1
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,577
<i>Yes.</i>

2
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,288
Yes.

3
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,413
Wonderful. I'll transfer you to booking.

4
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:47,460
Can I help you?

5
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,704
Edward Porris.

6
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:53,078
I... I have an appointment.

7
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,621
Porris.

8
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,702
Just have a seat.

9
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:33,207
<i>Hannah Geist?</i>

10
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:36,325
Excuse me?

11
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:40,042
You look like a Hannah Geist.
I'd take you for a Hannah Geist.

12
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:43,080
Yes.

13
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,949
Well, most people are.

14
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:49,746
I'm here for Michael Felix.

15
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:55,617
Do you know he used
to torment his lovers

16
00:02:55,738 --> 00:03:00,244
by packing his foreskin with spices
before intercourse?

17
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:06,126
<i>I'm just lucky they got to him
before the execution. I'm real lucky.</i>

18
00:03:08,196 --> 00:03:11,245
I'll take this one.

19
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:21,197
Breathtaking.

20
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:26,707
I understand your fascination with her.

21
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:30,414
I understand completely.

22
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:35,123
She's perfect somehow, isn't she?

23
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:38,246
More than perfect.

24
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:43,288
More than human.

25
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:48,074
Her eyes seem to reach...

26
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,075
right beneath your skin
and touch your organs.

27
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,743
And touch your stomach.

28
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,197
Your lungs.

29
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:04,578
Gives me the shivers.

30
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:14,077
As you can see,
we have several options available.

31
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:17,288
Each was acquired from Ms. Geist directly.

32
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:22,238
If I thought your interest
was only passing,

33
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,284
there are any number of low-end packages
I could offer. However,

34
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:30,703
you strike me as a man whose involvement
runs a little deeper than that.

35
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:37,447
I see you... as a man of taste.

36
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:42,406
A connoisseur.

37
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,536
If you'll permit me
to make a recommendation.

38
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:00,660
S-558.

39
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:03,072
Expensive...

40
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:06,070
but a must have
for the truly devoted.

41
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,944
Ms. Geist was afflicted
during her much-publicized

42
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:12,240
affair with Laura Law in 2003.

43
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:15,782
We purchased it from her soon after.

44
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,152
S558?

45
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:20,241
<i>Yes.</i>

46
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:23,657
A form of the herpes
simplex virus.

47
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:28,074
After infection, the virus lives on
in the cells of its host

48
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,488
for the rest of their life.

49
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,567
Did you know she's deformed?

50
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,817
You can't tell from the magazines.

51
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:44,033
She has to have
special underwear made.

52
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,785
Fashion designers make her
special underwear.

53
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:53,282
I've heard that.

54
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:01,192
Do you have your credit card
with you, Mr. Porris?

55
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,278
Which side do you want it on?

56
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:07,990
I haven't decided.

57
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:12,108
Most people want it
on the left side.

58
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:17,617
If she kissed you,
it would be on the left side.

59
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:21,606
If she kissed me?

60
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:29,282
Ms. Geist is infected here,

61
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:31,319
to the right of her mouth.

62
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:36,066
Now, if she kissed you,

63
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,066
it'd spread to your left side,

64
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:40,780
around here.

65
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:47,565
On the left, it'd be like she
gave it to you in person.

66
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:49,781
Yes, I'd like the left side.

67
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,813
Lean back please.

68
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:06,896
Just a little pinch.

69
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,187
There.

70
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:23,984
You should be showing
in a couple of weeks.

71
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:27,399
Enjoy.

72
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:37,862
Are you carrying
any infectious materials with you,

73
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:41,856
or items belonging to The Lucas Clinic
Incorporated or its suppliers?

74
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,193
No.

75
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:06,439
<i>Now, I thought a fungus was a plant
because it comes from vegetables, right?</i>

76
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,435
<i>So I told them this gives...</i>

77
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:13,358
<i>- Yeah, come in.
- Apparently I'm no biologist,</i>

78
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,568
<i>and some of our viewers
were quick to point that out.</i>

79
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,685
I wanted to ask
about the alarm test tomorrow.

80
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:20,231
Well, there's nothing
I can do about it.

81
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,943
You know, I don't like it either,
but it's the law.

82
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,105
No, I know. But...

83
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:31,237
it's just that I'm sick right now,
and I need my sleep.

84
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,477
Yeah. Okay, so, listen,

85
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:37,853
I'll tell you what we'll do about it.
We'll start at the top floor,

86
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:41,444
so we won't even get to you
until after 11.

87
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:43,855
It's the Aria Noble Ordeal.

88
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:48,482
Anyway, we'll, you know,
we'll just be in and out.

89
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:51,067
You can keep your bedroom shut.

90
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:55,186
<i>The question on everyone's mind is:
What is really going on with her?</i>

91
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,601
We're talking to Mr. Dorian Lucas,

92
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,968
founder of the Lucas
Celebrity Services Clinic.

93
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,843
Mr. Lucas, how do you respond

94
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:02,434
to critics who say the disease
you're really selling

95
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:05,552
- is a cultural one?
- That's ridiculous.

96
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:09,303
<i>Do you not agree
that the mania surrounding celebrity</i>

97
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:13,393
<i>- is reaching an unhealthy level?
- No, I don't.</i>

98
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:16,851
<i>So these people are really
so deserving of our attention?</i>

99
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:19,683
<i>In your opinion, does Aria Noble
deserve to be famous?</i>

100
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:21,837
<i>Let me stop you right there.
Deserve to be famous?</i>

101
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,554
<i>What does it mean to deserve
to be famous?</i>

102
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:27,676
<i>Anyone who's famous
deserves to be famous.</i>

103
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:31,017
<i>Celebrity is not an accomplishment.
Not at all.</i>

104
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,680
<i>It's more like a collaboration
that we choose to take part in.</i>

105
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:39,176
<i>Celebrities are not people;
They're group hallucinations.</i>

106
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:42,846
<i>Surely it's naive to imagine
that your clients think the same way.</i>

107
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:47,764
<i>Really? Naive?
My clients are intelligent adults</i>

108
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,053
<i>from all walks of life, all ages,</i>

109
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,515
<i>and they find meaning
in all the stories around them.</i>

110
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:57,758
<i>They choose to come to me
because they want</i>

111
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:01,678
<i>to feel more connected to those faces,
to those people</i>

112
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:04,548
<i>that they see in the magazines
and on television.</i>

113
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,968
<i>And their lives are much richer for it.</i>

114
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:41,220
The human face
is a powerful messenger.

115
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:45,010
Our brains are tuned
to its every nuance.

116
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,596
The smallest shift
in its musculature

117
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,930
can translate itself into complex
non-verbal information,

118
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:56,014
so subtle and communicated
so quickly that we often

119
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,754
don't even register it; Not consciously.

120
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:04,139
One could say that for human beings
the face is a structure

121
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:08,347
with a high information resolution.
The ReadyFace console

122
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,135
is designed to engage
the user's unconscious mental resources

123
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:16,050
by exploiting the brain's sensitivity

124
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:20,172
to facial patterns.
Our technician loads a virus sample

125
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,921
into the port,
where it's analyzed by ReadyFace

126
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,920
and is translated
into a face graphic.

127
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,636
This image represents
the structure of the disease.

128
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:37,301
It is in a sense the face of the virus,
dense with information.

129
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:40,339
As Mr. March manipulates
the graphic,

130
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:43,552
the machine manipulates the virus
in the sample container,

131
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,545
eventually rendering it
non-contagious.

132
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,011
This advanced form
of copy protection

133
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:52,377
affords us control
over the distribution

134
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:57,130
<i>of our products, as the virus cannot spread
beyond the infected client.</i>

135
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:02,094
ReadyFace fluidly incorporates
our technician's

136
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:06,427
unconscious mental resources
so that copy protecting a sample

137
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,761
like this one will take hours
rather than days.

138
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:12,624
<i>Hey, thanks for coming.</i>

139
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,841
Lovely to see you.

140
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,208
Thank you.

141
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:19,335
Thanks for making the time.
Appreciate it.

142
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,207
No, she has to have special
underwear made

143
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,004
because she doesn't have a vulva.
She was born without a vulva.

144
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:29,124
Her father used to make them
out of regular pairs,

145
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:32,547
which was an ordeal for her as a child,
but now she has fashion designers do it.

146
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:34,587
Anyway, that's what she meant
when she told Spot Magazine

147
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:36,799
- that she doesn't have a face.
- Listen to what you're saying.

148
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,540
Well, you asked me,
so I'm telling you.

149
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,836
You're telling me
you've been working here too long.

150
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:42,798
You're seriously buying into all this.

151
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:45,211
What's to buy into?
What I'm saying is factual.

152
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:48,833
Factual. Yesterday,
her birth defect was a unique,

153
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:52,209
non-functional organ
connected to her urinary system.

154
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:54,249
It's worth millions
on the celebrity meat market.

155
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,331
- Yeah, also true.
- Well, I'm sure the kid

156
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:58,377
could shed some light
on the situation.

157
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:01,045
Didn't you take a genital wart sample
from Hannah Geist once?

158
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,789
That was Derek.

159
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:05,085
Well, did he mention
if she had a vulva?

160
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:09,543
We're doing lunch at Dainty Davis.

161
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:11,710
- You coming'?
- I already ate.

162
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,872
You look like shit.

163
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,997
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hey, Syd.

164
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,966
- What can I get for you?
- 13, 644, 915.

165
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:30,375
915?

166
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:33,418
The new Aria Noble flu.
We got it this morning.

167
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,662
So we did.

168
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:54,875
Thank you.

169
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:59,245
Derek.

170
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:12,038
I understand your fascination with her.

171
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:14,127
I understand completely.

172
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:17,247
She's...

173
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:21,622
perfect somehow, isn't she?

174
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:24,336
More than perfect.

175
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,202
An ideal.

176
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:29,536
Overwhelming.

177
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,913
With a whisper,
she could have...

178
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:34,876
anything she wanted.

179
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:38,160
Anyone she wanted.

180
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:46,748
I'm happy to inform you
that we have something special

181
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,743
available today.

182
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:52,206
It just came in this morning.

183
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,956
S-915.

184
00:17:57,949 --> 00:18:00,043
You would be the first.

185
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:06,129
A biological communion
between you and Aria.

186
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,039
From her body to your body.

187
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:12,786
From her cells to your cells.

188
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:16,080
In my humble opinion...

189
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:20,079
it's not even a question.

190
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:31,244
Just a little pinch.

191
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:44,496
The fever should come on
just in time for the long weekend.

192
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:54,906
Enjoy.

193
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,906
Are you carrying
any infectious material with you,

194
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:41,908
or items belonging to The Lucas Clinic
Incorporated or its suppliers?

195
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:44,450
No.

196
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,454
Next. Who's ne... Okay.

197
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,911
Geist, okay, we...

198
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:26,948
Okay, what are we...

199
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,570
Like, we're talking like a roast
for two people?

200
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,947
This is good.

201
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:39,077
Hello, sir. What can I getcha?

202
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,406
I've been trying to reach you.

203
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,030
I was sick.

204
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:02,404
I think my body's starting
to turn on me, Arvid.

205
00:21:02,524 --> 00:21:04,618
I don't know how much longer
I can do this.

206
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,530
You'll be fine.

207
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:09,448
There's an ebb and flow
to this kind of work.

208
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:12,363
Give it a month

209
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:14,826
and you'll feel like a completely
different person.

210
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,034
I already feel
like a different person.

211
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:19,150
I'm developing a cripple identity.

212
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:23,530
- I think you look great.
- Thanks.

213
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:29,318
I don't understand
how this isn't considered cannibalism.

214
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:31,612
Well, these are just muscle cells.

215
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:35,577
It all depends on whether the human being
is found in its materials.

216
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:40,661
Right now the law tends towards
something more religious,

217
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:45,118
but we'll see what happens when we go
from growing celebrity cell steaks

218
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:48,656
to growing complete celebrity bodies.

219
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,241
I'm looking forward to it.

220
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:55,076
Yeah, well, with the proper funding,
I could probably make that happen.

221
00:21:57,563 --> 00:21:59,440
Have you seen my cell garden?

222
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:01,065
No.

223
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:11,073
Something new
I've been cooking up.

224
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:20,856
So, do we have business?

225
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:25,527
Yeah.

226
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,944
Yeah. I...

227
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:32,155
I cracked the new Aria Noble flu.

228
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,615
- That's already public.
- What?

229
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:39,028
Since Saturday.
You're behind the times.

230
00:22:39,144 --> 00:22:41,021
The clinic just got it last week.

231
00:22:41,144 --> 00:22:43,863
- Well, somebody beat you to the punch.
- Who?

232
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:46,025
One of my other guys.

233
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:47,521
Arvid.

234
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:51,149
Look, I'm not some bug-collecting hobbyist.

235
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,738
You want to get paid
for your work,

236
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:56,856
talk to me when you stop
getting scooped.

237
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:31,229
What's going on?

238
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:33,524
They arrested Derek.

239
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:37,238
Villainy in our own house, Syd. I simply
cannot work under these conditions.

240
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:39,228
Oh, like anyone will take you.

241
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,275
- I hear Vole & Tesser are hiring.
- Topp didn't even know

242
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:44,672
about Sara Holden's skin flap
until I told him last night.

243
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:47,816
I'm sure the kid doesn't know
about Sara Holden's skin flap right now.

244
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:50,232
You're too good for skin flaps,
aren't you, Syd?

245
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,069
Skin flaps are beneath you.

246
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:58,519
- Is there anything else you need?
- No.

247
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:06,188
Did you know that healthy tulips
have solid-colored petals?

248
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:11,029
The stripes on this flower
are caused by a viral infection.

249
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,438
I had heard that, yes.

250
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,483
Okay.

251
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:27,230
It's a weird business, Syd.

252
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,108
Do you know Derek Lessing?

253
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,230
Not well.

254
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:41,024
Well, the police found
an unlicensed ReadyFace console

255
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:43,358
in his apartment today.

256
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:46,773
An older model, a 35-50.

257
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:52,521
They think he was undoing the copy
protection on some of our samples

258
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:56,985
and then selling the contagious viruses
to a piracy group.

259
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:58,314
Jesus.

260
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,229
That machine is registered to us.

261
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:05,773
I guess he must have smuggled it
out of the storeroom or something.

262
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:07,890
So I had Michelle run an inventory,

263
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:10,892
and she discovered that there was
a second machine that's gone missing.

264
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:16,317
Will you let me know
if you hear anything at all?

265
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:18,727
Of course.

266
00:25:20,846 --> 00:25:22,974
I'm going to send you
on a house call today.

267
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:24,814
You're going to see Hannah Geist.

268
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:29,150
She's sick, she's at the Mayerson,
and she's eager to sell.

269
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:32,937
Now, normally,
I'd be sending Derek on this,

270
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:36,729
so be tactful if the subject comes up.

271
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:38,973
Yes, sir.

272
00:25:50,011 --> 00:25:51,388
<i>ID.</i>

273
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,061
Wait inside. They'll call you
when they're ready.

274
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:27,728
I didn't know
Vole & Tesser was here.

275
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:36,023
You do know the Hannah Geist line
is exclusive to Lucas.

276
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:40,059
Sure. She's all you have
going for you.

277
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:45,266
I hear she's worth more
than your entire catalogue.

278
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:49,185
I've never really cared for her.

279
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:53,010
Why are you here?

280
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,680
Gregory Vern.

281
00:26:55,758 --> 00:26:58,227
A terminal illness?

282
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:01,346
It's for Mr. Vole's personal collection.

283
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:03,435
He has a license.

284
00:27:16,132 --> 00:27:18,055
Lucas Clinic.

285
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:25,184
Where's Derek?

286
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:28,223
He called in sick.
My name is Syd March.

287
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:04,596
Tell Dorian we'll be in touch.

288
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:43,171
She's perfect somehow,
isn't she?

289
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:48,831
More than perfect.

290
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,168
More than human.

291
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:58,255
Her eyes.

292
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:03,043
Are... are you okay?

293
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:08,379
Sorry...

294
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:10,714
Excuse me for a moment.

295
00:32:16,536 --> 00:32:19,005
Hey. What is wrong with you?

296
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,213
I need to go.

297
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:24,047
Can you finish? Please?

298
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,691
Shit!

299
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:06,365
<i>We tracked down
The Future of Smiles,</i>

300
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:09,153
<i>an office where we spoke
to a principal coordinator, Gregory Hurek.</i>

301
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,693
<i>Mr. Hurek refused to appear on...</i>

302
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:15,322
Oh, hey.

303
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,690
A couple of guys were here
looking for you.

304
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:19,484
Portland somebody?

305
00:38:19,604 --> 00:38:22,073
I didn't get the other guy's name.
But, look,

306
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:23,655
he left you a number.

307
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,025
Here.

308
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,355
Has anyone been
in the apartment?

309
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,482
You know, they wanted me to let them in,
but it's against the law!

310
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:39,487
So, where were you?

311
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:45,906
- I was... asleep.
- Yeah, that's what I figured.

312
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,487
I know you've been sick.

313
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:51,613
I'll tell ya,
it's pretty shocking.

314
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:56,403
And now they're saying
it's a virus that she picked up in China?

315
00:38:56,518 --> 00:38:59,692
But her family will not let them
autopsy the body

316
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,064
until they fly over a specialist
from Munich.

317
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,529
Autopsy?

318
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:10,021
Well, they want their own doctor.
They're German.

319
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:20,609
Hey! You get in line.

320
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:23,070
Everyone listen carefully!
We're cutting our last tray

321
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:25,278
of Hannah Geist for the day!

322
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:27,736
If you get a ticket,
you can buy one three-ounce steak!

323
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,194
If you don't get a ticket,
you have to come back tomorrow!

324
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:32,528
- Is Arvid around'?
- Yeah, he's in the back.

325
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:42,605
Are you aware they're still growing
the cancer cells

326
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:45,945
of a woman who died in the 1950s?
Henrietta Lacks.

327
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:49,608
Yeah, they use them for research,

328
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:54,275
so these cells of hers are alive

329
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:57,645
and multiplying
all over the world.

330
00:39:58,682 --> 00:40:02,607
The afterlife is getting
extremely perverse.

331
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:04,567
What happened to Hannah Geist?

332
00:40:05,515 --> 00:40:06,937
You don't know?

333
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:10,944
- I think I was asleep.
- You know,

334
00:40:11,057 --> 00:40:13,401
she was sick for about a week.

335
00:40:13,515 --> 00:40:15,483
Nothing serious.

336
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:19,060
Then this morning
one of her aides found her dead.

337
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:25,319
She was in China
looking at orphans,

338
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:28,560
but none of her entourage
are having any problems,

339
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:32,151
so they don't know what it is she had
or how it was communicated.

340
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:35,359
It's quite an ordeal for the family.

341
00:40:35,473 --> 00:40:38,727
This all must feel...

342
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:40,724
a bit personal to you.

343
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:42,724
How so?

344
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:46,897
Well, you were one of the last people
to see her alive.

345
00:40:48,722 --> 00:40:51,896
- Where'd you hear that?
- I have big ears.

346
00:40:54,055 --> 00:40:57,650
I was hoping that's why
you came to see me.

347
00:40:58,804 --> 00:41:01,307
Sorry to disappoint.

348
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,649
That's too bad,

349
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:08,269
because that virus would be the Holy Grail
while this heat lasts.

350
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:12,436
Is there any chance
you can get me a taste?

351
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,306
I wish.

352
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:16,648
We can't hold deadly pathogens.

353
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:20,015
I'm sure the health board
already took everything.

354
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:24,688
Yeah? What about you?
You look sick.

355
00:41:24,803 --> 00:41:26,396
I am sick.

356
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,935
Listen, my console's down.

357
00:41:31,054 --> 00:41:33,682
You know anybody
with parts to spare?

358
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:34,850
Maybe.

359
00:41:36,136 --> 00:41:38,935
The anti-piracy lobby
is fairly insane right now,

360
00:41:39,053 --> 00:41:41,476
so... everyone's paranoid.

361
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:46,265
- I need a new 80-box.
- I'll see what I can do.

362
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:49,059
Hey. Hey, hey!

363
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:51,722
Is it true they arrested Derek Lessing?

364
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:54,939
- Yeah.
- That's too bad.

365
00:41:55,053 --> 00:41:57,055
He did some really good work for me.

366
00:41:58,844 --> 00:42:01,063
Here, have some Hannah.

367
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:02,641
On the house.

368
00:42:30,468 --> 00:42:33,563
There is less light
in the world now.

369
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:35,803
That much is certain.

370
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:39,475
A ray of light has been lost.

371
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:43,182
Hannah was a friend of this clinic,

372
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,645
and I'm proud to say
I knew her personally.

373
00:42:47,258 --> 00:42:51,263
She was truly a sweet
and a humble soul.

374
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:54,344
Our prayers here at Lucas

375
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:56,720
are with her family and loved ones.

376
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:01,935
So, what's your professional opinion?

377
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,176
What?

378
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:05,472
Well, you must have had
a good look at her.

379
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:08,071
We've got a pre-autopsy pool going
with the guys in accounting.

380
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:11,265
Mercer's playing it safe
and going with flu virus.

381
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:14,476
I'm thinking of taking a flyer
and going with food poisoning.

382
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,263
Do you think it might have been
food poisoning?

383
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,262
I don't know.

384
00:43:20,049 --> 00:43:22,969
Of course, no one's saying drugs.
They'll never admit it if it is drugs.

385
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:24,096
She didn't use drugs.

386
00:43:24,214 --> 00:43:26,512
Oh, you knew her well?

387
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:29,510
She was a Buddhist from birth.
She couldn't even take painkillers

388
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:30,928
or she would have been beaten.

389
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:34,473
I hear we'll be selling ringworm
from her dog Brom to fans with dogs.

390
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:37,467
Brom's getting a following.

391
00:43:38,256 --> 00:43:41,510
Hey, Dorian turned your sample
over to the board this morning.

392
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,348
That's a bit exciting,

393
00:43:43,464 --> 00:43:46,843
a little shop on the fringes
of a media frenzy.

394
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:52,058
Can I have a 900 pack?

395
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,258
- What's a 900 pack?
- Hannah Geist variety pack.

396
00:43:57,047 --> 00:43:59,470
Everybody's guzzling Geist today.

397
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,597
<i>And now everyone's talking about her</i>

398
00:44:02,713 --> 00:44:05,216
<i>oh, my gosh,
I don't even know if I can say it -</i>

399
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:07,136
<i>her anus! You heard that right.</i>

400
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:11,260
<i>Rumors of the young star's situation
have been spreading like a rash,</i>

401
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:13,723
<i>with news outlets as far as Japan,
Australia,</i>

402
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:15,681
<i>and even the Middle East scrambling</i>

403
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:19,926
<i>to get the poop on recent documents
leaked by the office of Aria's specialist.</i>

404
00:44:20,046 --> 00:44:23,721
<i>Swedish media network SMT
has even offered a bounty</i>

405
00:44:23,837 --> 00:44:26,716
<i>for photographic evidence
of the unusual condition,</i>

406
00:44:26,837 --> 00:44:30,341
<i>and sources close to her say
the normally hard-partying celeb</i>

407
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,715
<i>hasn't been seen in public since.</i>

408
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,931
<i>Well, that settles it!
I'm getting a camera!</i>

409
00:44:35,046 --> 00:44:37,344
<i>- You would do that!
- The hunt is on.</i>

410
00:44:37,462 --> 00:44:40,932
<i>Meanwhile, Hannah Geist's
former dog walker has opened up</i>

411
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,139
<i>in a recent interview
with our sister station.</i>

412
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:46,348
<i>Fifty-one-year-old Helen Pinto
was employed full time</i>

413
00:44:46,462 --> 00:44:50,137
<i>at the now-shuttered estate,
and caused quite a stir earlier today</i>

414
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:54,258
<i>when she claimed to be holding
one of the star's used panty liners.</i>

415
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:57,722
<i>Pinto said she retrieved the liner
towards the end of Hannah's illness</i>

416
00:44:57,836 --> 00:45:00,396
<i>and was in the process of having it
analyzed, with the results...</i>

417
00:45:09,044 --> 00:45:10,341
What's with the cane?

418
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:12,259
I've been having a little trouble.

419
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:16,463
I've gotta make a quick stop
before we get your part.

420
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:38,718
It must have happened overnight.
We found them like this in the morning.

421
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:40,711
I've never seen anything like this before.

422
00:45:40,834 --> 00:45:43,007
I mean, they were fine
when we shipped them.

423
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:47,050
Obviously they weren't fine.
You sold me bad meat.

424
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:51,714
- Well, are your trays clean?
- Don't fuck with me, Arvid.

425
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:54,803
- Don't you even fuck with me.
- Okay. I'm sorry, Luc.

426
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:58,341
I can't serve this. They think
they're getting Hannah Geist out there

427
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,926
and I'm feeding them Ron Deggy.

428
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:03,637
Okay. I'm gonna find out
what happened, and I'm gonna fix it.

429
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:08,636
So, do I get to know
what's killing you?

430
00:46:10,249 --> 00:46:13,469
An antique Michael Felix bug
I sold the other day.

431
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:17,342
It was a mistake.

432
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:19,927
Apparently the copy-protection
on some of those old samples

433
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:23,136
got a little weird, but I didn't think
I'd get another chance.

434
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:24,842
Sounds reckless.

435
00:46:25,623 --> 00:46:28,467
I'm just trying to keep things
interesting for myself.

436
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,134
- For two?
- Is Levine around?

437
00:46:51,247 --> 00:46:53,625
Sure, he's in the back.
I'll let him know you're coming.

438
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:30,833
You'll like Levine.
He's one of my best guys.

439
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,839
I just want to make sure
he's comfortable with all this.

440
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,622
Hang out here.

441
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,628
Is that you?

442
00:48:34,035 --> 00:48:36,458
I've done everything you've asked!

443
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:44,254
I'm not strong enough to escape.

444
00:48:45,617 --> 00:48:47,460
Please say something.

445
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:49,623
Hannah.

446
00:48:52,617 --> 00:48:54,460
Oh, thank God you're here!

447
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,627
I'm so afraid.

448
00:48:59,242 --> 00:49:03,497
I'll do anything you say.
Please, please just let me go.

449
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,624
<i>Do you... do you want me to hurt myself?</i>

450
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:17,201
<i>I can't say no to you.</i>

451
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,044
<i>- Hello?
- What was that?</i>

452
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:27,619
<i>Please repeat yourself
so I can obey your command.</i>

453
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:34,038
<i>Do you want me to hurt myself?
Do you want to see my body?</i>

454
00:49:35,532 --> 00:49:37,626
<i>Please, I'm so afraid.</i>

455
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:42,122
<i>Please.</i>

456
00:49:43,032 --> 00:49:44,454
<i>Please.</i>

457
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:53,458
<i>- Are you still there?
- All right, let's go.</i>

458
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:55,786
What is this thing?

459
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:57,499
<i>I can't take it anymore!</i>

460
00:49:57,614 --> 00:49:59,912
It's part of a new franchise.
Levine has the only location in town.

461
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:02,580
<i>Just tell me what to do!
I'll do anything you say!</i>

462
00:50:02,697 --> 00:50:03,778
It's catching on, though.

463
00:50:03,822 --> 00:50:06,450
<i>- Come on.
- I'll do anything.</i>

464
00:50:08,613 --> 00:50:10,035
<i>Please.</i>

465
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:12,244
<i>Please.</i>

466
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:46,248
Levine.

467
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,242
Syd March.

468
00:50:53,237 --> 00:50:55,831
It's always strange
to meet the competition.

469
00:51:00,029 --> 00:51:01,246
So...

470
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:04,490
Arvid here tells me that you actually
work at The Lucas Clinic?

471
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:06,488
Yeah.

472
00:51:08,445 --> 00:51:11,449
I think one of your friends is
a customer of mine.

473
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:14,497
Really? Yeah, Vera brings me
bugs sometimes.

474
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,614
So, that's kinda cool?
You're like an inside man.

475
00:51:18,444 --> 00:51:20,913
I think I'd be too contemptuous
to play that game.

476
00:51:21,028 --> 00:51:24,498
Oh, yeah. Levine's too classy
to profit from such trash.

477
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,328
I'm talking about politics.

478
00:51:26,444 --> 00:51:29,414
I get that we're all rat men here, Arvid,
scavenging the bin.

479
00:51:31,818 --> 00:51:34,822
But I like to think that my work
is purposefully gross, at least.

480
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:37,287
Allows me to hoard
a little dignity somewhere.

481
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:38,278
No of fence.

482
00:51:38,402 --> 00:51:42,202
I don't even think
dignity's still valid currency.

483
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:45,487
I appreciate you helping me out like this.

484
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:48,453
Anything for a friend of Arvid's. Here.

485
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:57,619
Where'd you get this?

486
00:51:58,608 --> 00:52:02,329
I built it using old parts I co-opted
from a contact at Vole & Tesser.

487
00:52:02,442 --> 00:52:04,490
I've been modifying it for years.

488
00:52:04,608 --> 00:52:08,329
The resolution is somewhere between one
of the new ReadyFaces and a 7-86.

489
00:52:08,442 --> 00:52:10,115
You...

490
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:12,611
want to run your blood
through it right here?

491
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:18,451
No. Thank you.

492
00:52:21,816 --> 00:52:23,818
Yeah, that's fine.

493
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:28,320
So, I don't have your 80-box,
but I can get one within the week.

494
00:52:28,441 --> 00:52:29,909
Arvid said you had one.

495
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:32,385
I thought I did. Turns out
none of my stuff is compatible.

496
00:52:34,024 --> 00:52:35,617
Levine's all right.

497
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:38,910
Hey, I'm completely trustworthy, all right?

498
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:41,447
I already know the guy
who can dig one up for me.

499
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:44,694
As a sign of good faith, though, I would
like to get your payment out of the way

500
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:47,443
- while you're here.
- My what?

501
00:52:48,815 --> 00:52:50,032
The sample.

502
00:52:52,606 --> 00:52:53,778
What sample?

503
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:58,034
The sample. What the hell, Arvid?

504
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,909
I told Levine you'd give us
a bit of that Hannah Geist bug

505
00:53:02,023 --> 00:53:03,144
you've been carrying around.

506
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:09,240
Arvid.

507
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,616
Don't be a miser.

508
00:53:55,812 --> 00:53:57,485
Look at you.

509
00:53:57,603 --> 00:53:59,025
You gonna faint?

510
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,240
I hope you're not taking this
too personally.

511
00:54:05,854 --> 00:54:07,902
Well, I'll admit

512
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,897
I was a little insulted
when I found out

513
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,988
you weren't going to share with me.

514
00:54:12,103 --> 00:54:13,821
Were you gonna shop it around?

515
00:54:14,811 --> 00:54:17,234
Did you just want this one
all to yourself?

516
00:54:19,602 --> 00:54:20,819
Okay.

517
00:54:22,227 --> 00:54:24,321
Listen,

518
00:54:24,436 --> 00:54:27,235
I understand these are
special circumstances.

519
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:29,813
You and I both recognize that.

520
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:33,818
When we're done here,
I'll find you a doctor

521
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:37,438
who will keep your situation low profile.

522
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:40,478
And then we'll get you fixed up...

523
00:54:42,351 --> 00:54:45,605
and you can still work for me. All right?

524
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:55,111
Your clock is counting down
at a maniac pace.

525
00:54:55,226 --> 00:54:56,773
You need a friend.

526
00:54:56,892 --> 00:54:59,236
- All done?
- Almost.

527
00:55:00,435 --> 00:55:03,029
I wouldn't mind grabbing a bit
of that rash for good measure.

528
00:55:08,434 --> 00:55:11,654
Now, I would love to do this properly

529
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,611
if you would just stop freaking out.

530
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:09,020
Coffee.

531
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:29,603
Do you mind?

532
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:41,025
Did you hear she died in her sleep
while her boyfriend was in the other room?

533
00:56:41,805 --> 00:56:43,307
Then he got into bed

534
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,024
and slept beside her body
the whole night without knowing.

535
00:56:48,596 --> 00:56:51,600
Can you imagine what an ordeal
it must have been when he found out?

536
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,478
I have no idea.

537
00:56:54,595 --> 00:56:57,314
Every night since I heard that,
I've been touching my wife

538
00:56:57,429 --> 00:57:00,433
before I go to sleep
just to make sure she's still warm.

539
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,437
Excuse me.

540
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:15,605
All right.

541
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,019
- What can I get you boys?
- I'll have the calamari.

542
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,313
I'm fine.

543
00:57:24,428 --> 00:57:27,022
- How about you?
- I'll have the calamari.

544
00:57:27,803 --> 00:57:29,225
Two calamaris.

545
00:57:32,802 --> 00:57:34,475
You're looking pretty sick.

546
00:57:34,594 --> 00:57:36,312
I'll live.

547
00:57:36,428 --> 00:57:37,805
Is that true?

548
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:41,605
I think you're a lot worse
than you're letting on.

549
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:47,437
I'm sorry, we're just waiting for a car.

550
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:50,309
My name's Portland, and this is West,

551
00:57:50,427 --> 00:57:52,429
and we're taking you to meet someone.

552
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,432
I'd rather not.

553
00:57:55,635 --> 00:57:57,808
Are you planning
on being difficult about it?

554
00:57:58,801 --> 00:58:01,429
No, I guess not.

555
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:04,016
That would be for the best.

556
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:31,596
Don't look so worried.
You're a commodity.

557
00:59:42,797 --> 00:59:44,219
This is it.

558
01:00:00,421 --> 01:00:02,014
<i>Shortness of breath?</i>

559
01:00:03,587 --> 01:00:04,679
No.

560
01:00:04,796 --> 01:00:06,469
Nausea?

561
01:00:06,587 --> 01:00:07,804
<i>Yes.</i>

562
01:00:09,462 --> 01:00:12,887
Ringing in your ears
or auditory hallucinations?

563
01:00:13,004 --> 01:00:14,221
No.

564
01:00:14,421 --> 01:00:16,423
No delusions of grandeur?

565
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:21,594
You know, towards the end
of my grandmother's life,

566
01:00:21,712 --> 01:00:23,806
she imagined the entire world

567
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,094
was operating exclusively
with her in mind.

568
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:30,385
I was only a child at the time,
but I remember once

569
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:32,301
I got off the toilet,

570
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,015
and she asked me what I had
intended to communicate to her.

571
01:00:37,003 --> 01:00:40,598
It was later discovered
she had a brain tumor.

572
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:46,802
I've been told that Hannah's illness...

573
01:00:47,585 --> 01:00:50,429
can produce florid hallucinations.

574
01:01:03,419 --> 01:01:05,797
There he is.

575
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,212
I think that virus destroyed my console.

576
01:01:14,918 --> 01:01:16,636
The virus was designed

577
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:19,220
with a security measure
to prevent analysis.

578
01:01:19,793 --> 01:01:23,798
It took a little effort, but I was
eventually able to bypass it.

579
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:26,591
- Designed?
- Yes.

580
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:31,213
I'm afraid you've become involved
in something sinister.

581
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:48,881
Go inside and take a seat.

582
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:17,800
Who are you?

583
01:02:21,581 --> 01:02:23,424
I'm Syd March.

584
01:02:25,206 --> 01:02:26,833
We met at the Mayerson.

585
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,588
Yeah, Dev told me you were coming.

586
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:44,796
Have you started bleeding yet?

587
01:02:45,998 --> 01:02:47,420
Bleeding?

588
01:02:50,747 --> 01:02:52,590
From your mouth.

589
01:02:59,788 --> 01:03:01,415
That's good.

590
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:07,540
I don't mind the sight of blood.
It just...

591
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:14,001
collects in my throat at night
and I have suffocation dreams.

592
01:03:17,204 --> 01:03:19,423
So I've mostly stopped sleeping.

593
01:03:33,412 --> 01:03:36,211
It's terrifying, really,
when you think about it.

594
01:03:42,995 --> 01:03:44,997
The death is a cover story,

595
01:03:45,786 --> 01:03:48,881
but she is dying for real,

596
01:03:48,995 --> 01:03:50,997
and we still don't have a cure.

597
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,959
We have reason to believe
that her infection was

598
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:55,954
an assassination attempt,

599
01:03:56,077 --> 01:03:59,581
and we felt this was the best
way to prevent a second attack.

600
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:03,583
This is all very unlucky for you,
but I'm hoping we can help each other.

601
01:04:05,994 --> 01:04:08,588
The disease wasn't built from scratch.

602
01:04:09,785 --> 01:04:14,006
It's a modification of something we sold
to your clinic three years ago.

603
01:04:14,994 --> 01:04:17,088
We assume someone
at Lucas created this,

604
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:20,080
and if you can find out who,
it might be the first step

605
01:04:20,201 --> 01:04:22,203
towards finding a cure for Hannah.

606
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:24,995
And for yourself, of course.

607
01:04:25,576 --> 01:04:27,203
She looks frail.

608
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,794
She needs your help.

609
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:36,207
I have a burned-out ReadyFace
at my apartment.

610
01:04:37,117 --> 01:04:39,996
It might be useful
if I could get it working again.

611
01:04:40,784 --> 01:04:43,003
I'm sure we can find you
whatever you need.

612
01:04:45,409 --> 01:04:48,583
- How do you feel?
- Tired.

613
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:50,791
Is that all?

614
01:04:51,783 --> 01:04:53,410
I have a headache.

615
01:05:00,783 --> 01:05:02,410
Last night...

616
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,998
Hannah had a mild psychotic episode.

617
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:11,292
For one hour she insisted
that I was her late publicist,

618
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:12,500
Maynard Welsh.

619
01:05:13,573 --> 01:05:17,578
This has been in some ways
an uncomfortable experience for me.

620
01:05:18,657 --> 01:05:22,582
My interest in her, of course,
is more than professional.

621
01:05:25,407 --> 01:05:29,207
Here. There's a company in Munich
where they make these.

622
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:35,212
They're skin grafts, grown from
celebrity skin cell samples.

623
01:05:36,407 --> 01:05:37,659
This one here,

624
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:41,209
this one is Hannah.

625
01:05:45,406 --> 01:05:49,001
You know, I'm not a spiritual man.

626
01:05:49,781 --> 01:05:53,001
A belief in God, it's always struck me

627
01:05:53,114 --> 01:05:55,993
<i>as a sign of dangerous infantilism.</i>

628
01:05:57,406 --> 01:06:00,876
But you will forgive me if I tell you

629
01:06:00,989 --> 01:06:03,788
that with each of these patches...

630
01:06:05,405 --> 01:06:09,000
my world has become more charged.

631
01:06:11,196 --> 01:06:12,994
That there is a power -

632
01:06:13,988 --> 01:06:17,413
something in the thrall
of the collective eye -

633
01:06:18,113 --> 01:06:21,708
that can be consumed
and appropriated.

634
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:27,414
You play the sceptic,
but I don't believe it.

635
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:30,658
Surely you could have stolen
Hannah's blood

636
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:33,578
without injecting yourself.
Why did you do it?

637
01:06:35,987 --> 01:06:38,410
Maybe you feel what I feel.

638
01:06:39,987 --> 01:06:42,991
Or maybe you're really
just another fan.

639
01:06:45,987 --> 01:06:49,582
Well, now you share a death with her,

640
01:06:50,695 --> 01:06:52,789
and that's a powerful bond.

641
01:06:54,569 --> 01:06:56,412
I don't want to die from this.

642
01:06:58,986 --> 01:07:00,203
Of course.

643
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:05,992
Here.

644
01:07:07,194 --> 01:07:09,071
Two, three times daily.

645
01:07:09,194 --> 01:07:10,662
What are they?

646
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,575
Antivirals.

647
01:07:13,777 --> 01:07:16,576
They should help
slow the infection down.

648
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,985
You're an absolute disgrace.
Where you been, bud?

649
01:10:12,769 --> 01:10:15,864
- I was sick.
- Dorian's in a rage.

650
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:18,072
You're making Mercer
look good these days.

651
01:10:18,185 --> 01:10:20,779
I had to pull a favor
to keep you from getting fired.

652
01:10:21,394 --> 01:10:22,441
Thank you.

653
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,654
Well, I need someone non-responsive
to talk to,

654
01:10:24,769 --> 01:10:26,646
and you're cheaper than my therapist.

655
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:30,864
You know, I've gotta say, it doesn't look
like your little vacation did you much good.

656
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,446
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hey, Mercer.

657
01:10:33,559 --> 01:10:35,653
Ask me if I'm looking forward

658
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:37,941
to Timothy Stanton's molluscum
this afternoon.

659
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,859
- Timothy Stanton is impotent.
- It's on his shoulder.

660
01:10:40,977 --> 01:10:43,275
You can get molluscum anywhere.

661
01:10:43,393 --> 01:10:46,863
I swear, he has an infection to sell
every time he gets a divorce. It's uncanny.

662
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:48,478
He's holding a competition
through Spot Magazine.

663
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:50,854
The winner gets to infect him
with their next cold,

664
01:10:50,976 --> 01:10:53,195
and they get a free sample
after he gets sick.

665
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:58,188
- Are you entering?
- No, I don't get colds.

666
01:10:59,392 --> 01:11:00,564
Catch you later.

667
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,359
Welcome back.

668
01:11:25,182 --> 01:11:26,604
Anything else?

669
01:11:31,182 --> 01:11:33,383
I was wondering if you could
look something up for me.

670
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:34,563
Yeah, sure thing.

671
01:11:38,182 --> 01:11:42,562
What is the recent sales history
for Hannah Geist sample S-888?

672
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,768
- How recent?
- Last two months.

673
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:49,439
S888 is the Bermuda flu,

674
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:51,854
which we phased out
when we got Paris Honeymoon,

675
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:55,022
so... it's been taken out once since April.

676
01:11:55,139 --> 01:11:56,766
By who?

677
01:11:57,764 --> 01:11:58,981
Derek Lessing.

678
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:03,063
Thank you.

679
01:12:07,973 --> 01:12:09,771
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

680
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:39,977
I've got more of my blood here
if you want it.

681
01:12:48,971 --> 01:12:51,190
You kind of caught me off guard.

682
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:57,397
What was Derek Lessing working on?

683
01:12:58,387 --> 01:13:00,060
Well, that's hard to say.

684
01:13:00,178 --> 01:13:02,556
Derek was into some weird pathology.

685
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:09,972
I thought he was one of your people.

686
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,605
He hasn't sold me anything
for over a year.

687
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:21,981
Drop it. Drop it.
Drop it. Drop it.

688
01:13:32,551 --> 01:13:35,179
I wanted to keep things civil with us,

689
01:13:36,385 --> 01:13:39,264
but Levine can be hard to manage.

690
01:13:39,385 --> 01:13:41,763
He's starting to get out of hand.

691
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,558
And that blood you gave him fried his rig.

692
01:13:47,385 --> 01:13:49,638
None of those samples lasted
more than a day.

693
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,386
What is going on with you, man?

694
01:13:52,759 --> 01:13:54,557
Whatever it is you're into...

695
01:13:56,176 --> 01:13:58,395
it's attracting
a lot of dangerous attention.

696
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:01,977
So here's what.

697
01:14:10,759 --> 01:14:12,978
I'm going to give this back to you,

698
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:16,386
and you're going to stay away from me.

699
01:14:18,967 --> 01:14:23,393
I refuse to be pulled into a crazy mess.

700
01:16:47,377 --> 01:16:49,175
Mr. Lessing?

701
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,962
Mr. Lessing? Is that you?

702
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:41,543
Hey, what, you just getting home?

703
01:17:43,749 --> 01:17:46,047
I've been having some trouble at work.

704
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:48,385
Did you catch any of the funeral?

705
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:52,045
The whole thing, yeah, it was live on 503.

706
01:17:52,165 --> 01:17:54,088
- I must have missed it.
- Yeah.

707
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:56,756
It was a beautiful service.

708
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,962
<i>But sad.</i>

709
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:02,759
For someone like that to die so young.

710
01:18:04,165 --> 01:18:06,759
She was an extraordinary woman.

711
01:18:07,957 --> 01:18:09,959
And absolutely gorgeous.

712
01:18:11,748 --> 01:18:13,546
I cried all the way through.

713
01:18:16,748 --> 01:18:20,423
Oh, that man Portland,
he was here again.

714
01:18:20,539 --> 01:18:22,166
He left you a package.

715
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:26,044
Thank you.

716
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:28,087
<i>Insiders say she had a flu</i>

717
01:18:28,206 --> 01:18:30,049
<i>for two weeks before passing away,</i>

718
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:33,634
<i>but they were totally unprepared
for the dramatic turn the illness took</i>

719
01:18:33,747 --> 01:18:35,624
<i>just as it seemed she was recovering.</i>

720
01:18:35,747 --> 01:18:37,624
<i>I spoke with the Geist family earlier,</i>

721
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:41,251
<i>and they were absolutely devastated
like any other family, really,</i>

722
01:18:41,372 --> 01:18:44,251
<i>who have experienced
the loss of a daughter or a sister,</i>

723
01:18:44,372 --> 01:18:47,421
<i>staying together and supporting
each other through this difficult time.</i>

724
01:18:47,538 --> 01:18:49,415
<i>Well, that's really just it, isn't it?</i>

725
01:18:49,538 --> 01:18:51,836
<i>A death in the family will
affect anyone the same way,</i>

726
01:18:51,955 --> 01:18:54,424
<i>whether you're the Geists
or the people next door.</i>

727
01:18:54,537 --> 01:18:56,255
<i>And you can see that
in the outpouring of sympathy</i>

728
01:18:56,371 --> 01:18:59,545
<i>- from her fans during the funeral.
- That's absolutely right.</i>

729
01:18:59,663 --> 01:19:02,633
<i>And many of them feel
a personal connection to Hannah,</i>

730
01:19:02,746 --> 01:19:06,046
<i>which I think says so much about
who she was before she got sick.</i>

731
01:19:06,162 --> 01:19:08,039
<i>We spoke to one crying fan today</i>

732
01:19:08,162 --> 01:19:11,257
<i>who told us her love for Hannah
actually saved her life.</i>

733
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:12,851
<i>She had all but given up on the world</i>

734
01:19:12,954 --> 01:19:15,423
<i>after a spiral of depression
and drugs eventually...</i>

735
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:39,417
<i>Hello, Derek.</i>

736
01:19:39,535 --> 01:19:41,378
<i>Great to see you again.</i>

737
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,749
What else are you feeling?

738
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:36,544
I can really feel it coming on now.

739
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:40,535
It's right in my cells.

740
01:20:43,033 --> 01:20:45,377
I'm tired all the time.

741
01:20:46,367 --> 01:20:48,540
I can't... move...

742
01:20:49,116 --> 01:20:50,993
or think properly.

743
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,748
I'm only approximating myself.

744
01:20:57,949 --> 01:21:02,546
I passed on your findings
to an old colleague of mine, Agna Hahn.

745
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:07,038
She's a professor of biotechnological law
in California.

746
01:21:07,157 --> 01:21:11,583
Now, she discovered that Vole & Tesser
had recently patented

747
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:14,747
a genetically modified virus.

748
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:19,620
It's quite likely the source
of Hannah's and your infection.

749
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:20,957
A patent.

750
01:21:21,073 --> 01:21:24,748
What it means,
it's unclear to me.

751
01:21:25,531 --> 01:21:27,625
But if they intended to kill her,

752
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:32,540
then why would they declare ownership
over the weapon?

753
01:23:22,068 --> 01:23:25,368
What are you doing here?

754
01:23:27,943 --> 01:23:29,741
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

755
01:24:45,356 --> 01:24:46,733
Hello, Syd.

756
01:24:50,522 --> 01:24:52,365
How are you feeling?

757
01:24:57,730 --> 01:25:01,030
I'm told you are at this moment
infected with the same virus

758
01:25:01,147 --> 01:25:03,946
that killed Hannah Geist.
Is that true?

759
01:25:07,355 --> 01:25:09,824
It's okay. We already know.

760
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,940
You have nothing to hide from us here.

761
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:14,606
This is an honest room.

762
01:25:14,729 --> 01:25:17,608
You can share any thoughts
or feelings you might be having.

763
01:25:17,729 --> 01:25:20,528
In fact, you are encouraged to share.

764
01:25:30,937 --> 01:25:32,234
Hey!

765
01:25:32,354 --> 01:25:35,358
There's no need to yell.
We can hear you clearly.

766
01:25:38,145 --> 01:25:41,240
Okay, I'll share first.

767
01:25:41,354 --> 01:25:45,404
Right now we are attempting
to capitalize on a unique opportunity.

768
01:25:45,519 --> 01:25:48,568
Since her tragic passing,
many of Hannah's admirers

769
01:25:48,686 --> 01:25:50,814
<i>have experienced
what could be described as</i>

770
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:55,534
an uncomfortable narrative gap
between her life and funeral.

771
01:25:56,519 --> 01:25:58,817
How did she die, really?

772
01:25:58,936 --> 01:26:01,940
What did the final hours
of her life look like?

773
01:26:02,936 --> 01:26:05,234
History may have denied them
these moments,

774
01:26:05,352 --> 01:26:08,947
but through you we have a window
into the past.

775
01:26:09,518 --> 01:26:14,399
By documenting your deterioration
we can ease the suffering of millions

776
01:26:14,518 --> 01:26:18,944
who have, through no fault
of their own, been left in the dark.

777
01:26:21,518 --> 01:26:23,941
How do you feel right now?

778
01:26:44,142 --> 01:26:45,519
Cooperate.

779
01:26:47,309 --> 01:26:48,731
Cooperate.

780
01:26:59,934 --> 01:27:01,732
I'm sorry.

781
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:03,943
I'm an innovator.

782
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:18,718
Bad dream?

783
01:30:37,924 --> 01:30:40,018
I think sexual politics are involved also,

784
01:30:40,132 --> 01:30:42,726
because of cell penetration by the virus.

785
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,388
The original host takes on
the role of the male,

786
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,929
and the newly infected is the female.

787
01:30:48,423 --> 01:30:51,893
And then the infected changes gender
to infect others,

788
01:30:52,006 --> 01:30:54,509
sort of the way the reef
fish change gender.

789
01:30:55,506 --> 01:30:57,929
<i>It probably says something
about your customers.</i>

790
01:31:06,089 --> 01:31:11,061
Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for the way you're being treated here.

791
01:31:11,922 --> 01:31:13,424
If it had been up to me,

792
01:31:13,547 --> 01:31:15,390
we would have taken
better care of you.

793
01:31:15,505 --> 01:31:17,849
But you know

794
01:31:17,963 --> 01:31:21,084
we've got to get this thing finished
and on the market while people still care,

795
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:23,724
otherwise there's no point.

796
01:31:24,713 --> 01:31:28,934
Besides, you owe me for what you did
to my rig.

797
01:33:32,665 --> 01:33:36,215
<i>Ask us about the new Vole & Tesser
VT Rewards program,</i>

798
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:39,337
<i>now available at all
Vole & Tesser locations.</i>

799
01:33:57,332 --> 01:33:58,675
Back off!

800
01:34:18,622 --> 01:34:20,340
<i>Hello, Ms. Tesser.</i>

801
01:34:20,914 --> 01:34:23,337
<i>Please, call me Mira.</i>

802
01:34:26,496 --> 01:34:29,500
<i>I'm sorry I'm not there
to speak with you in person.</i>

803
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:32,128
<i>I understand completely.</i>

804
01:34:33,705 --> 01:34:37,380
<i>I hear you've been causing problems
for our good friend Levine.</i>

805
01:34:39,496 --> 01:34:42,215
<i>He's such a brilliant little man, isn't he?</i>

806
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:46,130
<i>Is there any way I can convince you
to continue your collaboration?</i>

807
01:34:46,913 --> 01:34:48,506
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

808
01:34:50,121 --> 01:34:51,714
<i>That's a shame.</i>

809
01:34:52,495 --> 01:34:55,339
<i>We could make you excitingly famous.</i>

810
01:34:58,912 --> 01:35:01,916
I'd like to tell you something
about your virus.

811
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:05,502
And what would that be?

812
01:35:06,786 --> 01:35:10,131
The contract Hannah Geist
signed with Lucas...

813
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,498
prevents you
from selling her diseases, but a...

814
01:35:14,494 --> 01:35:18,590
but a virus you built
and patented yourself

815
01:35:18,703 --> 01:35:22,924
would remain your property
even if it passed through her body.

816
01:35:24,702 --> 01:35:27,706
You could infect her,
recover the sample,

817
01:35:28,494 --> 01:35:31,088
<i>and then sell it
as a Vole & Tesser exclusive.</i>

818
01:35:31,202 --> 01:35:33,125
Is that true?

819
01:35:34,702 --> 01:35:37,797
It's why you commissioned
the virus from Derek Lessing,

820
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:40,915
and why he infected her
during a house call.

821
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:46,379
It's a great loophole, isn't it?

822
01:35:46,493 --> 01:35:48,370
My idea, of course.

823
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:50,541
We stood to make a lot of money.

824
01:35:51,701 --> 01:35:55,001
Unfortunately, there was a problem
with your friend Derek's build.

825
01:35:55,118 --> 01:35:57,120
I want to know
if it can be cured.

826
01:35:58,284 --> 01:36:00,207
I think so.

827
01:36:00,326 --> 01:36:02,579
However, producing a cure
would be costly,

828
01:36:02,701 --> 01:36:04,795
and as you acquired the virus
on your own,

829
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:07,709
we feel no responsibility
for your condition.

830
01:36:10,117 --> 01:36:12,495
I have something to barter.

831
01:36:20,117 --> 01:36:22,119
She'll be here in the morning.

832
01:36:35,491 --> 01:36:37,118
We're not sure, but...

833
01:36:41,908 --> 01:36:46,709
Well, this is certainly
a heartbreaking turn of events.

834
01:36:47,699 --> 01:36:50,498
I mean, this really puts things
in perspective, doesn't it?

835
01:36:51,324 --> 01:36:54,578
You know? Now, I would happily
do something if I could,

836
01:36:54,699 --> 01:36:56,997
and the thought
of a collaboration between

837
01:36:57,115 --> 01:37:01,666
Ms. Geist and our company is
very appealing. Unfortunately...

838
01:37:02,531 --> 01:37:06,707
my specialist here has advised me
that she's too far gone to be saved.

839
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:09,992
You'll be hearing from our lawyers.

840
01:37:10,114 --> 01:37:13,334
I think you'll find we've taken
the necessary precautions.

841
01:37:14,323 --> 01:37:16,792
Now, if you'll excuse me.

842
01:37:16,906 --> 01:37:18,499
You know...

843
01:37:20,323 --> 01:37:23,702
while I was a guest at your clinic,

844
01:37:26,323 --> 01:37:29,702
I... I had some time
to think things over.

845
01:37:33,113 --> 01:37:36,913
I've been seeing a little more clearly
since then.

846
01:37:41,322 --> 01:37:43,495
For example, I can see that...

847
01:37:45,113 --> 01:37:47,332
this is an important moment.

848
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:50,699
I can see...

849
01:37:51,696 --> 01:37:54,495
an opportunity here...

850
01:37:58,112 --> 01:38:01,491
even in the face
of such a devastating tragedy.

851
01:38:04,112 --> 01:38:07,912
We... have a chance to innovate,

852
01:38:09,321 --> 01:38:12,200
and to do it in a way

853
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:15,494
that will benefit you both.

854
01:38:19,111 --> 01:38:21,705
The technology already exists...

855
01:38:23,695 --> 01:38:25,493
and I know where to find it.

856
01:38:30,111 --> 01:38:32,910
Allow me to take a moment of your time.

857
01:38:35,694 --> 01:38:38,493
<i>When I was a little girl,
my mother used to ask me,</i>

858
01:38:39,111 --> 01:38:41,580
<i>"What do you want to be
when you grow up?"</i>

859
01:38:41,694 --> 01:38:45,119
<i>And I would tell her,
"I don't want to grow up!</i>

860
01:38:45,694 --> 01:38:47,492
<i>I want to stay young and beautiful!"</i>

861
01:38:49,485 --> 01:38:52,489
<i>So I guess in a way
this is my childhood dream realized.</i>

862
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:56,909
<i>And I couldn't be more excited
to share it with you.</i>

863
01:38:58,902 --> 01:39:01,906
<i>Welcome, everyone, to my Afterlife,</i>

864
01:39:02,484 --> 01:39:05,328
<i>exclusively from Vole & Tesser.</i>

865
01:39:12,692 --> 01:39:15,366
From the perspective of the virus,

866
01:39:15,484 --> 01:39:17,703
the human being is irrelevant.

867
01:39:18,525 --> 01:39:23,702
What matters is the system
that allows it to function.

868
01:39:25,108 --> 01:39:27,202
Skin cells, nerve cells,

869
01:39:27,317 --> 01:39:29,490
the right home for the right disease.

870
01:39:30,692 --> 01:39:33,787
Within our Afterlife capsule,

871
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:39,202
the system that is Hannah Geist's body
has been perpetuated,

872
01:39:39,317 --> 01:39:43,197
even expanded beyond
what existed during her lifetime.

873
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:45,777
Make no mistake, however.

874
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:49,279
This is not some glorified cell steak.

875
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:53,575
Everything inside this housing
is either part of the original body

876
01:39:53,691 --> 01:39:55,989
or has been grown directly from it

877
01:39:56,107 --> 01:39:59,486
as a result of our patented
CellGarden technology.

878
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:04,820
Our chief technician, Syd March,
is about to load

879
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:07,784
the latest virus into the system,

880
01:40:07,899 --> 01:40:13,577
where it will infect Hannah's body
before being sold

881
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:17,661
as part of our Vole & Tesser
Afterlife product line.

882
01:40:20,356 --> 01:40:23,200
Now, this is just a sneak peek.

883
01:40:23,315 --> 01:40:26,569
If you want to know the nature
of the infection,

884
01:40:26,689 --> 01:40:30,193
you'll have to wait
until it's announced officially

885
01:40:30,314 --> 01:40:34,319
at our product conference
at the end of this month.

886
01:40:35,105 --> 01:40:36,357
<i>Thanks for coming by.</i>

887
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,574
Thank you.
Thanks so much for your time.

888
01:40:38,689 --> 01:40:40,191
Thanks for coming by.

889
01:40:40,314 --> 01:40:42,612
We'll see you at the end
of the month. Okay.

890
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:40,899
She's perfect somehow, isn't she?
