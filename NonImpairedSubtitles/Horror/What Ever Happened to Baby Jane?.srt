1
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:11,718
Want to see it again, little girl?
It shouldn't frighten you.

2
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,678
I'm sorry. Nothing until
matinee tomorrow.

3
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:46,693
Lady,
would ya mind takin' off your hat?

4
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,956
Excuse me.

5
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:02,343
Atta girl, Janey. Show 'em how!

6
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:32,105
Oh, thank you, folks.
Thank you very much, thank you...

7
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:36,104
One final request, all right?

8
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,547
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy!"

9
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,416
All right, thank you.

10
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,159
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy."

11
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,708
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

12
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:21,052
"His address is heaven above.

13
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:27,723
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...

14
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:34,061
"...and wish you were with us to love.

15
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:39,739
"Instead of a stamp I put kisses.

16
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:47,078
"The postman says that's best to do.

17
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:52,515
"I've written this letter to Daddy...

18
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:59,095
"...saying, I love you.

19
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:26,614
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

20
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:34,128
"...saying, I love you!"

21
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,348
Well, what do you have here?

22
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:55,376
All for you.

23
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,882
Jane, isn't that a beautiful doll?

24
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,985
Thank you, young man,
that's a gorgeous doll!

25
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,317
Folks, have you ever seen
such a lovely doll?

26
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:17,432
Don't forget, there's a genuine...

27
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,374
...Baby Jane doll waiting for each and
every one of you right out in the foyer.

28
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:23,444
All you have to do is go out there
and collect it. And kids, remember...

29
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,410
...you can tell your moms that
each and everyone of these...

30
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,742
...genuine, beautiful, great
big dolls...

31
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:33,182
...is an exact replica of your own
Baby Jane Hudson.

32
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,423
Baby Jane dolls.
Only $3.25.

33
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,671
I won't, I don't wanna
go back to that ol' hotel!

34
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,606
I don't have to take a nap
and you can't make me!

35
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,240
Now, Jane, don't act up, sweetheart.

36
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:03,080
You've got to take your nap.
You know that.

37
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,620
No, I don't know and I'm not going to!

38
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:08,715
You don't want all these
nice friends of yours out here...

39
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,916
...to think that you're
a bad little girl, do ya?

40
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:13,986
I don't care! I want an ice cream!

41
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,327
Janey, I told you...

42
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,527
I make the money,
so I can have what I want!

43
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,799
Leave me alone! I need an ice cream!

44
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:26,431
Well, if you need an ice cream...

45
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,433
...I guess you better have some.

46
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,341
I mean, it's pretty hot and all.

47
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,810
But remember, this is
the last time this week.

48
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:37,184
All right, Daddy.
Blanche wants some, too.

49
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,250
We gotta have some
ice cream for Blanche.

50
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:43,491
I don't want anything.

51
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:45,622
What do you think you're tryin' to do?!

52
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:48,522
I always said it's the parents' fault
in cases like this.

53
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,523
I'm really disappointed!

54
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,534
It sure is a hot day today.

55
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,141
You're the lucky one, though,
Blanche, really you are.

56
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,286
Someday it's going to be you
that's getting all the attention.

57
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,047
And when that happens, I...

58
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:19,392
...I want you to try to be kinder
to Jane and your father...

59
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,430
...than they are to you now.

60
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,090
You know what I mean?

61
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,266
I hope you'll try'n remember that.

62
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,139
I won't forget.

63
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,808
You bet I won't forget!

64
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,476
The Seltzer Agency sent you?

65
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,286
Think there's any chance for me?

66
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:50,917
There's a chance if Mr. Weber likes you.

67
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,292
What type does he like?

68
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:56,797
A lot of personality.

69
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,235
I'll catch on, watch me.

70
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,740
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

71
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:10,612
With my money
I should make a picture like that, huh?

72
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,180
Good morning, Mr. Weber.
I'm Ms. Brent.

73
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,516
Yes. Won't you come a little closer,
please?

74
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:21,613
She's got a southern accent
like I got a southern accent.

75
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:29,759
I know it's 11:00!
I'll be there when I get there!

76
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,394
Gardner is here to see you.

77
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,564
Gardner?

78
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,698
I'll come out.

79
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,402
I'll be right back, Ms. Brent.

80
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,274
Have yourself a cigarette.

81
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:44,404
Make yourself at home.

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,072
Then the job is mine?

83
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,677
Need you ask?

84
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:26,845
Kill it!

85
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,525
What do you think, Ben?

86
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,528
What's thinking got to do with it, huh?

87
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,524
She stinks, doesn't she?

88
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:42,565
They say the end's pretty good.
Maybe we should've seen it through.

89
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,933
You gonna want that picture
again today, Mr. Feldman?

90
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:53,006
I don't think anybody's ever gonna want
that picture again!

91
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,050
When the old man hired them
Hudson sisters...

92
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:04,850
...how come he had to hire
the back end of the act, too?

93
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:07,688
Boy, what a no-talent broad
that Baby Jane is!

94
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,262
Why can't she stay sober?

95
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:14,760
Jane's got her pride.
She's a very sensitive girl.

96
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:18,598
Your "very sensitive girl" guzzled
her way through six cases of Scotch...

97
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,331
...and slugged two studio cops.

98
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:23,776
Not to mention one or two other
less savory items of publicity...

99
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,072
...before we got that so-called
epic in the can.

100
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,010
Anyway, you don't have to talk to Jane.

101
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,615
If Blanche will only let us out
of that clause in the contract...

102
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:32,984
...which says that we have to make
a picture with Baby Jane...

103
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:34,852
...for every picture that we make
with Blanche.

104
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:37,085
Then Baby Jane's contract
won't be any problem.

105
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,225
You see, that's what we pay lawyers for.

106
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:40,226
Possibly.

107
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:43,626
But somehow,
I can't see Blanche doing that.

108
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:44,923
You know, I don't get it!

109
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,935
Blanche Hudson's the biggest thing
in movies today.

110
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,603
She can write her own ticket.
She's got a script approval.

111
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,273
She's got more money than she knows
what to do with...

112
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,305
You know, she just bought that
tremendous place Valentino used to have.

113
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,779
It's gonna take her a year
to fix it up...

114
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:01,348
...the way she wants it
before they move in.

115
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,917
Well I guess they can manage
to struggle on where they are now.

116
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,182
But, my point is she ought to have
sense enough to know that...

117
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:10,953
...she can't make a star
out of Baby Jane again.

118
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:14,153
Blanche doesn't have
any illusions like that.

119
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:18,025
But she's a very fine person, Ben.

120
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,496
She's never gonna forget
those early years.

121
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,795
What her sister did for her.
She told me that herself.

122
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,831
Well, I tell you, she's not doin'
Baby Jane any favor.

123
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:30,011
Someday, sooner or later,
that girl's gonna end up in a home.

124
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:34,747
Look, you're going to their party
at the Grove tonight, aren't you?

125
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:38,650
Did you ever try refusing
one of Blanche's invitations?

126
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,287
Do me a favor, Marty, will ya?
You talk to Blanche.

127
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:43,583
Try to make her understand, huh?

128
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:45,988
- Do my best.
- Thanks...

129
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:50,095
Remind me to send you
one of those...

130
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,532
...Baby Jane dolls for Christmas.

131
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:55,661
I've got mine for this year.

132
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,440
I don't get it, Marty.

133
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:02,172
What do they make monsters
like this for?

134
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,208
For Blanche Hudson.

135
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:10,078
That's our problem.

136
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:00,942
You go to bed!

137
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,317
- Hi, Mom!
- Oh, hi, dear.

138
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:26,604
Hello, beautiful!
How 'bout a little souvenir?

139
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,006
Let go of that, will ya, let go!

140
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,842
Come on, don't be like that.
Who do you think you are?

141
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,272
Thanks.

142
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,891
Isn't she great?

143
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:48,460
Sorry to break in on this fine old
Blanche Hudson movie, folks.

144
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:50,255
But you'll be glad I did...

145
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,027
...when you see what I have
right here...

146
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:54,331
...for that favorite pooch of yours.

147
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:55,961
And Iliad means quality.

148
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,304
So when your dog says, "woof woof"...

149
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,207
...feed him Iliad,
the classic dog food.

150
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:03,505
Oh, shut up!

151
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,673
Iliad will bring the sheen
back to your dog's coat...

152
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:08,842
Oh, my goodness, I remember
the first time I saw that picture.

153
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,416
I thought it was just wonderful.

154
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:12,784
When was that?

155
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:17,520
Let's see now, as I recall, your father
took me to see it at the old Majestic.

156
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,693
It was before we were married.

157
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:23,489
She must be about 150 by now!

158
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,093
As a matter of fact, dear,
I think Blanche Hudson is...

159
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,864
...just a few years older than I am.

160
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:30,469
Really?!

161
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:32,666
Yes, dear, "really."

162
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,274
Well, how come
we never see her around?

163
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:38,203
We've been living next door to them
for six months now...

164
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:41,746
...and the only one I ever see
is that fat sister slouching around.

165
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,952
Don't they ever have company?

166
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,585
I mean it must be awful.

167
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:50,121
You know, Julie says
that sister's kind of peculiar.

168
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:51,790
Did you ever notice that?

169
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,619
No, I never have.

170
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:55,953
Well, that's what Julie told me.

171
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,659
She said that she was supposed
to be responsible for the accident...

172
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,097
...that crippled her sister Blanche.

173
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,271
That all happened
a very long time ago, dear.

174
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,034
And maybe you shouldn't
pay too much attention...

175
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,473
...to everything that Julie Fowler
tells you.

176
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:10,273
There's too many people in this town
with nothing else to do but talk.

177
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:13,606
Maybe so, but Julie's folks
have lived here a long time.

178
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,339
I guess she should know.

179
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,381
Turn up the volume, dear.
We're missing the picture.

180
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,553
- Will you have a little champagne?
- No, thank you.

181
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,757
You wanna tell Poppa your troubles?

182
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:30,562
Somebody you love?

183
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:34,425
Oh, Jack, please try to understand.

184
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:36,261
I married you because...

185
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:39,735
...I was knocked silly
and it was a refuge.

186
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,968
I found out tonight that this boy's
in trouble, maybe alone.

187
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:47,378
It's blinding me.

188
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,714
I can't think of anything else...

189
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,647
Oh! He should've held that shot...

190
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:54,780
...Ionger.

191
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,786
I told him that when we were rehearsing,
also when it was shot!

192
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:00,187
But he wouldn't listen!

193
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,734
- Hiya?
- Swell.

194
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,973
It's still a pretty good picture.

195
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,339
...and Gemini...

196
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,219
Tommy, you don't have to stay here,
do you?

197
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,622
I'll just sit here.

198
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,389
Enjoying yourself?

199
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:10,892
Jane, what are you doing?

200
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:13,999
I was watching!

201
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,394
Then you're an idiot!

202
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,735
I won't have you speak to me like that!

203
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,882
Ah, the poor thing!

204
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,753
Poor baby.

205
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:39,590
Quiet down.

206
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:05,679
Oh, good morning, Ms. Hudson.
I hope I'm not intruding.

207
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,521
I just couldn't resist cutting
these flowers for your sister...

208
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,951
...after seeing her show yesterday.

209
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,258
You must be very proud
of her new success...

210
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:16,394
...on television, I mean.

211
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,625
I can't tell you how nice it is...

212
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:23,193
...to be seeing all of
her old pictures like this.

213
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:25,263
I'll tell 'er you said so.

214
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,971
You know, my daughter and I
would just love to meet her one day.

215
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:32,070
Perhaps she could...

216
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,445
Mrs. Bates,
my sister doesn't ever go out.

217
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:37,679
She's not fit to receive visitors.

218
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,450
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

219
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,083
I'd no idea that, well...

220
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,561
I hope she likes the flowers.

221
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:53,800
Thanks.

222
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,187
You miserable...

223
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:03,004
Oh, Jane, I'm sorry.

224
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,263
I didn't mean to ring for my breakfast.

225
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,234
I was just wondering who all those
people were at the back door.

226
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,507
Wasn't anything.

227
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,375
Just that nosey Mrs. Bates going on
about your picture last night.

228
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:17,447
Oh, really? Did she like it?

229
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,714
Oh, really? Did she like it?

230
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,025
She liked it.

231
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,754
I remember, when it first came out...

232
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:32,466
...it had a tremendous reception.

233
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:36,730
The critics described it as... brilliant!

234
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:40,532
Do you remember what year
you made that picture?

235
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:45,207
Well, of course, you must, too.
In 1934, right after I did "Moonglow."

236
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:48,215
I made a picture that year, too!

237
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:52,948
Oh, yes, it was that comedy
directed by Lloyd, wasn't it?

238
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:55,747
No, it wasn't. It was a love story.

239
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:57,322
"The Longest Night."

240
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,854
Marty McDonald said
it was the best thing I ever did!

241
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:04,590
They never even released it
in the United States!

242
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:07,331
Feldman was very upset.

243
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:08,926
He told me the company had...

244
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,801
...a very bad year and
they couldn't afford...

245
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:11,998
No, they didn't!
They had a great year!

246
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:13,769
They didn't want to show my films.

247
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:16,707
They were too busy
giving a "big build-up"...

248
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:19,436
...to that crap you were turning out.

249
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:24,477
I'll clean the cage.

250
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,688
Oh, that would be Elvira.

251
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:04,950
Come in, Elvira!

252
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,359
- How are you today?
- Fine.

253
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,927
Oh, you've seen Jane.

254
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:16,229
I don't think she's feeling
very well today.

255
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:19,872
Did you speak to that Dr. Shelby
about Ms. Jane like you said?

256
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:23,377
No, I haven't yet.
It's rather difficult.

257
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,036
I don't want to upset her again,
if I can help it.

258
00:24:26,314 --> 00:24:28,145
But she'll be upset anyway,
Ms. Blanche.

259
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,250
And the longer you leave it,
the worse it's gonna be.

260
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,044
I know.

261
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,990
But I was just hoping
it wouldn't be necessary.

262
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:39,985
I think she seems much better lately.

263
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:41,661
It's none of my business...

264
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,164
...but she's been drinkin' again.
You know that, don't ya?

265
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:46,334
No, I hadn't noticed.

266
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:50,528
Oh, I don't think
it does her any real harm.

267
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,764
I think I understand her.

268
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,167
Oh, you do, huh?

269
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,570
Well, then, you ought
to take a look at this.

270
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:02,207
What are these?

271
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,318
I guess it's what you'd call fan mail.

272
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:09,920
Oh, how kind people are.

273
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:11,819
You better look at them...

274
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:15,294
...and then you can tell me
whether or not you've seen them before.

275
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,257
- Did you read that?
- No.

276
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,561
But they've been opened.

277
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:21,295
That's right, they all have.

278
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:24,334
And there's one in here
marked "Personal."

279
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:34,914
"The other night my husband and I
watched that lovely movie of yours...

280
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,309
"...'Last Honeymoon.'

281
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:39,544
"I remember saying to my husband
at the time that seeing you again...

282
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,816
"...was just like
meeting an old friend."

283
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:46,291
Oh, that's charming.
That's really charming!

284
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:49,189
The point is, you never
saw them before, did you?

285
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:54,663
I thought not.

286
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,403
I'm sorry, I thought you ought to know.

287
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,805
But, I don't understand.

288
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,241
Where'd they come from?
Where'd you find them?

289
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:06,412
In the trash barrel, that's where!

290
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,172
They're from that television station...

291
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,241
...that's been running
your old movies, aren't they?

292
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:20,627
You mean Jane?

293
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,861
Who else?

294
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:26,566
Oh, well, she must have thought
they were advertisements.

295
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:29,032
Then why would she open
the one marked "Personal"?

296
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:32,263
And what about this?
You might as well see this, too.

297
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,836
Writing those dirty words!

298
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:40,342
I can even remember the last time
I saw words like that written down!

299
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:42,973
But, why would she do a thing like this?

300
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,444
You know what makes her
do things like this!

301
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,884
She's sick, and she's not
getting any better.

302
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:51,923
In fact, the last month
she's been getting a lot worse.

303
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,463
If you don't believe me, then...

304
00:26:56,564 --> 00:26:59,499
...why are you selling this house
and planning to move out?

305
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:01,825
You said this last month...

306
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,265
...she's been a lot worse.

307
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,337
Do you think she knows?

308
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:08,007
About selling the house?

309
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:11,935
How could she?
You don't have anything in writing.

310
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,606
We're sisters, Elvira.

311
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,843
We know each other very well.

312
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:17,976
I think she's jealous...

313
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,955
...because of those old movies of yours
they're showing on television this week.

314
00:27:22,457 --> 00:27:24,823
Anyway, in six weeks you'll have to
hand over the house and then...

315
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:26,788
...she'll have to know.

316
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:29,657
How do I tell her?

317
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,592
How?!

318
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:35,796
Well, if you'd just speak to that
Dr. Shelby, maybe he could tell her.

319
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:43,570
No, it ought to be me.

320
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,078
I can't let a stranger tell her.

321
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,911
But he's a doctor, Ms. Blanche.
And she's a sick woman.

322
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,850
Elvira, you didn't know her
when she was a child.

323
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:58,592
When she was young.

324
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,594
I've seen those pictures she keeps.

325
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,389
It wasn't that she was just pretty.

326
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:08,999
She was different.

327
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,799
She was so alive.

328
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:19,440
I was cleaning the cage.

329
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,377
The bird got out.

330
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,115
But where is it now?

331
00:28:24,652 --> 00:28:26,483
It flew out the window.

332
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:30,184
You let that bird out
on purpose, Ms. Jane!

333
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:35,360
I just told ya, I was cleaning the cage
and the bird flew out the window.

334
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:38,727
I'm sorry!

335
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,594
She did that on purpose!
Believe me, she did it on purpose!

336
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:45,169
Never mind.

337
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:47,397
Maybe he'll come back.

338
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:03,784
You won't change your mind, will you?

339
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:05,553
I mean about coming to live with me?

340
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,094
You know I don't go back
on my word, Ms. Blanche.

341
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:11,423
But you've got to make up your mind
about finding somewhere for Ms. Jane...

342
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:14,099
...where they can
look after her properly.

343
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,473
I have made up my mind.

344
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:22,474
I'm going to call Dr. Shelby today.

345
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,845
I know, Ms. Blanche, I know.

346
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:40,051
It's just that I have to be sure...

347
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:42,028
...I'm doing the right thing for her.

348
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:10,223
Hello, is this Johnson's?

349
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,616
I want to order some liquor.
It's Jane Hudson.

350
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:19,130
Waddaya mean you can't fill
any more orders for me?

351
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:21,697
My sister did?

352
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:31,638
Well, wait a minute,
I'll put 'er on.

353
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:38,384
Blanche, would you speak
to this man from Johnson's?

354
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:46,653
Hello, who is this, please?

355
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:51,893
Oh, yes, Mr. Carlston.

356
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:54,867
Yes, this is Blanche Hudson.
What seems to be the trouble?

357
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:02,672
I'm afraid there's been some
misunderstanding.

358
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:04,773
I certainly didn't mean to suggest...

359
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:07,947
...that you shouldn't fill
any orders for her.

360
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:12,652
After all, we do pay
our bills, don't we?

361
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:18,689
Yes, fine.

362
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,616
Would you please?

363
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:25,566
I'll put her on.

364
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:32,866
Okay, then?

365
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:34,500
Good...

366
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:39,036
...I'd like to order six bottles
of Scotch and three bottles of gin.

367
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:43,581
The same brands,
and as soon as possible.

368
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:57,362
I just told Ms. Blanche. I'm going
downtown to see a man about jury duty.

369
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:05,534
I'll be back tomorrow.

370
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,082
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

371
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,250
"His address is heaven above.

372
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:35,791
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...

373
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:43,361
"...and wish you were with us to love.

374
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:49,175
"Instead of a stamp, I put kisses.

375
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:53,809
"The postman says...

376
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:14,329
"The postman says...

377
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:16,131
"...that's best to do.

378
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:23,409
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

379
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,642
"...saying, 'I...

380
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:31,882
"...Iove... you."'

381
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,671
"Now when I'm very good...

382
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,336
"...And do as I am told...

383
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,406
"...I'm Mama's little angel.

384
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:07,114
"And Papa says I'm good as gold.

385
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,951
"But when I'm very bad...

386
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:12,454
"...and answer back and sass...

387
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,752
"...then I'm Mama's little devil.

388
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,499
"And Papa says I've got the brass.

389
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:23,230
"Now I wish that you would tell me...

390
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:27,598
"...'cause I'm much too young
to know..."

391
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:13,076
All right, Blanche Hudson!

392
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:16,290
Ms. Big, Fat, Movie Star!

393
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:19,683
Ms. Rotten, Stinking Actress!

394
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:21,588
Press a button, ring a bell...

395
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:26,027
...and you think the whole damn world
comes running, don't you?!

396
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:29,996
Lunch, Ms. Hudson?

397
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:33,602
Why, certainly, Ms. Hudson!

398
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:38,538
I'm sure we can find something
appropriate for you, Ms. Hudson!

399
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:18,245
Oh, you brought my lunch.
A bit early, isn't it?

400
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,919
Then what were you ringing for?

401
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,654
Oh, I wanted to tell you,
something's wrong with the telephone.

402
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:25,825
Maybe it's been left off
the hook downstairs.

403
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:27,690
Is that so?

404
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,992
Who'd you wanna call, Blanche?

405
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:34,098
Well, actually I wanted
to call Bert Hanley.

406
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:37,601
Oh, our business manager?

407
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:44,067
There's something I've been
meaning to discuss with you.

408
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:54,717
Well, I'm afraid I have bad news...
about money.

409
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:59,950
You see the point is, Bert thinks
we'll probably have to sell the house.

410
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,626
Why should we have to
sell the house, Blanche?

411
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,801
Well, that's what I'm trying
to tell you.

412
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:13,330
Our financial position
is such that we just...

413
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:14,869
...we can't afford to...

414
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:17,007
We've got plenty of
money invested. I know.

415
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:20,041
Yes... yes, that's quite true, but...

416
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,540
...some of those investments
aren't paying much.

417
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:29,889
When did our business manager
tell you all this?

418
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:32,659
Early last week, I think.

419
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,825
He didn't call here last week.
I know that, too.

420
00:38:37,164 --> 00:38:41,396
No, we didn't actually speak
on the telephone.

421
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:42,624
He wrote me a letter.

422
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,432
He didn't write you any letter either.

423
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:46,002
There hasn't been a letter
from his office since...

424
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,062
Yes, Jane, there has.

425
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:50,304
Oh, you're a liar! You're just a liar!
You always were!

426
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:54,813
Bert Hanley never wrote you any letter
and never called you on the phone...

427
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,640
...tellin' you to sell the house.

428
00:38:56,884 --> 00:39:00,251
You called him four weeks ago
and told him to sell it!

429
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:04,683
I did nothing of the sort.

430
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:09,395
Don't you think I know everything
that goes on in this house?

431
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,631
You've been spying on me!

432
00:39:16,303 --> 00:39:18,100
What do you think?!

433
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:20,297
You are disgusting!

434
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,267
After all I've done for you!

435
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:25,135
When all I'm trying to do is help.

436
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:27,476
Who are you tryin' to help, Blanche?

437
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:30,678
What were you plannin' to do with me
when you sold the house?

438
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:32,442
What'd you have in mind...

439
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:35,587
...some nice little place
where they could look after me?

440
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:51,295
Better not tire yourself out
using the phone anymore.

441
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:55,033
If there are any calls,
I'll take them downstairs.

442
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:01,174
Eat your lunch, it'll get cold!

443
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:30,268
Jane! Please wait.

444
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,670
Jane, I want to talk to you... please!

445
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,770
Jane, I want to talk to...

446
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,207
Telephone, mother.

447
00:43:17,044 --> 00:43:18,477
All right, dear.

448
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,963
I called this morning and placed an ad.

449
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,900
Did we give you a reference number?

450
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:21,804
Oh, yeah.

451
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:35,178
Here it is.
You want to check the copy?

452
00:44:40,894 --> 00:44:42,020
That's fine.

453
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,526
Did you want this to go in the
"Personal" column or in the want ads?

454
00:44:44,732 --> 00:44:47,462
Well, I always think the "Personal"
column's nicer, don't you.

455
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:54,841
That's an eight-line ad.
That'll be $6.30.

456
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:05,145
Who's placing this ad?

457
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:07,778
We have to know.

458
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:09,356
Why, I am!

459
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,491
Yeah, I know, but who for?

460
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,625
You see, when you're placing
an advertisement for someone...

461
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:17,129
...to do a job for you, we have to
have your name for the record.

462
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:20,196
Well, my name is... Jane Hudson.

463
00:45:25,372 --> 00:45:29,365
Maybe you remember me.
I'm Baby Jane Hudson!

464
00:45:31,378 --> 00:45:32,174
Sure.

465
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:35,715
Thank you. This will be
in the paper tomorrow.

466
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:43,222
Who the hell was Baby Jane Hudson?

467
00:45:45,626 --> 00:45:48,959
"Please call Dr. Shelby
at OL6-1656 and...

468
00:45:49,196 --> 00:45:51,756
"...ask him to come
to the house immediately."

469
00:46:00,574 --> 00:46:04,066
"Under no circumstances...

470
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,911
"...let my sister...

471
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:15,848
"...see the contents...

472
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:20,187
"...of this note.

473
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,193
"...Blanche Hudson."

474
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:34,261
Oh, Ms. Hudson, how nice to see you.

475
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,831
- I was just going to call on you.
- Why?

476
00:47:37,004 --> 00:47:39,905
I just wanted to ask you about the
flowers I brought over for your sister.

477
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,404
I'm afraid they don't last very long
this time of year and...

478
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:44,736
...I thought perhaps
you'd like some more.

479
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,441
You could've saved yourself
the trouble.

480
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:49,948
Oh, but it's no trouble at all.

481
00:47:50,017 --> 00:47:52,781
I've just been cutting some,
that's why I came over.

482
00:47:53,053 --> 00:47:54,645
I always think it's so nice
to have flowers...

483
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:56,120
...in the house...
- Mrs. Bates!

484
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,524
I guess if my sister needed flowers,
we could afford to buy them!

485
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:46,967
What's the matter, Mother? You look
as though you've been in a fight.

486
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:49,072
I'm not sure that I haven't been.

487
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,540
Jane Hudson makes me so mad,
I could kill her!

488
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,212
That's a good idea.

489
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:57,072
What'll we use?

490
00:49:54,441 --> 00:49:56,409
Did you have a nice drive?

491
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,643
What are you talking about?

492
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,642
Nothing, dear. It's been so long
since you were out of the house.

493
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,440
I though perhaps you'd gone
for a drive or something.

494
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:06,377
You know, I was thinking...

495
00:50:07,554 --> 00:50:10,682
...it's been so long since
we had a talk...

496
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:14,256
...you know, a real talk
about the future and everything.

497
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,131
I didn't want you to be worried
about the house.

498
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:24,336
Even if I do have to sell it,
we'll still be together.

499
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,072
Blanche, you're not going
to sell this house.

500
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:30,375
Daddy bought this house.

501
00:50:30,677 --> 00:50:32,269
And he bought it for me.

502
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:36,880
You don't think I remember that,
do you?

503
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:39,785
You're wrong, Jane.

504
00:50:39,853 --> 00:50:41,377
You've just forgotten.

505
00:50:42,222 --> 00:50:44,213
I bought this house for the two of us...

506
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,982
...when I signed my first contract.

507
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:48,721
You don't think I remember anything,
do you?

508
00:50:49,763 --> 00:50:51,594
There're a whole lot of things
I remember.

509
00:50:51,832 --> 00:50:53,959
And you never paid for this house.

510
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:59,168
Baby Jane paid for this house,
that's who!

511
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:01,565
You don't know what you're saying.

512
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,546
You aren't ever gonna
sell this house.

513
00:51:08,915 --> 00:51:11,440
And you aren't ever
gonna leave it...

514
00:51:12,853 --> 00:51:14,218
...either.

515
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,993
Do you remember when
I first came back after the accident?

516
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,407
You promised you wouldn't ever
talk about that again.

517
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,907
I know I did...

518
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:43,740
...but I'm still in this chair.

519
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:47,078
After all those years
I'm still in this chair.

520
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,414
Doesn't that give you
some kind of responsibility?

521
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:54,018
Jane, I'm just trying to explain
to you how things really are.

522
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,719
You wouldn't be able to do
these awful things to me...

523
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,957
...if I weren't still in this chair!

524
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,699
But you are, Blanche!
You are in that chair!

525
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:13,409
And tell me what are these awful things
I'm supposed to be doing to you?

526
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,680
Well I meant...

527
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:21,176
...you wouldn't have to work so hard.

528
00:52:21,788 --> 00:52:24,086
And I was thinking maybe...

529
00:52:24,157 --> 00:52:26,819
...maybe Elvira could come in
more often.

530
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:29,657
Maybe she could even live with us.

531
00:52:30,597 --> 00:52:32,861
We don't need Elvira!

532
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:36,459
But you get so tired, you...

533
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,961
There's so much to do,
and you're not well.

534
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,465
Maybe you're right.

535
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:46,575
Maybe I should get
a check-up or something.

536
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,007
That would be wonderful!

537
00:52:51,284 --> 00:52:55,243
Perhaps we can, we can find
a really good doctor.

538
00:52:56,089 --> 00:53:00,025
We could get hold of that
nice Dr. Shelby, couldn't we?

539
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:03,289
Let's see...

540
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,121
...what's his number again?

541
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:18,543
"...Under no circumstances...

542
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:23,142
"...tell my sister the contents
of this note."

543
00:53:24,651 --> 00:53:27,449
It's not me that needs
a doctor, Blanche!

544
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,176
Hello, lovey.

545
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:34,273
Now, don't stop for me.

546
00:55:34,514 --> 00:55:36,175
What did the doctor say?

547
00:55:37,317 --> 00:55:42,050
He says it's no use my trying
to go back to work for six months.

548
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:44,222
Didn't he even give you
anything new to take?

549
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:46,755
Oh, he says it's arthritis.

550
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:51,361
An' the only thing for me to do is
not to try an' work until it clears up.

551
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:55,226
Did he suggest what we're going
to use for money in the meantime?

552
00:55:56,136 --> 00:55:59,572
No, dear.
But he's ever such a nice man.

553
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:04,476
Now, lovey, never you mind, anyway.

554
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:08,141
You know, we've still got
a bit of savings.

555
00:56:08,515 --> 00:56:10,915
You're my little worrier.

556
00:56:12,152 --> 00:56:15,087
That's nice.
You've found something, have you?

557
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:18,984
You don't have to get so excited.
You haven't even seen what it is yet.

558
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:22,123
No, dear but it's a possibility,
isn't it?

559
00:56:22,395 --> 00:56:25,296
I mean, there aren't that many jobs
that'd be suitable...

560
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:28,363
...I mean for someone
with your qualifications.

561
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,763
What qualifications?

562
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,707
Well, you know... serious music
and that...

563
00:56:35,942 --> 00:56:39,810
Oh, this sounds like
just the ticket, doesn't it?

564
00:56:43,616 --> 00:56:46,016
- You're gonna call?
- Call who?

565
00:56:46,786 --> 00:56:48,378
These people.

566
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,118
Might as well.

567
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:51,281
Now?

568
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:56,018
Well, it wouldn't be a lot of bloody use
calling next week, would it?

569
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:05,030
Mom, tell you what.
Why don't you call for me?

570
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:07,737
Tell them you're my secretary
or something.

571
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,207
All right, dear, I'll do that.

572
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:13,675
And listen, I won't let on who I am.

573
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:17,940
You see, I'll just tell 'em
I'm Mr. Flagg's "secketary."

574
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:21,813
- Secretary.
- Sec-re-tary.

575
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:25,651
Well, do you know...

576
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:27,826
...I do believe yer old mum'd...

577
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:31,224
...be a jolly good "secketary" at that.

578
00:57:32,265 --> 00:57:34,597
Don't you think?

579
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,647
This is Jane Hudson.

580
00:57:54,654 --> 00:57:56,747
Oh, about the ad!

581
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,616
Who is this?

582
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:02,894
This is Mr. Flagg's "secketary."

583
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:05,687
Oh, his secretary.

584
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,359
Mr. Flagg is very interested.

585
00:58:09,602 --> 00:58:11,934
And he'd like to know if
he can have an appointment.

586
00:58:12,272 --> 00:58:16,299
I think you'll find
he's very well qualified.

587
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,102
Well, sure, I'd be glad to give
Mr. Flagg an appointment.

588
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:23,048
Well, now, let me see...

589
00:58:23,616 --> 00:58:25,311
...how 'bout 4:00 this afternoon?

590
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:30,881
I think that would be fine.

591
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:34,349
Well, I'll be expecting him then.

592
00:58:42,902 --> 00:58:45,132
It's all fixed, lovey.

593
00:58:45,405 --> 00:58:49,501
Ah, yer old mum's managed everything...

594
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:51,633
...hasn't she?

595
00:58:58,851 --> 00:59:00,045
Oh, shut up!

596
00:59:11,898 --> 00:59:13,160
What do you want this time?

597
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,728
Who was on the telephone?

598
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,163
None of your business!
What were you ringing for?

599
00:59:17,437 --> 00:59:18,461
I'm hungry, Jane.

600
00:59:18,738 --> 00:59:20,569
Well, of course you're hungry.
You didn't eat your dinner.

601
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,937
That's why you're hungry.

602
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:24,643
But you forgot my breakfast.

603
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,442
I didn't forget your breakfast.

604
00:59:28,214 --> 00:59:30,045
I didn't bring your breakfast...

605
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,807
...because you didn't eat your din-din.

606
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:38,284
We're right back where we started.

607
00:59:38,558 --> 00:59:41,459
When I was on the stage, you had
to depend on me for everything...

608
00:59:41,728 --> 00:59:44,288
...even the food you ate
came from me.

609
00:59:44,564 --> 00:59:46,998
Now you have to depend on me
for your food again.

610
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:49,132
So you see, we're right back
where we started.

611
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:51,600
Why are you doing this to me?

612
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:52,501
Why?

613
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,662
Doing what?

614
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,171
Making me afraid to eat,
trying to make me starve myself.

615
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,710
Don't be silly.

616
01:00:01,314 --> 01:00:03,407
If you starve, you die.

617
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,174
I don't know what you're talking about.
You really must be sick!

618
01:00:09,622 --> 01:00:11,590
Did you ever stop to think that...

619
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:15,356
...if anything happened to me,
I mean anything bad...

620
01:00:16,429 --> 01:00:18,329
...there wouldn't be any money for you?

621
01:00:18,598 --> 01:00:20,463
I wouldn't be here to sign the checks.

622
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,668
You wouldn't even have pocket money.

623
01:00:23,736 --> 01:00:25,727
Did you ever think of that?

624
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:28,470
I've thought about that.

625
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:35,439
Why didn't you eat your dinner?

626
01:00:36,783 --> 01:00:38,307
Because I'm afraid.

627
01:00:38,584 --> 01:00:40,279
You made me afraid.

628
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:44,615
I thought you were supposed to be
the big girl in this family.

629
01:00:47,694 --> 01:00:49,525
Nothing wrong with it.

630
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,457
You're just a neurotic, Blanche!

631
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:55,765
D'you know that...

632
01:00:55,835 --> 01:00:57,666
...you're just a neurotic?

633
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:06,672
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning.

634
01:01:14,887 --> 01:01:17,515
- Please, Jane, I'm so hungry.
- I have to go now.

635
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:19,692
But just a little, please!

636
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:24,223
No. You didn't eat your din-din,
so you'll have to wait till lunchtime.

637
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:28,399
Jane, please... don't do this to me.
Jane! Please!

638
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,526
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning, Ms. Jane.

639
01:01:57,397 --> 01:01:59,228
I wanna talk to you.

640
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,456
- I want to apologize.
- Apologize?

641
01:02:02,168 --> 01:02:05,899
I wasn't feeling so well yesterday,
so I was unkind to you.

642
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:08,636
I want to make it up.

643
01:02:08,741 --> 01:02:11,266
I got up this morning
and fixed the house.

644
01:02:12,545 --> 01:02:14,479
So you can have the whole day off.

645
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:17,179
Here's your $15.

646
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:20,548
Well, thanks, but does Miss...
What I mean, is...

647
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:22,650
...does Ms. Blanche know
about my taking the day off?

648
01:02:22,722 --> 01:02:24,212
Oh, sure, she knows.

649
01:02:25,124 --> 01:02:27,251
All right... if you say so.

650
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:29,652
See you next Tuesday then.

651
01:02:30,797 --> 01:02:32,059
Have a good time.

652
01:02:33,132 --> 01:02:34,258
Goodbye.

653
01:02:45,144 --> 01:02:46,076
Bye!

654
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,630
Who was that at the door earlier?

655
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:13,732
Elvira.

656
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:16,626
Where is she now? In the kitchen?

657
01:04:17,637 --> 01:04:20,265
No. I gave her the day off.

658
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,906
She has a pretty hard time, considering.

659
01:04:23,142 --> 01:04:25,007
I told her to come back next week.

660
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,579
You know we got rats in the cellar?

661
01:07:09,742 --> 01:07:10,902
Good afternoon.

662
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,608
Mr. Flagg?

663
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:19,214
Yes, I'm Edwin Flagg.

664
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:24,980
I have an appointment with
Ms. Hudson for 4:00 o'clock.

665
01:07:25,591 --> 01:07:27,684
I'm Jane Hudson.

666
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:31,789
My, you're... you're right on time,
aren't you?

667
01:07:32,064 --> 01:07:33,861
Yes, I believe I am.

668
01:07:34,934 --> 01:07:35,992
Come in.

669
01:07:56,522 --> 01:07:58,547
We can talk here in the living room.

670
01:08:03,763 --> 01:08:07,859
Oh, I say... what a perfectly
charming room.

671
01:08:11,036 --> 01:08:13,903
- So, you're Edwin Flagg?
- Yes, that's right.

672
01:08:15,407 --> 01:08:17,341
I'll bring you some tea. You like tea?

673
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,210
Oh, yes. I'm quite fond of tea.

674
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,538
You must've guessed that I'm English.

675
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,408
Oh, really? How nice for you.
