What was that?

[Panting] Don't ask me.

Ask him.

00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:23,474
- What was that?
- Miss Page, once again,

I must remind you,
do not leave your station.

The bottom.

Well, how long can we afford
to stay down here?

I regret not telling you
about Schillings...

because... well,
I... I should have realized

00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:15,922
that a submarine isn't
a good place to keep secrets.

Is it?

We'd been stalking
a German sub tender for a while.

cracked its back
with one torpedo.

526
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:34,173
We went topside to survey the
damage, and the ship was gone.

527
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,308
But there's a lot of debris
in the water,

and Captain Winters decides
to go down and haul some in.

00:37:39,187 --> 00:37:40,950
It was the middle
of the Atlantic.

I try to talk him out of it,
and... but he's al...

Anyway, he... the boat hit
an underwater obstruction,

534
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:55,301
and he fell... he hit his head.

535
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,032
And he was... he went under
before we could get to him.

I heard you were asking.

I don't know exactly
where it is,

but it's somewhere between the
pressure hull and the sea hull.

And if it's leaking here
or here,

then it's dumping oil
under the main ballast,

596
00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:41,246
which means that every time
we surface or dive...

We leave an oil slick.

Yeah, well, chief thinks
that with the tower flooded,

620
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:43,282
it gives the boat enough weight
to stay down

652
00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:58,961
Commander Winters, myself,
Lieutenant Loomis,

653
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,702
and Lieutenant
J.G. Stephen Coors.

654
00:48:06,213 --> 00:48:09,842
The night we lost
Old Man Winters...

655
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,350
Odd time to bring that up.

656
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:14,580
It's an odd place.

657
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:22,217
So, how'd he bang his head
before he went over?

658
00:48:22,295 --> 00:48:23,455
You heard.

659
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,027
I heard that the boat
hit something,

660
00:48:28,101 --> 00:48:30,160
but I never felt it down below.

661

[Thudding]

What?!

663
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:46,309
I didn't say anything.

664
00:48:46,386 --> 00:48:49,219
I know,
but what were you thinking?

665
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,190
Well...

666
00:48:54,694 --> 00:48:57,288
I used to hear about
these dock workers.

667
00:48:57,363 --> 00:49:00,127
They would get welded up
in these kind of places.

668
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:05,136
And then... they were
never heard from again.

669
00:49:05,204 --> 00:49:06,637
Wally?

670
00:49:06,706 --> 00:49:09,903
You are so fucking
out-of-bounds with that shit!

671

Let's keep moving.

it looks like.

673
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:36,367
Better drive some wedges.

00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:37,425
Yeah.

[Breathlessly]
Yeah. Yeah.

679

There were survivors
from the sinking.

- Brice and Loomis even, uh...

682
00:49:58,024 --> 00:50:01,460
but... Winters had other ideas,

683
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:03,791
and, uh...

684
00:50:03,863 --> 00:50:06,855
he ordered a gunnery party
topside.

685
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:08,525
Well, three of us had a problem

686
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:11,365
with machine-gunning
those men right in the water,

687

I mean,
even if they were German.

688
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:16,431
There was an argument.

689
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:20,606
It got kind of heated.

690
00:50:25,618 --> 00:50:27,381
Well, why didn't you tell us?!

691
00:50:27,453 --> 00:50:28,647
I guess, uh...

692
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:32,223
I guess we were trying
to protect him...

693
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:34,122
felt Winters was
a pretty good C.O.,

694
00:50:34,193 --> 00:50:36,753
even if he could be a tough
son of a bitch sometimes.

695
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:40,595
For his reputation...
you know, his family's sake.

696
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,293
Yeah, yeah, okay, but...

697
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:44,233
I still don't see
how he hit his head.

The rudder has a dedicated line
from here to the stern.

If we tap into there
somewhere aft,

I think we should regain
our steering.
