00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,204
Okay.

169
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,007
This is gonna go fast.
No, it's not.

170
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,242
Oh, my God.

171
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,547
Christopher Columbus.

172
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,614
ZACH: Oh, really? Yeah.

173
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:13,418
This is the first cathedral
in the New World.

174
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,588
The Cathedral of Santo Domingo.

175
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,089
It's, uh, the...

176
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,991
"It's Gothic style highlighted

177
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,260
with Renaissance details."

178
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,262
SAMANTHA (whispering):
Oh, my God,

179
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,997
I have never seen anything

180
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:29,134
so fucking perfect before
in my life.

181
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,570
Look at this sea of white.

182
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,371
Oh, my gosh.

183
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,007
(gasps) What's that?

184
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,113
(singsongy): That's my husband.

185
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,016
Wake up.

186
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:45,650
Hey.

187
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:46,985
(Zach yells, Samantha laughs)

188
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,588
(singing along with radio): ♪ Oogum,
Oogum, Boogum, Boogum, Boogum

189
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,158

your spell on me

190

00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,732

194
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,633
What is that?

195
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,301
It's the coolest
wedding present ever.

196
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,437
Mason gave it to us;
It's an adventure cam.

197
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,272
Oh, good,
that's what I always wanted.

198
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,239
I know. I know.

199
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,241
And now we can go zip-lining.
Come on. Yay!

200
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,111
ZACH:
Just get your game face on.

201
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:15,747
All right.

202
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,382
(screams) Hold on.

203
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,717
Hold on!

204
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,118
Whoa.

205
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,687
(drums beating, crowd cheering)

206
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,093
SAMANTHA: Wow.

207
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,362
(horn blowing)

208
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,100
SAMANTHA: Where are we?

209
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,668
(shouting)

210
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,070
(applause)

211
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,742
Zach, come here.

212
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,314
We're going here.

213
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,682
(chuckles)

214
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,183
Whoa.

215
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,151
(chuckles) Come on.

216
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,420
ZACH: Hey, wait up,
wait up, wait up.

217
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,755
WOMAN: Oh.

218
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:57,756
Hi. Welcome.

219
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,025
Oh, thank you, thank you.
ZACH: Hi.

220
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,459
Welcome.

221
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,594
(chuckles)

222
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:03,795
Have a seat.

223
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,396
Okay.

224
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,565
I will study your palm.
SAMANTHA: Okay.

225
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,267
Which one do you want?

226
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,035
This one.

227
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,370
ZACH: I don't think it matters.

228
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,373
Oh, well, they're different.

229
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,080
You've had some hard times,

230
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,583
but-but now you're so happy.

231
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,218
(laughs)

232
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,320
You're happy now.
ZACH: She's good.

233
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,456
(laughs)

234
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,197
No family.

235
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,835
No past.

236
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,847
You were...

237
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,316
born from death.

238
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,687
What do you mean?

239
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,155
They've been waiting.

240
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,223
ZACH: Do you want to go? Yeah.

241
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,357
They've been waiting. Whoa.

242
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,592
Okay. They've been waiting.

243
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,227
All right, let's, um...
ZACH: Excuse me, ma-ma'am.

244
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,462
They... Thank you. Jesus.

245
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,696
That's fine.
They've been waiting.

246
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,198
Okay. All right.
You are the first.

247
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,632
The first of many. All
right, thanks. Okay.

248
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,201
That's great.
You will bring the end.

249
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,635
All right, thank you.
You know what, let's go.

250
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:18,937
Let's go. Thank you very much.

251
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,371
You've been... No,
can-can we get...

252
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,539
All right. Ow, ow, stop.

253
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,907
Let go of me, please.
Ma'am, ma'am,

254
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,442
ma'am, let go, okay.
Okay, let's go.

255
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,644
Let's go, let's go. All right.

256
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,179
Zach, let's go. Come on.
Okay, okay.

257
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,647
ZACH: Hey, you okay?

258
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,816
What did she say to you?

259
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,651
Nothing. Fucking nothing.

260
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,320
I don't know. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

261
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,755
Hey, forget her, okay?

262
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,622
She was crazy.

263
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,824
I just... what did she whisper
in your ear?

264
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:40,658
I don't know.

265
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,761
It was just, like,
a bunch of gibberish.

266
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,661
She stank of rum anyway.

267
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,597
I just want to get back
to the hotel.

268
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,833
ZACH: I don't remember
this street. Do you?

269
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:52,604
SAMANTHA: Do you want
to go down this way?

270
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,706
ZACH: Let's turn around.

271
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,642
(man yells)

272
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,778
Okay.

273
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,717
(bangs, Samantha screams)
ZACH: Jesus.

274
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,852
(grumbles)

275
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,221
Let's go.

276
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,359
(high-pitched barking)

277
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,660
ZACH: They don't have
any street signs.

278
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,529
SAMANTHA: Can we just
head back towards, like,

279
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,564
where the party was?
I don't real...

280
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,431
(whistles)

281
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,801
<i>Oye, necesitan taxi?</i>

282
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,702
ZACH: You a taxi? Yeah.

283
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:25,837
ZACH: That's your family?

284
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,605
<i>Mi</i> family.<i> Tenem... Niños.</i>

285
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,306
<i>Bebés?</i>

286
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,407
B-b-babies? SAMANTHA: Oh, no.

287
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,842
ZACH: Oh, no, not yet.
SAMANTHA:<i> No tengo.</i>

288
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,611
No?
ZACH: We, uh,<i> esposas nuevas.</i>

289
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:37,715
DRIVER: <i>Tengo mucho,
mucho, mucho bebés.</i>

290
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,517
ZACH:<i> Sí. Mucho bebés.</i> Someday.

291
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,418
One day, yeah.

292
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,920
I take you somewhere fun.

293
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,321
<i>Eh, divertido?</i>

294
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,756
<i>Auténtico, auténtico.</i>

295
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,357
ZACH: No, no, no, we're good.
Thank you.

296
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,593
We just want to go back
to the, um, hotel, yeah?

297
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,228
Yeah. No, no, no, no. No worry.

298
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,296
<i>Eh, yo te por afuera.</i>

299
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,998
I-I, this place, eh,
<i>muy distintivo,</i> eh...

300
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,801
<i>¿Cómo se dice en inglés?</i>
It's special,<i> muy</i> special.

301
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,937
ZACH: What do you think?
One more drink?

302
00:13:58,939 --> 00:13:59,904
No.

303
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,573
<i>Vamos, ustedes están jóvenes.</i>

304
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,274
Oh, eh,<i> veinte minutos.</i>

305
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,609
ZACH: <i>Veinte minutos.</i>

306
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:08,012
20 minutes? 20 minutes.

307
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,480
It's our last night.

308
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,515
<i>Veinte. Veinte minuto?</i>

309
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,617
<i>Veinte. Ve... es vale?</i>

310
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,585
<i>¿Veinte?</i>

311
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,220
- Oh,<i> gratis.</i>
- Oh.

312
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:15,887
<i>Gratis.</i>

313
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,888
<i>Esta conmigo.</i>

314
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,822
ZACH: Deal. Fine.

315
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,824
Deal.
All right, fine. One drink.

316
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:20,692
<i>Ahora?</i>

317
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,293
<i>Llegamo,</i> we, uh, we here.

We here. We're here.

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,629
Yes, this is...

320
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,264
This looks... great.

321
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,298
ZACH: Uh... Okay.

322
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,734
Okay. <i>Ahora, tu
vacación empieza ahora.</i>

323
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:30,468
Okay.

324
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,769
SAMANTHA:<i> Gracias.</i> ZACH: Okay.

325
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,671
Yeah, thank you. <i>De nada.</i>

326
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:34,939
<i>Vamo. Vamo pa alla.</i>

327
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,341
ZACH: You don't look happy.

328
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,842
Yeah, well, where are we?

329
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,811
I don't know, but it

What?

403
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:52,043
I said, "These men are
staring at me." Oh.

404

All right.

406

I guess you'll do.

407
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:59,017
You guess?
I can't dance anymore.

408
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,685

Come on, wife.

Yeah, no kidding.

429

Oh, God, get away with that.

430

No, I know, but come on.

431
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,452
I'll get you some water,
but we got to get up.

432
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,720
We got to catch this plane.

433
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,489
Okay. Oh, God.

434

(groans)

435
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,759
Yeah, my head is killing me.

436
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,161
Me, too.

437

Oh, shit.

How did we get home last night?

441
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,737
I don't know,
the guy in the cab?

442
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,607
Stop.

443
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,574
Not right now.

444
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:07,712

See you later, Santo Domingo.

445

Home, sweet home.

458
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,572
ZACH:
Oh, Suzie left the door open.

459
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,107
Great. That's great.

460
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,208
ZACH: Here we are.

461
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,278
SAMANTHA (groans): Yay, home.

462
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,846
Ooh.

463
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:42,580
Presents. Ooh.

464
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,782
Crate & Barrel, Crate & Barrel,

465
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,116
Crate & Barrel.
I'll go get the bags.

466
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,852
All right,
we got the panini grill

467
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,255
and that thing from Allison.
Oh.

468
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,991
And what... is this one?

469
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,293
I don't know, open it up.

470
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,295
Mav, do you want to open this?

471
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,629
All right.

472
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,797
He doesn't care.

473
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,999
Okay, this is...

474
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,268
the juicer that I wanted!

475
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,605
I'm gonna make
so much stuff with, like,

476
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,174
flax and probiotics and...

477
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,677
things with kale.

478
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,946
Kale?

479
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:15,913
Mmm.

480
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,783
(whispering): Kale, shh, kale.

481
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,917
(laughter, groaning)

482
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,851
SAMANTHA: Oh, Mav.

483
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,119
Mav, give me...
give me the bun.

484
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,621
Mav, give me the bun.
Oh, my God.

485
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,690
Look at him. Oh.
Damn, that... Oh, wow.

486
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:29,026
Hey, did you see the "sold" sign
on the Anderson house?

487
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:29,894
ZACH: Oh, for real?

488
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,996
(chuckling): Maybe someone
will finally fix that place up.

489
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,231
I hope so. Hey, uh, Samantha?

490
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,665
It's terrible. Your husband.

491
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,567
I know.
He can't grill for shit.

492
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,969
ZACH: Sam, come on,
you're gonna miss it.

493
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,170
All right,
this is gonna be awesome.

494
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,072
Ready? Just like we practiced.

495
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,773
Are you kidding me?

496
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:43,908
Come on. Maverick, no, no, no.

497
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,776
You're not...
You're supposed to catch it.

498
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,144
SAMANTHA: Zach? Yeah?

499
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,179
ZACH: Come on, ready?

500
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,214
Eye on the prize,
eye on the prize.

501
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,916
Yes! Yes! Yes!

502
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,184
Zach? What?

503
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:56,754
Can you turn that off
for one second?

504
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,324
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is that?

505
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,364
Uh...

506
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,698
I... (sighs)

507
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,333
It, uh, it doesn't make
any sense.

508
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,869
I mean, I've taken
the pill religiously.

509
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,037
I've never missed one ever.

510
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,173
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
holy-holy sh...

511
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,744
You're pregnant?

512
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,813
Yes. Oh, my God.

513
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,181
(kissing)

514
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,650
We're having a baby.

515
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,952
(chuckles) Holy shit.

516
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,788
Aah! Oh, my God!

517
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,890
That's so amazing.

518
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:33,858
Oh, my God.

519
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,826
ZACH: I feel good
about this office.

520
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:36,661
How about you?

521
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,797
I feel good, except that says
three stages of pregnancy,

522
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,998
and there's four pictures.

523
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,466
Okay, so this isn't
a math office,

524
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,903
it's a doctor's office.
(laughs): I hope that doctors

525
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:46,671
can do math.

526
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,673
Well, the doctor didn't
make that sign, clearly.

527
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,641
(anxious groan)
You think the doctor made

528
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,943
the "dirty area" sign? (Laughs)

529
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:53,811
Oh, hello. ZACH: Hi.

530
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,013
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. McCall.
SAMANTHA: Hi. Hey.

531
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,848
Hello. How are you?
I... I'm Zach.

532
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,151
Hi. I'm Dr. Ludka.
It's nice to finally meet.

533
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,320
Finally meet. Yes! Yeah. Yeah.

534
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,055
Hello, lucky lady. Hi.

535
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:06,457
How you doing?
I'm good. How are you?

536
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,758
Okay. You ready?

537
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,426
(inhales) Yeah.

538
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,128
Okay, this is gonna be
quick and painless.

539
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,063
ZACH: Awesome.

540
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,164
Sorry. (Laughs): Awesome.

541
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,367
Um, you know you get a copy
of the ultrasound, right?

542
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,836
ZACH: Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I just, um...

543
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,870
He... This is his thing.

544
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,105
It's our thing. We...
It's our thing.

545
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,808
We just wanted to film
a bunch of this, so he can...

546
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,976
he, she, whoever,
can see it later.

547
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,978
It's for the baby. Okay. Sure.

548
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
Is it okay? Oh, yeah. Perfect.

549
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,882
Okay.
Make sure you get my good side.

550
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,852
Done. Done. Right there.
(laughs) Both sides.

551
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,922
This is gonna be a little cold.

552
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,890
(Zach laughs)

553
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:40,858
Mm-hmm.

554
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,026
LUDKA: Little gooey, huh?

555
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,862
Yeah. Oh. That's...
(Ludka laughs)

556
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,098
great. Okay.

557
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,400
(machine beeps)
LUDKA: Ah, there we go.

558
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,135
ZACH: Ooh. Can you see?

559
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,404
There's your uterus,
right there.

560
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,106
(low, rhythmic whooshing)

561
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:57,942
And there's the heartbeat.

562
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,077
(Ludka chuckles)

563
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,980
Huh. Um...

564
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,382
ZACH: What?
LUDKA: Oh, don't worry,

565
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,451
don't worry, I'm just
gonna make a few adjustments.

566
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,220
SAMANTHA: Is it okay?

567
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,688
ZACH: Is it...

568
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,823
LUDKA: Uh...

569
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,393
Ah, there we go.

570
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,294
So, you're about
seven weeks along.

571
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,930
ZACH: Ooh. And everything
looks really good.

572
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,832
ZACH: Honeymoon baby.

573
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,833
(all laugh)

574
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,069
The pill's about 99% effective,

575
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,538
but occasionally this happens.

576
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,540
Okay. Don't even...
She winked at me.

577
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,575
I saw that. I...
'Cause I got good sperm.

578
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,979
What? It's good, strong sperm.
This is what you've started.

579
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:38,082
I'm gonna prescribe
vitamin B...

580
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,917
and iron, since
you're a vegetarian.

581
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,420
Mm-hmm. ZACH: Yeah, I've been
trying to break her of that.

582
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,288
LUDKA: Yeah. It's for the baby.
Mm-mm.

583
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,323
But overall, you're pretty healthy.
Yeah.

584
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,459
I'm expecting
a pretty smooth ride here.

585
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,161
ZACH: Awesome. SAMANTHA: Great.

586
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,996
Okay? ZACH: Thank you. Yeah.

587
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:54,298
One more thing.

588
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,334
ZACH: What? Ooh. Oh.
Congratulations.

589
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,836
(laughs)
The due date is March 30.

590
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,372
ZACH: Hey, it looks like a...
he looks like you.

591
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:04,241
(laughing): He doesn't.
A little jelly bean.

592
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:07,878
Ooh, will you hold this?
LUDKA: Oh, sure. (Laughs)

593
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,314
It's our first family video.

594
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:13,250
LUDKA: Oh, sweet.

595
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,119
(whispers): That's awesome.

596
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,520
Sorry, sorry. Thanks.

597
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,154
(laughter)

598
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,958
LUDKA: All right, expecting
you guys back in five weeks.

599
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,892
♪

600
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,260
(Zach chuckles softly)

601
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,396
I think Maverick drank my wine.

602
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:27,164
(Samantha and Zach laugh)

603
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,167
SAMANTHA:
Aw, Mav. He's such a lush.

604
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,602
ZACH: Hey, are your...

605
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:34,505
like, ankles and toes
started swelling up?

606
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,874
SAMANTHA:
Oh, my God, with the ankles.

607
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,976
Yes, they're swelling up. Yeah.

608
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:39,944
I read in the baby book,

609
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,479
it says that those things
swell sometimes.

610
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:46,116
They do. My entire thing
is swelling right now, so...

611
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:46,917
Looks-looks good.

612
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,554
You could use a little
meat on your bones. Mm-mm.

613
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,223
I don't like it.

614
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:54,058
Hey, ew. I mean, whoa.

615
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,559
(laughs): Excu... What?

616
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:56,327
Oh, God.

617
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,461
You haven't noticed that?

618
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,163
No. What is that? I don't...

619
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,197
Oh. Does it hurt?

620
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,367
No. I think my body's
being taken over by hormones.

621
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,069
Ugh! This is not supposed
to be happening.

622
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:07,471
Yeah, don't look at that. No,
no, that is supposed to...

623
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,573
All these weird things
are gonna happen to you.

624
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,542
You're making a-a person...

625
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:14,245
Yeah. Inside of your person.

626
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,547
(chuckles):
Seriously, it's amazing.

627
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,516
(low groan) Sam.

628
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,483
Hm?

629
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,485
You're making a baby.

630
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,487
I can't do that.

631
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,256
Yeah.

632
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:28,259
(soft snoring) (rustling)

633
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,960
(Zach exhales)

634
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:33,163
(Samantha continues snoring)
(sniffs, groans)

635
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:34,398
(Maverick whines)

636
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,935
ZACH: Oh, she woke you up?

637
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:41,272
Yeah. So, your mother snores,

638
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:44,475
even though she
categorically denies it.

639
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:46,844
But we now have hard evidence,

640
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,680
so if she ever denies it ag...

641
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,017
Oh, hey.

642
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,485
Sam.

643
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,587
Sam, hey.

644
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:59,590
Jesus, Sam...

645
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,892
Sam...

646
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,093
(gasps)

647
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:06,063
(groaning softly)

648
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,299
Go to sleep.

649
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,704
ZACH: What are you doing?
Hello.

650
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,239
ZACH: All right,
they're getting restless,

651
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,241
they're getting restless,

652
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,510
so let's, uh...
I'll leave it to Sam.

653
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:20,978
We're having a baby.

654
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,615
Oh, my God! (Laughs)
(squealing, excited chatter)

655
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,417
Oh, that's great!
(Zach chuckles)

656
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,085
They're having a baby! What?

657
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:32,389
Congratulations. We get
to be grandparents again!

658
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:36,961
Aw. Stop, okay? Thank you.
Congratulations.

659
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:37,461
Flip it.

660
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,698
Flip that card that you
just had in your hand.

661
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,432
Thank you.

662
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:44,101
Seven, king... so I get it.

663
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,202
(Zach laughs)

664
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,471
It's tofu. ZACH: What
did you think it was?

665
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,407
I wish you wouldn't have
told me it was tofu.

666
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,775
I mean, did they do a sonogram?

667
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,511
Oh, yeah. Did you get...
did you get a picture?

668
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:58,115
Yeah. She wants, like, a
picture to show everybody,

669
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,049
like, immediately.

670
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,150
Ultra... oh, ultrasound.

671
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:03,087
If you go with a C-section, your
body just bounces right back.

672
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,388
Oh, really. Great. What?

673
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,591
Sweetie... Did you... why
don't you try to not, like,

674
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,326
micromanage their
entire... thing.

675
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,594
I checked under the fridge...
it's not there.

676
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,996
You lifted
the fridge up and...?

677
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,664
Well, I mean,
I looked... Whatever.

678
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,333
We'll find it. We'll find it.
Uh, I couldn't find it. I'll...

679
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,735
When I do, I'll
e-mail it to you.

680
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:20,437
Oh, I hope you find it, 'cause...
We will, we will.

681
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:23,107
I'm sorry, Nat.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

682
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,408
(indistinct chatter)

683
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,243
Oh, my God, Sam,
you're bleeding.

684
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,145
SAMANTHA: Oh, God.
Oh, geez. Here.

685
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,080
Sam, here you go.
This is clean.

686
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:30,748
Tilt your head back.

687
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,784
SAMANTHA: Oh. Ugh! Ew.
SUZIE: Are you okay?

688
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:36,020
ZACH: This is where
you'll go to school.

689
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,755
I got beat up here
a couple times,

690
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,523
but that's not
gonna happen to you.

691
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,692
You're gonna be
a much cooler kid.

692
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,527
(bell tolling)
Uh, this is where

693
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,562
me and your mom got married.

694
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,332
Very pretty church.

695
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,169
This is where we walk the dog.

696
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,471
Here's the Anderson house.

697
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,739
It still looks like shit.

698
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,542
(barking) Shit, fuck, Maverick.

699
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,244
Maverick, goddamn.

700
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:03,614
(barking continues)
Hey, hey. Maverick.

701
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:05,149
Come here. Hey.

702
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:05,783
Hey. No, no.

703
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:07,751
No, no, we don't live here.
Come on.

704
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,454
(Maverick growls)
All right, come on.

705
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:12,156
(Maverick panting)

706
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:13,123
Come on.

707
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,558
This is your house.

708
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,461
That's your room
up there on the left.

709
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:20,597
Granddad says that
it's a money pit, but, uh...

710
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,100
(loud crack)
you know, it's got good...

711
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,635
good bones. Shit.

712
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:25,602
(rain falling) Hey.

713
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:29,473
Hey. Do you think
this looks too mishmash?

714
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:30,674
Um...

715
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,176
do you want the truth?

716
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:35,479
(laughs) I'm giving our baby
a tour of the house.

717
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,814
Yeah? Hey! Sorry.

718
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,182
That's not the house.

719
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,818
(thunder rumbling)
ZACH: And the grand finale...

720
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,652
your room!

721
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:44,621
Formerly known
as your mother's office.

722
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,523
(Samantha chuckles)
But now we are converting.

723
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,559
Thank you for
giving up your office.

724
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,293
Mm-hmm. Whoa!

725
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,628
(chuckles): Watch it there.
SAMANTHA: Geez! (Laughs)

726
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,432
I mean, I study on the couch
all the time anyway, so...

727
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,366
it's not a big deal.

728
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,634
It's a pretty good room, though.

729
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:00,804
She really didn't do anything
in it, so I think it's...

730
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:01,739
it's only fair.

731
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,340
It's gonna be
kind of cool, though...

732
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,442
you and I are
gonna hang in here...

733
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,244
Hey. Teach you...

734
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,813
Do you see this guy
across the street?

735
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:13,417
Huh? He's just, like,
staring up at the house.

736
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,486
ZACH: What? What the fuck?

737
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:18,288
SAMANTHA: Oh, it's creepy.

738
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,490
ZACH: Hey. Hi.

739
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:20,591
How was class? Ow!

740
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:24,428
Uh, it was fine. I just had
to leave 'cause I'm starving.

741
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,498
I think there's some
leftover pad Thai in there.

742
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,900
I know. I don't want that.

743
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,535
Okay.

744
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,402
(loud groan)

745
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:35,906
Um... I'm just gonna eat
a bunch of cookies.

746
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:40,344
How are you...
how are you feeling?

747
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:41,678
Fine.

748
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,281
I'm just hungry.

749
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,486
(low, indistinct chatter)

750
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,698
(low, indistinct chatter)

751
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,577
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A. system)

752
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,754
MAN: You're okay?

753
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:26,790
All right.

754
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,829
(low, indistinct chatter)

755
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,340
(low, indistinct chatter)

756
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,497
(low, indistinct chatter)

757
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,679
(imitates drumroll)
All right, get ready!

758
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:26,250
(gasps) SAMANTHA: Oh! What?
Whoa, whoa. Hey, no.

759
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,384
Hello? SAMANTHA: Hey.

760
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,886
I told you not...
that this was off-limits

761
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,454
until I told you
that it was on-limits.

762
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,422
But it's just Emily.
I want her to see it.

763
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,491
EMILY: It looks so good.
I don't care abut Emily.

764
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,660
I care about you. Oh. Okay.
EMILY: Uh-oh. Great.

765
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,729
Thanks. Are you guys gonna
pick a color, or...

766
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,766
Well, one of these days.
This looks really good, though.

767
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:43,800
Oh, look! (Gasps)

768
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:44,902
Oh, my God. ZACH: Yep.

769
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,737
SAMANTHA: That's really nice.
EMILY: You made that?

770
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,005
ZACH:
It's gonna look way better.

771
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:49,740
SAMANTHA:
Well, you're doing a great job.

772
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,476
I'm very proud of you.
(Emily giggles)

773
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,278
Well, here's the crib.

774
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,979
Uh-huh. Hey... EMILY: Oh, wow.

775
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,748
ZACH: Yeah.
That looks really good.

776
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,017
Yeah, I got it... we got it
at the antique place,

777
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:02,419
and then I brought it home
and, uh, you know,

778
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,787
sanded it down,
refinished it and stuff,

779
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,490
made it baby-safe... I know
you're big on baby safety.

780
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:09,526
Yeah. Well, it looks great.
EMILY (gasps): Cute sheets.

781
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,762
(Samantha grunts in pain)
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

782
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:12,696
ZACH: I got you. (Grunts)

783
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:16,366
Okay, okay, hey. I got you.
Oh, ow, ow, ow.

784
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,501
Sit down.

785
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:18,068
You okay?

786
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,370
EMILY: It happened
this morning, too.

787
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,572
(groaning) Did... This bad?

788
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:23,373
Mm-hmm.

789
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,109
Hey. Hey. Just breathe, okay?
(groaning)

790
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,578
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

791
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,847
EMILY: Lie down, maybe?
You sure it's just...

792
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,417
I'll just sit here for a second.

793
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,086
(takes deep breath)

794
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,020
In.

795
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,355
(inhales)

796
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:39,556
And out.

797
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,426
(all exhale)

798
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:43,527
In.

799
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,762
(all inhale)

800
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,533
(whispers): Do you see
what I'm doing for you?

801
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,868
I'm learning how to breathe.

802
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,070
(inhales)

803
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:53,870
(both exhale)

804
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,940
(whispers): You might actually
have to know some of this stuff.

805
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,109
I know this stuff.
I know how to breathe.

806
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,478
Okay. I know that
you know how to breathe,

807
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,381
but there's other stuff...
(inhaling)

808
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:04,748
Okay.

809
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,484
(Zach wheezes) (laughs): Stop.

810
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,953
INSTRUCTOR: You are strong.

811
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,989
You are healthy.

812
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:12,856
(people exhaling)

813
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:17,394
Your body is going through
a beautiful transformation.

814
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,896
SAMANTHA (whispers):
That's a load of shit.

815
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,833
INSTRUCTOR: I want you all
to imagine a place

816
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,835
that's calming...

817
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:25,669
quiet.

818
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,139
Make it a specific memory.

819
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:30,941
Where are you?

820
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:34,978
SAMANTHA (whispers):
On the beach on our honeymoon.

821
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,714
INSTRUCTOR: How old are you?

822
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:40,450
(Samantha exhales)

823
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,753
Are you alone?

824
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,990
Breathe in to this memory
that brings you joy.

825
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,493
(women gasping in pain)

826
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,528
INSTRUCTOR: Okay,
everyone please breathe.

827
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,198
Breathe. If you're gonna sit up,
sit up slowly.

828
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,733
Very slowly.
Keep breathing, everyone.

829
00:33:56,735 --> 00:34:00,670
ZACH: Hey, Sam. Sam.
Please remain calm.

830
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,006
(women gasping, groaning)
Sam, are you okay?

831
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,674
So, this is happening.

832
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:07,744
SAMANTHA: Yep.
We are buying baby stuff.

833
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,112
♪ Baby stuff!

834
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,515
(Zach chuckles)

835
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,717
Let's go crazy.
Yeah, let's go nuts.

836
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,152
Ooh. You want to... (grunts)

837
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,054
You want to practice
a little diapering,

838
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,622
get a little wrap
around this guy?

839
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,657
I'm-I'm good.
You don't want to do that?

840
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,958
I'm good.
But he's just been out,

841
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,794
he's not even in a box...
he's clearly dirty.

842
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:25,028
Yeah, where'd
this baby come from?

843
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,397
I don't know you, baby.
(laughs): You bent him over

844
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,599
and looked at his ass
to see where it came from.

845
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,869
I just wanted to know
if he had a name or something.

846
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,638
(Samantha groans)

847
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,540
(laughing): It's a milk pump.

848
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,442
Not at all.

849
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,543
No? No.

850
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:40,610
We need one, though, right?

851
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:41,878
Yeah, we do.
I actually need one.

852
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,148
I never want to see you
do that ever again.

853
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,953
Probably not.
(shopping cart rattling)

854
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,522
No, I think we got everything.
For the whole pregnancy.

855
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,991
This is all a baby
needs right here.

856
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,560
Ow! You all right?

857
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:57,127
(groans)

858
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,096
(engine starting) I'm gonna
go get the car, all right?

859
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,130
Just hold on. No, I'm fine.

860
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,032
No, seriously, Sam, Sam, please,
just wait there, all right?

861
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:03,667
SAMANTHA: No. Look,
if I just keep moving,

862
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,035
I'm gonna be completely...
I'll be right there.

863
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:06,736
ZACH: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(Samantha yelling)

864
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,605
Oh, shit! Sam!
SAMANTHA: Motherfucker!

865
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,574
Whoa, hey, hey, no.
MAN: What are you doing?

866
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,008
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you fucking crazy?!

867
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,045
Stop, stop, stop!
Get away from my car!

868
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,984
(Samantha groaning, crying)
It's okay. It's okay.

869
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,954
(sobbing) Okay, okay. We're
gonna get some help.

870
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,655
We're gonna get some help.
It's all right.

871
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:26,857
It's all right. It's all right.

872
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:29,126
It's all right.
What happened?! What happened?!

873
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,961
(continues sobbing)
Just breathe. Just breathe.

874
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,597
Oh, what is wrong with me?!
Just breathe. It's okay.

875
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,001
(sobbing): Something is wrong!
Something is wr...

876
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,704
ZACH: Hey.

877
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:44,941
You look really pretty
when you're pensive.

878
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,210
I'm serious.

879
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,912
Hey.

880
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,948
Look what I found
behind your ear.

881
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,718
(Zach laughs) Nothing.

882
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,620
Oh. Hello.

883
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,854
Hi. Hi, Zach.

884
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,055
Hi, Samantha. I'm Dr. Dylan.

885
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:01,024
ZACH:
Wait, uh, where's Dr. Ludka?

886
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:04,161
Dr. Ludka had to take
a leave of absence.

887
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,762
I'm covering for her.

888
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,796
Well... (coughing)

889
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:09,900
Excuse me. Is she gonna
be back anytime soon?

890
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:14,171
She filled me in,
and I've studied your file.

891
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,071
Okay. That's it.

892
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:16,907
ZACH: So, well,
I mean, will she be back

893
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:19,242
by the time we deliver?
Yeah, can we talk to her?

894
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:22,212
I don't think she's
gonna be able to come back.

895
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:25,115
Let's talk about your symptoms.

896
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:28,051
ZACH: Uh... okay.

897
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,687
Hmm.

898
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,289
(low, rhythmic whooshing)

899
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,791
Baby looks healthy.

900
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,693
But it's... turned around.

901
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,128
We're not gonna be able to...

902
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,130
find out if it's
a boy or girl today.

903
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:44,167
ZACH: It's gotten so much bigger.
(chuckles): Yeah.

904
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,238
(quiet retching) Sam, you okay?

905
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,006
ZACH: Oh, geez...

906
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:54,177
Hey. All right,
all right, right here. Here.

907
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,752
ZACH: She just needs a minute.

908
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,255
Sorry, the nausea
hasn't really gotten better.

909
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:08,325
It actually... seems like
it's gotten kind of worse.

910
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:13,063
Well, it's not
entirely unusual, so...

911
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,631
Um...

912
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,633
she's been getting
nosebleeds, too.

913
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,201
Are those... are those...

914
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,670
Yeah, can be.

915
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,807
She just doesn't seem
like herself lately.

916
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:27,844
Is there a history of mental
illness in her family?

917
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:28,678
I-I don't know.

918
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,916
Uh... I mean, she took
some meds during college

919
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,018
for... anxiety or...

920
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,887
I don't really know what...
they were.

921
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,656
We don't... uh...

922
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:43,093
we don't really know anything
about... her family.

923
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,894
Her parents were killed
in a car crash,

924
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,631
and they had
to cut Sam out of her womb.

925
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:50,367
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

926
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,736
SAMANTHA: Hey. Oh.

927
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:55,238
ZACH: You look beautiful.
(Samantha scoffs)

928
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,439
SAMANTHA: I'm really sorry.

929
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,442
ZACH: It's all right.
DYLAN: It's all right.

930
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:03,813
I, um... I'm gonna
do an amnio now.

931
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:04,948
Just to rule out any issues.

932
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,785
Especially since you don't know
what may run in your family.

933
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,487
ZACH: Okay.

934
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,889
You all right?

935
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,791
(Samantha grunts) Okay.

936
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:15,992
Okay.

937
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:16,860
Good.

938
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:17,927
I'm good, too.

939
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,863
Good. I was worried about you.

940
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,665
I know. I could tell,
'cause you asked.

941
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,233
(chuckles)
Uh, is this gonna hurt?

942
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:25,201
DYLAN: Oh, it's just
a little pressure.

943
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,437
It'll be over
before you know it.

944
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,839
I need you to stay very still.

945
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,775
Okay. Nurse, watch
the monitor, please.

946
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:34,844
(sighs) You ready?

947
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:35,378
Mm-hmm.

948
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,981
Just relax. Take a deep breath.

949
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,717
(inhales)

950
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,152
(groans)

951
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,286
Mmm-mm.

952
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,454
ZACH: Are you okay? (Grunts)

953
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:45,955
No. It's okay. Hey, hey, hey.

954
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,123
It's... N-No, something's wrong.

955
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,058
Can you get it out?

956
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,292
Can you get it out?
Keep her still.

957
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,694
Is everything okay?
(coughs) No, no.

958
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,162
Mm-mm. Keep her still.
Just try and stay still.

959
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,064
No. Can you get it out?
Samantha, we're almost there.

960
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,865
Can you get it out? Sam, Sam.
We're almost there.

961
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,434
Please get it out! No!
You're gonna hurt yourself.

962
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:58,835
No! You're gonna hurt yourself.

963
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,170
Get it out!
Sam, please, please, please.

964
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,439
Get it out! Please, can you
get it out of her? Thank you.

965
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:04,140
Get it out! It's out!
We're all done.

966
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,142
(screaming)
Sam, it's out, it's gone.

967
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:07,143
It's done, it's done.

968
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,978
Hey, hey, it's done.
(whimpering)

969
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,514
Hey, hey, it's okay, all right?

970
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,250
(whimpering)
Jesus Christ. It's okay.

971
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,419
(softly): I can't do this.

972
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,954
I can't do this.

973
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:20,824
It's all right, it's all right.

974
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,826
ZACH: I'm-I'm really
worried about her.

975
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,127
I don't... I don't know
what to do.

976
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,830
Do you think she'd ever
actually hurt herself?

977
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:27,864
What?

978
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,532
No, I don't...

979
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,568
I don't know. I don't think so.

980
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,338
Just to be safe, we'll be
keeping a close eye on her.

981
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,474
Okay.

982
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,518
(man whispering in Spanish)

983
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,089
(dog barking in distance)

984
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,430
(whispering continues)

985
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,406
(drilling)

986
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,943
(drilling stops)

987
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,446
(man whispering in Spanish)

988
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,021
(footsteps echoing)

989
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,567
ZACH: This door... I'm gonna
fix this door someday.

990
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,836
SAMANTHA:
Yeah, that'll be great.

991
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:40,870
ZACH: Watch your step.

992
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,105
SAMANTHA (chuckling):
Okay, thank you.

993
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,408
I'm so glad my sister bought
me that-that flashlight.

994
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,911
(sighs) Oh.

995
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,481
(Samantha clears throat)

996
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,919
How are you doing?

997
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,287
I feel like a...

998
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,088
hot air balloon.

999
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,889
(chuckles)

1000
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:00,924
You're going upstairs?

1001
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:02,258
Mm-hmm, I'm gonna go
take a bath.

1002
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,059
Okay. Yeah.

1003
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:05,829
I'm just gonna check the score
on the game real quick.

1004
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:08,198
All right.

1005
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,433
(sighs)

1006
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:13,503
Yeah, this thing takes
forever to turn on.

1007
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,374
(stairs creaking)

1008
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,984
(quietly):
We need to get a fucking maid.

1009
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,590
(Samantha humming quietly,
water running)

1010
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,830
(turns off water,
water sloshing)

1011
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,305
(humming continues)

1012
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,447
(barking, growling)

1013
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,417
(barking continues)

1014
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,590
(birds singing)

1015
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,564
(gasps)

1016
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:15,965
Oh, look.

1017
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,066
ZACH: Oh.

1018
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,568
SAMANTHA: That's beautiful.

1019
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,503
ZACH: Wow.

1020
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:22,639
Nice.

1021
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,609
Do you want to, like,

1022
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,978
take off while we wait
for the results?

1023
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,879
Just go...

1024
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,949
I don't know,
a spa or just get out?

1025
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,585
Like, let's just get
out of town.

1026
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,958
It's a good idea. I... Yeah.

1027
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,059
I'm just thinking, though,

1028
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,296
you-you've already taken
so much time off of work,

1029
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:48,064
and I've got finals,

1030
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:52,402
and we should probably be close
to the doctor right now.

1031
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,172
All right.

1032
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:57,707
It's just a thought.

1033
00:42:57,709 --> 00:43:00,276
It's a good thought.

1034
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,447
I'm gonna be all right.

1035
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,616
I know.

1036
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,957
(indistinct whispering)

1037
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,194
SAMANTHA: Come here.
ZACH: Here we go.

1038
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:19,629
SAMANTHA: Hold on a second.

1039
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:21,497
(sighs) Okay.

1040
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:22,465
ALL: Surprise!

1041
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,400
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

1042
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,234
Oh.

1043
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,303
ZACH'S MOTHER: Hi.

1044
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:30,506
Hey, sweetheart,
happy birthday, darling.

1045
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:32,275
Wow, thank you.

1046
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,543
Great, son. How are you?

1047
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:34,477
I'm very well, thank you.

1048
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:35,679
Hi, Ma. Come here, sweetheart.

1049
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,679
GIRL: Yeah. Yeah.

1050
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,648
Happy birthday, Aunt Sam.
Oh, my gosh.

1051
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,415
Thanks, sweetie.

1052
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,250
Happy birthday!
ZACH: All right, that's...

1053
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:42,418
All right, Jim. That's it.

1054
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,054
No, I'm fine,
I just got to rest.

1055
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:45,755
You sure? Yeah.

1056
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:48,257
EMILY: Why are you guys
hiding in the corner?

1057
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,325
Hey.

1058
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:50,593
Looking good! Thank you.

1059
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:52,629
Um, she's just gonna
go upstairs for a little bit,

1060
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:54,197
take a rest.
Yeah, I got to lie down.

1061
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,331
I'll be... I'll be back. Oh.

1062
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,200
You okay? All right, I'll
come up in a little bit

1063
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:59,402
and check on you. All right.
I just need a few minutes.

1064
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,337
(indistinct conversations)
Man, I'll clean all this up.

1065
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:02,672
No, I think that's what
they do actually.

1066
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,273
No, no, I got it, I got it.
I'll help you.

1067
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,642
I'm gonna help you, too,
I was just going to...

1068
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,644
It's fine, I got it.
You guys got everyone here.

1069
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,379
I'll clean it all up.
That's no problem.

1070
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,514
That's what friends are for.
Can I have some cake?

1071
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:12,749
Yeah, here you go. (Sighs)

1072
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,183
Is this too big a bite? No.

1073
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:16,019
There you go. Oh, that's cute.

1074
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:17,754
Mmm, nice. We're the sweetest.

1075
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,088
We're so cute.

1076
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,289
How's, um, how's Sam?

1077
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,491
Uh, I don't... I don't know.

1078
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:25,161
I haven't been up there
since she went up, but, um,

1079
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,230
she just, honestly,
like, in general,

1080
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:30,333
has not been herself or right.

1081
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,535
I mean, and the doctor says
that everything's fine,

1082
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:34,170
and we've done, like,
all these tests,

1083
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,606
and she's just
kind of convinced

1084
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,241
that there's something wrong
with the baby.

1085
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:40,209
Like, she's adamant about it.
Well...

1086
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,078
WOMAN: How's everything going?

1087
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,479
MAN:
Thank you, Hey, you know what...

1088
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:44,380
LITTLE GIRL: Braedan.

1089
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:48,317
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1090
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,620
(breathing heavily)

1091
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:52,755
Braedan?

1092
00:44:57,828 --> 00:45:00,596
Come on, I know you're in here.

1093
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,134
(gasps)

1094
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,770
Braedan?

1095
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,815
(sighs)

1096
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,151
Braedan?

1097
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,356
(breathing heavily)

1098
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,258
Braedan, come out.

1099
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,394
It's not funny anymore.

1100
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,696
(crib creaking)

1101
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,738
(sighs)

1102
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,246
Braedan?

1103
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,751
Get out! (Girl screams)

1104
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,125
(floor creaking)

1105
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,636
(scraping)

1106
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,806
ZACH: I just saw you move.

1107
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:19,609
All right, come on.

1108
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:21,844
Do it again, here.

1109
00:46:21,846 --> 00:46:25,414
Lift this back
so we can see you.

1110
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,917
All right, buddy, let's go.

1111
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,454
(sighs)

1112
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:34,690
You're sleeping
like your lazy mother.

1113
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,260
Yeah.

1114
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:38,895
Lazy bones.

1115
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:40,696
(chuckles)

1116
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,765
It's all right.

1117
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,133
(sighs)

1118
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,434
All right, shh.

1119
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:47,804
(dog barking outside)

1120
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,178
Mav, hey.

1121
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,312
Hey.

1122
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,681
(barking continues)

1123
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,953
(grunts)

1124
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,792
(low rumbling)

1125
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:20,469
I mean, you know, we talked
about the summer courses,

1126
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:24,373
so I figured I'd just get
a couple of classes going

1127
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,876
and then go back
to the full load in the fall.

1128
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,712
You don't want to just
wait till the fall?

1129
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:31,647
(sighs)

1130
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:32,481
No, I don't.

1131
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:35,484
I don't want to just wait
until the fall.

1132
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:37,720
Well, um...

1133
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:40,456
I-I...

1134
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:41,757
Okay, I was just
thinking 'cause...

1135
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:44,894
I know, it's just
that this has come up and I...

1136
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:46,262
No, I know, but the baby...

1137
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:47,464
the baby's coming in-in March.

1138
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:49,265
I know it's not gonna
be easy, but I just...

1139
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:50,766
I don't want to put everything
on hold just to, like...

1140
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:52,501
No, we're not putting everything on...
Well, it is.

1141
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:53,669
I mean, it's not
on hold indefinitely.

1142
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,238
But, like, I got to keep
working, and then...

1143
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,672
Yeah, but if it stops,
if I stop doing it now,

1144
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:57,740
then I'd just feel like

1145
00:47:57,742 --> 00:47:59,375
I'm not gonna be able
to start back up again.

1146
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,676
Like, I'm gonna be
stuck in this house,

1147
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:02,478
and I'm gonna become some housewife.
No, you're not

1148
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,846
gonna be... You're not...
S-Sam, Sam.

1149
00:48:03,848 --> 00:48:05,414
Then I'm gonna turn
into your sister.

1150
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:06,782
I'm gonna be Natalie.
No, you're not...

1151
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:08,484
And I don't want to be her.
Sam, you're not

1152
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:10,052
gonna be Natalie. It's you and me.
Well...

1153
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,021
It's Zach and Sam, all right?
That's what it's turning into.

1154
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:13,422
I know that, but
I don't want to...

1155
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,691
This isn't what I wanted
to begin with, okay?

1156
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:16,959
I didn't want to get pregnant,

1157
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,862
and now I am and I just want
life to go back to normal.

1158
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:20,997
Can you just... Okay, well...

1159
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:23,232
I don't want to talk
about it anymore,

1160
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,301
and my fucking hair
is falling out, okay?

1161
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:28,337
(door slams) Sam, whoa!

1162
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,275
Hey. ZACH: Hi.

1163
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:33,943
Are you excited? Yeah.

1164
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:34,877
Yeah, why?

1165
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,780
'Cause today's
my first Communion.

1166
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:38,881
Oh, shoot, my bad.

1167
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,049
SUZIE: I don't know, you guys.

1168
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:42,652
I went to church like once.
Oh, you look like a princess.

1169
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:44,620
Hey. MAN: Brittany,
give your aunt a hug.

1170
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:45,554
Oh, hi.

1171
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,623
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
MAN: What's wrong, sweetie?

1172
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:48,791
Thank you. How are you feeling?

1173
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:53,095
Well, well, well, you ready
for your big day, young lady?

1174
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,797
You've got the
whole family here.

1175
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:56,299
Yeah. All right.

1176
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:57,934
Hey, hello, Sam.

1177
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,568
Oh, hi. How are you doing?

1178
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,436
I'm doing well.

1179
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,704
How are you? Good. (Coughs)

1180
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:02,471
I'm good, really.

1181
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:03,839
(coughing continues)
Yeah. Are you all right?

1182
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:05,641
So, when is the little one due?

1183
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:06,742
ZACH: Uh, one month.

1184
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,110
One more month.
(coughing continues)

1185
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,045
One month. That's good.

1186
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,012
Are you all right? Yeah.

1187
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:11,814
Hey, do you want a bottle
of water or something?

1188
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:13,416
No, I'll be fine.
One month, that's all.

1189
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:14,583
Home stretch, right? Yeah.

1190
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:16,652
I've just got something in my throat.
Well...

1191
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:18,521
I'm so sorry. Do you... Yeah.

1192
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:19,689
Excuse me.

1193
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:20,756
Sorry. Bye.

1194
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,658
MAN:
We'll see you inside, I guess.

1195
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,761
CHOIR: ♪ Early in the morning

Uh, this-this sacrament...

(coughs)

1221

Did I...

1246
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,117
I mean, did I do that to him?

1247
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,952
What?

1248
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:04,053

ZACH: Come on. SAMANTHA: No.

1288
00:53:58,336 --> 00:53:59,702
ZACH: Yes.

1289
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,003
I'm sorry, but we got to get up.

1290
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:03,806
SAMANTHA: Ugh.

1291
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:05,274
I'm so hungover.

1292
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:06,308
ZACH: Yeah, no kidding.

1293
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,911
SAMANTHA (groans):
Oh, God, get away with that.

1294
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,813
Hey, Mason, it's Zach.
I know, but come on...

1295
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:11,947
Um... I'll get you some water,

1296
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,882
but we got to get up;
We got to catch this plane.

1297
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,351
Um, can-can you come over
for a little bit?

1298
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:17,086
I need to talk to you
about something.

1299
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,921
SAMANTHA: Okay. Thanks.

1300
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:19,755
And-and just, um,

1301
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,423
I-I'll meet you outside,
in front of the house, okay?

1302
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:24,193
I don't want to...
I don't want to bother Sam.

1303
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:26,161
Okay.

1304
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:27,896
(Samantha coughs over video)

1305
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:29,398
How did we get home last night?

1306
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,235
ZACH: I don't know,
the guy in the cab, I think?

1307
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:35,037
ZACH: What the fuck?

1308
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:36,739
SAMANTHA (over video): Stop.

1309
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,374
Not right now.

1310
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,411
(floorboards creaking)

1311
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,653
(creaks)

1312
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,125
He was, like, our cab
driver, on our honeymoon.

1313
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:58,227
So I came home and, like,
looked at all the tapes,

1314
00:54:58,229 --> 00:54:59,728
and there's all this
mystery fucking...

1315
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,829
Look at this. You sure, man?

1316
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:04,833
Maybe it's some weird shit they
do down there to scare tourists.

1317
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:07,069
Whoa, what the fuck?

1318
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:09,305
What the fuck?

1319
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,840
What? It's gone.

1320
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:12,274
I, uh...

1321
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:13,409
What are you talking about?

1322
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:16,845
I-I was j... literally
just looking at this shit

1323
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:17,713
right before you...

1324
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:18,914
I was literally
just looking at this

1325
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:20,215
right before you just came in,

1326
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:21,950
and now it's-it's-it's gone.

1327
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:22,985
It's empty.

1328
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,019
The fucking... It's gone.

1329
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,387
The fucking tape is gone now.

1330
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:26,455
I mean, y-you... Fuck!

1331
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:28,924
Why don't you just take a...
take a breath, man, you know?

1332
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:31,827
No, I don't need to do that.
I don't need to take a...

1333
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,995
Wait, hold on.

1334
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:34,330
What the fuck!

1335
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:39,368
NURSE:
We've been monitoring him 24-7.

1336
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:45,774
ZACH: Uh, do you think
I can talk to him privately?

1337
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:49,812
NURSE: If he needs anything,
we'll be right outside.

1338
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:57,086
ZACH:
Father Thomas, how are you?

1339
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,923
I had a small stroke.

1340
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:01,857
Yeah, we heard.

1341
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:05,260
Are you going to be...
you going to be all right?

1342
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,064
How... how is Sam?

1343
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:11,467
Um, she's... she's okay.

1344
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:13,535
That's actually kind of
why I wanted to...

1345
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,270
I'm glad that she's okay.

1346
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:16,839
Talk to you.

1347
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:19,308
Um, I...

1348
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,711
I saw these weird symbols
on our honeymoon.

1349
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:27,149
And, um, I just don't know
really what they are,

1350
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:28,517
and I thought you might
'cause...

1351
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:30,786
I don't know, I think
everything I've seen

1352
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:33,489
says they're, uh,
religious symbols.

1353
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,391
So, uh, look, um,

1354
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:39,261
there's these ones, and then...

1355
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:41,530
there's that.

1356
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,032
I-I mean, there's a bunch more.

1357
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:45,267
I just started...
I mean, these are

1358
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:46,869
the only ones I've
actually seen in person.

1359
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:49,538
The other ones were all just
kind of linked to it

1360
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,073
when I started looking...

1361
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,875
John... First John.

1362
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:54,910
What?

1363
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:58,347
First John 2:18.

1364
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:02,985
"Children, this is
the last hour.

1365
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:07,222
"You have been told
the antichrist is coming,

1366
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:11,293
"and so there are many
that are coming,

1367
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:15,130
"and that... that is
how we know it is the...

1368
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,098
the last hour."

1369
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,367
Uh, what are you...
what are you talking about?

1370
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,803
These are from early,
early religion.

1371
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:22,971
These are... early religion.

1372
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:24,940
There's a sect, dissident.

1373
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:28,043
They tried to bring the Church
down in its early days,

1374
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:32,247
and they did... they did rites,
and they used those symbols.

1375
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:34,283
They... they painted them

1376
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:36,819
on the point of entry
and on the nest.

1377
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:40,322
The point of conception
and the point of... of birth.

1378
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,224
What? So that he could get in.

1379
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:45,294
And there was ash all around.
There was ash everywhere.

1380
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:47,329
The antichrist is coming.

1381
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:50,432
So will there be many
antichrists,

1382
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:54,970
and that is how we know
it is the last hour.

1383
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:55,904
They will be coming.

1384
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:57,973
Okay, I-I didn't mean
to upset you. I'm really...

1385
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,875
It's the last hour. I'm really sorry.
I, uh...

1386
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:02,311
I don't think you can be here
with that anymore.

1387
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:04,480
You have to go now. O-Okay.

1388
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:06,014
I need you to go now, Zach.
Yeah.

1389
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:07,616
I'm very, very tired,
and I need you to go.

1390
00:58:07,618 --> 00:58:09,151
Okay.
Put that away. Don't-don't...

1391
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,486
Don't use that.
It's gone. I'm sorry.

1392
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:12,454
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

1393
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:13,956
You've upset me. Just go.

1394
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,224
All right. Go.

1395
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:16,892
I hope you feel better.

1396
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:17,559
Now! Go!

1397
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:20,362
(monitor beeping)
Okay. All right.

1398
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,965
ZACH: Nurse? Nurse, can you...

1399
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:25,334
Um, this one's from you, Em...

1400
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:26,268
This is from Emily.

1401
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,104
Can everybody... Thank you.
Oh, yay!

1402
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:31,073
More... more to come.
That's just a taste.

1403
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:31,907
(laughter)

1404
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:33,375
SUZIE: You're going to eat...
Okay, this...

1405
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:34,977
Whose is this one?
This... I don't know.

1406
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,178
That doesn't...
doesn't have a name.

1407
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,581
Does anybody... Does this...
this be-belong to anybody?

1408
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,183
Well... anonymous.

1409
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,284
It's nameless. Anon.

1410
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:45,654
EMILY: You're just getting
gifts from everywhere.

1411
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,525
SUZIE: Sorry,
whoever this is from.

1412
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:50,492
Brooke!

1413
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:53,028
What a sweetheart, Brooke!
(women cheering)

1414
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,196
I didn't read the note,

1415
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,298
so I don't know
what's happening.

1416
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,466
EMILY: That's nice of you.

1417
00:58:57,468 --> 00:58:58,967
SUZIE: Well, you know, keep it.

1418
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,168
NATALIE: Sam, you okay?

1419
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:03,372
(glass clinking in distance)

1420
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:13,348
ZACH: How was...
how was the shower?

1421
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,387
SAMANTHA: Fine.

1422
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:20,956
(clattering in distance)

1423
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,292
Did you hear that?

1424
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,495
(panting)

1425
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:33,001
(running footsteps)

1426
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,040
(car alarm blaring in distance)

1427
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,051
ZACH: Fuck.

1428
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,955
(crickets chirping)

1429
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,565
Every window in the house,
but a lot of them in these...

1430
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:06,268
This is really mostly
where I see it, so I don't...

1431
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,103
what should...
I-I don't know what to do.

1432
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,172
You know, I have
to admit, it is, uh...

1433
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:11,273
it's kind of weird.

1434
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,107
No, it's-it's-it's...

1435
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,475
I mean, someone
was in here, all right?

1436
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:15,444
Someone broke into our house,
and they put this shit...

1437
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:16,578
Wait, hold on a second.
Did, uh...

1438
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,613
But look at the porch. I mean...

1439
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:20,415
OFFICER (muffled, in distance):
I mean, wait a second here.

1440
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:22,184
Was anything stolen? ZACH: No.

1441
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:25,454
No, not tonight, but, um...
But no break-in?

1442
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:26,655
No break-in?
There is a break-in.

1443
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:29,057
Like, someone came in
and put this here,

1444
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,025
so they... broke in.

1445
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:31,426
I mean, they don't have
to physically

1446
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,061
break something, do they?
Well... no, no.

1447
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:35,097
Around the house, there's
no evidence of a break-in.

1448
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,531
ZACH: You know, we usually
lock the doors,

1449
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:38,500
so I really don't know
how anyone got in here.

1450
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:40,736
OFFICER: Sir, there's nothing
I can do right now.

1451
01:00:40,738 --> 01:00:41,637
I can file a report.

1452
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:44,139
And call us if there's
any other problems.

1453
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,641
That's all I can do for now.

1454
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:49,111
Now, you have a nice night.

1455
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,725
(light switch clicks)

1456
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,803
(floorboards creaking)

1457
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:21,243
(sighs)

1458
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:36,058
(birds chirping)

1459
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,392
STEVE: Okay, here we go.
JAY: Nice.

1460
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:38,493
JAY: Here he goes. Watch this.

1461
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:40,195
ASHLEY:
You're going to break your neck.

1462
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,397
JAY: Ah-ah-ah. (Ashley screams)

1463
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:42,497
JAY: Oh, he got it! No way!

1464
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:44,100
ASHLEY (laughing): Wow.
STEVE: Fuck that.

1465
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:45,400
I'm so impressed.
Check this out.

1466
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:46,635
What's up?
JAY: Here, take this.

1467
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:48,870
I got to take a piss. Oh, fuck.

1468
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,272
I'm out.
STEVE: All right. Be careful.

1469
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:51,707
ASHLEY: Taking a break?
Do you want to come?

1470
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:54,743
Will you hold it for me?
No, she doesn't want to.

1471
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:55,744
(laughter)

1472
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:57,746
Since Jay's gone...

1473
01:01:57,748 --> 01:01:59,448
do you want to, like, uh...

1474
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,718
JAY (in distance): Hey, guys,
you got to come see this!

1475
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,086
(Steve sighs)

1476
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:05,554
What is he doing? Fucker.

1477
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,689
STEVE: You're fucking me up.

1478
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:09,524
Look what I caught.

1479
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:11,326
ASHLEY: What is that?

1480
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:12,194
STEVE: Oh, fuck.

1481
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:13,261
ASHLEY: What the fuck?

1482
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:14,362
JAY: Dinner is served, y'all.

1483
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:15,864
ASHLEY: Jay, stop.
STEVE: Oh, what in the fuck?

1484
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:17,666
ASHLEY: That is so gross.
Please don't... don't touch it.

1485
01:02:17,668 --> 01:02:18,767
STEVE:
Jay, what did you do to it?

1486
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,135
ASHLEY: Oh, it fucking stinks!

1487
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:21,503
Hey, take a photo.
ASHLEY: Oh, my God.

1488
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:23,305
I'm taking a video, jackass.
It smells like shit.

1489
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:25,407
STEVE: Hey, touch it
and see if it's still warm.

1490
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:26,608
ASHLEY: Hey.
(Jay and Steve laugh)

1491
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,143
You guys, there's
something over there.

1492
01:02:28,145 --> 01:02:29,745
JAY: Ah!
STEVE: You're so fucked-up.

1493
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:31,313
ASHLEY: Look!

1494
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:32,280
Do y'all see that?

1495
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:34,116
JAY: Shut up. STEVE: What?

1496
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,286
(grunting)

1497
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:44,459
ASHLEY: Wait.

1498
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,263
STEVE: Yo.

1499
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,065
JAY: Hey.

1500
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:51,399
ASHLEY: What is she doing?

1501
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:53,568
STEVE: Hey, Ash, stay back.

1502
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,506
JAY: Ma'am, are you okay?

1503
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:01,276
STEVE:
What the fuck is she doing?

1504
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,512
(squishing)

1505
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,850
JAY: What the fuck?
ASHLEY: Oh, my God.

1506
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:10,185
STEVE: Oh, shit.

1507
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:11,419
ASHLEY:
Uh, ma'am, are you okay?

1508
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:15,357
(Ashley screaming)
JAY: Oh! What the fuck?

1509
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,658
Run!

1510
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,759
(panting)

1511
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:19,294
(yells, groans)

1512
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,462
Steve! Steve!

1513
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,197
STEVE: Come on, man! Get up!

1514
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:23,565
Get up, dude! (Screaming)

1515
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:25,333
STEVE: Oh, what the fuck?

1516
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:27,202
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1517
01:03:27,204 --> 01:03:29,905
(panting, gasping)

1518
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,774
Shit.

1519
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:35,310
(grunting, panting)

1520
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,348
(screaming)

1521
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,416
No!

1522
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:43,819
(screaming): No...!

1523
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,620
(grunts)

1524
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,832
(sniffs)

1525
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,705
Oh, fuck.

1526
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,682
ZACH: Hey, you all right?

1527
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:14,716
Yeah, I'm good.

1528
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:17,786
Actually, I feel
a little bit better.

1529
01:04:17,788 --> 01:04:18,854
Good.

1530
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:22,457
Um, do you need anything?

1531
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,726
No, I'm good. Thanks.

1532
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:26,561
Good.

1533
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,436
(door opens and closes)

1534
01:04:34,438 --> 01:04:37,606
(Samantha humming in distance)

1535
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,714
(clattering)

1536
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,884
ZACH: Sam?

1537
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,721
Sam?

1538
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:55,457
(humming continues in distance)

1539
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,662
(humming grows closer)

1540
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:02,497
Hey.

1541
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,403
Sam.

1542
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,943
What... Hey.

1543
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,516
(humming stops)

1544
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,587
What are you doing?

1545
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,793
Sam.

1546
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,430
Hey.

1547
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,733
What's going on?

1548
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,038
You okay?

1549
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:47,442
Sam, what the fuck is going on?

1550
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,811
(Samantha grunting)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, look, hey.

1551
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:52,547
Don't touch us!

1552
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,884
Sam, it's just me, all right?

1553
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:57,052
It's just me. (Samantha grunts)

1554
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:58,887
Hey. Stop, stop, stop,
stop it, Sam.

1555
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:00,855
Sam, it's okay, it's okay.
(grunting, gasping)

1556
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:02,624
I think you're dreaming.
It's okay.

1557
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,592
Hey, stop. It's okay.

1558
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:05,460
It's okay.

1559
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,363
It's me. No, it's me.
(whimpering)

1560
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:09,965
Yeah. Yeah. Zach?

1561
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,500
I got you. I got you.

1562
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:13,868
It's me.

1563
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,670
It's all right. I'm right here.

1564
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:16,671
See? See, look.

1565
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:18,707
It's just me. It's just me.

1566
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:20,408
Okay?

1567
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,711
You okay?

1568
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:26,348
It's okay. It's okay.
What's happening?

1569
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,916
Nothing.

1570
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:30,585
You just had a dream.

1571
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,556
It's okay.

1572
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,159
That's okay.

1573
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,428
ZACH'S FATHER (over phone):
...home, so please leave us

1574
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:43,898
a message and we'll call
you back as soon as we can.

1575
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,568
Hey, Dad, um, it's Zach.

1576
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,436
Uh, look, I think Sam and I

1577
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:52,640
need to come over and stay
with you and... and Mom.

1578
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:53,742
Sam's really freaking out,

1579
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:56,511
and it's gotten me
really scared and-and...

1580
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:57,612
It-it's just not normal, okay?

1581
01:06:57,614 --> 01:07:00,949
And I know this sounds
really crazy, but I-I swear,

1582
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:03,184
there's been people
watching us or...

1583
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,919
We just don't want
to be alone, okay?

1584
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:06,554
I think we'd just feel
a lot better

1585
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:08,790
if we were...
we were with you and Mom.

1586
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:11,626
So, uh, call me back.

1587
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,631
(sets phone on table)

1588
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,182
(Zach sighs)

1589
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:37,886
Fuck.

1590
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:39,788
(panting)

1591
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,658
(car engine starts)

1592
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,795
Hey. Hey!

1593
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,466
(growling)

1594
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,540
(rustling)

1595
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:01,609
(doorknob rattling)

1596
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:03,445
ZACH: Oh. Hey.

1597
01:08:03,447 --> 01:08:04,112
Hi. Hi.

1598
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:06,014
Uh, thanks for coming over.

1599
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:08,516
Sam's... Sam's upstairs.
She's sleeping.

1600
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:09,484
She feeling okay?

1601
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:11,386
