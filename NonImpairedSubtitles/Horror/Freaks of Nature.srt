- Shut up. Milan Pinache? That's huge.
- (GIGGLES)

Oh, my God. Look at her face.
She's totally going to fuck him.

159
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:44,877
Yeah, you better jimmy up.

160
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:48,489
If you actually knew him,
you'd realize Milan's really sweet.

- Oh, shit!

168
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,074
- What?
- Rick's here.

169
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,185
- Yeah, he's sponsoring the team this year.

Come on, man.

won't even recognize me.

Congratulations.

Hey! I know you.
You're, uh, Peg Parker's boy.

177
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,287
- Bug? Bag? Tag?
- My name's Dag.

178
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,039
- Doug. Yes, right.
- Dag.

179
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,626
Your mom was such a spark plug.
Peg Parker. What's she up to nowadays?

180
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,794
Oh, she's good. She's
just around the house.

181
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,463
Oh, how long has she been unemployed?

182
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,940
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Um, since she left the factory.

183
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,943
And why did she leave the factory again?
Wait, wait, I think I have the answer.

184
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,346
- Because I fired her.
- Yeah. You fired her.

185
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:54,847
She shouldn't have tried
to unionize my zombies.

186
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,307
- Yeah, can I get a uniform?
- That's the whole idea.

187
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,407
- Can I get a fucking uniform?
- (SHOUTING) Parker!

188
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,245
That was uncalled for.

00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,266
Come here, son. I want to talk to you.

I understand.

193
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,680
You know, I remember what it was like
to be in high school. It's tough.

194
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:18,846
Especially for a big, tall,
freaky motherfucker like you.

195
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,307
- I'm fine with it.
- Okay, okay.

196
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,917
- I like my body.
- All right.

197
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,502
Let me help you out. A word of advice.

198
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,338
Stop concentrating on the negative.
All right?

199
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,275
Look at the bright side.
You get to spend more time with your mom.

200
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,491
And I have a new secretary
who I have sex with.

201
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,119
- With my penis.
- (DAG GRUNTS)

with their penises.

RICK: Seeing as how I paid for this field,

204
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,447
Coach Pulcifer asked me to come down
here today and say a few words,

205
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,466
so here I am.

206
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:01,138
I want you to look into the eyes of the boy
sitting next to you. Go ahead, do it.

207
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,791
And repeat after me.

00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,352
"You are not my teammate."

"and must be destroyed."

00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,391
You are my enemy and must be destroyed!

Chill, dude.

216

Winners and losers, boys.
That's what makes America great.

217
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,817
Look at me. When I first came to Dillford,
the meat plant was underperforming

218
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:34,171
and I drove an '04 Ford Taurus.

219
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:40,761
But now the riblet is the crown jewel
of the Malphasta Corporation

220
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:45,391
- and I drive a red Porsche Boxster.
- Whoo!

221
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:50,004
How? I fired the dead weight
and brought in cheap zombie labor.

222
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:53,190
Why? Because I came here to win.

223
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,301
Out of the 25 boys seated here today

224
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:59,697
23 of you will go on to lead
completely inconsequential lives.

225
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,807
For the other two boys,
it'll be a different journey.

226
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,910
One of them will just drop dead
for no reason. Poof. Nobody knows why.

Heart attack, aneurysm,

Bang, gone.

229
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,543
But the other boy,
whoever that chosen boy is,

230
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,589
he will be a shining fucking star like me.

00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,807
- Prenatal scoliosis.
- So what?

309
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,226
- Diabetes.
- Doesn't matter.

310
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,145
Pain in the ankles.

311
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,147
Yeah, that would be hard
for sports and whatnot, yeah.

312
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,999
- Also, puff tongue!
- Puff tongue?

313
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,400
- Yeah, puff tongue.
- Puff tongue?

314
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,610
- Puff tongue.
- Pfft.

315
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,612
Oh, oh, oh. How terrible.

316
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,923
Just think of all those little kids
with puffy tongues. What?

317
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,829
If this TXP stuff was really so unhealthy

318
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,457
they wouldn't put it in the riblets,
now would they?

319
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,018
It's what Saturn is made of.
Do you know Saturn?

320
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,187
I know Saturn, a classy economy car.

321
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:27,441
I'm so sorry about the F, honey.
You'll get them next time.

322
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:30,402
There's no next time. Do you know
what an F does to my transcript?

323
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,570
No.

324
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,698
- I can kiss my scholarship goodbye.
- You can kiss college goodbye.

325
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,141
What?

326
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,936
I'm sorry, but let's cut the shit, people.
We're in deep trouble here.

327
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,956
Do you have any idea
how much this crapola costs?

328
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,583
- Doesn't insurance cover that?
- Insurance is for suckers, Ned.

329
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,945
From now on, when you're not in school,
I'm going to need you down at the car lot.

330
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:50,197
Dad, dickbag gets to sell Hyundais
and I don't?

331
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,091
Oh, I think that's a fantastic idea.

332
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,636
- I'm going to my room.
- This one.

333
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,395
Why do you think he left the room?
It's because he doesn't want to talk.

334
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,894
Do you got a minute?

335
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:13,737
Ned, listen, I know that at times it seems
like it's awkward between you and I.

336
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,741
I'm excited that the two of us are going
to get to spend more time together.

337
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,327
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, he does.

338
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,479
Yeah. I do. I really do.

339
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,898
I mean, if you want,
you can start coming to competitions.

340
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,359
There's Mathletes on Saturday
and then there's Odyssey of the Mind.

341
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,862
And there's father-son NASA,
which I think that you would really like.

342
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,465
No, no, no. You're overthinking this.
You overthink everything.

343
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,509
Maybe just the father-son NASA.
You don't have to...

344
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,829
Look, right now
I need you down at the lot.

345
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,748
With the extra hours, if we're lucky

346
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,433
maybe Jr.'s dream of making the pros
still has a chance.

347
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,269
What about my dreams?

348
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,857
What dreams?

349
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,151
Uh, well, for starters,
I want to be an engineer someday.

350
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:57,014
Son, how many times do we have to
go over this? No one rides trains anymore!

351
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,932
You gotta stop living in the clouds
and get real.

352
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,828
If it's not the lot, you can work at the riblet
plant, be a meat bleacher like your mom.

353
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,106
I did 10 years on the ammonia hose
and I regret nothing.

354
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:10,794
I don't want to work the ammonia hose
or be a stupid freaking Hyundai salesman.

355
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,072
Whoa! Slow your roll, tiger.
Leave the Hyundai Corporation out of this.

356
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,509
Stop telling me to slow my roll!
Chaz Jr. doesn't have to slow his roll!

357
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,787
How come I'm the only one around here
who has to slow his roll?

358
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,848
Listen, I understand we're all upset
about Chaz Jr.

359
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,683
- Fuck Chaz Jr.
- Fuck Chaz Jr.?

360
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,686
- Yeah. Fuck Chaz Jr.
- Nobody fucks Chaz Jr.!

361
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,022
MRS. MOSELY: Ned, don't go! Chaz!

362
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,692
Don't point your finger at us!
Point it at your old friend, Dag!

363
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:37,487
He's the one who threw that pitch!
He's the one who ruined our lives!

364
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,483
Hmm. Mmm.

365
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,919
I just love your waterbed. (CHUCKLES)

366
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,171
It's the best.

367
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,592
- You know, I'm surprised you're still around.
- What do you mean?

368
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,887
I mean that stunt you pulled today
on the baseball field.

369
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,017
We were all set to win State
and Chaz Jr. was going to get scouted.

370
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,919
Yeah.

371
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,021
What were you thinking?

372
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,007
I don't know. I guess...

373
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,401
I sort of... I wanted to...

374
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:19,863
Like, impress you.

375
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,449
- Really?
- Yeah.

376
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,868
That's so sweet.

377
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,540
- Why would you want to impress me?
- What?

378
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:36,880
I said, why would you want to impress me?

379
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,593
Lorelei,

380
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,763
I think I might be in love with you.

381
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,058
(LAUGHS)

382
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:53,397
Dag, you are the weirdest,
funniest boy I know.

383
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,883
I don't know what I would do without you.

384
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,484
- (GIGGLES)

(GROANS)

386
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,950
- Sweetheart, you know I'm saving myself.
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

387
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,661
DAG: Be right there.

388
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,788
Are you leaving?

389
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,582
Yeah, all this talking about sex
is making me really hungry. So...

390
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,027
- Yeah. Me, too.
- I'm going to go to Burger King.

391
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,236
Yeah, a Whopper sounds good.

392
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,529
- Right?
- Yeah, let's do it.

393
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:18,989
- I'll smell you later.
- Okay.

394
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,340
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

395
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,675
Yeah?

396
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:24,761
Ah...

397
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,415
Uh...

Oh. (CLEARS THROAT)

(CLEARS THROAT)

400
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:42,362
Dag, your mother and I
don't want to encourage pot smoking.

401
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:46,491
But we want you to know that

402
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,286
we completely understand it.

403
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,897
- It's actually not my weed.
- Very good.

404
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,957
- Okay. Well, Dag...
- We get it.

405
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,570
That's what we're saying.
It's Lorelei's and if it wasn't

406
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,614
well, whatever, whatever, whatever.

407
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,175
Okay, thank you for being
so understanding,

408
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,219
but in this case
you're not understanding correctly.

409
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:10,707
Okay. Your mother and I understand
what you're saying.

410
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:14,144
It's hard to express
how much we understand

411
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,021
on a daily basis.

412
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:21,468
Really. Like, even 15 minutes ago,
we totally understood.

413
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,694
- We got it.
- Really?

414
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,721
I didn't know that you
understood that much.

415
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,656
- (COUGHS) Twice a day, at least.
- PEG: Well, whenever.

416
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,476
We're on an understanding plane.

417
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,645
- Look at that. Look at that.
- It's like an ice skating rink.

418
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,664
- Look at this. I'm getting trails.
- PEG: Wow.

419
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:38,735
Mom, is there anything else
you wanted to talk about?

420
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,045
- No.
- No.

421
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,279
Oh. (CLEARS THROAT)

422
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,424
We wanted to talk to you
about some of the changes

423
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:47,219
that happen to your body as you get older.

424
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,664
- Don't do that talk.
- The thing is, the men of the Parker clan...

425
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:54,101
Um, well, we change relatively slowly.

426
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:58,522
But, now don't be frightened,
when the change comes, it is...

427
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,008
- Enormous.
- Enormous.

428
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:02,467
No, no, no.

429
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,303
A lot of girls will be frightened.

430
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:09,016
In fact, it took me a while
to get used to it, but it's big.

431
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,451
- It's a big change.
- Wow. And it's...

- (MAKES EXPLOSION SOUND)
- Whoomp, there it is.

No, no. I can't talk right now with you.

434
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:19,292
I'm sorry. You know,
everything's in order. So...

435
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,919
- That's fine.
- PEG: We just wanted to talk about it.

436
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,089
- Later, alligator.
- Okay. Bye, Dad.

We'll just leave you to

Sure. Lunch.

to help me out today. Thanks.

that you had whispered to any boobs
or any titties?

828
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:38,989
Because we had to whisper downstairs and
everybody assumed there would be titties

829
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,926
because you are the girl and I'm the guy
and usually the girl takes her titties out
