Translated by mrickx, Awe and KH

3
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:33,330
Enjoy it! :-)

4
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:36,870
Who's there?

5
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:42,995
Polecat!

6
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:15,103
"Valerie, forgive me."

7
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:24,430
Where are her earrings ?

8
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,818
Speak!

9
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,580
I lost them, constable.

10
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:28,693
- You lie, Orlik.
- No, I don't.

11
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,823
You can't avoid punishment, 
I will torture you with water.

12
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:37,751
Orlik!

13
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:39,309
Bend down!

14
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,270
I will jump on your back.

15
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:49,779
Hurry up!

16
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,107
Scallywag.

17
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,223
Grandmom, have the actors arrived ?

18
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,515
You should be more concerned that
the missionaries are coming.

19
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:21,999
When?

20
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:24,861
Today or tomorrow.

21
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:27,569
One of them will be living with us.

22
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:33,268
You are not playing with that earring, are you ?

23
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:36,596
I'm not a child anymore, grandmom.

24
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:39,972
Just tonight, you know.

25
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:51,850
At 13 ... as your mother.

26
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:56,908
I'm warning you!

27
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,743
Get rid of that ear-rings.

28
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,125
Your mother put them away on the day 
when she entered the nunnery.

29
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:07,900
Your father was a bishop.

30
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:11,453
As you know, both are now in heaven.

31
00:08:12,172 --> 00:08:14,602
Is there some secret in these earrings?

32
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:17,936
Oh no.

33
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:22,421
I got them at this house's auction from some constable.

34
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,088
Did you know him?

35
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:44,464
Grandmom, the actors have arrived.

36
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:47,207
But it's just a weding.

37
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:50,171
Hedvika is marrying.

38
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:07,936
Poor Hedvika.

39
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:11,289
Why?

40
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:14,076
She will be a rich farmer's wife.

41
00:09:39,388 --> 00:09:39,923
Grandmom! 

42
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:41,929
Grandmom, monster!

43
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:54,233
This can't be him.

44
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:56,470
He'd died already.

45
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:59,115
Who are you talking about, grandmom?

46
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:05,697
Go and repeat your piano fingering.

47
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,976
O.K. grandmom.

48
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:40,715
"Beautiful maiden.

49
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:47,276
It was me who stole your earrings and 
brought them back in your hands again.

50
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:52,727
My uncle, the constable, desires them.

51
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,447
He killed my dad and mom and I'm afraid for your destiny.

52
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,550
Today will be in church...

53
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,750
...today will be in church sermon for maidens.

54
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:13,249
Please leave your dress in summer-house so that 
in disguise I could exchange a few words with you.

55
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:15,059
Your unhappy Orlik."

56
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,124
Valerie?

57
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:20,722
Valerie?

58
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:24,002
Where are you my child?

59
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,416
Valerie?!

60
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,336
Valerie?

61
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:35,402
It's time to dress for vesper.

62
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:40,598
Grandmom, may I take with me a leaf of rosemary?

63
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:29,580
Me, God's servant, missionary.

64
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:37,190
I came between you, maidens, 
to give you the knowledge and God's vow.

65
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:41,231
Oh maiden, do you know what you are?

66
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,272
You are an alabaster handshake.

67
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:50,418
You are an uncut pomegranate.

68
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:56,893
You are the boat of a leaf and an opening rosebud.

69
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:07,555
Rough hand touching your breast would
leave an indelible fingerprint.

70
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:12,215
But I'm with you, my maiden.

71
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:17,052
In guardian angel's place I bow to you.

72
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:28,452
And I bless with this wine, your mouth, your breast, your lap.

73
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,109
Amen.

74
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:35,693
Amen.

75
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:44,969
Orlik?

76
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,007
Orlik?

77
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:49,997
Orlik?

78
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:29,338
Orlik!

79
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,328
Orlik?

80
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,771
Valerie, is that you?

81
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:00,446
The monster tortured me hard.

82
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:04,781
Valerie, I want to give you advice.

83
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:08,208
- We are on square.
- I'm sorry.

84
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:10,080
Don't look.

85
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:13,402
Yet?

86
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:14,466
Yet!

87
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:16,301
I'm here.

88
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:18,589
Firstly :

89
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:25,140
Where is the public poor-house, dear child?

90
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:28,419
There, reverend sir.

91
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:34,367
You do act from mercy?

92
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:37,459
Or don't you like me?

93
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,394
No reverend sir.

94
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,138
Dear me! I please you.

95
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:54,387
You enter first.

96
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,655
Go on, don't worry.

97
00:19:09,702 --> 00:19:10,493
Please.

98
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:16,028
This is my kingdom.

99
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:42,412
Valerie!

100
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:47,291
Come!

101
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:50,067
Closer.

102
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:55,937
Come closer.

103
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,439
Look.

104
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:03,811
Oh no!

105
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:12,481
I know that I don't appeal to you anymore, my Gracian.

106
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,654
Only five years ago, when you were here last time...

107
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,082
...but now!

108
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:27,139
Go away!

109
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:30,430
I will lash myself.

110
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:34,065
- Grandmom!
- Look!

111
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:52,912
It's only a dream.

112
00:20:56,112 --> 00:21:00,225
I'm asleep and everything is a dream.

113
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:13,997
Did he hurt you ?

114
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:15,569
No.

115
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,942
He wants you to love him.

116
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:23,906
How could I love him when I am affraid of him?

117
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:25,867
That's just it.

118
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:32,485
Orlik?

119
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:34,301
Orlik!?

120
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,070
I'm waiting for you, constable.

121
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,326
Damned broker.

122
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:41,965
Hands up, burglar, or I will shoot!

123
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:46,401
Elsa, it's me.

124
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,533
Don't you remember me?

125
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:54,841
Richard.

126
00:21:57,185 --> 00:22:01,019
I haven't heard my name for ages.

127
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:09,114
Why did you come Richard?

128
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,857
I missed you so much.

129
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:23,151
I had never loved another man from that time you seduced me and left.

130
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:26,216
I'm really sorry about that.

131
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:34,323
See how old you are, Elsa!

132
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,328
Then you were 17.

133
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,179
What would I give to become younger like you. 

134
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:43,701
Richard, tell me your secret.

135
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:46,985
I will give you everyting you want.

136
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,760
Give me back this house, Elsa!

137
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:01,503
This means to rob Valerie!? 

138
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,116
You are capable of much worse deeds!

139
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:14,563
Yes, I will.

140
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:19,738
Well, let's write a small business agreement.

141
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:24,904
You will be young and beautiful again.

142
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:29,725
It will happen tonight, on the stingy farmer's wedding night.

143
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,109
You are devil!

144
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,527
This pearl will save you.

145
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,759
Orlik, where is Valerie?

146
00:23:40,422 --> 00:23:42,120
- I kidnapped her.
- Where?

147
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:44,433
To the church tower.

148
00:23:45,814 --> 00:23:49,972
- Au!
- Come to me, ninny! You will take me there.

149
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:54,920
Pray.

150
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:08,104
Do you hear?

151
00:25:14,873 --> 00:25:18,235
For the third time bells had tolled and went quiet again.

152
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:26,199
The food is excelent.

153
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:37,437
One enjoys any meal, especially after things 
I've seen when I was with the cannibals.

154
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,056
There we saved a young black girl.

155
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:45,577
- She was very beautiful.
- What happened to her, reverend?

156
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:53,585
We took her to our tent and 
tried to convert her to our faith.

157
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:57,611
She showed a great talent.

158
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:00,325
And did she become really a nun? 

159
00:26:01,756 --> 00:26:02,596
Unfortunately no.

160
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,436
- We lost her in a certain french port.
- Martha, where is wine?

161
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:11,486
One day I will tell you what happened to her.

162
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:19,054
She fell into bad indecency and 
committed a sin against 6th commandment.

163
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:24,467
- I will give you advice in that respect, dear child.
- Thank you, reverend.

164
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,363
Your father bishop was a gentleman.

165
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:37,400
He fainted during bride's confession and 
all the beautiful women adored him. 

166
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:39,849
I will tell you more sometime.

167
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,592
And how many children did he have?

168
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:47,610
You and a boy called Orlik.

169
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:49,502
Orlik!?

170
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:52,002
What happened?

171
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:56,454
I've got a headache. May I go and lie down?

172
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:58,549
Dinner is still not over.

173
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,912
Excuse me.

174
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,855
Will you touch the glasses with us?

175
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:06,940
I have never drunk wine.

176
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:08,633
Make an exception today.

177
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:17,322
In a memory of dead bishop.

178
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:27,680
Orlik?

179
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:32,875
Orlik?

180
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:14,543
I want to talk to you my child.

181
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:16,637
Now reverend?

182
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:19,469
There is no better time for contemplation.

183
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:22,890
How beautiful breasts you have.

184
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:25,899
Go away reverend.

185
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:32,343
What I want from you is sweet.

186
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:39,939
You are so beautiful!

187
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,292
- You are so gorgeous!
- Go away.

188
00:28:46,678 --> 00:28:48,271
You are so fascinating!

189
00:28:49,716 --> 00:28:53,049
I will resist you, you coward. 
You will responsible for my death.

190
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:06,882
What have you done?

191
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:05,224
Signed.

192
00:30:14,736 --> 00:30:16,830
My house is again yours.

193
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:23,688
And now we will wait till midnight.

194
00:30:26,578 --> 00:30:28,200
At the wedding bed.

195
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:14,080
Come, it's time.

196
00:31:18,563 --> 00:31:20,112
Pity of my hopes.

197
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,748
Come, it's time.

198
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,257
I'm so old.

199
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:48,619
I will be too.

200
00:32:23,497 --> 00:32:25,916
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

201
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,647
Not one drop of blood. 

202
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,275
Don't cry.

203
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:57,307
You look old when you cry.

204
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,349
Valerie?

205
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:22,667
Valerie?

206
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:28,349
Orlik!

207
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:40,152
Orlik.

208
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:43,076
Valerie!

209
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:53,208
Please.

210
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:00,890
- Don't look that way.
- What way?

211
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:02,527
Kneel down!

212
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:07,615
Kneel down!

213
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:14,928
- Isn't it too cold?
- No.

214
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:24,118
I'm like blindman.

215
00:34:25,135 --> 00:34:27,347
There is a free guest room in our house.

216
00:34:28,144 --> 00:34:29,781
You will relax there.

217
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,276
He knocked me down from the tower, toad.

218
00:34:34,249 --> 00:34:36,152
The bell clapper saved me.

219
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:40,311
I heard the strange toll.

220
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:44,449
I prayed for you.

221
00:34:52,212 --> 00:34:54,159
Plague is our best friend.

222
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,316
If my uncle don't get enough fresh blood. 

223
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:00,751
- He will die of a terrible death.
- You are cruel

224
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:03,361
He is 100 years overdue for death.

225
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:05,131
The monster.

226
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:17,298
It's nothing, just a hanged man.

227
00:35:29,022 --> 00:35:30,184
Where are we?

228
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:32,429
Still under your house.

229
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:34,818
I'm afraid.

230
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,897
Be brave!

231
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:39,472
Who is in these coffins?

232
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,445
Victims from which the polecat sucked blood. 
Look here.

233
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:52,117
Grandmom!

234
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:54,904
Valerie!

235
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:25,570
Excuse me, I was't suitably dressed.

236
00:36:28,669 --> 00:36:30,142
This is your room.

237
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:37,763
I thought that the room was free.

238
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,716
I came on the night coach.

239
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:43,478
Do you recognize me, don't you?

240
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:46,193
I'm your remote cousin. 

241
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:48,098
Call me Elsa.

242
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:50,194
Valerie.

243
00:36:52,147 --> 00:36:55,195
And this is...
...this is my brother.

244
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:57,023
Orlik.

245
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,387
I have settled in your room as you can see.

246
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,580
I give it up.

247
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:09,245
No, no, you will give me another one.

248
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:12,308
I will talk to grandmother about it.

249
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:15,770
Your grandmother had left, dear child.

250
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:18,438
Without farewell?

251
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,724
Old people have strange habits.

252
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:30,297
- I hope you will allow me to take her room.
- With pleasure.

253
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:33,821
This room is yours.

254
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:39,727
Please.

255
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:57,826
- I'd love to ride a horse.
- I'll lend you mine.

256
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:03,018
I am very tired, I will go to bed.

257
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:12,108
- Don't you recognize me, Valerie?
- No.

258
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:21,498
You are not afraid of me, are you?

259
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:31,452
I'm just joking, my dear.
We really meet for first time. 

260
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:19,432
My earrings.

261
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,897
Your sister hasn't returned?

262
00:40:54,737 --> 00:40:56,596
Where is Valerie? Do you know?

263
00:40:58,134 --> 00:41:02,878
- You are sweet when you are angry.
- Where is Valerie!?

264
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,674
I will tell you on one condition...

265
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:12,346
...that you will love me.

266
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,492
Never!

267
00:41:22,787 --> 00:41:23,805
Go away sir.

268
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:25,852
No.

269
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,804
I'm not your guest. You go!

270
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,459
You will regret that!

271
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:24,329
You will have glorious death.

272
00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:28,886
Die as maiden! Die!

273
00:42:30,169 --> 00:42:33,343
Orlik!? Orlik!? Orlik!? 

274
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:48,032
Good night my dark haired girl, good night and sweet dreams.

275
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:58,617
When you wake up don't reveal the secret. 

276
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,183
Valerie you are saved.

277
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,440
I heard everything.

278
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:05,608
My cousin loves you.

279
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,483
- Cousin?
- I know.

280
00:43:09,058 --> 00:43:10,165
It's grandmom.

281
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:12,819
She stole my earrings. 

282
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:14,854
But empty.

283
00:43:16,447 --> 00:43:18,217
There is their mystery.

284
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:23,128
They will save you from danger of death.

285
00:43:23,924 --> 00:43:25,163
Beware of polecat!

286
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:27,519
Where is he?

287
00:43:28,393 --> 00:43:29,425
He's dying.

288
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,147
Wretch.

289
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:34,188
You were sold on his charm.

290
00:43:36,622 --> 00:43:37,587
Valerie.

291
00:43:38,524 --> 00:43:39,680
I love you.

292
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:42,683
You can't!

293
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:44,674
- We are brother and sister.
- But...

294
00:43:44,778 --> 00:43:47,053
- We have the same father.
- ...that's not not true.

295
00:43:47,284 --> 00:43:49,010
Valerie, come back.

296
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,947
Valerie, my father is polecat!

297
00:44:36,748 --> 00:44:43,823
Yea and nay, yea and nay, yea!

298
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,370
I'm dying.

299
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,215
I'm dying.

300
00:45:28,866 --> 00:45:31,265
Now you can see what old age means.

301
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:33,998
Valerie? Valerie?

302
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:35,767
You are wasting your time.

303
00:45:37,518 --> 00:45:38,687
Valerie's dying.

304
00:45:40,192 --> 00:45:42,846
I sacrificed her for my youth. 

305
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,926
You are as lost as I'm.

306
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,774
You will fall into the same spasms.

307
00:45:54,482 --> 00:45:58,552
Only your granddaughter could save us both.

308
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:00,920
She has my blood.

309
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:03,375
How is that?

310
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:05,423
Her father was not the bishop? 

311
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:08,950
I was bishop!

312
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,693
I'm her father.

313
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,197
You lie.

314
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,002
Drink!

315
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,267
- Drink!
- No!

316
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:22,576
- First tell me how to extend my youth.
- Save Valerie!

317
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:28,328
Our salvation is in her blood.

318
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,435
Valerie.

319
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,832
Damned Valerie.

320
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:42,397
It's me.

321
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,113
Father!

322
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,370
My child!

323
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,546
Take this.

324
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,660
No i detest.

325
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:07,925
I'm a human again and I have to die.

326
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:10,358
No, you won't die.

327
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,408
You saved me.

328
00:47:44,425 --> 00:47:45,443
Dad.

329
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:55,044
- Let me go! I please you.
- I'm again the monster.

330
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:58,989
Let me go!

331
00:48:01,149 --> 00:48:02,325
Leave me alone!

332
00:48:03,844 --> 00:48:05,972
No! No! No!

333
00:49:07,513 --> 00:49:09,150
Gracian!

334
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:12,619
My Gracian!

335
00:49:18,176 --> 00:49:19,415
Gracian!

336
00:49:22,556 --> 00:49:25,166
Your lover sleeps like a log.

337
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,440
Gracian.

338
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:35,475
Poor Gracian.

339
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:40,917
I have a certain plan, Elsa.

340
00:49:42,111 --> 00:49:43,790
I need Orlik's heart.

341
00:49:46,536 --> 00:49:48,084
Do you want to kill Orlik?

342
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:51,358
His heart will reanimate my daughter 
and give her eternal youth.

343
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:55,428
Richard, transplant Orlik's heart into my chest.

344
00:49:55,694 --> 00:49:57,729
Are you going to betray Valerie?

345
00:49:59,985 --> 00:50:03,392
Richard, you will do it.

346
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:09,910
With bleeding heart.

347
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,889
Orlik?

348
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:19,319
Orlik?

349
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:21,251
Why did i leave you.

350
00:50:42,444 --> 00:50:43,299
Help!

351
00:50:43,771 --> 00:50:44,685
Help!

352
00:50:44,965 --> 00:50:46,588
Why do you show your face to me, Valerie? 

353
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:50,982
Don't worry, I'm not dead and you are neither.

354
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,124
Come on, I will show you the way out.

355
00:51:01,306 --> 00:51:03,016
Parsonage is on the opposite side, reverend.

356
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:07,072
Reprobate, you tempted me to commint a sin.

357
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:09,476
You will see!

358
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,657
"Valerie.

359
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:21,510
Valerie.

360
00:51:22,086 --> 00:51:23,336
I'm saying good bye.

361
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:28,147
You have left me and the monster had disgraced your mouth.

362
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:31,237
We could have been so happy together but it's too late now.

363
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:33,866
Believe Valerie.

364
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:37,428
Polecat is not your and mine Father.

365
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,845
You extened his life.

366
00:51:41,906 --> 00:51:45,446
I wanted be your guardian, friend and husband but it's too late.

367
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:48,808
Farewell Valerie, your Orlik.

368
00:51:50,136 --> 00:51:51,085
Valerie?

369
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,958
Valerie, what happend to you?

370
00:51:53,365 --> 00:51:54,162
Come.

371
00:51:54,604 --> 00:51:55,502
Hedvika.

372
00:52:08,983 --> 00:52:09,780
Hedvika?

373
00:52:11,372 --> 00:52:13,781
Hedvika, what happend to you? Hedvika?

374
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:17,876
I'm fading from wedding.

375
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:20,884
- Eat strong soups.
- No.

376
00:52:21,152 --> 00:52:22,662
No. No. No.

377
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:26,282
I'm under the spell of a vampire.

378
00:52:40,926 --> 00:52:41,855
Valerie?

379
00:52:43,891 --> 00:52:45,395
See my shoulder.

380
00:52:50,394 --> 00:52:51,279
Does it hurt?

381
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:53,447
Oh no. No.

382
00:52:53,978 --> 00:52:55,576
Do you see anything on my lips?

383
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:58,125
- No, why?
- Are not they stained?

384
00:52:59,818 --> 00:53:01,543
You ate fruits, didn't you?

385
00:53:08,926 --> 00:53:11,675
I'm not afraid of anything when you are with me.

386
00:53:13,622 --> 00:53:14,905
I'm so happy.

387
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,604
I have never had a real friend.

388
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:46,002
Valerie?

389
00:53:47,335 --> 00:53:49,104
Valerie, I'm saved!

390
00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:51,980
- Hedvika.
- See!

391
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,661
The stain is gone.

392
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:03,218
- Your kisses gave me back my health.
- You are so beautiful.

393
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:08,483
There lives a witch among you! 

394
00:54:09,899 --> 00:54:12,243
She tortured me with sinful words.

395
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,004
She rubbed her slick hips against me. 

396
00:54:16,997 --> 00:54:20,438
Whe she found that I could resist her seducements. 

397
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:22,906
She threw a noose round my neck. 

398
00:54:24,587 --> 00:54:28,171
I thank God that I'd escaped with my life.

399
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,807
But the witch is hidden among you.

400
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,639
In name of God give her in!

401
00:54:38,037 --> 00:54:41,399
- She deserves to be burned to death.
- That's lie! Don't believe him.

402
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:44,939
It's her! The witch!

403
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,593
Don't believe him! He is lying, I swear.

404
00:54:47,859 --> 00:54:49,407
Apage satanas!

405
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,168
Catch her! On the pyre with her!

406
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,865
Plead guilty! You are a witch!

407
00:55:17,997 --> 00:55:19,404
Lier, firer.

408
00:55:19,935 --> 00:55:21,175
Expiate.

409
00:55:26,314 --> 00:55:28,031
Moustached comedian.

410
00:56:33,334 --> 00:56:34,320
Orlik.

411
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:36,298
Why have you forsaken me?

412
00:58:10,314 --> 00:58:11,774
Come here, bitches!

413
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:18,540
Have you ever been beaten?

414
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:34,647
Beast!

415
00:58:59,733 --> 00:59:01,220
Drink deep!

416
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:02,786
Richard.

417
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:38,667
Disappeared!

418
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:45,418
Polecat!!!!

419
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:52,508
I wish all the spells went away.

420
01:02:11,835 --> 01:02:12,583
Grandmom.

421
01:02:17,941 --> 01:02:19,091
When did you come back?

422
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,432
Where from, my child, I was in church.

423
01:02:30,904 --> 01:02:32,718
Have the missionaries gone yet?

424
01:02:37,983 --> 01:02:39,399
Which missionaries?

425
01:02:41,168 --> 01:02:42,451
What happend to you child?

426
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:49,253
Nothing, grandmom.

427
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,052
Grandmom?

428
01:03:10,711 --> 01:03:12,448
There is an unknown boy.

429
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:19,217
It's only a actor, 
who wander around the town. 

430
01:03:43,816 --> 01:03:45,409
"My dear.

431
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:47,931
Don't go to the theater.

432
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,320
Let

433
01:03:51,913 --> 01:03:54,567
right away

434
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,235
harness the horses

435
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,250
and go to the blue lake.

436
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:10,520
Don't shoot for god's sake!

437
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:25,714
Miss!

438
01:04:26,024 --> 01:04:28,855
Miss, your grandmom is dying!

439
01:04:32,572 --> 01:04:33,589
Grandmom!

440
01:04:34,474 --> 01:04:36,332
Dear grandmom, how do you feel?

441
01:04:41,668 --> 01:04:42,855
Grandmom.

442
01:04:51,098 --> 01:04:52,055
Grandmom.

443
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:53,258
Mirror.

444
01:05:10,024 --> 01:05:12,169
Coach without a driver went out from court.

445
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,124
This is a good sign.

446
01:05:19,011 --> 01:05:21,858
I never had a courage to tell you the truth.

447
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,963
Your mother loved certain young hunter.

448
01:05:37,874 --> 01:05:39,776
And gave birth to his two children.

449
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,183
Boy and girl.

450
01:05:46,457 --> 01:05:50,616
But, Richard, my lover told me that those children were his.

451
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:53,359
And I, from jealousy, 

452
01:05:53,757 --> 01:05:55,851
drove out your mother from the house.

453
01:05:57,252 --> 01:05:58,978
I kept the girl.

454
01:05:59,818 --> 01:06:00,703
That's you.

455
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:04,331
Orlik was kidnapped by Richard 
and ended up in an unknown place.

456
01:06:05,482 --> 01:06:07,561
I drove out your mother with these words.

457
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:09,729
"I will only take you in

458
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:13,047
when the horses bring you back."

459
01:06:13,401 --> 01:06:15,126
My mother is still alive?

460
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:23,400
Grandmom!

461
01:06:52,215 --> 01:06:53,441
Mom!

462
01:06:54,016 --> 01:06:55,299
My child!

463
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,687
This is your father, my dear.

464
01:07:12,686 --> 01:07:15,297
I know your face from somewhere, father.

465
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:18,217
You probably remember it from babyhood.

466
01:07:32,593 --> 01:07:34,719
Is this all real, it's not a dream?

467
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:43,700
I wish your grandmother had forgiven me.

468
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:18,000
