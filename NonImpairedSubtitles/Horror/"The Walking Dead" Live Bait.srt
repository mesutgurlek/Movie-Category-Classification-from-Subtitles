00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:19,025
Here. Here.

166
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:23,780
<i>( footsteps )</i>

167
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:26,883
- <i>( floorboards creak )</i>
<i>- Hey. You hear them?</i>

168
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:28,651
Yeah.

169
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:31,120
Yeah.

170
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:33,907
Get my legs, friend?

171
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,878
Tara's been up there
a bunch of times

172
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,197
blasting them bastards
to pieces.

173
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,134
She says they just
keep getting back up.

174
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:48,338
I told her no more.

175
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,974
Can't afford to waste
her bullets.

176
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:54,377
( coughs )

177
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:57,546
You got kids?

178
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:01,067
No.

179
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:03,386
When my girls were born,

180
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:06,739
that's when I finally figured
out what it was to be a man.

181
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,025
You know, a real man.

182
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,743
( coughs )

183
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,162
You protect them,
you keep them safe.

184
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:14,781
You just try
to make them stronger

185
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:17,450
until they can
look out for themselves.

186
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:20,169
But this here,

187
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,273
I... I never counted
on this.

188
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:28,177
Hey, I got a buddy.

189
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:30,413
Bill Jenkins,
he lives up in 303.

190
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:33,850
He's got a real nice
backgammon set up there.

191
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:36,135
He won't mind and he keeps
it under his bed there.

192
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:39,605
Just... please.

193
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:41,391
You've been out there
in the world

194
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:44,927
and you know how to handle
yourself around those things.

195
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:46,946
Look, I know you might
not understand it

196
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:48,982
'cause you don't got
a baby girl of your own,

197
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:50,817
<i>but...</i>
<i>( coughs )</i>

198
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:55,238
it might be something that might
make my Megan talk again.

199
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,607
<i>Please.</i>

200
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:53,546

<i>( door opens )</i>

203
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,278
Thank you.

204
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:35,749
You're welcome.

205
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:45,518
Couple things for the road.

206
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:49,122
I'm okay.

207
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:51,357
You helped us.

208
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:53,493
We're saying thank you.

209
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:55,245
Deal with it.

210
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:01,918
I guess you'll be
needing this back.

211
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:05,922
Keep it.

212
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:09,709
Don't...

213
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,761
throw that at me.

214
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:16,933
It's your gun.
You can have it back.

215
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:19,736
You need another one.

216
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:21,271
I have this.

217
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:26,659
Tara was right.

218
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,244
We should have frisked you.

219
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:30,947
I found it upstairs.

220
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:34,617
You keep that.

221
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:43,576
You have to kill the brain.

222
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:45,128
What?

223
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:47,964
Your sister, she shot
'em in the body,

224
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:50,683
but you have to hit 'em here.

225
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:53,102
That's what kills them.

226
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:54,437
Why?

227
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:02,812
I need to ask you something.

228
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:08,318
My dad's got stage four
lung cancer.

229
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,820
I worked oncology
for a few years.

230
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:13,623
He's nearing the end.

231
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:19,329
He's got about
two days of oxygen.

232
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,830
Maybe less.

233
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:25,251
We never thought
he'd make it this long.

234
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:28,788
You've already done
so much for us, but...

235
00:20:30,474 --> 00:20:32,475
there's an old folks home

236
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:34,677
a couple of blocks from here.

237
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:38,898
Even one tank
would mean everything.

238
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:41,801
He's the only one who can
put a smile on Megan's face.

239
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,471
Even for a second.

Let me be a nurse again.

Good news is it doesn't look
like you need any stitches.

Feels good to have
something to do.

264

Megan.

When she saw you
out there on the street.

269
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:59,477
He went out one night about
three and a half years ago

270
00:25:59,478 --> 00:26:01,896
to get a couple beers
and a Powerball ticket.

271
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:03,898
Said he'd be right back.

272
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:09,104
Megan thought you were him,

273
00:26:09,105 --> 00:26:12,490
finally coming right back.

274
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:18,530

<i>- In here, honey.</i>

275

Everything's okay, sweetheart.

276
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:28,957
Brian just got a boo-boo that
needs a little cleaning up.

277
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,925
Same as when you get a cut.

278
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,018
I don't have the ointment.

279
00:26:44,523 --> 00:26:47,559
Why don't you watch
my patient until I get back?

280
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,227
Okay.

281
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,825
What happened to your eye?

282
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:05,376
It's gone.

born like that?

Something happened to me.

286
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:18,256
Was that bad to ask?

287
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,230
No.

288
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:32,353
I'll tell you what
happened to my eye,

289
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:34,606
but you have to promise
to keep it secret.

290
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:38,493
I promise.

291
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:42,831
What's that?

292
00:27:42,832 --> 00:27:44,332
Pinkie swear.

293
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:55,510
Plus cross my heart
and hope to die.

294
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,882
Well...

295
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:04,435
I'm a pirate.

296
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:06,337
No way.

297
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:08,773
( laughing )

298
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:14,812
Yeah, you caught me.

299
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:21,402
What really happened was
I was trying to help someone.

300
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:25,290
Someone I loved very much.

301
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,575
How were you trying
to help them?

302
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:32,497
I was trying to protect
them, you know?

303
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:35,333
Stop them getting hurt.

304
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:37,201
But you got hurt instead.

305
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:39,036
Yeah.

306
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,675
Did they get hurt, too?

307
00:28:43,676 --> 00:28:45,843
Uh...

308
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:47,762
yeah, yeah, they did.

309
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,784
I'm sorry.

310
00:28:56,021 --> 00:28:57,889
Me, too.

311
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:05,053
Megan:
What is it?

312
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:06,722
Chess.

313
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:08,557
Looks hard.

314
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,961
Well, maybe for some folks,
but you're smart.

315
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:14,479
You'll catch on quick.

316
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,297
What's this one called?

317
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:18,483
That's a pawn.

318
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:20,852
They're your soldiers.

319
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:24,606
Do they die?

320
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:26,808
Sometimes.

321
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:29,194
Do you lose if they die?

322
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:31,413
No, not necessarily.

323
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:34,082
You can lose a lot of soldiers,

324
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,535
but still win the game.

325
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:42,791
That's the king.

326
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:46,678
That's the guy
you want to capture.

327
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:59,107
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.

328
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:08,700
Looks like you.

329
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,905
Yeah.

330
00:30:13,906 --> 00:30:15,991
( chuckles )

331
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:23,582
Come on, let's play.

332
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:29,037
So these ones are pawns.

333
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,277
Lily:
He's gone.

334
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,647
I think he's been gone a while.

335
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:33,151
( crying )

336
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:35,287
Y'all should go now.

337
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:37,572
Just give us a minute.

338
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:41,877
I love you, Daddy.

339
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:46,614
( growling )

340
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:49,801
- ( gasps )
- Lily: <i>Tara!</i>

341
00:31:52,221 --> 00:31:54,389
- Tara: <i>Stop! What are you doing?</i>
<i>- It's not Dad!</i>

342
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,790
- Stop!
- It's not Dad!

343
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,125
( Megan screams )

344
00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:20,141
I know, okay?

345
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:23,078
It happens no matter what?

346
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,713
Yeah.

347
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:28,283
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

348
00:33:31,187 --> 00:33:33,088
He could have got me.

349
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:36,758
He almost got me.

350
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:43,131
<i>I was thinking</i>

351
00:33:43,132 --> 00:33:46,200
he would have been grateful
<i>or whatever</i>

352
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:49,087
that you stopped him,
from him...

353
00:33:49,088 --> 00:33:51,389
you know what I mean?

354
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:00,932
So, yeah, we're cool.

355
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,313
<i>( shatters )</i>

356
00:35:31,974 --> 00:35:33,575
( knocks )

357
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,046
Good-bye.

358
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:40,031
No.

359
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:41,833
- We're coming with you.
- No.

360
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:43,334
There has to be
someplace better,

361
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:44,836
and you're gonna
help us find it.

362
00:35:44,837 --> 00:35:46,538
- Lily.
- I saw the picture, Brian.

363
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:49,657
You had a family, I know that.

364
00:35:49,658 --> 00:35:52,177
And I know we're not them.

365
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:54,179
But for now,
you're stuck with us.

366
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,098
- And that's just the way it's gonna be.
- I can't.

367
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,551
You already have.

368
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:09,903
Tara:
<i>Where should we go?</i>

369
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:12,072
Governor:
No use making a plan.

370
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:13,940
We'll go where they let us.

371
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:16,076
<i>Who's they?</i>

372
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:18,295
The roads.

373
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:20,163
The biters.

374
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,469
I'm not really a cop.

375
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,338
I mean, it's not a total lie.

376
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:29,890
I was in the academy.

377
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,811
I'm sorry I lied to you.

378
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:39,850
You don't have to be sorry.

379
00:36:39,851 --> 00:36:41,935
<i>Well, I am.</i>

380
00:36:43,688 --> 00:36:46,440
<i>Do you think we can make it?</i>

381
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,745
We'll make it.

382
00:36:53,197 --> 00:36:55,749
Are you lying to me?

383
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:00,871
No.

384
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:24,845
Lily: You can come
join us, Megan.

385
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,737
It's just gonna take some time.

386
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:37,023
It's okay.

387
00:38:54,986 --> 00:38:56,987
<i>( engine grinding )</i>

388
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:15,138
Governor:
We'll find another car soon.

389
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:17,007
Tara:
I hope you're right.

390
00:39:17,008 --> 00:39:19,843
This whole country backdrop
is reminding me of Sam.

391
00:39:19,844 --> 00:39:22,896
- Lily: Here we go.
- I thought she was the one.

392
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:25,632
Then you went camping,
ate mushrooms, game over.

393
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:28,852
You're forgetting the part where Sam broke
down and told me she had a boyfriend,

394
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:30,537
that she wasn't
really into chicks.

395
00:39:30,538 --> 00:39:33,239
Ugh, worst weekend of my life.

396
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,742
- <i>( crow caws )</i>
<i>- Tara.</i>

397
00:39:35,743 --> 00:39:37,661
Oh, man.
Damn it!

398
00:39:37,662 --> 00:39:39,946
- <i>You all right?</i>
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

399
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:42,749
- Tara, stop. Let me look at it.
- I'm fine!

400
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,669
Just hand me my backpack.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

401
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,288
( groans )

402
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:53,710
- Can you walk?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

403
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:57,597
<i>( metal squeaking )</i>

404
00:39:57,598 --> 00:39:59,265
I'm fine.
Let's go.

00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:02,302
- ( metal squeaking )
- ( Walkers growling )

406
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:10,176
Drop your bags.
Let's go. Come on.

407
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:13,029
- Tara: Megan.
- Megan, come on.

408
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,748
<i>Megan, right now.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

409
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:17,033
- <i>Megan!</i>
<i>- Come on, Megan.</i>

410
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:18,985
Megan, come on.

411
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:20,954
Megan, right now.
Come on.

412
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:29,462
Come on, Megan.
Come on.

413
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:31,331
Lily:
<i>Megan!</i>

414
00:40:35,553 --> 00:40:37,170
Governor:
<i>Here.</i>

415
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,144
Go.

416
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:46,012
Move.

417
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:15,909
- Ah!
- ( Megan screams )

418
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,745
- Brian!
- I'm here.

419
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:24,100

420
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:28,188

I'm sorry.
You okay?

429
00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:10,180
You all right?

430
00:42:10,181 --> 00:42:12,482
I'm never gonna let
anything happen to you.

431
00:42:12,483 --> 00:42:14,567
Okay?

432
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:24,077
- Promise?
- Cross my heart.

433
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:29,866
Holy shit.

434
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:35,789
Cross my heart.
