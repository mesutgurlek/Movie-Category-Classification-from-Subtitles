1
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:11,755
<i>They were  pulling her out of the river
when I got there</i>

2
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:16,338
<i> more water than blood in her
at that point.</i>

3
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,364
-- Was she able to speak?
-- No.

4
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:24,668
She stopped breathing

5
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:32,071
OK, that should be enough

6
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:36,273
Detective Aubrey, despite
some irregularities ...

7
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:38,619
with regards to proper
Police procedures,

8
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,546
We will not be proceeding
any further with our inquiry.

9
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:43,687
Six weeks have elasped ...

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,670
since the last Uncle Eddie murder.

11
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:49,993
And that itself suggest that
the public interest has been served

12
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:55,084
Congratulations on your promotion
to detective first grade.

13
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,894
<i> This afternoon
Detective Stan Aubrey,</i>

14
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:12,158
<i>lead investigator in
the Uncle Eddie's case ...</i>

15
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:18,381
<i> The death of primary suspect
in the Uncle Eddie murders ...</i>

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,796
<i> ended this morning.</i>

17
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:23,594
<i> ... these horrible murders.</i>

18
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,706
<i>The circumstances
surrounding the shooting ...</i>

19
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,365
<i> remain as yet unclear.</i>

20
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:31,466
<i> Linked by their gruesome art ...</i>

21
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:39,510
<i> while presenting the awards ...
as a model officer,</i>

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,681
<i> responsible for bringing one of
the city's</i>

23
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:43,928
<i> most disturbing case.</i>

24
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:45,093
Come on.

25
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:02,007
Wait, wait, wait.

26
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:31,233
-- Wait, my hat.
-- Get up.

27
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:55,214
Hey, OK?

28
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,505
Don't be seduced.

29
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,093
Avoid psychological
speculation

30
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:39,197
related to the killer's intent

31
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,947
We may never know
why he did what he did.

32
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,654
He may never know.

33
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,558
Treat the boundaries of the
crime scene like a frame,

34
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,013
and limit your analysis to what
is presented within it.

35
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:04,964
Stick with it,
don't rush things,

36
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:07,674
and above all, in your initial
encounter with the crime scene,

37
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,375
trust your own eyes.

38
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:13,160
Remember, all you really have
is what the killer left behind

39
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:16,936
His work is pathetic,
if you will.

40
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:24,502
OK, we'll pick up
there next week.

41
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:44,870
Ninety three.

42
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:16,068
Yup

43
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,976
Well you better get him out out of here.
'Cos north of the lamp post is ours

44
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:28,069
Do us all a favour
and walk away from this one?

45
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,534
Walk away and take him

46
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:49,155
Gonna ask some of you questions.

47
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:50,588
We got a preliminary statement

48
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,982
Stan, don't recognize you.
How've you been?

49
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:56,127
Good, I'm good

50
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,437
Action is in there

51
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,388
Chew a little easier
on the protocol, eh pal?

52
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:02,924
Brainerd called me.

53
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,665
Brainerd called him, eh

54
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:06,686
Stan ...

55
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:10,040
You come in the morning, alright?

56
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,080
See, I'm getting promoted.
You and I going to be peers.

57
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,631
No.

58
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:21,360
I got to tell you I had a bad case of
deja vu, I didn't work the caper.

59
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,725
-- What caper?
-- What caper?

60
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:26,802
The caper. Uncle Eddie.

61
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:30,441
Isn't that why Brainerd brought you in?

62
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:51,553
No, no, no, you're cold.

63
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:04,036
We held up turning it down
till you got here

64
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:09,136
Yes, it's the kind of smell like it
gets inside you, doesn't it?

65
00:10:09,663 --> 00:10:12,127
Billy, video.

66
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:25,098
I call that a conversation piece.

67
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,220
It is a camera obscura.

68
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:40,794
A device used in
the Renaissance ...

69
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,663
to draw in perspective.

70
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:47,033
May I?

71
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,179
Hey, Hey! You want to hold off
on that until I mark the aperture?

72
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:59,804
The pinhole focuses the light.

73
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:11,534
You have that flashlight?
-- Yah.

74
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:24,341
Take it down

75
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,349
I would love to get up there.

76
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:10,139
I do not know, man.
I could smell it down the hallway.

77
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:12,240
Did you see they called Stan Aubray in?

78
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:14,721
Nope. Hey, he's on one of my classes

79
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,882
I thought they retired him already

80
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:17,883
God...

81
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:52,243
-- Wanna buy you breakfast.
-- No, I'm going straight to bed.

82
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,910
I think I'm getting a cold.

83
00:12:58,225 --> 00:12:59,398
OK.

84
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:31,681
What are you doing, Stan?

85
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,550
Worrying.

86
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,187
-- About what?
-- Wearing the fabric.

87
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,550
That's what my mon used to say

88
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:44,633
is to touch things all the
time wear them down.

89
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,813
That's why you're good
at what you do.

90
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:50,490
You never mentioned your mother before.

91
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:52,915
She live in the city?

92
00:14:59,544 --> 00:15:01,157
Staying sober?

93
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:04,754
Four years and three months.

94
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,347
You're gonna ask me that everytime?

95
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,283
Yes, it's certainly the best
place to get to know someone.

96
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,668
Or maybe that's the idea.

97
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:18,267
You probably you keep
a girl like me ...

98
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:19,968
at every donation center.

99
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:31,588
It's so weird to think of my blood
in someone else's body.

100
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:34,179
You know, if you'd run into me
a couple of months later, then you

101
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,889
thought wouln't be accepting
my blood right now.

102
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,926
No, you'd estrange yourself
out of it sooner or later.

103
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,674
-- Can I pick who it goes to?
-- No.

104
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,143
It's my blood.

105
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:49,300
That is the trouble with transfusions.

106
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,038
You have to replace like with like.

107
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,017
It's not true.

108
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:55,240
If you are old
you can give to anybody.

109
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:03,320
You know Crystal was old.

110
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,382
When I used to see her
they had to be ...

111
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:07,458
because she'd give it up
for anybody.

112
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,642
She give it up for you?

113
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,106
Did she say something?

114
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,258
I don't know, between dates, yeah.

115
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:17,682
You have a lot of time
to get to know someone.

116
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:20,430
I knew things from it
that nobody else knew.

117
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:23,421
She had this birthmark...

118
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:24,716
under his left arm.

119
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:27,342
She always used to say that no matter
how many guys she was with,

120
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:29,244
no man would ever find her

121
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,403
Think about it too

122
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:40,716
Sorry.

123
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:45,494
Let's go to somewhere
away from here.

124
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:47,233
Above ground, maybe

125
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:50,270
Like hiking

126
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,502
I'm going with some friends
this weekend.

127
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,878
You could come.

128
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:59,374
I'd love to
but I got to work.

129
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:03,171
-- Shocking.
-- Another time.

130
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:05,838
Probably.

131
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:08,787
Probably not.

132
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:11,818
I got to go.

133
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,704
Looks like an egg.

134
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:32,492
Sometimes a circle
is just a circle, chief

135
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,733
Building management got back
to us this morning.

136
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:38,893
The hanging man was
identified as Martin Calderon.

137
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,683
Works as a day trader,
never left his apartment.

138
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:45,345
I thought that you might want to take
a look at the report Carl put together.

139
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:47,325
He was up all night.

140
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,428
It's a theory it was a ritual killing,

141
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,421
some kind of a copycat
imitating Uncle Eddie.

142
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:58,294
No, this is different.

143
00:17:58,782 --> 00:18:00,719
It's less spontaneous.

144
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,549
It don't seem so different to me.

145
00:18:06,578 --> 00:18:09,675
Look, hard as the Uncle Eddie case was

146
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,956
you're still a detective

147
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:17,694
I'd appreciate it if you'd give
this one your full attention.

148
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,339
I'll will

149
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:24,615
Thank you.

150
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:35,887
Based on decomposition of the body,

151
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:38,199
victim's been dead
at least a week.

152
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:41,515
-- Now, the cause of death.
-- Hanging by your f.....  ankles.

153
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,555
But he was probably dead
before he got that far.. yeah?

154
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:47,555
Yeah.
You see the sutured wound?

155
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:50,585
Intestines had been removed

156
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:55,596
The killer went to the trouble of ..
removing them

157
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:59,356
and closing the incision
before he strung him up.

158
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:04,530
I would have cleaned the body
completely but I want to show you...

159
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,934
The blue is not just discoloration.

160
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,410
The body was painted
before the dust was applied.

161
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:15,481
It's all over him

162
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:17,866
I don't see it here.

163
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:21,509
Just the front of his body.

164
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:25,523
The side that faced
the aperture.

165
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,525
Like a stage set,
seen from one side.

166
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:30,663
What, the human slide show..

167
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:32,524
wasn't kinky enough?

168
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:34,222
He had to paint the body?

169
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,748
Maybe trying to pretty him up.

170
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:06,020
Excuse me ...

171
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:08,265
Are you the owner?

172
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:09,478
Yeah

173
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,319
You can't put a painting like that
in the window

174
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Why?

175
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:20,247
It is irresponsible.

176
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,521
I don't have to look at that
everytime I leave my apartment.

177
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:28,591
So, buy it and burn it.

178
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,026
Don't get fresh with me.
You take it down, right now.

179
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,452
-- How much is this?
-- Fifty dollars.

180
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,736
Why not have more of those?
Pictures of butterflies.

181
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:39,616
When was the last time
you've seen a butterfly?

182
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:42,988
-- Where did you get this?
-- I don't know, a state lot.

183
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,867
-- I may need to call you.
-- You're a cop?

184
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:48,606
Its like its stolen?

185
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:50,871
Hey listen, I just
I found this out on the street,

186
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:52,041
right in front of my shop.

187
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:53,255
Thanks

188
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:07,920
Nice painting.
We analyzed the paint.

189
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:10,064
These aren't commercial pigments.

190
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,094
Pull samples
from this case number,

191
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:15,360
and have the lab
run a comparison.

192
00:21:17,258 --> 00:21:18,632
There is something else.

193
00:21:18,996 --> 00:21:21,018
We did an X-ray
to look for underpaint

194
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,279
This is pretty wild

195
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,808
Look like there was a bird
in the chair in the original image.

196
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,374
I wonder
why he painted over it.

197
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:36,624
Do you have anything to wrap this up?

198
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,945
I want to take it over there myself

199
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,542
You've been shopping, Stan?

200
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:57,276
"Mr. Aubrey, Let's talk"

201
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,017
"Alex"

202
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:12,003
Stan, I wanted to pick your
brain about the case.

203
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,279
What is this?
Paperweight?

204
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:18,066
I still need to sit down
over the pathology report.

205
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,083
No, no, no, I mean
the Uncle Eddie case.

206
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:26,447
Given the copycat angle ...

207
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:28,350
I though it was good idea
to look at your file.

208
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,554
-- You looked at my file?
-- Yeah.

209
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,591
You don't mind, do you?

210
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:40,620
Hey Stan, why not you flip
through the unsolved case files?

211
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:43,087
Look to see if those guys
missed anything.

212
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:47,007
I know it is tedious right, but,
Who knows what you might see?

213
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:52,542
-- What is today?
-- Tuesday.

214
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:57,068
-- No, the date.
-- The Tenth. Why?

215
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:06,187
Ok, this is what I've got.
Louis comf.., 1745.

216
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:07,887
-- Nice.
-- Yes.

217
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:10,393
Sixteenth century Ming

218
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:15,687
Rarity, Joseph Ubonn.

219
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,839
And an  American Victorian

220
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:24,859
-- I do not know this is your style but ...
-- What is that?

221
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:28,638
Oh that a girl
to go with your chair.

222
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:32,840
See I stumble upon
this invaluable collection ...

223
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,332
of Civil War porn.

224
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:38,687
I am not interested in pornography,
I need something functional,

225
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:40,307
something I can touch.

226
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:42,414
Okay, I was ready
to diversify.

227
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:45,766
But you hold on to those.
Tell me which one you want to pursue.

228
00:23:46,377 --> 00:23:50,217
Oye, oye, not her.
She's mine.

229
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,536
Russ, another round.

230
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:54,791
Coming up.

231
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,367
Here is a painting
I wanted to see.

232
00:24:05,135 --> 00:24:09,095
Sorry, Stan,
but this is joke.

233
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:12,618
-- And doesn't go with your chair.
-- No, you don't understand.

234
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:14,530
It is a picture of
of the crime scene ...

235
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,188
I am working on.

236
00:24:16,391 --> 00:24:20,350
It was in the  window of the
antique store near my place.

237
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,509
I think the killer painted it.

238
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:26,863
Wow.

239
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:31,106
That would be quite a coincidence
I mean if you're right.

240
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:35,338
Come on, I mean anybody
could have done this.

241
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:38,577
It has been in the news
for the last couple of days ...

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,154
You know, just sticking it out
till I can collect my pension.

-- Hey, not too shaby.
-- Yes.

248
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:07,261
The department really spared no
expense for your promotion.

249
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,808
-- It's beautiful, fellas.
-- Yes.

250
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:11,668
You know my brother
got a f... watch

251
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,829
-- Beer?
-- No, thanks.

252
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:32,124
-- Two shots already yeah?
-- Yes.

253
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,480
-- Cheers, Cheers.
-- Cheers.

254
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,453
Great success.

Miss, Could I get
some milk?

258
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:14,805
Sure are a lot of cops here,
aren't there, Mr. Aubrey?

259
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:20,785
-- How do you know my name?
-- Alex Fredericks.

260
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:24,423
Probably read

When other reporters were taking
you down, I defended you

263
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,657
Turns out you and I were right.

264
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:40,112
We were?

265
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,607
Talk to me about the new case

266
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,563
Is it a copycat killer?

267
00:27:49,011 --> 00:27:50,827
You think he'll kill again?

268
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,679
Who do we call him?
Oh, will think of something snappy.

269
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,294
What do you want?

270
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,508
Why don't you walk away after
the Uncle Eddie murders?

271
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,963
It is sad
what happened to that girl.

No?

You see this is the thing,
You and I have been working ...

289
00:31:00,877 --> 00:31:03,788
in the same office ... about what
five years now?

well, I don't give a shit

But you and I are gonna have to
work together at some point.

Both got the same shield
Now, Stan, you understand me?

301
00:35:06,486 --> 00:35:08,669
It's all pieces of the same guy.

302
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:10,821
A Jeff Sarno.

303
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,448
Except the intestines.

304
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:16,560
They belong to Mr. Calderon.

305
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:19,954
We checked for evidence
of sexual assault, none.

Hey, Stan,
Nice you can make it.

-- What did I missed?
-- Meet Jeff Sarno.

308
00:35:26,632 --> 00:35:27,877
What else you got?

309
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:31,110
This might interest to
only to students of anatomy ...

310
00:35:31,232 --> 00:35:33,092
and human behavior.

311
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,084
Victim had
extensive cosmetic surgery.

312
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:38,633
Apparently wasn't happy
with the top half of his mouth ...

313
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:42,320
so they split his his upper palate ...

314
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:45,997
and lengthened it to
match the lower jaw.

315
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,270
Pretty ironic, huh?

316
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:51,978
All that work and end up
chopped up like this.

317
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,759
Why would he go through
all that trouble?

318
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:57,679
Jeff Sarno was an actor.
Not a successful one.

319
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:00,184
Didn't you read the case file?

320
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:02,892
He had an audition.

321
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:05,769
According to his agent, the
director calls that the kid ...

322
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,526
had the right look for the part

323
00:36:07,606 --> 00:36:09,951
We got an address or a phone
number for the appointment?

324
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:11,974
No. We checked
and came up with nothing

325
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:13,150
And the agent?

326
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:17,720
He just got a call saying that they
were..  going in a different direction.

327
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:19,994
Whatever that means.

328
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:21,498
When Sarno didn't call back

329
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,288
The agent figured the kid
buried his head in the sand

330
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:58,194
"We need a good Scout"
SANDY

331
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:29,065
<i> Session 2, November 17.</i>

332
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:33,592
<i> Detective Aubrey, let's pick up
where we left off last time.</i>

333
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:37,914
<i>We were talking about the moment
you found the girl.</i>

334
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:42,884
<i>They were pulling here out of the River
when I got there</i>

335
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:46,845
<i> She was wearing a fur coat
that had become big ...</i>

336
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,867
<i> and heavy with the water.</i>

337
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:55,984
<i> -Was she able to speak?
-- No.</i>

338
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,540
<i>She had multiple stab wounds
to the abdomen.</i>

339
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:02,895
<i> There was more water than blood
in her at that point.</i>

340
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:06,895
<i>I tried to use my hands
to stop the bleeding,</i>

341
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:11,382
<i>but she took
a big gasp of air ...</i>

342
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:14,051
<i> and looked right through me.</i>

343
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:18,253
<i> And then she stopped breathing.</i>

344
00:39:20,155 --> 00:39:22,294
<i> He said you had met the victim before.</i>

345
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:26,538
<i>Did you ever intend to warn her
that she was in danger that night?</i>

346
00:39:46,524 --> 00:39:47,898
It is one in the morning.

347
00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:52,303
I'm sorry, I know it's late, but did
you hear any noises upstairs earlier?

348
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,689
Not only you just now.

349
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:57,154
Someone broke into my apartment

350
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:00,952
No, didn't hear anything.

351
00:40:55,242 --> 00:40:56,293
What you think?

352
00:40:56,577 --> 00:41:00,132
White male, age 43, lives alone.

353
00:41:00,657 --> 00:41:03,002
One case of corrupting a minor ...

354
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:04,875
brought by the DA's office
five years ago,

355
00:41:04,955 --> 00:41:06,575
then later dismissed.

356
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:10,340
Drives a Lincoln, similar to the one
identified by witnesses ...

357
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:12,685
at three of the last
five murder scenes.

358
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:14,788
And we got prints
and blood type ...

359
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:16,648
based on saliva match

360
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:26,407
I think this is our guy.

361
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:29,035
I can have a warrant ready
in three hours.

362
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:54,650
Hey Stan!

363
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:07,863
Aubrey and Luiz, you take the back,
I'll go on the front.

364
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:09,882
Now wait on my signal.

365
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,680
Position.

366
00:42:35,904 --> 00:42:39,054
Gun! Gun, gun!
Stop, don't shoot!

367
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:47,219
We got the bastard

368
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:51,219
It looked like a gun

369
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:07,908
Did the right thing.

370
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,488
I was going to meet you upstairs

371
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,428
I can't, I just got time
for my cigarette break.

372
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,098
-- We can go get a coffee.
-- No, this is good.

373
00:43:46,178 --> 00:43:48,767
I really need a cigarette.
Mind if I smoke in here?

374
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,063
No, hop in.

375
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:58,264
How you doing, man?

376
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:00,976
-- Thanks for returning my call.
-- Not a problem.

377
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,793
We are buddies

378
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:05,298
I heard that you are working
on a new case.

379
00:44:05,422 --> 00:44:08,695
Yeah, they expect to be on something
so soon after that last one.

380
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:12,455
Last one?
Talking about five years ago.

381
00:44:13,795 --> 00:44:15,614
-- You got promoted didn't you?
-- Yeah.

382
00:44:16,505 --> 00:44:19,089
They got me up there
nice cushy desk job

383
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,036
Oh good.

384
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:25,077
--Tough thing was that girl.
-- The girl?

385
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:28,551
Could have been twenty more
girls like her dead, Stan.

386
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:31,056
Panned out in the end.

387
00:44:32,882 --> 00:44:34,214
How is your family?

388
00:44:35,749 --> 00:44:38,063
Everybody's good.
Boys are 8 and 10 now.

389
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:40,447
Big kids, man.

390
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:46,911
Look, It's great to see you, man.

391
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:49,423
Me too.

392
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:52,138
Have something you want
to get off your chest?

393
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:54,315
No!

394
00:44:56,091 --> 00:45:01,949
I mean I'm on this thing and...
I have been thinking.

395
00:45:04,562 --> 00:45:08,051
You know, I think I know
what is going on here.

396
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:13,437
My advice to you is, if it's in
the past, let it stay there.

397
00:45:13,558 --> 00:45:14,854
Things change.

398
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:18,222
Never set foot in the same river twice.

399
00:45:21,212 --> 00:45:23,273
-- Thanks.
-- Sure.

400
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:25,859
I think you gonna catch this guy.

401
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:40,886
That one.

402
00:45:41,568 --> 00:45:43,218
-- This is the one you want?
-- Yes.

403
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,541
What's wrong with the one
you've got, Stan?

404
00:45:46,691 --> 00:45:49,235
Oh you know that I actually having
company over the year?

405
00:45:49,841 --> 00:45:51,579
I just want another chair.

406
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:54,528
What's wrong with having
two matching chairs?

407
00:45:54,812 --> 00:45:57,683
Nothing wrong, Stan.
Nothing wrong.

408
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:03,783
I get you a Federal salty table or
a Heppelwhite for the same price.

409
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:06,493
-- No, no, no, that's what I want.
-- OK.

410
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,462
What?

411
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:16,836
You just have to have it, don't you?

412
00:46:18,168 --> 00:46:19,704
That's your problem, Stan.

413
00:46:20,985 --> 00:46:25,963
Me, I love the feel of an object
changing hands, to let it go.

414
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:28,757
You can't let go of
anything, can you?

415
00:46:29,561 --> 00:46:31,667
Like that girl,
the memory of the girl.

416
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:35,505
Might not be your fault.

417
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:41,606
Might just be the past
that isn't through with you yet.

418
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:44,071
Keeps pulling you back
all the time.

419
00:46:44,437 --> 00:46:47,144
Now all of a sudden
it's a copycat killer.

420
00:46:47,629 --> 00:46:49,528
We do not know if it is a copycat.

421
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:51,590
I'm not so sure either, Stan.

422
00:46:51,795 --> 00:46:54,987
I took a look at some photos
from the Uncle Eddie killings,

423
00:46:55,106 --> 00:46:58,249
and I kept thinking about
your painting ...and

424
00:46:58,412 --> 00:47:00,401
He said it was a piece of junk.

425
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:02,629
There was something there though.

426
00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:07,319
The presentation of the body,
the pigments and gestalt.

427
00:47:07,522 --> 00:47:09,579
There was something about it,
You know what I mean?

428
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:12,212
No, I don't know what you mean.

429
00:47:13,506 --> 00:47:15,646
Looking at the work
in a sequence,

430
00:47:15,727 --> 00:47:18,477
was like watching
a retrospective.

431
00:47:26,194 --> 00:47:28,659
I think you should stick
to garage sales ...

432
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,365
and vintage porn.

433
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:32,830
Don't get your horns all twisted.

434
00:47:32,954 --> 00:47:35,338
We killed Uncle Eddie.

435
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:39,864
You're dealing with the same guy.

436
00:47:44,671 --> 00:47:46,820
-- I'm tired of your bullshit.
-- Stan, sit down, Stan.

437
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,925
-- No, I'm leaving.
-- Come on, sit down, Stan.

438
00:47:49,098 --> 00:47:50,440
I'm leaving.

439
00:48:57,509 --> 00:48:58,856
Sorry.

440
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:01,208
I'm sorry.

441
00:51:30,877 --> 00:51:32,304
Stan.

442
00:51:36,615 --> 00:51:37,918
Thanks

443
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:39,779
Eggs Florentine.

444
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:11,750
Is it true that there is a connection
with the murders of Uncle Eddie?

445
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:16,374
What about connections to Uncle Eddie?
Is it a copycat?

446
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:19,456
-- Come on, give us something.
-- When I say stop, you stop.

447
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:22,486
There is no copycat,
got nothing to do with Uncle Eddie.

448
00:52:22,608 --> 00:52:23,943
Leave it alone.

449
00:52:24,347 --> 00:52:26,480
I heard the victim worked
Uncle Eddie cases with you.

450
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:29,527
You got to give me something.

451
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,849
-- I can't always have information ...
-- Get her out of here!

452
00:52:33,532 --> 00:52:34,788
Hold on here, miss.

453
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:40,364
Who leaked this to the press?

454
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:44,416
Hard to keep a lid on
a story like this.

455
00:52:44,505 --> 00:52:45,841
You know that, Stan.

456
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:52,109
This guy really
a buddy of yours?

457
00:52:53,322 --> 00:52:54,857
Work colleague

458
00:52:56,955 --> 00:52:59,018
Make me lie for you, Stan.

459
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,468
Used your friend
like an inkwell.

460
00:54:40,982 --> 00:54:45,150
What's this one about, Picasso?
What's the connection?

461
00:57:29,077 --> 00:57:31,225
Guy is writing a love letter, Stan.

462
00:57:50,174 --> 00:57:51,192
Stan ...

463
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:53,859
Just take a minute.

464
00:57:54,624 --> 00:57:56,850
I wasn't sure whether
I should come down here ...

465
00:57:56,971 --> 00:57:59,357
so I talked it over with my wife.

466
00:57:59,752 --> 00:58:02,549
She works a hotline
as a crisis counselor.

467
00:58:04,854 --> 00:58:08,367
She told me that the only way to
avoid a crisis is to anticipate one.

468
00:58:09,782 --> 00:58:11,480
Has seen this morning paper?

469
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,366
Your past is starting
to give me nightmares.

470
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:15,330
Camera Killer
Leaves a Mess

471
00:58:15,452 --> 00:58:17,806
Which version of my past do
you mean?

472
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:21,000
Your old partner,
George, is dead.

473
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,104
-- Now why is that?
-- I do not know.

474
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:25,690
Good answer.

475
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:28,438
But I don't think there is much
to this copycat angle.

476
00:58:28,561 --> 00:58:30,510
Hey, but f... the copycat.

477
00:58:30,762 --> 00:58:32,702
I got Carl,
of all people,

478
00:58:32,782 --> 00:58:34,966
asking whether the correlation
between these cases ...

479
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:37,149
is more than circumstantial.

480
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:38,899
And he's not the only one.

481
00:58:42,611 --> 00:58:45,403
You are not the kind of cop
who'd kill an innocent man.

482
00:58:45,482 --> 00:58:48,594
-- And I told Carl, this much.
-- Thanks for your confidence.

483
00:58:48,676 --> 00:58:50,298
Don't mention it.

484
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:54,781
Hey, look. There was one
version of the past,

485
00:58:54,862 --> 00:58:56,845
yours, mine
and the department.

486
00:58:56,926 --> 00:58:58,746
That's one version.

487
00:59:07,907 --> 00:59:10,205
This next photo is from
Gauthier Grisomme,

488
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,437
the French master photographer.

489
00:59:13,205 --> 00:59:18,304
He spent his entire life
chasing the decisive moment,

490
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:21,742
that instant when
composition, form and content ...

491
00:59:21,821 --> 00:59:25,178
conspire to reveal
some fundamental truth.

492
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:30,067
Too esoteric?
Hold that thought.

493
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:33,341
What do you see?

494
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:40,814
Where is the decisive moment?
What truth is revealed?

495
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:45,435
Is this the truth?
Or this?

496
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:47,737
Or this?

497
00:59:48,378 --> 00:59:50,412
Or is it just another angle?

498
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:57,080
You're all familiar with
the Uncle Eddie case.

499
00:59:57,646 --> 01:00:00,442
Now everybody's talking
about a copycat.

500
01:00:02,341 --> 01:00:05,653
If Uncle Eddie is the original,

501
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:09,858
then the copycat is the one
always trailing behind,

502
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:14,991
compelled to reconsctruct
again and again ...

503
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,904
the decisive moment
that has already happened.

504
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:29,256
And maybe there is no copycat.

505
01:00:30,873 --> 01:00:36,570
Only a killer that has become
impatient with chance.

506
01:00:37,782 --> 01:00:41,576
No longer content to kill
his victims where they stand,

507
01:00:41,656 --> 01:00:45,139
he forces the decisive moment.

508
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,397
The killer painted half
of this with a pantograph,

509
01:00:58,477 --> 01:01:00,181
and I finished the rest.

510
01:01:03,585 --> 01:01:06,400
It's weird
but it makes sense, Stan.

511
01:01:06,525 --> 01:01:10,081
Because he's implicating you
more and more into his crime.

512
01:01:10,926 --> 01:01:13,113
I mean, you're already his patron.

513
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,271
Remember you bought
that painting?

514
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,118
Without a patron
there is no painting.

515
01:01:20,401 --> 01:01:22,584
Maybe you are his Pope Innocent.

516
01:01:22,748 --> 01:01:27,484
Maybe you're his crazy
object of obsession, Stan.

517
01:01:28,743 --> 01:01:34,482
OK, I got Velazquez portrait of
of the Pope Innocent X.

518
01:01:34,841 --> 01:01:38,037
Quite an ambivalent study
of absolute power.

519
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:40,175
And here comes Francis Bacon.

520
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:43,496
Despite never seeing
this painting in person,

521
01:01:43,577 --> 01:01:45,682
Bacon became so obsessed
with it ...

522
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:49,441
that he compulsively repainted it
over and over again,

523
01:01:49,522 --> 01:01:52,877
but each version
more horrific than the previous.

524
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:12,836
Did I tell you that the latest victim
worked with me ...

525
01:02:12,883 --> 01:02:14,673
on the Uncle Eddie murders?

526
01:02:16,248 --> 01:02:21,703
I think you've been part of
this bizarre thing all along.

527
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:25,785
It's not until an artist
finds his obsession ...

528
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:29,909
that he can create
his most inpired work.

529
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,270
Where he gets his obsession from,
it does't really matter

530
01:02:33,394 --> 01:02:35,543
It can be the myth of Prometheus,

531
01:02:35,664 --> 01:02:37,615
It can be another man's
painting of the Pope,

532
01:02:37,696 --> 01:02:41,052
it can even the story of
Stan Aubrey.

533
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:42,911
It can be anything.

534
01:02:43,539 --> 01:02:47,921
So drink up.
I'll gonna show you something.

535
01:02:57,499 --> 01:02:59,283
Seems familiar right?

536
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:02,758
The artist had the real
underground cult following

537
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:06,114
Already some show is in the
more hip galleries down town.

538
01:03:06,242 --> 01:03:09,066
You wouldn't believe what
this stuff is selling for.

539
01:03:09,142 --> 01:03:11,095
-- What's his name?
-- No name.

540
01:03:11,182 --> 01:03:12,882
... no official representation.

541
01:03:12,837 --> 01:03:15,915
-- Where we find it?
-- Stan, that's the whole thing.

542
01:03:16,036 --> 01:03:18,665
This guy doesn't exist,
that's the whole gimmit

543
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:20,888
The only thing you have is his work.

544
01:03:21,092 --> 01:03:22,341
What about the gallery owner?

545
01:03:22,505 --> 01:03:25,095
Blowing rail since back room I guess.

546
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:34,782
That is my chair.

547
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:36,963
Yeah, I told you I would
help you to find ...

548
01:03:37,005 --> 01:03:41,006
-- No, it's my chair.
-- What?

549
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:43,998
Fate
Wood and fabric

550
01:03:44,444 --> 01:03:45,897
It was stolen.

551
01:03:49,169 --> 01:03:52,321
We take it later.
I'll swing the car around.

552
01:03:52,526 --> 01:03:53,657
No, you can't do that, Stan.

553
01:03:53,741 --> 01:03:56,172
All right, just tell them
it's evidence.

554
01:03:59,975 --> 01:04:01,469
Oh good, you're back.

555
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:04,137
Any chance of returning our "Fate"

556
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:07,855
-- What?
-- The chair that you absconded with.

557
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,370
-- I am afraid I can't do that.
-- Evidence.

558
01:04:11,865 --> 01:04:13,843
I suppose you'll
beat me with rubber hoses ...

559
01:04:14,006 --> 01:04:16,435
if I choose to respect
the artist's anonymity.

560
01:04:16,596 --> 01:04:19,104
No, we're not gonna do that
but you got to tell us what you know.

561
01:04:19,185 --> 01:04:21,812
-- All I have is a name.
-- Okay.

562
01:04:22,096 --> 01:04:24,321
-- Gerri Harden.
-- Sounds a pornstar.

563
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:28,161
-- You got a bio, any photos?
-- Not even an address.

564
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:29,740
You never asked where she lived?

565
01:04:29,902 --> 01:04:32,531
You never talked about boyfriends,
girlfriends, nothing like that?

566
01:04:32,612 --> 01:04:36,088
Detecting is your pastime,
mine is selling paintings.

567
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:39,523
-- And she sold quite a few.
-- You weren't curious?

568
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,476
We gonna have to ask
you downtown

569
01:04:41,517 --> 01:04:43,174
to give a full description anyway.

570
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,718
OK.

571
01:05:00,245 --> 01:05:02,835
Not a single trace of fiber in any
of the crime scenes ...

572
01:05:02,956 --> 01:05:04,815
but this clay
is full of prints.

573
01:05:05,345 --> 01:05:07,290
We didn't even need to dust.

574
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:10,947
I'm gonna need a few hours.

575
01:05:24,606 --> 01:05:25,977
You get a match?

576
01:05:26,098 --> 01:05:28,242
A match, a name
and a last known address.

577
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:42,180
-- It's an anagram, for a red herring.
-- Come again?

578
01:07:43,919 --> 01:07:46,423
I don't think there
is a Gerri Harden.

579
01:07:48,406 --> 01:07:49,698
Take a look.

580
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:19,965
-- Who is that, Stan?
-- It's Crystal.

581
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:25,379
Looks like someone else thinks
he got the wrong man.

582
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:10,509
You're different from when
I first met you.

583
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,923
It's funny.

584
01:09:17,863 --> 01:09:19,963
Crystal said the same thing to me.

585
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,951
It's going to be five years
this week.

586
01:09:27,405 --> 01:09:28,658
I know.

587
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,608
She was my best friend.

588
01:09:38,556 --> 01:09:40,908
There's nothing you
could have done, Stan.

589
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:43,698
She was half dead
when you found her.

590
01:09:43,822 --> 01:09:45,886
I am sure she forgives you.

591
01:09:47,464 --> 01:09:49,321
No, she won't.

592
01:09:50,776 --> 01:09:54,543
That night
we knew Uncle Eddie ...

593
01:09:54,665 --> 01:09:56,607
had shifted his killings
to the docks.

594
01:09:56,729 --> 01:09:59,315
I should've warned her,
but I didn't

595
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:07,517
I tried to keep an eye on her but
she must have seen me and slipped away.

596
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:12,253
By the time I got there ...

597
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,114
well ...

598
01:10:17,831 --> 01:10:20,093
they were pulling her out of the water.

599
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:28,620
Nothing I could do.

600
01:10:32,257 --> 01:10:37,103
Shul Grantz. You told her
everything was going to be OK.

601
01:10:41,997 --> 01:10:43,892
What do you think?

602
01:10:47,206 --> 01:10:49,195
Good for you.

603
01:10:52,394 --> 01:10:54,901
I was out there that night too.

604
01:10:56,072 --> 01:10:57,404
I didn't know.

605
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:05,292
I'm sorry.

606
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,006
Aubrey.

607
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:01,423
<i>The poison heart</i>

608
01:12:01,504 --> 01:12:02,679
What?

609
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:07,282
<i>The poison harms.
Certainly does</i>

610
01:12:08,253 --> 01:12:11,403
<i> Now you should know that. Cos you've
been poisoning yourself for years</i>

611
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:17,585
<i> Now that you've seen my work
I want some feedback.</i>

612
01:12:19,121 --> 01:12:21,142
<i>You and I both like the color blue,</i>

613
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,666
<i> a pigment that was
once quite precious.</i>

614
01:12:26,004 --> 01:12:28,788
<i> It is also the color of Narcicism.</i>

615
01:12:30,565 --> 01:12:34,727
<i> How will you spend your final moments?
Stuck on your throne?</i>

616
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:38,044
<i>Staring on your face
reflected in a pool of water?</i>

617
01:12:38,164 --> 01:12:41,439
<i> Maybe it won't be your face in the
water but the body of a girl.</i>

618
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,993
<i> water, limpid and clear.</i>

619
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:53,698
<i>Clear as crystal.</i>

620
01:12:55,602 --> 01:12:57,257
I have a theory.

621
01:12:58,709 --> 01:13:00,712
Uncle Eddie got scared and
stopped killing

622
01:13:00,953 --> 01:13:02,993
because he knew
he would get caught.

623
01:13:03,598 --> 01:13:04,972
He knew.

624
01:13:08,043 --> 01:13:10,629
<i> An artist never stops working.</i>

625
01:13:11,362 --> 01:13:15,969
<i>He always gathering material,
preparing a new study.</i>

626
01:13:17,345 --> 01:13:21,989
<i> I having another show.
637 Spruce.</i>

627
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:28,501
<i> You should thank me, Stan.
We make quite a team.</i>

628
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:31,370
<i> If it weren't for me
you'd be stuck at home</i>

629
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:34,282
<i> riddling out your existence.</i>

630
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,089
Detective Aubrey.

631
01:15:34,123 --> 01:15:36,583
We did dealt it what
like you asked.

632
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:42,329
Cover the rock when you
want to talk to the press.

633
01:16:56,433 --> 01:16:58,290
Eggs Florentine.

634
01:16:58,411 --> 01:17:00,959
No eggs today.
Cholesterol.

635
01:17:01,082 --> 01:17:04,032
I told your friend
that is what you always order.

636
01:17:06,942 --> 01:17:08,756
He paid for it already.

637
01:17:10,498 --> 01:17:13,083
No, thanks. Just tea.

638
01:17:17,488 --> 01:17:19,063
Prasa carnia

639
01:17:19,954 --> 01:17:22,297
Coffee cup in the trash
by your desk.

640
01:17:22,302 --> 01:17:23,754
It was mere.

641
01:17:23,837 --> 01:17:25,572
You went through my trash?

642
01:17:27,795 --> 01:17:29,856
You are hell of a good detective, Carl.

643
01:17:32,242 --> 01:17:35,796
Place is great.
I love it.

644
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:38,947
Gina, I got to tell you old boy...

645
01:17:39,473 --> 01:17:41,452
She's got a real mouth on her.

646
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,007
You know Stan, there are reems of
paper on the Uncle Eddie case.

647
01:17:48,896 --> 01:17:52,696
Enquiry transcripts,
supervisors commendation,

648
01:17:52,778 --> 01:17:54,153
case logs.

649
01:17:54,154 --> 01:17:57,992
But you know what?
No real information.

650
01:17:58,639 --> 01:17:59,860
None

651
01:18:01,273 --> 01:18:03,133
Till you caught ...

652
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:06,689
I mean killed ...

653
01:18:09,154 --> 01:18:10,730
Sure he was the one?

654
01:18:11,784 --> 01:18:14,812
He had to be.
Killings stopped, right?

655
01:18:18,976 --> 01:18:22,052
You know back in the warehouse,
when we looking at that dead cops body

656
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:24,760
He said you
worked with him.

657
01:18:24,885 --> 01:18:26,160
You didn't mention
you met with him

658
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,857
the day he was murdered.

659
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,084
You investigating me
or the copycat?

660
01:18:30,165 --> 01:18:32,956
If I were investigating you, believe
me, you wouldn't know about it.

661
01:18:37,036 --> 01:18:39,297
Nothing you want to tell me
about the old case?

662
01:18:39,786 --> 01:18:41,480
I'm all ears.

663
01:18:43,545 --> 01:18:47,622
-- I'll call you if I think of anything.
-- You do that.

664
01:18:48,511 --> 01:18:51,177
And while you're thinking, I'm
gonna keep on doing what I'm doing.

665
01:18:57,605 --> 01:19:00,269
Let's better hope that it
doesn't lead back to Uncle Eddie.

666
01:19:11,339 --> 01:19:13,805
A Red Herring
A Poison Harms Ana

667
01:19:51,145 --> 01:19:53,125
Anamorphism

668
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:55,283
Renaissance painting technique ...

669
01:19:55,444 --> 01:19:58,519
which uses the principles
of forced perspective ...

670
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:03,167
to construct an alternate image
within the frontal composition.

671
01:20:04,016 --> 01:20:08,339
Take this image, for example,
"The whale in pursuit of Jonah."

672
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:12,592
If you stand at an extreme oblique
angle to the picture plane,

673
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:17,605
A second image, often
contradicting the first will appear.

674
01:20:19,503 --> 01:20:23,141
In this case,
a peasant copping a squat.

675
01:20:24,999 --> 01:20:28,029
Holbein, this is 1536.

676
01:20:28,435 --> 01:20:32,961
Now this painting magnifies the
worldliness of two young men in...

677
01:20:33,042 --> 01:20:35,106
pursuit of life.

678
01:20:35,267 --> 01:20:39,436
But take a closer look, view it
from above and from the side ...

679
01:20:39,556 --> 01:20:42,908
and a secret message is revealed.

680
01:20:44,287 --> 01:20:47,384
You're being confronted with a skull.

681
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:49,945
Your memento mori.

682
01:20:51,122 --> 01:20:56,253
It's interesting but, what does
this have to do with the case?

683
01:20:56,373 --> 01:21:00,702
All the devices
at the crime scene ...

684
01:21:00,825 --> 01:21:05,071
they are like a tutorial on
the mastery of perspective.

685
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:09,404
But anamorphosis
subverts the visual plane...

686
01:21:09,525 --> 01:21:13,446
canceling out all that you've learned
about fixed perspective.

687
01:21:13,731 --> 01:21:17,374
There is always another angle,
another meaning.

688
01:21:20,488 --> 01:21:23,281
The truth depends
where you stand.

689
01:21:23,441 --> 01:21:24,454
Yeah.

690
01:21:25,739 --> 01:21:29,256
You got to go back
look at things from a different angle.

691
01:23:56,115 --> 01:23:58,219
<i> Hey, back here!
Vamos!</i>

692
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,087
<> Come, we go...!

693
01:24:29,453 --> 01:24:30,874
<i> Stan ...</i>

694
01:24:32,207 --> 01:24:33,460
<i> Stan ...</i>

695
01:24:35,085 --> 01:24:36,497
<i> Okay, fine.</i>

696
01:24:36,498 --> 01:24:37,498
<i> Hi</i>

697
01:24:37,992 --> 01:24:41,463
<i>I promised my folks whatever
gonna wait for you to call me</i>

698
01:24:41,546 --> 01:24:44,941
<i> but then I realized that I
would probably be waiting forever.</i>

699
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:49,024
<i> I want to see you again.</i>

700
01:24:49,187 --> 01:24:50,684
<i>Call me or a... </i>

701
01:24:50,771 --> 01:24:53,924
<i> I have a meeting tonight.
You can pick me up after that.</i>

702
01:25:11,789 --> 01:25:13,848
<i> Hi, it's Sandy.
Leave a message.</i>

703
01:25:17,975 --> 01:25:18,871
Sandy?

704
01:25:18,961 --> 01:25:20,176
<i> No, it's Carl.
Who is Sandy?</i>

705
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,186
What do you want?

706
01:25:21,234 --> 01:25:22,453
<i> Stan, let me talk to you.</i>

707
01:25:22,932 --> 01:25:24,025
I can't talk right now.

708
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:25,847
<i>Stan, I need to talk to you
or come to you</i>

709
01:25:25,968 --> 01:25:27,062
I'll call you back

710
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:52,332
Can I help you?

711
01:25:53,624 --> 01:25:57,100
Yes, I am looking for a
Sandy Strickler.

712
01:25:57,188 --> 01:25:59,533
Oh, we do not use last names here.

713
01:26:05,031 --> 01:26:07,486
She left just soon as she got here.

714
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:11,811
-- It was obvious that she wasn't sober.
-- Are you sure?

715
01:26:12,579 --> 01:26:16,216
Her sponsor was kind enough
to take her home.

716
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:24,097
Have you ever seen this man,
the man standing behind her?

717
01:26:24,178 --> 01:26:26,765
-- That's Michael C.
-- Michael C.?

718
01:26:26,886 --> 01:26:28,747
That's her sponsor.

719
01:26:29,839 --> 01:26:31,219
What's his last name?

720
01:26:32,431 --> 01:26:36,151
-- Alcoholics Anonymous. It Anony ...
-- Anonymous, I know.

721
01:26:36,252 --> 01:26:37,507
Stan ...

722
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,335
Michael left this for you.

723
01:26:52,356 --> 01:26:53,316
-- What was that?
I do not know what it is,

724
01:26:53,347 --> 01:26:54,867
he just gave me the package.

725
01:27:33,614 --> 01:27:37,287
You have always 'stood the scum
of the rose on my ankle.

726
01:27:40,357 --> 01:27:43,347
I can't believe that
I let you talk me into this.

727
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:13,773
You sure you're not too high
to do to straighten out?

728
01:28:13,894 --> 01:28:15,351
I'm fine.

729
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:19,471
Why is it you never seem high?

730
01:28:21,252 --> 01:28:24,159
Would never put that
poison into my veins.

731
01:28:40,444 --> 01:28:42,504
-- Hey, hey.
-- I'm sorry.

732
01:28:46,222 --> 01:28:47,595
-- Can I see it?
-- No.

733
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:51,840
-- Why won't you let me see it?
-- Just ...

734
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:53,904
-- Wait, let me look at it.
-- Let me work.

735
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:58,633
Oh God, you know what.
I need a break.

736
01:36:30,772 --> 01:36:33,110
Death
