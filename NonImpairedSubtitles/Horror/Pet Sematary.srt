1
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,229
Bye, old Shep.
See you in heaven. Yeah?

2
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:58,546
This is where my kitty lays.

3
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,049
No more he screams
and hollers.

4
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:03,483
He lived for
5 and 20 days.

5
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:04,986
He cost me $50.

6
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:10,185
Spot--a good fella.
We love you.

7
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:01,893
We're finally here.

8
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:03,193
Yeah.

9
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,728
Yay!

10
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,105
So?

11
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:23,115
What do you think?

12
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:26,883
It's gorgeous.

13
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:35,196
Decided to wake up

14
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:38,530
and see what home
looks like, huh?

15
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,034
Mm-hmm.

16
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:42,298
Uh-huh. Come here.

17
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:54,978
Mommy! Daddy!
I see a path.

18
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,958
Ellie, be careful.

19
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,292
Ellie!

20
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,324
Listen to your moth--

21
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:13,061
Mommy! Daddy!
It hurts!

22
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:16,196
Mommy! Daddy! It hurts!

23
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,705
Honey, are you ok?

24
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:18,934
It hurts.

25
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,441
Get rid of this.

26
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,943
I got it.

27
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:22,943
You OK?

28
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:24,445
No. It hurts.

29
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:26,038
Anyone screaming that loud

30
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:27,878
doesn't need
intensive care.

31
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,350
Hi, Church.

32
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,248
Church.

33
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,130
She just skinned
her knee.

34
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:44,393
[horn honks]

35
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,435
[honk]

36
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:51,072
I don't want
the stingy stuff, Daddy.

37
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,801
Where's Gage?

38
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:55,067
Gage!

39
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,142
Gage!

40
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,742
No, you don't, my friend.

41
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,684
Not in that road.

42
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:05,686
Gage!

43
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:08,189
I corralled him
for you, Missus.

44
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:10,021
Thank you so much.

45
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:11,185
Thank you.

46
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:13,786
I'm Louis Creed.

47
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,091
Jud Crandall.

48
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:17,598
I live just
across the road.

49
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,329
You want to watch out
for that road.

50
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:23,099
Them damn trucks
go back and forth

51
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:24,662
all day and night.

52
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:31,213
And, uh, who might
you be, little miss?

53
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,771
I'm Ellen Creed.

54
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:35,784
Your dad's going to be
the new Doctor

55
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:37,285
up at the college.

56
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,789
I think you'll be
happy as a clam here.

57
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:42,381
Are clams
really happy?

58
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:46,557
Mr. Crandall,
there's a path over there.

59
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,029
Do you know
where it goes?

60
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:50,030
Oh.

61
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:55,396
Ayuh, that's
a good story.

62
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:56,904
A good walk.

63
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:59,407
I'll take you
up there sometime.

64
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:01,340
Tell you
the story, too,

65
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:03,311
after you get
settled in.

66
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:05,006
Great.
Uh, excuse me,

67
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:07,515
I've got to get
this kid changed.

68
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,017
Nice to meet you.

69
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:10,017
Same here.

70
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:11,519
Come on, Ellie.

71
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:15,189
House has stood empty
too long.

72
00:07:15,258 --> 00:07:18,193
It's damn good
to see people in it again.

73
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:40,808
[meow]

74
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,888
[meow]

75
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:13,181
Aah! Church!

76
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:16,548
You scared the life
out of me, Church.

77
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:18,109
[meow]

78
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:20,279
Come here.

79
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:36,028
Is that you, Doc?

80
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:38,130
Yeah, it's me.

81
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:39,731
Come and have a beer.

82
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:52,720
Need a glass?

83
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:54,222
Not at all.

84
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,917
Good for you.

85
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,454
Jesus.

86
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,054
Ayuh.

87
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:04,861
That's one
mean road, all right.

88
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:10,031
You know that path
your wife commented on?

89
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:13,564
That road
and those Orinco trucks

90
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:16,703
are the two main reasons
it's there.

91
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:19,612
Well, where
does it lead?

92
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:21,479
Pet cemetery.

93
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,712
Ha. Pet cemetery.

94
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:25,219
It's that damn road.

95
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:28,223
It uses up
a lot of animals.

96
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,384
Dogs and cats mostly.

97
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,894
My little girl's got a cat.

98
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:33,894
Winston Churchill.

99
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:36,397
We call him Church for short.

100
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,401
I'd get him fixed if I were you.

101
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:42,996
Fixed cat
don't tend to wander.

102
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:45,404
If it's always
crossing that road,

103
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,409
its luck will run out.

104
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:49,308
I'll take it
under advisement.

105
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:53,748
Meantime, Doc,
here's to your bones.

106
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:56,011
And your bones.

107
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:04,919
Uh-oh.

108
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:06,461
Uh-oh.

109
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,933
I'll be going now, Dr. Creed.

110
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:13,468
All right, Missy. Thanks.

111
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:16,297
Hi, Missy.

112
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:19,637
I'll do these up,
bring them back next time.

113
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,371
Great. Can you come
on Monday, Missy?

114
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:29,477
Always thought it would be lucky
to marry a Doctor.

115
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:33,488
Wish I had a Doctor around
with my stomach pains.

116
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:35,490
Guess I'll never be lucky.

117
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:37,822
Hell, I ain't married
to anyone.

118
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:42,490
Bye, Missy.

119
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,142
Mommy, Daddy,
come on, let's go!

120
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:56,906
We're coming.

121
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:02,749
All set?
Let's get on with it.

122
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,218
Yay!

123
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:10,519
There's the place.

124
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:12,220
What's it say, Mommy?

125
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:14,263
It says "Pet Sematary,"
honey.

126
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,730
It's misspelled,
but that's what it says.

127
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,495
Ellie, wait a minute!

128
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:26,341
I told you it was
a bad road.

129
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,809
It's made a lot
of kids unhappy.

130
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,316
At least something good
come of it. This place.

131
00:11:34,383 --> 00:11:37,682
Couldn't plant nothing
but corpses here anyway.

132
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:40,688
How can you
call it a good thing?

133
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:43,691
A graveyard for pets
killed in the road,

134
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,989
built by
brokenhearted children.

135
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:48,963
They have to learn
about death somehow.

136
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:49,963
Why?

137
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:55,336
Can I have the baby?

138
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:56,701
Yeah.

139
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:07,382
Daddy, look,
this one's a gold fishy.

140
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,883
That's right, Ellie.

141
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:11,886
They wasn't all killed
by the road,

142
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:14,946
especially the ones
back from my childhood.

143
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,996
They get older as you go
towards the middle.

144
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:22,496
Harder to read.

145
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:26,433
Missy Ellen, come
over here just a minute.

146
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:29,471
That's where I buried
my dog Spot

147
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:32,006
when he died in 1924.

148
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:35,305
Ellie...do you know

149
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:39,007
what a graveyard
really is?

150
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:43,711
Well, I guess not.

151
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:47,517
It's a place
where the dead speak.

152
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,424
No, not right out loud.

153
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:54,019
Their stones speak
or their markers.

154
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:56,530
This ain't
a scary place, Ellie.

155
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:59,830
It's a place of rest
and speaking.

156
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:02,097
Can you remember that?

157
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,502
Yes, sir.

158
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:05,839
Shh.

159
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:06,840
Shh.

160
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:14,441
Hi, babe.

161
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:16,451
Daddy, what if
Church dies?

162
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,479
What if he dies and has to go
to the pet cemetery?

163
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:24,082
Honey, Church
will be fine.

164
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,958
No, he won't.
Not in the end.

165
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:29,964
In the end
he's going to croak.

166
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:32,466
Lovey, Church
might still be alive

167
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:34,469
when you're
in high school,

168
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:36,971
and that's
a very long time.

169
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,473
It doesn't
seem long to me.

170
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,669
It seems short.

171
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:44,304
I'd let Church
live to be 100,

172
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,814
but I don't
make the rules.

173
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:48,315
Well, who does?

174
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:49,817
God, I suppose.

175
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:52,820
He's not God's cat,
he's my cat.

176
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:56,415
Let God get His own
if He wants one.

177
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:58,255
Not mine.

178
00:13:58,327 --> 00:13:59,851

Uh-oh!

184
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:39,992
I'm scared.

185
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,902
What if school here
isn't like in Chicago?

186
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:45,338
I'm scared.
I want to go home.

187
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:47,342
You'll be
all right, Ellie.

188
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,346
I don't want Church to get
his nuts cut, Daddy.

189
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:54,383
Good God, where
did you hear that?

190
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,815
Missy Dandridge.

191
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:57,819
She says
it's an operation.

192
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:00,822
Well, the road
is a lot more dangerous

193
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,085
than any operation.

194
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,593
Church will be
just the same.

195
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:07,094
Well, almost the same,

196
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:09,097
and we won't
have to worry

197
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:12,100
about him getting run over
by trucks.

198
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,760
He'll be all right.

199
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:15,269
You promise, Daddy?

200
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,539
Don't shilly-shally,
Louis.

201
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,939
Give the little girl
a promise.

202
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,107
Church will be fine.
I promise.

203
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:28,047
Yay!

204
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:36,289
Thank you.

205
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:37,791
Oh, you're very welcome.

But if anything does happen
while he's under the gas--

207
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:44,295
now, it's a 1 in a 1,000 shot,
but it does happen--

208
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:46,231

Got to go.

212
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,269
Going to get his--

213
00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:23,771
Nuts cut. Yes.

214
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,774
Thank you, Missy, for introducing
that colorful phrase

215
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:28,275
into my daughter's
vocabulary.

216
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:29,606
Don't mention it.

217
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:34,642
How's that bellyache
of yours?

218
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:36,685
No better. No worse.

219
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,948
I can take a look
at that.

220
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:42,956
It'll pass.

221
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:44,959
They always do.

222
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:53,533
Missy.

223
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:54,534
Ma'am.

224
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:01,807
Still friends, Doc?

225
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:14,822
I kissed you.

226
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,121
Have a great first day
at school, Doc.

227

Bye-bye.

What happened?

232
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:28,299
He got hit by a truck.

233
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,997
Oh, God, his head.

234
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:31,869
Hold him gently.

235
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:33,841
Didn't even stop.

There's so much blood!

What's going on?

Get Dr. Creed!

What's happened?

240
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:41,412
He got hit by a truck.

242
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:44,918
Get them all out of here.

Easy. Easy.

All right.
Everyone out, please.

245

Let the Doctors
do their work.

246
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:53,056
Let's clear
the room here.

247
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:54,561
Just clear out!

Yes, sir.

Get an ambulance here.

It's Pascow.

as a sprain today, my friend.

Because you tried
to help me.

you were dreaming?

you may feel you have to,

336
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:02,639
We can't climb
over that.

337
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:04,235
We'll break our necks.

338
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:05,279
No, we won't.

339
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:08,248
I've climbed it
a time or two before.

340
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:10,477
I know where to step.

341
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,287
Just follow me.

342
00:27:14,823 --> 00:27:16,415
Move easy.

343
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:21,428
Don't look down...

344
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:23,760
and don't stop.

345
00:27:23,832 --> 00:27:25,663
If you stop,

346
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:27,861
you'll crash through
for sure.

347
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:39,903
Just don't stop, and...

348
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:43,275
Whoa!

349
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,852
And don't look down.
Right.

350
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:53,394
Louis, you all right?

351
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:54,655
Yeah.

352
00:27:54,729 --> 00:27:58,495
I just lost my happy thoughts there
for a second.

353
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,000
Whoo!

354
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,644
Not much farther now.

355
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:16,411
[loon cries]

356
00:28:16,484 --> 00:28:18,577
[rumbling]

357
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:20,746
Jud, what's that?

358
00:28:20,822 --> 00:28:22,813
Shh!

359
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:24,984
[rumbling]

360
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,689
[loon cries[

361
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:32,866
Just a loon, that's all.

362
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:38,838
Here we go.

363
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:41,273
Won't be
much longer now.

364
00:28:56,424 --> 00:28:58,858
Just down here
a little ways.

365
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:16,639
Almost there, Louis.

366
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,474
You keep saying that.

367
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:20,480
This time I mean it.

368
00:29:35,563 --> 00:29:37,224
What is this place?

369
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:42,058
This was
their burial ground.

370
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,002
Whose burial ground?

371
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:47,974
Micmac Indians.

372
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:53,180
I brought you here
to bury Ellen's cat.

373
00:29:53,248 --> 00:29:55,216
Why, for God's sake?

374
00:29:57,085 --> 00:29:59,519
I said why, Jud?

375
00:29:59,587 --> 00:30:01,077
I had my reasons.

376
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:06,022
The soil's thin,

377
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:07,686
but you'll manage.

378
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,696
I'm going to sit
over yonder

379
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:11,197
and have a smoke.

380
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:12,699
I'd help you,

381
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:15,201
but you got
to do it yourself.

382
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,238
Each buries his own.

383
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:32,014
Uhh!

384
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:06,610
[telephone rings]

385
00:31:09,257 --> 00:31:11,817

[ring]

388
00:31:21,436 --> 00:31:22,528
Shit.

389
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:25,030
Louis?

390
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:27,373
Louis?

391
00:31:27,442 --> 00:31:28,534
Yeah.

392
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:33,080
When you talk
to them,

393
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:36,117
not one word
about what we done tonight.

394
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:39,153
What did we do
tonight, Jud?

395
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:50,056
What we did, Louis,
was a...

396
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,065
secret thing.

397
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:57,066
Women are supposed
to be the ones

398
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:59,572
who are good
at keeping secrets.

399
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:02,508
Any woman who knows anything
will tell you

400
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:06,343
she's never seen
into a man's heart.

401
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:09,349
The soil of a man's
heart, Louis,

402
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:10,850
is stonier,

403
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,183
like the soil
up there

404
00:32:13,254 --> 00:32:15,654
in the old Micmac
burying ground.

405
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:44,380
Goldman residence.

406
00:32:44,452 --> 00:32:45,384
Hi, Dory.

407
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:46,886
It's, uh, Louis.

408
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:49,389
You want to talk
to your daughter?

409
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:53,086
Yeah. That would
be real fine.

410
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:54,492
Hi, Daddy.

411
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:55,893
Hi, baby.

412
00:32:55,964 --> 00:32:57,727
How's everything
in Chicagoland?

413
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:01,235
Grandma and Grandpa
gave me lots of neat things.

414
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:02,667
How's Church, Daddy?

415
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:04,227
Does he miss me?

416
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:07,499
Well...

417
00:33:07,575 --> 00:33:09,509
I--I guess
he's just fine.

418
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:12,011
I haven't seen him
this evening.

419
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,015
Make sure you put him
in the cellar

420
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,018
so he won't run out
in the road.

421
00:33:18,086 --> 00:33:20,714
Kiss him good night
for me.

422
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:22,847
Yuck.

423
00:33:22,924 --> 00:33:25,051
Kiss your own cat.

424
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:30,192
Want to talk to Gage?

425
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:32,028
Yeah.

426
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,738
Hi, Daddy.
I love you.

427
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:42,936
Hi, Daddy.
I love you.

428
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:16,539
Aah!

429
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:20,046
Jesus.

430
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:22,642
Church.

431
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:33,193
[tapping bowl]

432
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:35,024
Food, Church.

433
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:36,461
[tapping bowl]

434
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:38,021
[meow]

435

[tapping bowl]

436
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:40,994
Food.

437
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:46,870
Come on, Church.
Chow down.

438
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,976
Come on, Church.

439
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:50,976
[meow]

440
00:34:58,453 --> 00:34:59,886
Christ.

441
00:34:59,954 --> 00:35:02,479
I don't believe this.

442
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:04,491
[meow]

443
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,026
You stink, Church.

444
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:10,163
Hold on a second.

445
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:12,665
God, he chewed
his way out.

446
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,003
Jesus, boy.

447
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:18,436
Christ.

448
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:21,734
Damn it.

449
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:35,689
I tried to tell myself

450
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:37,691
that I buried him
alive.

451
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:40,685
I'm not a vet.

452
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:42,195
It was dark.

453
00:35:42,263 --> 00:35:43,696
Sure, it was dark.

454
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:46,529
But his head swiveled
on his neck

455
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:49,536
like it was full
of ball bearings.

456
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:53,540
When you moved him,
he pulled out of the frost.

457
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:57,544
Sounded like a piece of tape
coming off a letter.

458
00:35:57,612 --> 00:35:59,546
Live things
don't do that.

459
00:35:59,614 --> 00:36:02,981
You stop melting the frost
under where you're laying

460
00:36:03,051 --> 00:36:05,281
when you're dead.

461
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:08,015
Well, I feel like
I'm going crazy.

462
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:18,331
It was the ragman that told me
about the place.

463
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,832
He was half Micmac.

464
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:23,337
He knew how I felt
about my dog Spot.

465
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:26,840
Spot had got caught in barbed wire
that infected.

466
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:30,344
When he died,
I thought I was going to die.

467
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:36,350
Ragman did for me
what I did for you last night.

468
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:39,352
Only I wasn't alone
when Spot came back.

469
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,445
My mother was with me.

470
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:45,822
You could still see
the barbed wire marks on him.

471
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:47,258
[grrr]

472
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:49,762
Jud, come and get
Your dog!

473
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:53,289
He stinks of the ground
you buried him in!

474
00:36:53,368 --> 00:36:54,266
Jud!

475
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:55,267
[barking]

476
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:57,099
Spot came back,
all right.

477
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:58,103
Spot!

478
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:01,369
He wasn't quite
the same dog I knew.

479
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:02,374
Spot.

480
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:04,877
When he died
that second time,

481
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:07,881
I buried him there
in the pet cemetery

482
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:10,008
where his bones
still lie.

483
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:13,520
A man doesn't always
know why he does things.

484
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:15,522
I think I did it

485
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,524
'cause your daughter
ain't ready

486
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:20,026
for her favorite pet
to die.

487
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:23,530
Maybe with more time,
she'll learn what death really is,

488
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:25,964
which is where
the pain stops

489
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:27,933
and the good memories
begin.

490
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:30,994
Has anyone ever buried a person
up there?

491
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:34,739
Christ
on His throne, no.

492
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,640
And who ever would?

493
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:40,465
Oh!

494
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:44,142
[grrr]

495
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:48,013
Shit.

496
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:51,017
How the hell
did you get in here?

497
00:38:53,888 --> 00:38:55,321
Out!

498
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:57,618
Uh! Ow!

499
00:38:58,759 --> 00:38:59,953
Out!

500
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:09,803
Bye-bye, Ellie.
Watch your step now.

501
00:39:11,873 --> 00:39:12,965
Daddy!

502
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,974
Hi, sugar!

503
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:16,304
Come here.

504
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:20,404
Mmm.

505
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:22,745
Hi, Daddy.

506
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:27,150
Daddy, is Church
all right?

507
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:28,483
Yes.

508
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:29,989
I guess so.

509
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:33,720
He was asleep on the porch
when I left.

510
00:39:33,794 --> 00:39:35,227
There you go.

511
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:38,231
I dreamed he got
hit by a car,

512
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:42,736
and you and Mr. Crandall buried him
in the pet cemetery.

513
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:45,567
That was a silly dream,
wasn't it?

514
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,835
Is he really all right?

515
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:49,934
Yes.

516
00:39:51,746 --> 00:39:52,678
Hi, honey.

517
00:39:52,747 --> 00:39:56,012
You want to take
your son, Doc?

518
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,675
Oh.

519
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:59,014
Hey.

520
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:09,295
[meow]

521
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:11,695
Phew. You smell bad.

522
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:19,863
Can cats have shampoos?

523
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,309
You have to take them

524
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:24,810
to someone
who grooms animals,

525
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:26,437
and it's pretty expensive.

526
00:40:26,514 --> 00:40:30,416
I'll save my allowance
and pay for it.

527
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:33,044
Church smells bad.

528
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:39,492
I'll cough up
the money, Ellen.

529
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,687
I hate that smell.

530
00:40:41,762 --> 00:40:43,354
Yes.

531
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:45,023
I hate it, too.

532
00:41:48,562 --> 00:41:50,689
May the Lord
bless you and keep you.

533
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:55,501
May the Lord make His face
to shine upon you

534
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:57,366
and comfort you

535
00:41:57,438 --> 00:41:59,030
and lift you up

536
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:01,006
and give you peace.

537
00:42:01,075 --> 00:42:02,372
Amen.

538
00:42:02,443 --> 00:42:03,910
- Amen.
- Amen.

539
00:42:09,817 --> 00:42:11,250
Rachel not feeling well?

540
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:13,752
Just a touch of the flu.

541
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:15,254
She's been throwing up

542
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:17,256
ever since
Mrs. Rogers called

543
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:18,757
and said
Mrs. Dandridge--

544
00:42:18,826 --> 00:42:19,815
That's enough, Ellen.

545
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:25,757
Poor Missy.

546
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:29,166
I don't know why God
takes someone like her,

547
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:32,171
who should still
have a bunch of years,

548
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,140
and lets an old fart
like me go on and on.

549
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:38,042
My father used
to have a saying, Jud.

550
00:42:38,112 --> 00:42:40,740
God sees the truth...

551
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:43,441
but waits.

552
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:44,449
Ayuh.

553
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:47,112
How's your cat, Louis?

554
00:42:47,188 --> 00:42:48,849
It's Ellie's cat.

555
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:49,855
No.

556
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:52,188
It's your cat now.

557
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:00,533
Possibly more dolphins
have beached

558
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:01,966
or stranded themselves

559
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:04,834
along the eastern
Maine coast,

560
00:43:04,905 --> 00:43:07,032
and scientists
don't know why.

561
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,144
[meow]

562
00:43:11,212 --> 00:43:12,645
What's up, sugar?

563
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:13,907
Daddy,

564
00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:16,506
did Missy Dandridge
go to heaven?

565
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,314
Do you want
to talk about it?

566
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:25,017
Is Missy in heaven,
do you think?

567
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:27,185
I don't know, honey.

568
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:30,196
Different people believe
all sorts of different things.

569
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:32,698
Some believe
in heaven or hell.

570
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:35,702
Some think we come back
as little children,

571
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,762
and some think
we just wink out,

572
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,798
like a candle flame when
the wind blows hard.

573
00:43:42,877 --> 00:43:44,640
Do you believe that?

574
00:43:50,618 --> 00:43:51,846
No.

575
00:43:53,454 --> 00:43:55,479
I think we go on.

576
00:43:59,627 --> 00:44:01,322
Yeah.

577
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:03,295
I have faith in that.

578
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:05,025
You believe in it.

579
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,794
Give me a kiss.

580
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:14,534
What do you want
to watch?

581
00:44:29,423 --> 00:44:32,085
I heard you
and Ellie tonight.

582
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,093
I thought
you might have.

583
00:44:34,161 --> 00:44:37,597
I know you don't
approve of the subject.

584
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:39,530
I just get scared.

585
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:42,958
And you know me.

586
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:45,537
When I get scared,

587
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:47,506
I get defensive.

588
00:44:47,575 --> 00:44:49,008
Scared of what?

589
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:50,441
Dying?

590
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,008
My sister Zelda--

591
00:44:58,085 --> 00:45:00,679
I know. She died.
spinal meningitis.

592
00:45:02,556 --> 00:45:06,424
She was in the back bedroom
like a dirty secret.

593
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:12,024
My sister died
in the back bedroom,

594
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:14,567
and that's
what she was...

595
00:45:14,635 --> 00:45:16,660
a dirty secret.

596
00:45:17,738 --> 00:45:18,898
I had to...

597
00:45:18,973 --> 00:45:20,634
I had to feed her
sometimes.

598
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,643
I hated it,
but I did it.

599
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:26,573
We wanted her to die.

600
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:30,174
We wished...
for her to be dead.

601
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:34,754
It wasn't just so
she wouldn't feel pain.

602
00:45:34,822 --> 00:45:38,121
It was so we wouldn't
feel any more pain.

603
00:45:38,192 --> 00:45:40,956
She started to look
like this monster.

604
00:45:41,028 --> 00:45:43,963
Even now, I wake up
and I think,

605
00:45:44,031 --> 00:45:47,057
is Zelda dead yet?

606
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:50,195
Is she?

607
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,805
My parents were gone
when she died.

608
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:57,867
Rachel...

609
00:45:57,945 --> 00:46:00,436
Ha ha ha.

610
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:05,448
She started to...

611
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:06,952
She started
to convulse...

612
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:08,249
and I thought...

613
00:46:08,322 --> 00:46:09,254
I thought...

614
00:46:09,323 --> 00:46:11,757
Oh, my God,
she's choking.

615
00:46:11,825 --> 00:46:12,757
Zelda's choking.

616
00:46:12,826 --> 00:46:14,817
And they'll come home,

617
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:17,830
and they'll say I
murdered her by choking.

618
00:46:17,898 --> 00:46:20,332
They'll say,
"You hated her, Rachel,"

619
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:21,959
and that was true.

620
00:46:22,036 --> 00:46:24,971
They'll say,
"You wanted her to be dead."

621
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:26,802
That was true, too.

622
00:46:28,075 --> 00:46:29,838
And then she died.

623
00:46:31,612 --> 00:46:33,637
And I started to scream.

624
00:46:33,714 --> 00:46:36,012
I ran from
the house screaming,

625
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:38,381
"Zelda's dead! Zelda's dead!

626
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:39,384
Zelda's dead!"

627
00:46:39,453 --> 00:46:41,387
And the neighbors
came out

628
00:46:41,455 --> 00:46:43,218
and they--they looked.

629
00:46:44,425 --> 00:46:46,359
They thought
I was crying.

630
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:49,558
But you know something?

631
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,928
I think maybe...

632
00:46:53,267 --> 00:46:54,928
I was laughing.

633
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,915
If you were,
I salute you for it.

634
00:47:08,983 --> 00:47:10,917
If I needed
another reason

635
00:47:10,985 --> 00:47:12,919
not to like
your parents,

636
00:47:12,987 --> 00:47:14,318
I have one now.

637
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:17,824
You should never have been
left alone with her, Rachel.

638
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:18,823
Never.

639
00:47:18,892 --> 00:47:21,019
Where was a nurse?

640
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:22,528
They actually went out

641
00:47:22,596 --> 00:47:25,531
and left
an 8-year-old kid

642
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,829
in charge
of her dying sister

643
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:29,425
who was
probably insane.

644
00:47:29,503 --> 00:47:31,368
Where are you going?

645
00:47:31,438 --> 00:47:33,338
To get you a Valium.

646
00:47:33,407 --> 00:47:35,341
You know I don't take--

647
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:37,036
Tonight you do.

648
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:58,554
 Well, in my heart
I could be ready to go 

649
00:47:58,632 --> 00:48:02,124
 Get ready to go now 

650
00:48:02,202 --> 00:48:05,899
 Let's go,
let's go, go 

651
00:48:05,973 --> 00:48:06,905
Look!

652
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:07,906
He pulled.

653
00:48:07,975 --> 00:48:09,408
Daddy's flying a kite.

654
00:48:09,476 --> 00:48:10,807
Mommy, look!

655
00:48:10,878 --> 00:48:11,845
Watch it!

656
00:48:11,912 --> 00:48:13,345
There it goes.

657
00:48:13,414 --> 00:48:14,745
That's it, Louis.

658
00:48:14,815 --> 00:48:17,283
Go, Daddy.

659
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:19,615
Higher.
We want it higher.

660
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:21,153
Let Gage do it.

661
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:22,153
Here, buddy.

662
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:29,727
 God, she's so young 

663
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:33,255
 Sheena is
a punk rocker 

664
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:36,063
 Sheena is a punk rocker 

665
00:48:36,136 --> 00:48:38,434
 Sheena is
a punk rocker 

666
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:39,995
 Now 

667
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:43,499
 Sheena is-- 떰

668
00:48:45,145 --> 00:48:46,510
You're flying it.

669
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,013
There's the kite!

670
00:48:48,082 --> 00:48:49,515
You got it.

671
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,175
Gage is flying it.

672
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:53,185
Can I fly it now?

673
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:55,187
Let Gage
finish his turn.

674
00:48:56,423 --> 00:48:57,856
We gotted it.

675
00:48:57,925 --> 00:49:00,257
We got it.

676
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:01,692
The kite goes.

677
00:49:01,762 --> 00:49:02,990
Go ahead.

678
00:49:03,063 --> 00:49:05,224
Go ahead.
Run, buddy. Run.

679
00:49:07,234 --> 00:49:09,099
Gage is flying it.

680
00:49:09,169 --> 00:49:10,727
I'm flying it.

681
00:49:11,872 --> 00:49:14,272
That kite
is getting up there.

682
00:49:14,341 --> 00:49:15,706
Uh-oh.

683
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:20,207
It got away
from him, that numb shit.

684
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,113
Ellen...Creed!

685
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:25,083
Oh. I dropped it.

686
00:49:27,287 --> 00:49:29,721
Daddy, can I fly it now?

687
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,156
OK. In just a minute.

688
00:49:32,226 --> 00:49:34,217
I want to fly it.

689
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:36,728
Daddy, Daddy,
it's my turn now.

690
00:49:36,797 --> 00:49:39,425
All right.
Just a minute.

691
00:49:43,103 --> 00:49:46,038
Don't let him go
in the road, Louis!

692
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:48,597
Get him, Louis!
Get the baby!

693
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:50,302
Get the baby!

694
00:49:52,412 --> 00:49:54,107
Get the baby!

695
00:49:55,816 --> 00:49:56,748
Gage!

696
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:57,749
No!

697
00:49:57,818 --> 00:50:00,685
Gage!

698
00:50:14,768 --> 00:50:17,703
No!

699
00:50:18,772 --> 00:50:22,230
No!

700
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,939
No!

701
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:02,343
Sedative
finally took hold.

702
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:03,906
Rachel's asleep.

703
00:51:12,926 --> 00:51:16,362
I want to go back
to my own room.

704
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:18,364
I can't sleep with Mommy.

705
00:51:18,432 --> 00:51:20,957
She keeps
stealing the covers.

706
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:23,468
Ellie, what
you got there?

707
00:51:23,537 --> 00:51:24,469
Hmm?

708
00:51:24,538 --> 00:51:27,666
What you got there?
Let me see.

709
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:29,174
Can I see?

710
00:51:30,244 --> 00:51:33,338
Oh. Ain't that real nice?

711
00:51:33,413 --> 00:51:35,847
You pulling him
in the wagon.

712
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:38,282
Bet he liked that,
didn't he?

713
00:51:39,886 --> 00:51:42,320
I'm going to carry
this picture

714
00:51:42,389 --> 00:51:44,823
until God lets Gage
come back.

715
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:45,823
Ellie...

716
00:51:45,892 --> 00:51:48,383
God doesn't do
things like that.

717
00:51:48,462 --> 00:51:50,794
He can
if He wants to.

718
00:51:52,766 --> 00:51:56,202
I have to keep his things
waiting for him.

719
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:57,703
That's what I think.

720
00:52:00,107 --> 00:52:01,472
I've got his picture.

721
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:03,338
I'll sit in his chair--

722
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:04,570
Ellie.

723
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,615
Louis.

724
00:52:15,689 --> 00:52:18,123
Take care
Of your little girl.

725
00:52:18,191 --> 00:52:19,624
She needs you.

726
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:38,944
I knew something
like this would happen.

727
00:52:39,012 --> 00:52:41,446
I told her
when you married,

728
00:52:41,515 --> 00:52:44,450
you'll have all
the grief you can stand.

729
00:52:44,518 --> 00:52:45,917
Now, look at this.

730
00:52:45,986 --> 00:52:47,920
I hope you rot in hell!

731
00:52:47,988 --> 00:52:50,718
Where were you
while he played?

732
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:52,418
You stinking shit!

733
00:52:52,492 --> 00:52:54,858
You killer of children!

734
00:52:54,928 --> 00:52:56,020
Daddy!

735
00:52:56,096 --> 00:52:57,757
Ellie!

736
00:52:57,831 --> 00:52:59,321
Stop it!

737
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:01,697
You son of a bitch!

738
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:06,130
No!

739
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:08,766
No!

740
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:09,900
No!

741
00:53:09,976 --> 00:53:10,908
No!

742
00:53:10,977 --> 00:53:13,377
You son of a bitch!

743
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:14,744
You had no right!

744
00:53:14,815 --> 00:53:17,010
What's wrong with you?

745
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:19,751
It's your son's funeral.

746
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,482
Get a hold of yourself.

747
00:53:58,992 --> 00:54:00,459
Good night, Ellie.

748
00:54:03,497 --> 00:54:04,930
Good night, Daddy.

749
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:11,295
Daddy?

750
00:54:15,242 --> 00:54:18,609
God could take it back
if He wanted to,

751
00:54:18,678 --> 00:54:19,872
couldn't He?

752
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:23,211
If He really,
really wanted to.

753
00:54:25,452 --> 00:54:28,250
Can I have faith in that?

754
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:31,216
Yes.

755
00:54:32,793 --> 00:54:35,193
I suppose you can.

756
00:54:35,262 --> 00:54:37,662
Good night, Ellie.

757
00:54:51,812 --> 00:54:54,178
[rowr]

758
00:54:58,385 --> 00:55:00,046
[rowr]

759
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:04,579
Fuck off, hairball.

760
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:22,601
Mmm.

761
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,152
Mmm.

762
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:41,153
[rowr]

763
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:52,237
Jud, I buried
my son today.

764
00:55:54,808 --> 00:55:56,241
I'm very tired.

765
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:58,743
I wonder
If we could just--

766
00:55:58,812 --> 00:56:01,747
You're thinking thoughts
best not thought of.

767
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:06,084
I was thinking
about going to bed.

768
00:56:06,152 --> 00:56:09,087
I'm responsible for
more pain in your heart

769
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:11,089
than you should have
tonight.

770
00:56:11,157 --> 00:56:12,590
For all I know,

771
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:14,786
I may even
be responsible

772
00:56:14,861 --> 00:56:17,455
for the death
of your son.

773
00:56:17,531 --> 00:56:18,463
What?

774
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:25,560
Jud, you're talking crazy.

775
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:31,208
You are thinking of
putting him up there.

776
00:56:31,278 --> 00:56:32,711
Don't deny the thought

777
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:34,713
hadn't crossed
your mind, Louis.

778
00:56:39,286 --> 00:56:40,218
Louis...

779
00:56:47,794 --> 00:56:51,730
You asked me if anyone
had ever buried a person

780
00:56:51,798 --> 00:56:54,358
up there in
the Micmac grounds.

781
00:56:55,802 --> 00:56:58,771
I lied to you
when I said no.

782
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:00,567
It's been done.

783
00:57:01,942 --> 00:57:04,877
What you've been thinking of
has been done.

784
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:08,080
He was a local boy.

785
00:57:08,148 --> 00:57:12,084
It was towards the end
Of the Second World War.

786
00:57:12,152 --> 00:57:15,053
His name
was Timmy Baterman.

787
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:18,056
He was killed
on his way home

788
00:57:18,124 --> 00:57:20,058
from
the Second World War.

789
00:57:20,126 --> 00:57:23,061
His father Bill
was so grief-struck

790
00:57:23,129 --> 00:57:24,596
he buried his son
up there

791
00:57:24,664 --> 00:57:27,565
before he had the chance

792
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:30,228
to get to the bottom
of the truth.

793
00:57:30,303 --> 00:57:33,136
I'll bite, Jud.

794
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:38,077
What's the bottom
Of the truth?

795
00:57:38,144 --> 00:57:41,807
Well, that sometimes
dead is better.

796
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:44,315
The person
you put up there

797
00:57:44,384 --> 00:57:46,818
ain't the person
that comes back.

798
00:57:46,886 --> 00:57:49,320
It may look
like that person,

799
00:57:49,389 --> 00:57:51,289
but it ain't
that person.

800
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:52,723
'cause...

801
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:54,726
whatever lives
in the ground

802
00:57:54,794 --> 00:57:56,728
beyond the pet cemetery

803
00:57:56,796 --> 00:57:59,094
ain't human at all.

804
00:57:59,165 --> 00:58:01,827
Ha ha ha!

805
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:05,997
It was four or five days
after Timmy's funeral

806
00:58:06,072 --> 00:58:08,006
that Margie Washburn
seen Timmy

807
00:58:08,074 --> 00:58:11,009
walking up the road
towards Yorkie's Livery.

808
00:58:11,077 --> 00:58:12,510
As time went by...

809
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:13,671
Aah!

810
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:17,114
lots of folks saw Timmy
walking back and forth.

811
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:21,052
But it was Margie

812
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:24,056
who finally came
to us men folks

813
00:58:24,124 --> 00:58:27,059
and said it had
to be stopped.

814
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:29,561
She knew it was
an abomination.

815
00:58:31,264 --> 00:58:34,722
So us men sat down
and talked it out.

816
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:36,735
We got in my car

817
00:58:36,803 --> 00:58:39,738
and went to Baterman's
to take care of it,

818
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:41,239
one way or another.

819
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:42,740
There's no other way.

820
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:44,436
He's got to burn!

821
00:58:44,511 --> 00:58:46,945
You're wrecking my house!
Stop it!

822
00:58:47,013 --> 00:58:48,446
Timmy, stop it!

823
00:58:48,515 --> 00:58:49,880
Daddy.

824
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:51,473
The place's going up!

825
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:52,483
Go away!

826
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:54,986
Get out
While you still can, Bill!

827
00:58:55,055 --> 00:58:56,488
Bring out the cans.

828
00:58:56,556 --> 00:58:57,989
Igot them.

829
00:58:58,058 --> 00:58:58,990
Wait!

830
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:00,390
He's a monster, Bill.

831
00:59:01,561 --> 00:59:03,995
Leave us alone!

832
00:59:04,064 --> 00:59:05,497
He's my son!

833
00:59:05,565 --> 00:59:07,499
Come, Timmy.
Let's get out.

834
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:08,625
No, Dad.

835
00:59:08,702 --> 00:59:11,296
Hate living.

836
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:12,804
Come on, son!

837
00:59:12,872 --> 00:59:14,237
Timmy!

838
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:15,968
Aah! Timmy!

839
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:16,974
No, Dad!

840
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:18,635
Hate living.

841
00:59:18,712 --> 00:59:22,148
Louis, sometimes
dead is better.

842
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:24,308
The Indians knew that.

843
00:59:24,384 --> 00:59:26,318
They stopped using
that burial ground

844
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:29,514
when the ground
went sour.

845
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:31,250
Don't think
about doing it.

846
00:59:31,324 --> 00:59:33,189
The place gets holier,

847
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:34,692
but the place...

848
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:36,194
is evil.

849
00:59:38,498 --> 00:59:40,989
Sometimes,
dead is better.

850
00:59:42,769 --> 00:59:45,636
You see, Louis, what
I'm getting at here?

851
00:59:45,705 --> 00:59:46,637
You understand?

852
00:59:46,706 --> 00:59:49,140
You're telling me
that place knew

853
00:59:49,209 --> 00:59:51,040
Gage was going
to die?

854
00:59:52,445 --> 00:59:54,174
I'm saying...

855
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:58,383
that place might
have made Gage die

856
00:59:58,451 --> 01:00:01,887
because I introduced you
to the power.

857
01:00:01,955 --> 01:00:05,015
I may have murdered
your son, Louis.

858
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:15,033
This could
be the beginning

859
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:18,036
of patching things up
with your folks.

860
01:00:18,104 --> 01:00:21,039
If something good doesn't
come from Gage's death,

861
01:00:21,107 --> 01:00:22,039
I think...

862
01:00:24,577 --> 01:00:28,911
I don't want to go
to Chicago, Grandma Dory.

863
01:00:28,982 --> 01:00:30,347
Why not, darling?

864
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:32,782
I had a bad dream
last night.

865
01:00:32,852 --> 01:00:34,513
About what?

866
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:36,680
About Daddy...

867
01:00:36,756 --> 01:00:38,348
and Gage...

868
01:00:38,424 --> 01:00:40,392
and someone named Pax-cow.

869
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,394
You guys
better get going.

870
01:00:42,462 --> 01:00:44,896
You're going
to miss the boat.

871
01:00:44,964 --> 01:00:45,896
Louis.

872
01:00:47,433 --> 01:00:49,424
I am sorry.

873
01:00:49,502 --> 01:00:51,936
What can I say?
I lost my mind.

874
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:54,166
We all lost our minds.

875
01:01:06,786 --> 01:01:09,220
You take care
Of your mother.

876
01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:12,383
Come with us, please.

877
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:14,949
I'll be there in three days,
four at the most.

878
01:01:15,028 --> 01:01:16,893
Please, Daddy.
I'm scared.

879
01:01:16,963 --> 01:01:20,364
Everything's going
to be all right, Ellie.

880
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:22,162
Do you swear?

881
01:01:24,938 --> 01:01:26,337
I swear.

882
01:01:31,244 --> 01:01:32,677
Come on, Ellie.

883
01:01:32,745 --> 01:01:33,939
Let's go.

884
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:27,731
It's wrong.

885
01:02:29,302 --> 01:02:31,998
What happened
to you is wrong.

886
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:33,663
Remember, Doc.

887
01:02:35,241 --> 01:02:40,042
The barrier was not meant
to be crossed.

888
01:02:40,113 --> 01:02:43,480
The ground is sour.

889
01:02:54,594 --> 01:02:56,027
If it doesn't work...

890
01:02:59,098 --> 01:03:00,531
if he comes back...

891
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:06,204
and he's like Jud said
Timmy Baterman was,

892
01:03:06,272 --> 01:03:09,935
well, I'll just put him
back to sleep.

893
01:03:12,645 --> 01:03:15,113
They don't have to know.

894
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:19,715
Rachel and Ellie don't--
don't ever have to know.

895
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:23,318
[Ellie crying]

896
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:27,655
Mommy.

897
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:29,718
Mo-Mommy.

898
01:03:29,796 --> 01:03:32,060
Ohh, Mommy!

899
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:33,723
Mommy.

900
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,994
Mommy!

901
01:03:35,068 --> 01:03:36,000
Mom-Mommy!

902
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:38,003
You had a bad dream.

903
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:39,197
That's all.

904
01:03:39,272 --> 01:03:41,206
You know that,
don't you?

905
01:03:41,274 --> 01:03:42,707
It wasn't a dream.

906
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:44,640
It was Pax-cow.

907
01:03:44,711 --> 01:03:47,680
Pax-cow says Daddy will
do something really bad.

908
01:03:47,747 --> 01:03:49,180
Who is Pax-cow?

909
01:03:49,248 --> 01:03:51,682
Is he like
the bogeyman?

910
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:53,275
He's a ghost.

911
01:03:53,353 --> 01:03:54,786
He's a good ghost.

912
01:03:54,854 --> 01:03:57,652
He says he's sent
to warn us.

913
01:03:57,724 --> 01:04:01,182
He says he was near Daddy
because they were together

914
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,160
when his soul was...

915
01:04:03,229 --> 01:04:06,528
dis-- dis--

916
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:10,261
I can't remember.

917
01:04:10,336 --> 01:04:11,769
Shh. Listen to me.

918
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:13,772
There are
no ghosts, Ellie.

919
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,307
There are no ghosts.

920
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:17,809
Now sleep and forget
this nonsense.

921
01:04:17,877 --> 01:04:19,310
Do you hear me?

922
01:04:20,847 --> 01:04:24,783
Would you at least call
and make sure Daddy's OK?

923
01:04:24,851 --> 01:04:26,819
Of course I will.

924
01:04:51,344 --> 01:04:54,279
Pax-cow? Where do
I know that name?

925
01:04:54,347 --> 01:04:56,076
Pascow.

926
01:04:56,149 --> 01:04:58,242
Pascow?

927
01:04:58,317 --> 01:04:59,750
Was she saying Pascow?

928
01:04:59,819 --> 01:05:02,754
[Ellie]
He was trying to help me

929
01:05:02,822 --> 01:05:04,756
because Daddy
was helping him

930
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:06,689
when his soul dis-dis...

931
01:05:06,759 --> 01:05:08,727
Discorporated.

932
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:20,036
I'm going
to bust you out, son.

933
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,379
[telephone rings]

934

[ring]

935
01:05:48,134 --> 01:05:49,567
He's not home.

936
01:05:50,803 --> 01:05:53,237
Probably went out
for a hamburger

937
01:05:53,306 --> 01:05:54,739
or a chicken dinner.

938
01:05:54,807 --> 01:05:57,742
You know how men are
when they're alone.

939
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:01,806

[ring]

941
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,978
Hello?

942
01:06:09,055 --> 01:06:10,488
Hello, Jud.
It's Rachel.

943
01:06:10,556 --> 01:06:11,989
I'm calling
from Chicago.

944
01:06:12,058 --> 01:06:12,990
Chicago?

945
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:14,492
Is Louis with you?

946
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,358
No. We're going
to be here a while.

947
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:19,330
He needed a few days

948
01:06:19,398 --> 01:06:21,832
to close things up
back there.

949
01:06:21,901 --> 01:06:24,836
I just wondered
if he was with you.

950
01:06:24,904 --> 01:06:26,804
No.

951
01:06:26,873 --> 01:06:28,807
But if he drops by,

952
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:31,639
I'll tell him
to call you.

953
01:06:31,711 --> 01:06:33,406
Don't bother.
I'm coming home.

954
01:06:33,479 --> 01:06:35,879
Rachel, no.
You don't want to do that.

955
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:37,381
I have to do it, Jud.
Good-bye.

956
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:38,417
[dial tone]

957
01:06:38,484 --> 01:06:41,510
Rachel! Rachel!

958
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:08,773
You've done it,
you stupid old man.

959
01:08:08,841 --> 01:08:11,776
Now you got to undo it.

960
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:36,529
Oh, Gage.

961
01:08:43,843 --> 01:08:47,108
It's going
to be all right.

962
01:08:47,179 --> 01:08:50,478
I swear it's going
to be all right.

963
01:09:51,043 --> 01:09:55,673
I'm coming
for you, Rachel.

964
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,608
And this time...

965
01:10:02,188 --> 01:10:04,281
I'll get you.

966
01:10:06,392 --> 01:10:13,958
Gage and I will get you

967
01:10:14,033 --> 01:10:17,764
for letting us die.

968
01:10:22,141 --> 01:10:24,575
Good evening again,
ladies and gentlemen.

969
01:10:24,643 --> 01:10:27,077
We've had
a strong tailwind,

970
01:10:27,146 --> 01:10:30,411
and we expect to arrive
at Boston's Logan Airport

971
01:10:30,483 --> 01:10:31,916
almost on time.

972
01:10:31,984 --> 01:10:32,916
Thank God.

973
01:10:38,724 --> 01:10:39,588
Excuse me.

01:10:39,658 --> 01:10:40,590
Sorry.

01:10:40,659 --> 01:10:41,591
Excuse me.

01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:49,827
Excuse me.

977
01:10:54,006 --> 01:10:54,938
Excuse me.

978
01:10:55,007 --> 01:10:56,201
Excuse me.

979
01:10:56,275 --> 01:10:57,207
Excuse me.

980
01:10:57,276 --> 01:10:58,903
Excuse me.

981
01:11:03,616 --> 01:11:05,982
Don't do that, babe.

982
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:09,787
- Make it wait.
- I can't.

983
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:12,346
All right.
I'll call the pilot.

984
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:07,807
I'm not going to stop,
Gage.

985
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,314
I'm not
going to look down.

986
01:12:44,517 --> 01:12:46,451
I'm sorry.
It's been busy.

987
01:12:46,519 --> 01:12:48,111
I don't have anything.

988
01:12:48,187 --> 01:12:51,452
What about the Aries K
with the scratched side?

989
01:12:51,524 --> 01:12:53,458
I do have an Aries K,

990
01:12:53,526 --> 01:12:55,960
but it came in
beat up

991
01:12:56,028 --> 01:12:57,655
with a long scrape.

992
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:00,290
I'll take it.

993
01:13:00,366 --> 01:13:03,824
OK. Major credit card
and a license.

See?

996
01:13:45,611 --> 01:13:47,511
Just imagination.

997
01:14:18,877 --> 01:14:20,208
Aah!

998
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,863
Now what?

999
01:14:39,932 --> 01:14:41,866
It's trying
to stop you.

1000
01:14:41,934 --> 01:14:43,367
Do you hear me?

1001
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:45,403
It's trying
to stop you.

1002
01:14:55,848 --> 01:14:57,338
Is anyone there?

1003
01:15:16,535 --> 01:15:19,060
Come back to me, Gage.

1004
01:15:22,975 --> 01:15:24,670
Come back to us.

01:38:47,978 --> 01:38:50,913

[ring]

1186
01:39:14,038 --> 01:39:16,438
Darling.

1187
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:35,892
Aah!

1188
01:39:42,466 --> 01:39:45,663
 Under the arc
of a weather-stained bone 

1189
01:39:45,736 --> 01:39:48,899
 Ancient goblins
amble alone 

1190
01:39:48,973 --> 01:39:52,204
 Come out of the ground
not making a sound 

1191
01:39:52,276 --> 01:39:55,507
 The smell of death
is all around 

1192
01:39:55,579 --> 01:39:58,673
 And at night when
the cold wind blows 

1193
01:39:58,749 --> 01:40:03,777
 No one cares,
nobody knows 

1194
01:40:04,989 --> 01:40:07,822
 I don't want
to be buried 

1195
01:40:07,892 --> 01:40:11,760
 In a pet sematary 

1196
01:40:11,829 --> 01:40:16,027
 I don't want
to live my life again 

1197
01:40:18,002 --> 01:40:20,869
 I don't want
to be buried 

1198
01:40:20,938 --> 01:40:24,738
 In a pet sematary 

1199
01:40:24,808 --> 01:40:29,074
 I don't want
to live my life again 

1200
01:40:31,448 --> 01:40:34,542
 Fallen victim
to the sacred place 

1201
01:40:34,618 --> 01:40:37,587
 Just seen a grin
I can't escape 

1202
01:40:37,655 --> 01:40:40,988
 Old empty things,
the clicking of bones 

1203
01:40:41,058 --> 01:40:44,391
 Spirits moaning
among the tombstones 

1204
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:47,555
 And at night
when the moon is bright 

1205
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:52,330
 Someone cries,
something ain't right 

1206
01:40:53,971 --> 01:40:56,599
 I don't want
to be buried 

1207
01:40:56,674 --> 01:41:00,405
 In a pet sematary 

1208
01:41:00,477 --> 01:41:04,880
 I don't want
to live my life again 

1209
01:41:06,984 --> 01:41:09,612
 I don't want
to be buried 

1210
01:41:09,687 --> 01:41:13,418
 In a pet sematary 

1211
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:17,824
 I don't want
to live my life again 

1212
01:41:32,943 --> 01:41:36,379
 The moon is full,
the air is still 

1213
01:41:36,447 --> 01:41:39,541
 All of a sudden,
I feel a chill 

1214
01:41:39,617 --> 01:41:42,711
 Victorious grinning
faces writhing away 

1215
01:41:42,786 --> 01:41:46,119
 Skeleton dance,
I curse these days 

1216
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:49,250
 And at night
when the wolves cry out 

1217
01:41:49,326 --> 01:41:54,423
 Listen close, then
you can hear me shout 

1218
01:41:55,633 --> 01:41:58,500
 I don't want
to be buried 

1219
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:02,403
 In a pet sematary 

1220
01:42:02,473 --> 01:42:06,671
 I don't want
to live my life again 

1221
01:42:08,679 --> 01:42:11,375
 I don't want
to be buried 

1222
01:42:11,448 --> 01:42:15,407
 In a pet sematary 

1223
01:42:15,486 --> 01:42:19,547
 I don't want
to live my life again 

1224
01:42:20,991 --> 01:42:22,549
 Oh, no 

1225
01:42:24,361 --> 01:42:26,693
 Oh, no 

1226
01:42:26,764 --> 01:42:32,862
 I don't want to live my life
not again
