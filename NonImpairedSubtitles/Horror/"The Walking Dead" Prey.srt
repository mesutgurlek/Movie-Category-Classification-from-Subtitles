00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:20,567
We'll have to eliminate

a way out.

54
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:53,588
What about everything
we talked about?

55
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,424
Beating this thing?
Clawing our way back?

Look, this business

But the people at the prison...

What?

00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:07,953
Hmm?

00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:10,438
- I should move on?
- Yes.

it's all that matters.

72

There is no deal.
Philip's asked for Michonne.

73
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,144
Rick would never agree to that.

her over or not,

to get out of there.

No.

You'll never get close to him.

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,518
The Governor, he is not
what he seems to be.

169
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,887
- He seems pretty straight up to me.
- That's what I thought, too.

170
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:42,573
But I'm telling you,
he has done terrible things.

171
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:44,558
He's planning worse.

172
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,111
I've got to get out of here
and you should, too.

173
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:50,064
Look, you're rattled,
exhausted.

174
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:52,200
Just put the knife down.

175
00:13:53,452 --> 00:13:55,569
I'm going.

176
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:02,877
Okay.

177
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:16,557
We shouldn't have let her go.

178
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:19,110
What do you want me
to do, shoot her?

179
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:30,547
- You should have stopped her.
- Stop her how?

180
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,549
- Shoot her in the back?
- No, you did the right thing.

181
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,050
Thank God neither
of you were hurt.

182
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:36,436
We stand on that wall
to stop biters,

183
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,739
not keep people in.

184
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,858
This isn't
a prison camp, is it?

185
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:45,228
Of course not. It's just she's in
no shape to take care of herself.

186
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:47,397
Seems pretty capable to me.

187
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,451
She was out there all winter

188
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,920
alone.

189
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,041
Can you imagine?

190
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:03,913
Now, you two had each other
or your friends.

191
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:06,516
She only had the biters.

192
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:10,937
We brought her in
and tried to help her,

193
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:12,439
but it was too late.

194
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,975
She'd been out there too long.

195
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:20,230
Did she--
did she say anything?

196
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:25,902
- Like what?
- I don't know.

197
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:27,571
Like what panicked her?

198
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,792
No.

199
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:36,129
I hope this doesn't affect us.

200
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,783
What do you mean?

201
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:43,953
Well, we heard she was
with that prison group.

202
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:46,807
I hope I didn't
complicate things.

203
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:48,925
No. No.

204
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:51,761
Um, look, I'll tell you what.

205
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:54,964
Martinez here could use
a hand with something.

206
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:57,133
If you wouldn't mind helping
him out, I'd appreciate it.

207
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:59,486
- Of course.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

208
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:07,277
<i>( door opens )</i>

209
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,667
Is she gone?

210
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:17,504
They going after her?

211
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,155
No.

212
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:21,157
I am.

213
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:24,928
Oh.

214
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:26,630
You have a problem
with that, too?

215
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,351
Let her go.

216
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:33,720
Why would I do that?

217
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,672
She just wants
to be with her people.

218
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,677
You talked to her?

219
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:42,812
No.

220
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,199
You did.

221
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,851
You knew she was leaving,
didn't you?

222
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:50,871
She told me.

223
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:54,824
What else did you two
talk about, huh?

224
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,743
Did you tell her
about the deal?

225
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:01,548
Did you tell her
about Michonne?

226
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:07,921
She knows, doesn't she?

227
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:18,881
( panting )

228
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:21,351
( walkers growling )

229
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:31,912
Hey.

230
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:34,080
Be ready to roll in a few.

231
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:36,283
Where to?

232
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:38,451
We're not going
after that girl, are we?

233
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:40,453
What if we were?
Is that a problem?

234
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:42,422
She was pretty shook up.

235
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:44,124
She definitely
didn't want to be here.

236
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,410
Look, she's on her own,
understood?

237
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:49,746
We got something else.

238
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:51,548
It's sort of hard to explain.

239
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,883
Just be at the truck in five.

240
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,419
- Okay.
- What girl?

241
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,271
Andrea jumped the wall.

242
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:01,057
On your watch?
And you let her go?

243
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:03,760
Hey, man, these guys
have been talking.

244
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:05,261
She's trouble.

245
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:07,063
Maybe she's not the issue.

246
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:11,651
She said some
pretty crazy shit.

247
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:14,955
You know why?
'Cause she's crazy.

248
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:17,607
Hey, don't screw this
up for us.

249
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:20,410
- I'm just looking out.
- For you two, maybe.

250
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,629
What the hell
are you talking about?

251
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,464
We got a good thing here.

252
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:26,967
I don't want to get
tossed out because of you.

253
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:31,504
These guys are on edge.

254
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:34,140
They've been attacked by that crazy-ass
cowboy and some chick with a sword.

255
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:35,925
Shit's going down
and you're making waves.

256
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:37,978
We just have to get
with the program.

257
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:40,313
I am.

258
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,599
That guy doesn't trust you.

259
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,684
Do not screw this up.

260
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,969
Ease back, man.

261
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:50,156
Or what?

262
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:52,993
You need to shame me
in front of my boy again?

263
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:55,645
Don't go there, man.

264
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:58,198
Donna...

265
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,617
I just happened to be there.

266
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:03,203
- It could have been anyone.
- But it wasn't, was it?

267
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:06,189
- It was you.
- You want to do this now?

268
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,825
A long time coming.

269
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,344
You guys catch up.

270
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:13,129
Come on, Ben.

271
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,669
Yeah, it was me.
I saved her life.

272
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,721
Right place, right time.

273
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:24,357
And from that moment, she was
glued to you like a lost puppy.

274
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:27,110
Her knight in shining armor.

275
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,145
It made me feel like...

276
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:33,483
- I could have done it.
- I know you could've.

277
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:35,285
- She didn't.
- Of course she did.

278
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:38,688
She knew that.
She was just scared, that's all.

279
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,710
This ain't got nothing
to do with you or me.

280
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:47,029
Yo, I said five.

281
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,031
Let's go.
Fire it up.

282
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:50,667
We ain't done.

283
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:52,836
( engine starts )

284
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,390

Shit.

292
00:21:23,811 --> 00:21:25,295
Sasha:
What is that?

293
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:26,963
Martinez:
Jackpot, baby.

294
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,150
This some kind
of extermination?

295
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:32,802
You could say that.
No weeding out today, Shump.

296
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:34,988
- The more the merrier.
- All right.

297
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:37,307
You got a use for them?

298
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:38,775
Honey, we got a use
for everything.

299
00:21:43,147 --> 00:21:46,616
This got something to do with that meeting
tomorrow? The one with the prison group?

300
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:50,253
Ho, ho, ho.
Get that man a prize.

301
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:53,090
- You're bringing biters?
- Allen, heads up.

302
00:21:53,091 --> 00:21:54,875
Okay, this is genius.

303
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:57,827
Hey, kid, grab the collars
out of the truck.

304
00:21:57,828 --> 00:21:59,829
This ain't right.

305
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,548
Didn't think we were gonna
have any problems today, fella.

306
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,350
I didn't think we'd be
feeding people to biters.

307
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:06,169
What do you care?
They're rats.

308
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,055
This is sick.

309
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:10,974
Hey, give me a hand here.
Ty, you deaf?

310
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:13,176
I'm not doing this.

311
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:15,178
They got women and children.

312
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,646
You can't do this.

313
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:18,014
Fine, suit yourself.

314
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,983
We get back,
you tell the Governor.

315
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:22,369
He'll send you packing.
Send you all packing.

316
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,038
- There's no need for that. Damn it.
- Relax.

317
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,908
We looked out for each other.
We'll do it again.

318
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:30,794
We'll get out of your way
if that's what you want.

319
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:34,047
You don't speak for us.
You're not sending my boy out there again.

320
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:37,551
- I look out for him.
- Like you looked out for Donna?

321
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,004
( grunts )

322
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:45,175
- Sasha: <i>Tyreese!</i>
<i>- Leave him alone!</i>

00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:47,010
Get off me!

00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:51,681
Do it.

325
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:55,402
Go on!

326
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,074
Please.

327
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,331
Go on!

328
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:15,705
You okay?

329

Got a few shit stirrers

You know, people are more
afraid of a biter on a leash

than a gun in their face.

417

It's pretty effective.

00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:35,685
Then why didn't your man
just say that?

433
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,164
Never been better.

434
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:17,286
It's a real shame
about the pits.

You heard about that, huh?

436
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:24,927
I hope you find out who did it.

Already have.
