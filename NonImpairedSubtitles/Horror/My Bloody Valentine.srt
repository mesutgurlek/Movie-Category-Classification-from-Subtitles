1 
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:28,551 
Not sure of the 
induced collapse, 

2 
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:31,180 
team of specialists working in 
the causes of the accident. 

3 
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:36,604 
But I assure you that we do 
possible 

4 
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,050 
dropped to the survivors. 

5 
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:43,315 
Calm down children 
routine matter. 

6 
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:48,517 
Harry is the only survivor may be 
able to report on the incident. 

7 
00:00:49,986 --> 00:00:53,824 
He claims that he is responsible 
But it was an accident. 

8 
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:57,800 
Forget''to ventilation 
pipes'' 

9 
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:03,743 
Firefighters found 
5 corpses. 

10 
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:06,184 
For the survivors. 

11 
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:11,258 
Harry Gouornten the sole survivor 
the collapse in the mine. 

12 
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:14,692 
5 people killed by 
neglect of one. 

13 
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:16,111 
Murder? 

14 
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:18,581 
There was an accident death 
These 5 people 

15 
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:25,055 
Gouornten Harry was killed by 
the air to save himself. 

16 
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:29,620 
The evidence is strongly against 
Harry's death miners. 

17 
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:34,929 
The diagnosis is that Harry can be 
can never go out of his coma. 

18 
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,228 
God is not reserved for final 
Miracle at Gouornten Harry. 

19 
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,573 
We better go lower 
ready. 

20 
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:10,567 
- I did my job, Harry. 
-Do what I say! 

21 
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,756 
Belonging to the father 
mine do not hesitate to do so. 

22 
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,777 
Everybody now! 

23 
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,159 
My Bloody Valentine 
3D 

24 
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:27,723 
Happy fucking days 
of lovers. 

25 
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:32,005 
Sheriff here. 

26 
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,188 
I waited a long time 
Obtain a pension. 

27 
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:47,826 
The same, who did this? 

28 
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,803 
Harry Gouornten. 

29 
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,528 
Harry is Gouornten 
one of the parties. 

30 
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:54,919 
Probably woke up. 

31 
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,499 
Where the hell are you? 

32 
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,636 
We will find other 
for the feast. 

33 
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:27,999 
I said that we expect the 
Sarah and Tom. 

34 
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:31,430 
- The promised. 
- Oh my. 

35 
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:34,121 
We have broken the rules? 

36 
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:37,330 
So says Sarah 
is the love of his life. 

37 
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:40,707 
While, until the xanachalasoun. 

38 
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,252 
- I am stupid. 
- Yeah right. 

39 
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,244 
- Hi guys. 
- Hey! 

40 
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:08,400 
Thanks for waiting. 

41 
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:11,195 
Yes, another little doubt Axel 
He knew that the future tense. 

42 
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:13,676 
Hello. 

43 
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:16,212 
To get a picture? 

44 
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,593 
- No, thanks. 
- Come on! 

45 
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,027 
- Come on. 
- Are you sure? 

46 
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:22,395 
You are so beautiful together. 

47 
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:26,170 
The bird! 

48 
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:32,032 
- Would you? 
- No, not okay, go. 

49 
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,959 
- Ready to glentiseis? 
- Are you sure. 

50 
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,768 
We must go 
Tom if you do not. 

51 
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:53,937 
We believe that we 
a photograph. 

52 
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:59,223 
Great things will go 
later. 

53 
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:03,072 
You're right that it was inappropriate 
time. 

54 
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:09,969 
No matter, everyone is here 
with his desire. 

55 
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,968 
- Want to be here? 
- Yes 

56 
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:17,700 
- Are you sure? 
- Yes 

57 
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,192 
- I love you. 
- I. 

58 
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:29,523 
I forgot the beer in the car, 
Wait. 

59 
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:31,195 
I come back. 

60 
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,226 
- Can I come? 
- Do not go. 

61 
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:41,941 
Children! 

62 
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:53,905 
Axel? 

63 
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,628 
Peace? 
Where are you? 

64 
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:40,121 
With the passing of Harry 
Gouornten, check this out! 

65 
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:00,686 
Anyone? 

66 
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,727 
Tzeison? 

67 
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:13,688 
Tzeison you? 

68 
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,876 
See a scare! 

69 
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,533 
Come on. 

70 
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:27,348 
I go here! 

71 
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:08,698 
Go fuck! 

72 
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,847 
Fuck you listen to? 

73 
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:41,463 
Sarah? 

74 
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,253 
All died! 

75 
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,950 
Come on! Come on! 

76 
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:55,668 
Hurry! Run! 

77 
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:02,192 
Tom? No! 

78 
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:11,016 
My God! Tom! 

79 
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:43,094 
Stay Harry! 

80 
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,218 
Stay Harry! 

81 
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:19,532 
Tom? 

82 
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:22,821 
Tom? 

83 
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,687 
Come on, take it from here. 

84 
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:50,688 
by nirvana 

85 
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:51,697 
Hard to believe that this quiet 
Rokgouel and beautiful city, 

86 
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:53,915 
is the metropolis of murder 
of America. 

87 
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:57,609 
Now completed 10 years 
the day of love, 

88 
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,382 
10 years later. 

89 
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,128 
held the ugly 
crimes. 

90 
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,373 
When a miner, the 
Harry Gouornten committed a series of 

91 
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:07,458 
murder, killing 22 people 
including women and children, 

92 
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:10,563 
before finally buried alive 
mine once worked. 

93 
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:15,795 
But after 10 years the victims and the city 
able to overcome the shock? 

94 
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:19,351 
We are here with the Sheriff Axel 
Palmer said the following. 

95 
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:23,322 
That was was long ago, 
trying to look ahead. 

96 
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:28,076 
Sheriff not ever worry 
similar events occur? 

97 
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:31,481 
The media likes 
something. 

98 
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:34,017 
Because each time walking around? 

99 
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:35,979 
It's like a bad show ... 

100 
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:41,042 
And most ridiculous of all ... 

101 
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:45,520 
Sheriff do this tomorrow 
seems like a good community. 

102 
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:50,233 
- We are a beautiful community. 
- Enjoy your coffee? 

103 
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:55,642 
- Where is the joke? 
- You and the Sheriff Axel Palmer. 

104 
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:59,947 
- Now we see that age. 
- I do not know. 

105 
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:04,420 
I am a bastard beautiful and good if 
ask me to start my own show. 

106 
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:08,637 
Yes better to do a Gyra 
anyone catch bicycle thief. 

107 
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:11,658 
- Hey Sarah. 
- Hi, honey. 

108 
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:15,018 
- I would not have a little bit? 
- I see. 

109 
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:21,960 
- Loss on television. 
- Right, how was it? 

110 
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,887 
When we leave this stupid 
and come with me? 

111 
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:28,577 
- Around 8. 
- I have gasoline in the Cadillac. 

112 
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,294 
We do not strongylokathises now. 

113 
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:44,216 
Sarah I have an appointment with the doctor and 
There can be a bit wrong? 

114 
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:46,858 
Yes, when finished. 

115 
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,054 
The main jobs I have something 
Yo. 

116 
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:02,776 
Want to come? 

117 
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:07,125 
Not the coffee you drink, you will 
if it is for you. 

118 
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:26,854 
Shudder here. 

119 
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,631 
We can not go anywhere 
motel next time? 

120 
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,186 
Yes, good idea. 

121 
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,361 
Just stop 
and go. 

122 
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,254 
I do not think anyone noticed the 
sheriff's car from outside. 

123 
00:17:42,424 --> 00:17:44,528 
Perhaps to say 
his wife. 

124 
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:48,665 
Perhaps. 

125 
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:57,746 
I know that will not allow Sarah 
that day and I said so ... 

126 
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:13,181 
We have something ... 

127 
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:18,052 
We need, I already did. 

128 
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,631 
I am pregnant. 

129 
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,069 
Tom what are you doing here? 

130 
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,551 
What do you mean? 
I came to sign the papers. 

131 
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:01,251 
We become before Monday. 

132 
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:02,841 
Not to be on Monday? 
Good. 

133 
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:05,217 
Since arriving, 

134 
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:08,119 
Want to come for a drink? 
- Yes, of course. 

135 
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:14,550 
- Was lost funeral. 
- Of course. 

136 
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,314 
His father lost his 
earlier, however. 

137 
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:21,950 
You can if you want maloseis. 

138 
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:24,378 
We ekove his ass if he knew 
to sell mines. 

139 
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:27,177 
- I am who I am Ben. 
- Bullshit! 

140 
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,331 
These mines are within the 
Tom lives. 

141 
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:32,578 
We are talking about families here. 

142 
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:36,777 
We will ensure that all renewable 
contracts and more experienced 

143 
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:40,503 
like you, at work. 
- How? 3 months? 

144 
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:42,227 
Not my problem. 

145 
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,441 
No! It's my shit! 

146 
00:20:44,631 --> 00:20:47,603 
These old mines 
when I was a child. 

147 
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:52,018 
But my father did not want 
to admit, you know. 

148 
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:56,675 
Thus, in this case. 

149 
00:20:58,247 --> 00:20:59,919 
Well. 

150 
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,088 
If you do peace 
father, 

151 
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:13,261 
set. 

152 
00:21:16,686 --> 00:21:20,376 
I am the majority shareholder and 
will sell. 

153 
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:23,379 
And that's all. 

154 
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:26,958 
Your father and I care 
these people. 

155 
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:31,577 
Sold as 
someone here in town. 

156 
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,984 
Welcome to property 
my side. 

157 
00:21:56,118 --> 00:21:58,907 
Lewis to come here immediately! 

158 
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:07,329 
- Is Mel here? 
- I hope not. 

159 
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:11,757 
- He died 7 years ago. 
- Is there a place? 

160 
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,662 
So come on. 

161 
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:48,980 
- God! 
- What happened? 

162 
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:51,073 
I am so turned on! 

163 
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:09,062 
Stay Harry! 

164 
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,116 
Finally, we will stay 
another night? 

165 
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,261 
We travel and I have come 
until the day of love. 

166 
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:41,757 
Did you know that Valentine was 
Roman who lived around 500 AD; 

167 
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:46,665 
There was a large part of the recording 
name a couple decoder, 

168 
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:52,116 
the girl was a secret sexual 
any profit for the year. 

169 
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,701 
From there, follow the letters 
in a romantic form of disease. 

170 
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,937 
Yes, it's romantic. 

171 
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:03,399 
- What are you doing? 
- None. 

172 
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,651 
Frank? 

173 
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:08,584 
What is this? 

174 
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:12,556 
Peace is personal 
my collection. 

175 
00:24:12,723 --> 00:24:17,026 
- Look, you pay. 
- I'm not a whore! 

176 
00:24:18,603 --> 00:24:20,317 
Now you are. 

177 
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:57,202 
Frank! Bastard! 

178 
00:24:57,712 --> 00:25:02,016 
That can 
no children around. 

179 
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:04,971 
Shit for clothes, give me the 
Cassette swear otherwise, 

180 
00:25:05,116 --> 00:25:08,169 
I swear! 
- Peace, two things. 

181 
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:10,732 
1) do not want another. 

182 
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:13,086 
2) I know that the gun is empty. 

183 
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,554 
Fuck you Frank! 

184 
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:18,980 
Jesus! 

185 
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,803 
Puta! 

186 
00:25:56,402 --> 00:25:58,543 
Oh my! 

187 
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:07,355 
My God! 

188 
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,975 
Louis are you? 

189 
00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:09,241 
Lewis where are you? 

190 
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:16,405 
Small skatiariko, stop 
hiding from Mom. 

191 
00:27:20,768 --> 00:27:24,325 
Lewis all the problems are. 

192 
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:30,612 
As in the closet? 

193 
00:28:04,512 --> 00:28:07,682 
Damn! Let go! 

194 
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,984 
What do you want? 

195 
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:40,681 
What fucking? 

196 
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,183 
Leave me alone! 

197 
00:29:21,163 --> 00:29:24,144 
Christoula my peace! 
He took his heart. 

198 
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:31,269 
Seems to use a screwdriver? 

199 
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:33,560 
So I think that what you said? 

200 
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:37,046 
Irene had no connection with them. 

201 
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:40,397 
Sorry Sheriff, I know 
know. 

202 
00:29:40,884 --> 00:29:43,596 
Not anymore. 

203 
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:48,009 
Checked entries 
in motels, 

204 
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,130 
not all normal 
names, if you know what I mean. 

205 
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:57,169 
This is true, 
Tom Chanigker. 

206 
00:29:57,381 --> 00:30:00,127 
We found a video camera 
I wrote that. 

207 
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:03,373 
Sorry again later. 

208 
00:30:03,712 --> 00:30:06,362 
Become a punishment out there 
Police around the world. 

209 
00:30:06,568 --> 00:30:10,685 
- Speaking of Axel? 
- No. 

210 
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:15,644 
Hello. 

211 
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,947 
- Tom! 
- Sarah. 

212 
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:23,909 
I work with 
Your own. 

213 
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,809 
Tom what are you doing here? 

214 
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:32,010 
I went back to clear 
one thing. 

215 
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:34,903 
His father, sorry. 

216 
00:30:35,764 --> 00:30:36,794 
Thank you. 

217 
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:41,674 
Tom were you? Is ... 
10 years. 

218 
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:45,790 
You were beautiful when I left. 

219 
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:50,299 
If this is to say ... 

220 
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,899 
Simply disappear, nor his father 
I knew you were. 

221 
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:57,857 
We thought you were dead. 

222 
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:04,933 
Sorry. 

223 
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,950 
Family you have there. 

224 
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:18,267 
And Sarah Marshall was not right? 

225 
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:22,172 
No, now Sarah Palmer. 

226 
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:25,874 
I knew that Axel manage 
arez always. 

227 
00:31:28,941 --> 00:31:31,231 
- I gotta go. 
- Wait ... 

228 
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,273 
Nice to see Sarah. 

229 
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,589 
- Mom. 
- Come on Sheriff, I come in? 

230 
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,601 
- Okay. 
- Well? 

231 
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,439 
Why not go to brush their teeth 
and I tell you? 

232 
00:31:57,703 --> 00:31:59,373 
- Okay, Mom. 
- I love you. 

233 
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:03,834 
- Axel arrived yet? 
- No, Mrs Palmer. 

234 
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:06,884 
Well, thanks for today 
I will take now. 

235 
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:33,082 
- What? 
- I am. 

236 
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:36,210 
You okay? I heard it was 
something that the motel yesterday. 

237 
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:41,350 
Look I do not have time to talk now 
others must know that it was Irene. 

238 
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:45,544 
- Murdered. 
- La Paz? 

239 
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,579 
Gotta go. 

240 
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:11,011 
Indeed, what if we want to clarify 
Harry Gouornten returned. 

241 
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,698 
If people remember 
more problems. 

242 
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:17,560 
Most people remember what happened 
Sanaa was 10 years ago yesterday. 

243 
00:33:17,722 --> 00:33:20,286 
Many outsiders in 
Gordon this city. 

244 
00:33:20,672 --> 00:33:22,814 
There Harry Gouornten 
is dead, remember? 

245 
00:33:22,995 --> 00:33:26,202 
Sheriff has a gift for 
Valentine's Day. 

246 
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,210 
I get my gloves. 

247 
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,573 
Jesus! 

248 
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,719 
There is no right to Harry? 

249 
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:04,771 
Gouornten Harry is dead. 

250 
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:07,354 
I shot myself. 

251 
00:34:08,231 --> 00:34:11,040 
Copy, a 
sick bastard. 

252 
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:16,141 
Saying that there was never a corpse 
in contrast with the reports say. 

253 
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,093 
Damn. 

254 
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:20,429 
Look what happened. 

255 
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:22,971 
- What the hell do here? 
- Leave the girl alone. 

256 
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,792 
- Relax. 
- Shit. 

257 
00:34:27,046 --> 00:34:30,303 
Stop! 

258 
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,812 
Came for you! 

259 
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:35,552 
You are responsible! You! 

260 
00:34:39,726 --> 00:34:41,460 
You brought me! 

261 
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,881 
Stop at once! 

262 
00:34:54,078 --> 00:34:57,013 
Harry will kill you for the good 
this time, right? 

263 
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,237 
- Go to the outside. 
- Why? 

264 
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,109 
Want to blame for 
happened, so you want to go? 

265 
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:05,410 
That kills me! 

266 
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:06,997 
Come on, come on! 

267 
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,543 
Start with you, Tom. 

268 
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,296 
Half the people here know someone 
who died from his father ... 

269 
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:16,733 
Harry Gouornten the 
dead, not me! 

270 
00:35:16,934 --> 00:35:19,375 
- I know this. 
- So why blame? 

271 
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:22,917 
- You will not be sheriff? 
- Yes 

272 
00:35:25,169 --> 00:35:29,061 
Once you have saved your own ass 
a second time. 

273 
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:33,652 
But do not worry, kid, 
any third party. 

274 
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:04,296 
What happens? The NOA; 

275 
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:06,410 
A playground is an NOA 
is 2 in the morning. 

276 
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:08,118 
What is this? 

277 
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:13,228 
There is evidence of murder. 

278 
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,248 
Sorry, I did not realize. 

279 
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:21,498 
Tom turned Chanigker 
in the city. 

280 
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:25,594 
Do not visit huh? 

281 
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:28,025 
Yes, the wine shop. 

282 
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:31,748 
Imagine my surprise, 
Why? 

283 
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:35,752 
The love of your life can be 
too involved in the shit. 

284 
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:42,444 
- It is the love of my life. 
- No? 

285 
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:49,668 
You forgot this. 

286 
00:36:56,768 --> 00:36:59,415 
It was the last time 
they were together. 

287 
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,087 
I come to mourn. 

288 
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:05,098 
I do not want to malosoume 
I'm at work at 5 hours. 

289 
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:07,492 
Yes, I 
working now. 

290 
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:13,452 
Found on tape 
Part of the murders. 

291 
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:30,530 
If xanaerthei contact 
to trial. 

292 
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:49,992 
I am. 

293 
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:53,265 
- I'm at work. 
- Sorry. 

294 
00:37:54,223 --> 00:37:55,468 
What are you doing here? 

295 
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:58,977 
I'd like to talk a little with you 
when will you be in business. 

296 
00:38:01,187 --> 00:38:02,882 
I now work. 

297 
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:07,328 
You have 15 minutes before the opening 
Shop. 

298 
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:13,103 
We should have gone. 

299 
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,243 
Fucking. 

300 
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:18,366 
Come on time. 

301 
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:24,027 
I thought it sell well if the 
mines in the past two years. 

302 
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:27,639 
If he loses and sell 
rest of your life too. 

303 
00:38:27,818 --> 00:38:29,326 
We came to talk about it. 

304 
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:32,015 
You have no idea huh? 

305 
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,971 
This city depends on 
these mines. 

306 
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:37,591 
So many people who work there are 
the only income to survive. 

307 
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:40,367 
- It is not my responsibility. 
- Yes it is. 

308 
00:38:40,557 --> 00:38:44,027 
Left 10 years ago, but the rest 
ceased to collect the pieces. 

309 
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,496 
We supported each other. 

310 
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:51,090 
Recall that these metals 
support your family? 

311 
00:38:51,336 --> 00:38:53,092 
Probably not. 

312 
00:38:53,294 --> 00:38:55,299 
I just left and went 
to run. 

313 
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:57,389 
It is not a nuisance for 10 years. 

314 
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:04,130 
- I ... response. 
- I do not. 

315 
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:07,376 
I wish I could, but 
I can not. 

316 
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:10,790 
I lost my way. 

317 
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:17,672 
Tom can not re - 
The top left. 

318 
00:39:17,905 --> 00:39:20,343 
Only be implemented in all 
his life. 

319 
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:23,565 
Your choice. 

320 
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,309 
Tom what are you doing here? 

321 
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,774 
Where is Ben? 
I want to talk to him. 

322 
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:24,459 
You may be down. 

323 
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:26,459 
- I'm down. 
- Of course not! 

324 
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,042 
It is not safe. 

325 
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:30,976 
We grew up, a joy 
I will be. 

326 
00:40:41,964 --> 00:40:44,328 
Turn the lights 3. 

327 
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:48,766 
From here descend. 

328 
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:08,297 
How are you? 

329 
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:26,671 
Do not touch anything! 

330 
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:29,037 
I will call Ben! 

331 
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:35,910 
Ben entering tunnel 3 
have visited. 

332 
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:40,148 
What do you mean? 

333 
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:46,389 
Go for it! 
Stupid! 

334 
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,380 
Come with me. 

335 
00:41:56,567 --> 00:42:00,330 
Best to start 
Work ... 

336 
00:43:10,744 --> 00:43:15,059 
So to move the hands 
listen ... 

337 
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:21,073 
What do you want? 

338 
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:35,914 
Children 3 to problem again!

Christoula me. 

342 
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:27,749 
Is he dead? 

343 
00:45:28,068 --> 00:45:31,144 
The children are dead? 
Pull me out of here! 

344 
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:33,117 
What happened? 

345 
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:41,356 
- Blocked help. 
- Stay open. 

346 
00:45:45,015 --> 00:45:47,861 
- What did you do? 
- I did nothing! 

347 
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:54,085 
Damn! 

348 
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:02,870 
- This will tell the public Hey task. 
- No problems in Dr. Miller. 

349 
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:07,011 
- Give me one. 
- Take what you want. - Thanks. 

350 
00:46:13,661 --> 00:46:15,317 
Where the hell have you been? 

351 
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,738 
I was in the tunnel 3 
in Ray. 

352 
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,132 
- Was Harry Gouornten. 
- Tommy, come now. 

353 
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:25,668 
He was attacked and 
killing rays. 

354 
00:46:26,015 --> 00:46:27,293 
You know how crazy heard? 

355 
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,779 
Very well; 
I know this! 

356 
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,785 
However, he was tried and 
to kill me. 

357 
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:33,872 
Sir, please calm down. 

358 
00:46:36,033 --> 00:46:38,814 
- You will be fine. 
- Thanks. 

359 
00:46:43,028 --> 00:46:46,706 
- Tell what you saw. 
- What happened? 

360 
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:50,958 
- He attacked. 
- Who? 

361 
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:54,176 
- None. 
- Harry Gouornten. 

362 
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:57,133 
Mining. 

363 
00:46:59,705 --> 00:47:01,265 
What did you do there? 

364 
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:03,700 
I went to tell Ben 
not sold. 

365 
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:09,283 
And why not? 

366 
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:14,559 
Find something worthwhile 
to make your stay? 

367 
00:47:14,896 --> 00:47:18,198 
Always with our envy 
Sarah. 

368 
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:20,584 
You mean my wife 
Sarah? 

369 
00:47:20,768 --> 00:47:22,871 
Living in my house? 
The mother of my child? 

370 
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:26,503 
Bed 
do sex with her? 

371 
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:29,420 
- Sarah? 
- Stop! Quite! 

372 
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:34,924 
- Harry to attack him? 
- Yes 

373 
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:37,995 
Apart from being killed 
10 years, 

374 
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:40,515 
which was not seen in 
Anyone else? 

375 
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:44,192 
I do not know who was a sheriff 
there, I saw him. 

376 
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:47,820 
You do not need the city in panic, 
because of you. 

377 
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:50,459 
Cease immediately. 

378 
00:47:50,895 --> 00:47:53,348 
That means the 
What should I do? 

379 
00:47:55,884 --> 00:47:58,711 
- What are you talking about? 
- Well, I tell myself. 

380 
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:03,260 
You see my father Tom 
pareitsa here with Ben, 

381 
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:06,487 
decided to lerosoun 
hands 10 years ago, 

382 
00:48:06,957 --> 00:48:08,769 
Harry Gouornten dead. 

383 
00:48:08,965 --> 00:48:11,732 
And the sheriff Berk 
hidden. 

384 
00:48:13,921 --> 00:48:17,084 
The parents of the city uses 
Some justice unsolicited. 

385 
00:48:17,848 --> 00:48:20,254 
You see Harry not buried 
I live in mine 

386 
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:22,059 
But the dead buried. 

387 
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:24,041 
And rest in peace. 

388 
00:48:25,538 --> 00:48:26,426 
And? 

389 
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:35,299 
Where is it? 

390 
00:48:35,732 --> 00:48:37,978 
I do not know what to expect you. 

391 
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:41,159 
Jim is my show 
buried the corpse. 

392 
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:43,969 
Once the mechanism 
is the trap door. 

393 
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:49,731 
Sheriff really believe that the bone 
before 10 years 

394 
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:51,399 
will clarify these 
murder; 

395 
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:54,741 
Nobody stops the world 
believes that Harry has become, 

396 
00:48:55,052 --> 00:48:56,912 
and we can do 
proper investigation. 

397 
00:49:00,598 --> 00:49:01,561 
A hatch. 

398 
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:06,680 
Yes, here we again 
the hatch. 

399 
00:49:08,327 --> 00:49:09,031 
Here. 

400 
00:49:18,024 --> 00:49:18,919 
Understood. 

401 
00:49:21,354 --> 00:49:22,597 
Here at least was. 

402 
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:25,819 
What the hell is this? 

403 
00:49:26,123 --> 00:49:28,847 
Animals ... should be 
work. 

404 
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:29,837 
Animals; 

405 
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:31,369 
He was killed when 
the thapsate? 

406 
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,526 
Of course, there is no pulse. 

407 
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,062 
Life had stopped, 
Huh? 

408 
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,282 
Throw the bastard 
until he died. 

409 
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:40,721 
Thapsame here. 

410 
00:49:41,034 --> 00:49:42,870 
This deserves. 

411 
00:49:43,495 --> 00:49:44,867 
And certainly he was dead? 

412 
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:49,091 
Exclude lived. 

413 
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,016 
Damn. 

414 
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,586 
I want their deposits. 

415 
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,435 
And you. 

416 
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:59,786 
I want now, 
to discuss. 

417 
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:01,844 
Come on, Sarah. 

418 
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:03,599 
Come, gentlemen. 

419 
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:16,648 
- What is mine? 
- My job. 

420 
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,785 
You are a suspect, 

421 
00:50:21,482 --> 00:50:22,486 
not me. 

422 
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,453 
The murdered man 
mining, 

423 
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,655 
may seem that I did 
me, but he did not. 

424 
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:39,306 
Relax I did not say anything. 

425 
00:50:45,491 --> 00:50:46,431 
So, 

426 
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,605 
because you are actually new? 

427 
00:50:51,655 --> 00:50:52,757 
Do you know why. 

428 
00:50:53,732 --> 00:50:54,688 
No, 

429 
00:50:55,934 --> 00:50:58,381 
I do not know how someone who does not 
came to the funeral of his father, 

430 
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:01,452 
decided to sell the 
single property. 

431 
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:02,806 
Eventually sell. 

432 
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,745 
I decided to stay. 

433 
00:51:10,826 --> 00:51:12,279 
Why? 

434 
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:21,779 
You know that a commitment 
with you, right? 

435 
00:51:28,425 --> 00:51:29,347 
God. 

436 
00:51:30,737 --> 00:51:32,350 
What you just said? 

437 
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,343 
Sarah is with you ... 

438 
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,053 
Do not fuck with 
my wife, me? 

439 
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:43,342 
Axel cool. 

440 
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:45,299 
- Mine is. 
- Can. 

441 
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:50,064 
The rest assured that Tom 
was trapped in the cage, 

442 
00:51:51,386 --> 00:51:53,074 
someone was still there. 

443 
00:51:58,571 --> 00:51:59,464 
Very nice. 

444 
00:52:02,173 --> 00:52:03,345 
Crap. 

445 
00:52:12,378 --> 00:52:14,710 
It will take time to be 
Axel on the right. 

446 
00:52:14,972 --> 00:52:17,367 
Because it is believed 
does not mean he is right, 

447 
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:19,822 
someone was still there. 
- Yes 

448 
00:52:20,593 --> 00:52:24,509 
Harry, but how? 

449 
00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:27,248 
I do not know, maybe he wants to end 
that began 10 years ago. 

450 
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,427 
If I were in your position 
Leave. 

451 
00:52:30,634 --> 00:52:32,367 
Not this time. 

452 
00:52:32,669 --> 00:52:33,683 
I believe him. 

453 
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:39,889 
If you can not look 
not find it. 

454 
00:52:41,763 --> 00:52:42,861 
The you. 

455 
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:50,097 
Return of the murderer 
Day of love? 

456 
00:55:58,482 --> 00:55:59,299 
Who is it? 

457 
00:56:41,343 --> 00:56:43,717 
Harry Gouornten can obtain 

458 
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:46,847 
must remain in the dark, 

459 
00:56:50,204 --> 00:56:52,526 
in the dark ... 

460 
00:57:20,213 --> 00:57:21,609 
You are! 

461 
00:57:58,919 --> 00:57:59,894 
Crap! 

462 
00:58:06,003 --> 00:58:08,396 
I know the picture is 
is a man we have, 

463 
00:58:08,637 --> 00:58:11,248 
and send it to be. 

464 
00:58:11,718 --> 00:58:13,270 
I do not care ... 

465 
00:58:14,238 --> 00:58:16,857 
It is possible, what is 
problem? 

466 
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:19,673 
Amazing, 

467 
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:22,488 
yes, immediately launched a 
I do not care, 

468 
00:58:22,682 --> 00:58:23,699 
just do it. 

469 
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,765 
Well. 

470 
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:29,027 
Yeah, well, well. 

471 
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:31,436 
Sarah. 

472 
00:58:35,447 --> 00:58:37,297 
I have brought something to eat. 

473 
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,324 
- Have you seen Tom? 
- Not since yesterday. 

474 
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:42,578 
We lost track of the morning 
Ben and ignore. 

475 
00:58:42,784 --> 00:58:43,602 
I do not know who they are. 

476 
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,772 
Look, Sara is not a game 
people who die 

477 
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:47,207 
and Tom is the only 
knows something. 

478 
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:47,959 
Tom is not ... 

479 
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:49,319 
- Shut up. 
- Jesus! 

480 
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:55,986 
What's wrong? 

481 
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,302 
I feel good? 

482 
00:59:01,408 --> 00:59:02,197 
Sorry. 

483 
00:59:02,488 --> 00:59:03,821 
- Sheriff. 
- What is it? 

484 
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:07,826 
We found Ben.

485 
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,279 
See you later. 

486 
00:59:31,357 --> 00:59:32,621 
What do you think? 

487 
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,269 
We koroidepsan. 

488 
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:40,918 
I was here with other 
above, 

489 
00:59:41,139 --> 00:59:42,760 
And I'm pretty sure that the 
Harry is not the murderer. 

490 
00:59:45,134 --> 00:59:46,495 
Putting off guard 
my home 

491 
00:59:47,465 --> 00:59:48,689 
find Berk, 

492 
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:51,261 
and Tom is Chanigken 
the main suspects. 

493 
01:00:07,693 --> 01:00:09,355 
Megan mind 

494 
01:00:09,636 --> 01:00:12,712 
to help a bit to go 
faster than here? 

495 
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,493 
Whatever. 

496 
01:00:23,893 --> 01:00:26,588 
They finally 
Axel Tom with you? 

497 
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,328 
It was long ago. 

498 
01:00:30,499 --> 01:00:32,465 
When the Harry Gouornten 
killed them all? 

499 
01:00:33,269 --> 01:00:34,296 
You were there, 

500 
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:37,377 
Tom was? 

501 
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:39,964 
Yes 

502 
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:47,272 
Axel was the one who 
I stopped. 

503 
01:00:47,514 --> 01:00:50,573 
But ... not anymore. 

504 
01:00:56,745 --> 01:00:57,877 
Closed front? 

505 
01:00:58,737 --> 01:00:59,526 
Yes 

506 
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:01,928

Please? 

508 
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:41,526 
- Wait here. 
- Wait! 

509 
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:45,928 
I fear that very few times. 

510 
01:02:15,626 --> 01:02:16,571 
There is nobody here. 

511 
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:34,573 
Megan God, go! 

512 
01:02:34,828 --> 01:02:36,167 
Get the hell out of here. 

513 
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,979 
Run! Run! 

514 
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:40,068 
Help! 

515 
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:46,765 
Push! 

516 
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:50,262 
Back! Back! 

517 
01:03:53,482 --> 01:03:55,075 
Help! 

518 
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:02,428 
We want the keys! 

519 
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,292 
The keys are here! 
Here! 

520 
01:04:05,043 --> 01:04:06,207 
- Come on! 
- Not seen! 

521 
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,037 
It is urgent ... 

522 
01:04:31,536 --> 01:04:32,729 
I can not open! 

523 
01:04:34,188 --> 01:04:35,956 
I can not open! 

524 
01:04:40,884 --> 01:04:41,585 
Spring! 

525 
01:04:44,387 --> 01:04:45,444 
No! No! 

526 
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,400 
Go quickly! 

527 
01:04:54,762 --> 01:04:57,018 
Wait! 

528 
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:00,147 
Come on! Come on! 

529 
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:01,286 
Here I am! 

530 
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,171 
Sarah is? 

531 
01:06:04,448 --> 01:06:05,867 
Where is it? 

532 
01:06:06,123 --> 01:06:07,530 
From behind ... 

533 
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:08,981 
back. 

534 
01:06:09,254 --> 01:06:10,857 
Stay behind me! 

535 
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:12,576 
Sarah Stay behind me. 

536 
01:06:12,919 --> 01:06:14,492 
- Do you understand? 
- Yes 

537 
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:05,362 
Stay here. 

538 
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,727 
- Jesus. 
- What? 

539 
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,872 
I would not let Sarah 
please watch this. 

540 
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:28,910 
EFTICHISMENI day of love 

541 
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,148 
I go to hospital 
to see. 

542 
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:48,007 
Are you going to find? 

543 
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,439 
All 
mining, 

544 
01:07:53,045 --> 01:07:54,419 
10 years ago. 

545 
01:07:55,423 --> 01:07:56,645 
Megan not. 

546 
01:07:59,437 --> 01:08:01,727 
Perhaps the murderer knew 
to do. 

547 
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:07,261 
- What are you talking about? 
- I'm not blind Axel. 

548 
01:08:13,313 --> 01:08:14,477 
Come on. 

549 
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:59,406 
- Where you going? 
- Take out the trash. 

550 
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:14,229 
Finish the baby? 

551 
01:09:45,971 --> 01:09:47,971 
It is here, inside the house. 

552 
01:09:52,636 --> 01:09:53,656 
Come on. 

553 
01:10:14,038 --> 01:10:15,288 
Want to drive? 

554 
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,380 
He retired. 

555 
01:11:36,881 --> 01:11:40,029 
I bend and 
hide this? 

556 
01:11:40,246 --> 01:11:43,642 
Do not leave until it reaches 
although they do. 

557 
01:12:34,991 --> 01:12:36,785 
Berk, come here! 

558 
01:13:15,241 --> 01:13:16,463 
Please? 

559 
01:13:16,721 --> 01:13:19,198 
Sarah, I am who are you? 

560 
01:13:20,832 --> 01:13:22,310 
In the hospital. 

561 
01:13:22,676 --> 01:13:23,786 
What happened are you okay? 

562 
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,086 
I'm fine. 

563 
01:13:26,576 --> 01:13:30,679 
Harry turned Gouornten, 
tried to kill me. 

564 
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:32,318 
- Missed it. 
- Have you seen them? 

565 
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:33,519 
Only the mask. 

566 
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,115 
Sarah thinks it's not Harry. 

567 
01:13:35,607 --> 01:13:38,219 
- What do you think? 
- Trust; 

568 
01:13:39,502 --> 01:13:40,727 
- Tom ... 
- Trust; 

569 
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,577 
Yes, trust. 

570 
01:13:46,104 --> 01:13:48,347 
Well, if you have to show something. 

571 
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,537 
Tom has to go home. 

572 
01:13:49,865 --> 01:13:52,652 
Well I will go myself and I 
show on the road. 

573 
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:00,325 
Where is Sara? 

574 
01:14:00,618 --> 01:14:04,105 
- Just go. 
- What are you talking about? 

575 
01:14:05,545 --> 01:14:09,324 
Before 10 minutes with him 
Tom Chanigker. 

576 
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:10,738 
Sheriff? 

577 
01:14:13,183 --> 01:14:14,217 
Hello? 

578 
01:14:14,547 --> 01:14:16,653 
Upon receiving the request 
Tom Chanigker, 

579 
01:14:17,346 --> 01:14:18,553 
Must see. 

580 
01:14:27,036 --> 01:14:30,317 
It took 10 years to forget this 
the mask and just returned. 

581 
01:14:32,227 --> 01:14:36,201 
- Axel is always here; 
- Yes, here was all. 

582 
01:14:36,528 --> 01:14:37,577 
Last changed? 

583 
01:14:41,796 --> 01:14:43,489 
Axel is not 
Sarah what you think. 

584 
01:14:44,277 --> 01:14:45,106 
What do you think? 

585 
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:47,234 
I think that I believe this 
is responsible for that to happen, 

586 
01:14:49,111 --> 01:14:50,185 
of murders. 

587 
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,377 
It's crazy. 

588 
01:14:56,278 --> 01:14:57,315 
Do not answer. 

589 
01:15:02,101 --> 01:15:04,555 
- Hello? 
- Where are you from? 

590 
01:15:06,164 --> 01:15:07,346 
It is with you right? 

591 
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:12,351 
- Yes 
- Who was that? 

592 
01:15:12,648 --> 01:15:14,397 
Sarah heard, 

593 
01:15:14,691 --> 01:15:16,777 
must go outside the 
Tom immediately. 

594 
01:15:17,073 --> 01:15:18,424 
What do you mean? 

595 
01:15:18,634 --> 01:15:21,204 
Tom was in a psychiatric institution 
the past 7 years 

596 
01:15:21,463 --> 01:15:23,038 
not what they loved. 

597 
01:15:23,328 --> 01:15:24,038 
Who is it? 

598 
01:15:24,264 --> 01:15:26,753 
Sarah was at home, Louisa 
dead, 

599 
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:29,292 
it and Berk, pursued 
our son! 

600 
01:15:30,243 --> 01:15:31,566 
And now you. 

601 
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:35,713 
- The NOA is that? 
- So, so. 

602 
01:15:36,001 --> 01:15:38,316 
We were at the station 
are safe. 

603 
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:39,819 
Watch ... 

604 
01:15:41,207 --> 01:15:44,543 
I know it's terrible to you 
I apologize ... 

605 
01:15:45,657 --> 01:15:48,994 
you can if you want a split 
Please get in your car 

606 
01:15:49,285 --> 01:15:51,808 
Sarah, please. 

607 
01:15:53,657 --> 01:15:55,549 
We come to see mama. 

608 
01:16:10,953 --> 01:16:13,766 
Come home to mom 
told me that the NOA is not good. 

609 
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:16,799 
It's about your mom. 

610 
01:16:17,959 --> 01:16:20,323 
- We must return to my son. 
- Trust; 

611 
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:21,817 
Go to the house. 

612 
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:25,338 
Do not take it with confidence. 

613 
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:28,867 
Tom, Tom begins to scare me. 

614 
01:16:29,056 --> 01:16:31,481 
You have to trust 
this. 

615 
01:16:31,646 --> 01:16:34,304 
I have a husband and son in 
Please go to the house. 

616 
01:16:34,468 --> 01:16:36,476 
Axel wants to believe 
I'm not one. 

617 
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:39,397 
I do not think you know 
because it is capable. 

618 
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,494 
We will restore 
opportunity 

619 
01:16:42,774 --> 01:16:44,203 
not allow 
again. 

620 
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:46,252 
Damn! 

621 
01:16:56,061 --> 01:16:58,218 
Sarah! Sarah! 

622 
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:40,990 
- Who are you? 
- Axel; 

623 
01:18:41,327 --> 01:18:43,427 
Colliding with the car in the woods 
near the mine. 

624 
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:44,417 
You okay? 

625 
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:46,091 
Yes ... I think. 

626 
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:47,846 
God, well ... 

627 
01:18:48,941 --> 01:18:50,504 
You can go to the old 
in my parents' house. 

628 
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:54,812 
- Hide me there. 
- Okay. 

629 
01:19:22,818 --> 01:19:23,525 
Crap! 

630 
01:20:24,368 --> 01:20:26,434 
"Axel is not 
you think. " 

631 
01:20:26,665 --> 01:20:28,473 
"I do not think you know 
because it is capable. " 

632 
01:21:04,855 --> 01:21:05,953 
Axel. 

633 
01:21:11,978 --> 01:21:12,855 
Stop! 

634 
01:23:48,509 --> 01:23:49,413 
Damn! 

635 
01:24:13,484 --> 01:24:14,752 
Do not move! 

636 
01:24:14,894 --> 01:24:17,814 
- Sara ... What are you doing? 
- I found your heart. 

637 
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:21,410 
What heart? 

638 
01:24:21,573 --> 01:24:23,426 
The day of love! 

639 
01:24:23,787 --> 01:24:25,437 
This Megan? 

640 
01:24:25,865 --> 01:24:26,932 
Look I'm sorry ... 

641 
01:24:28,474 --> 01:24:30,447 
We talked to Megan 
damn! 

642 
01:24:30,725 --> 01:24:34,448 
I mean those who use 
to put within their hearts! 

643 
01:24:37,534 --> 01:24:40,373 
Sarah is Tom ... This ... 

644 
01:24:40,553 --> 01:24:44,205 
Parada, Tom photo 
Got to be there! 

645 
01:24:44,367 --> 01:24:45,484 
Tom was there, 

646 
01:24:45,698 --> 01:24:47,421 
Sarah was working the last 
72 hours 

647 
01:24:47,635 --> 01:24:49,190 
where to find the time 
to play the psychopath?
