1
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,950
Ronnie? It's Lisa.

2
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,309
I know, I know.

3
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,749
I want to, baby...

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,911
but I can't. I've basically been

5
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,193
abducted.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,036
She looks like my older sister.

7
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,915
The Surgeon General.

8
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,719
You know...

9
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,915
Me too.

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,835
Ditto.

11
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,673
Listen, I can't talk here.

12
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,399
Take my number. Call me back.

13
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,071
It's area code 303-560...

14
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,515
Ronnie?

15
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,069
That was low.

16
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,312
That was really low.

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,119
Thank you so much.

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,030
Okay, fine.

19
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,352
I'll stay a month.
A month won't be so bad, right?

20
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,349
No offense, but I don't think
Snowfield can compare to L.A.

21
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,153
activity-wise.

22
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,153
And besides...

23
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,954
Mom needs me back.

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
Mom will be fine, Lisa.

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,108
Anyway, it's healthier up here.

26
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,715
Less smog, less gunfire.

27
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,439
I like smog and gunfire.

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,750
- Less Ronnie.
- You don't know him.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,399
I know the type.

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,750
He's cute.

31
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,678
They always are.

32
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,716
Many people here?

33
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,598
400, in the winter.

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,429
In the summer, with tourists,
it can be 4,000.

35
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,792
It's kind of cute,
in a dorky sort of way.

36
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,118
Is it always this quiet?

37
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,554
No.

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,799
No, it isn't.

39
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,076
Hilda, we're home!

40
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,999
You'll love Hilda.
Housekeeper of the Gods.

41
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,792
When I left this morning,
she was promising apple pie.

42
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,518
No message.

43
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,599
Jenny!

44
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,349
Go. Go stand over there. Go.

45
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,638
Looks like someone
beat the shit out of her.

46
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,592
She died suddenly.

47
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,519
How do you know?

48
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,199
There's no blood.

49
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,833
There's no sign of struggle.

50
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,718
What's going on?

51
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,752
Phone's dead.

52
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,397
Out of order now, it's
strange, don't you think?

53
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,518
What if she was killed?

54
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,234
What if the killer's
still in the house?

55
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,559
Shit!

56
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,592
Police station's four blocks.

57
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,074
We'll walk.

58
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,154
- You okay?
- I'm going to be sick.

59
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,396
We're almost there.

60
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,711
- It's a disease.
- Just wait.

61
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,353
I don't want to die like this.

62
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,719
We're not going to die.

63
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,551
Let go!

64
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,713
- Calm down.
- Why?

65
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,194
You brought me here!

66
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,430
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,118
You're just scared.

68
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,955
I am too.

69
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,552
Just let me do this.

70
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,919
Here, check the phone.

71
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,799
Anybody...

72
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,830
Nothing.

73
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,631
You weren't shooting
at a disease, were you Paul?

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
- He got off three rounds.
- More.

75
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,712
He's a pro, right?
He hits what he aims at.

76
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,156
So?

77
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,238
Where's the blood, Jenny?

78
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,159
Why do you need a gun?

79
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,395
For whatever.

80
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,355
Know how to use it?

81
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,875
I understand the concept.

82
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,959
It's like this.

83
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,717
See? L.A.'s good for something.

84
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,638
Everybody's dead.

85
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,357
No, it can't be.

86
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,791
Not a whole town.

87
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,038
Is there a nuke plant around?

88
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,389
No.

89
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,673
Big military base?

90
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,393
No.

91
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,993
Thought maybe...

92
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,511
it's radiation?

93
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,237
Radiation doesn't kill in a blink.

94
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,753
Besides...

95
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,315
there'd be burns, lesions.

96
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,271
It was running before.

97
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,313
I saw it.

98
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,789
Jacob and Anna. It's their
bakery. They're always here.

99
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,432
Let's go around in back.

100
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,435
Something's up there.

101
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,432
Keep moving!

102
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,118
Jacob!

103
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,439
Anna?

104
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,675
What the hell?

105
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,670
The stump's, like, cauterized.

106
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,436
It's some freaking maniac.

107
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,317
One maniac can't wipe out a town.

108
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,349
Just a Bundt cake.

109
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,759
It's just a Bundt cake.

110
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,792
Not that way. Out the front!

111
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,513
Who are you?

112
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,195
- What do you want?
- What is it?

113
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,073
Come on.

114
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,795
How you doing?

115
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,799
What's going on here.

116
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,591
Stu, let's go!

117
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,158
Stu, you okay?

118
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,709
Yeah.

119
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,349
Fine.

120
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,833
Can we go yet?

121
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,593
No, not yet.

122
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,717
I want to get a forensic here.

123
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,473
Right? Get a coroner.

124
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,795
You can't do that.

125
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,558
Get 3 more deputies.

126
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,149
Sheriff Hammond?

127
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,839
You can't bring people.

128
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,793
It could be toxic.

129
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,513
Toxic? Yeah.

130
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,069
Whatever got those,
definitely toxic.

131
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,549
They were decapitated.

132
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,838
Not your deputy, Henderson.

133
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,435
Or my housekeeper.
It was something else.

134
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,359
We should get them out.

135
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,953
You don't know what it is.

136
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,514
Just calm down.

137
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,994
You can't risk spread...

138
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,754
Doctor, I'm in charge here!
All right?

139
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,271
I'm going to get on the radio.

140
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,638
I'll figure this out.

141
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,156
Good. Let's go.

142
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,593
Henderson was on the phone.
The line just went dead.

143
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,478
We got here as soon as we could.

144
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,154
He used to be FBI, like me and Bryce.

145
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,713
He was a good cop.

146
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,275
Why didn't Paul see
an attack coming?

147
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,635
He didn't make mistakes.

148
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,790
Just one.

149
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,275
Excuse me?

150
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,559
If anybody was alive,
that would have brought them out.

151
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,197
Those lights are the Candleglow Inn.

152
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,953
Steve, bring them along.

153
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,633
Are you okay?

154
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,354
Yeah.

155
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,391
Okay, because I need
you to be okay here.

156
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,359
All right?

157
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,674
I'm okay.

158
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,194
You okay?

159
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,028
Yeah.

160
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,074
Okay, then.

161
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,115
Have you heard any barking.

162
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,958
Barking? No.

163
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,197
- Seen any dogs or cats?
- No.

164
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,549
There are only 4 rooms booked.

165
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,239
All upstairs.

166
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,711
There might be someone
in the manager's apartment.

167
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,275
Where you want...

168
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,074
to start, chief?

169
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,075
Nothing.

170
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,669
All right.

171
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,473
Holy shit!

172
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,989
Hi.

173
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,431
Want to tell me what happened?

174
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,951
What are you doing?

175
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,793
Jesus.

176
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,270
I was just...

177
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,709
Looking for clues?

178
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,870
Yeah.

179
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,474
Watch the hallway.

180
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,469
Are you okay?

181
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,675
You feel sick?

182
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,955
I feel good.

183
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,556
Doctor?

184
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,473
Stay here.

185
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,235
Be careful.

186
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,272
Watch the hallway, Stu.

187
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,195
This door was locked from the inside.

188
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,032
I had to break it open.

189
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,359
Nobody in there.
So how'd she get out?

190
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,752
- Window?
- There is no window.

191
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,710
Look at this.

192
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,319
You want to see something?

193
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,629
What?

194
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,513
You want to see something?

195
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,829
No.

196
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,559
Who's Timothy Flyte?

197
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,194
I've no idea.
I was hoping you would know.

198
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,358
He's no one local.

199
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,710
- Think it's one of the killers?
- It seems so.

200
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,390
She locks herself in here, to
get away from him, and writes...

201
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,070
Then why not write a clear message?

202
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,673
She wrote it in lipstick.

203
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,398
But where's the tube?

204
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,229
Vanished.

205
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,708
along with whoever used it...

206
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,951
from a locked, windowless room.

207
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,508
What is this?

208
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,596
Whatever it is, it wasn't here before.

209
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,074
That's a gold tooth.

210
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,398
Like Nazis.

211
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,194
In the camps, they'd
leave anything of value.

212
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,991
This is junk.

213
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,076
Don't touch it.

214
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,919
Buttons.

215
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,918
Strips them to their skins.

216
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,909
Beyond the skin.

217
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,074
Jenny, what is that?

218
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,389
It's a pacemaker.

219
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,315
Got to be kidding.

220
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,599
Now this guy...

221
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,956
this guy's got an edge.

222
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,275
There's been no guest Timothy Flyte.

223
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,829
There are 7 people in those 4 rooms.

224
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,269
Only found one body.

225
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,908
Where's everybody?

226
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,593
Maybe they're still alive...

227
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,434
somewhere.

228
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,789
No mistake. We were to come here...

229
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,118
and find that message.

230
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,911
I'll run the name Flyte
by headquarters and see what it does.

231
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,310
What?

232
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,790
I don't like this.

233
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,918
- That was not here before!
- No way.

234
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,149
We'd have seen it.

235
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,836
I fall to pieces...

236
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,350
Help!

237
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,113
- Help me!
- Bryce, cover me.

238
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,235
Steve, wait!

239
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,877
The message read: "Timothy Flyte,
The Ancient Enemy."

240
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,680
- That's Flyte: F-L-Y-T-E.
- 10-4, Sheriff.

241
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,797
Set up a roadblock at the turnoff,

242
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,150
and close the town down tight.

243
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,118
Nothing comes in, nothing goes out.

244
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,628
Federal assistance.

245
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,348
- Armed federal specialists.
- 10-1.

246
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,119
Receiving poorly, Sheriff.

247
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,593
There is an anti-terrorist unit
for chemical/bacteriological threats.

248
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,909
Breaking up! Repeat.

249
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,957
Fort Sherwood, all right?
The whole strike force.

250
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,350
Big firepower, full
analytical assistance...

251
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,039
Send everyone they have.

252
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,958
One, possibly two officers dead.

253
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,713
I may have hundreds dead.

254
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,596
Jesus! Joe!

255
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,592
Come on, Joe!

256
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,989
Hello?!

257
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,116
What is this?

258
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,716
Same thing on the phone.

259
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,875
They didn't get the message.

260
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,239
There won't be any help coming.

261
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,638
Of course there will, Lisa.

262
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,793
Not in time.

263
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,509
So...

264
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,592
Guess we're on our own.

265
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,033
Wait a minute, Stu.

266
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,873
Nobody's going off.
We have a chain of command.

267
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,990
This has to be a managed response.

268
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,517
"Managed response?"

269
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,998
I'm sorry, Sheriff.

270
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,800
Don't have my book on me.
Is that an FBI term?

271
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,155
What's your problem?

272
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,474
Nothing.

273
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,510
I'm just trying to learn
to be a better cop.

274
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,393
You know what?
The doctor sure is cute.

275
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,480
I'm not going to have
this conversation with you.

276
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,435
What conversation?

277
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,757
- Any conversation.
- I'm saying...

278
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,150
it seems like you two
are hitting it off.

279
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,590
I don't know what your problem is.

280
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,269
I know what you are trying,
so cut it off.

281
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,117
I like the little sister, though.

282
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,436
Stop!

283
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,431
Shut up, all right? Enough!

284
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,798
Easy, chief.

285
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,228
Easy.

286
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,995
I got Witnesses.

287
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,712
Why don't you calm down.

288
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,031
Is that what you meant by...

289
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,713
a "managed response"?

290
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,636
Who are you?

291
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,755
What was that?

292
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,269
It came from over here.

293
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,390
No, it's over here.

294
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,470
The window!

295
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,469
Was that a bird?

296
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,516
No way.

297
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,510
If help's coming,
it won't be till daybreak.

298
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,270
I wouldn't worry.

299
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,117
Wahtever it was won't
be coming back in here.

300
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,952
What makes you so sure?

301
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,951
Well, for one thing...

302
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,277
we probably just shot it
about thirty times, Sheriff.

303
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,672
That doesn't mean it's dead.

304
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,393
It ate through his face...

305
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,152
consumed the eyes...

306
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,110
most of the soft tissue...

307
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,469
and the entire brain.

308
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,552
Impossible. The brain alone
weighs 6 or 7 pounds.

309
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,519
It just devoured it in seconds.

310
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,833
It almost got Lisa.

311
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,349
No.

312
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,835
It wanted Deputy Wargle first.

313
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,350
It wants men like him most of all.

314
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,671
What do you mean, "men like him"?

315
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,835
It's the devil, don't you think?

316
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,156
Come up from hell tonight.

317
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,149
I think he wants to dance with us.

318
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,759
Dr. Flyte?

319
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,158
Wilson and Hawthorne.

320
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,554
FBI.

321
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,153
We're here to ask questions...

322
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,431
about articles you've written.

323
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,593
The FBI reads Wide World News?

324
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,638
Only if it's about...

325
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,469
"The Ancient Enemy".

326
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,678
They're based on a treatise
I published at Oxford.

327
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,955
Got you kicked off.

328
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,999
They weren't that rude.
No boot to the bottom.

329
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,191
It's a pretty radical theory.

330
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,754
I believed any theory...

331
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,350
published with evidence
became open to discussion.

332
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,478
But I've learned how vicious
the academic community can be.

333
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,269
They're swine. Polite swine,
but swine, nonetheless.

334
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,279
Convincing the world
to consider a new idea...

335
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,313
takes patience, perseverance,
and willingness to fight...

336
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,795
in any media forum one can find.

337
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,798
Which is why a bigtime...

338
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,349
paleobiologist, like yourself,
works here.

339
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,272
No. I need the money.

340
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,839
Come with us.

341
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,594
Whatever for? I merely
exercised my rights to...

342
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,233
National security.

343
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,349
You okay?

344
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,431
Your sister's holding up...

345
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,874
I don't know.

346
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,351
She had a rough time.

347
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,189
Our mother is not exactly...

348
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,994
the best role model.

349
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,754
- How do you mean?
- She drinks.

350
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,673
But I thought bringing Lisa
up here would help.

351
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,550
Help you, or her?

352
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,272
Both of us.

353
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,314
I have this need to...

354
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,515
take charge.

355
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,790
I noticed that.

356
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,268
So...

357
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,873
Harvard...

358
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,551
a few years with the FBI.

359
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,638
What are you doing here?

360
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,955
Yeah.

361
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,948
See...

362
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,632
He had a gun.

363
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,196
He was hiding in a closet.

364
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,150
And the gun turned out to be a toy.

365
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,078
Carrying his picture with you...

366
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,911
Why torture yourself?

367
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,993
He shouldn't be forgotten.

368
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,390
I need an escort.

369
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,155
I'll do it.

370
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,272
Okay, you're all set.

371
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,078
This is so embarrassing.

372
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,799
I'll be right outside.

373
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,871
That was stupid.

374
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,475
Want to see something?

375
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,195
You are so fucking cute.

376
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,518
My God, he's in there!

377
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,399
There's nobody in there.

378
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,709
Yes, there was.

379
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,352
They couldn't just evaporate.

380
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,996
It's like that bathroom.
No windows, a locked door...

381
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,909
Yes!

382
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,229
- They're here!
- Thank God!

383
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,195
What the hell?

384
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,549
Come on!

385
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,789
Reconnaissance.

386
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,639
Infrared photography.
It's not going to stop.

387
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,549
Get your stuff.
I'll get you out of here.

388
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,199
I am a legal resident
of the United States.

389
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,835
I have the right to an attorney.

390
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,953
If I'm not arrested,
this could be construed...

391
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,599
as kidnapping.

392
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,273
If you people really know
where Elvis is...

393
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,879
we'd like to know.

394
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,910
What?

395
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,434
We've been looking
for him a long time.

396
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,719
Yes, sir.

397
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,358
The King sure is slippery.

398
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,317
You can't stay here alone,
miles from anyplace.

399
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,198
Someone has to be here.

400
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,118
Just go, okay?

401
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,674
- Come on!
- AI right, pop the hood.

402
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,588
You got to be kidding.

403
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,434
Looks like it's been
crushed in a press.

404
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,960
Help me! Somebody! Please!

405
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,550
Please! For God's sake! Help me!

406
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,432
No one's really out there.

407
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,272
It's just trying to bait us.

408
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,391
Like your deputy at the inn.

409
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,159
Let's go back inside.

410
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,433
Gun's won't do it, General.

411
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,352
We're not just about guns.

412
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,878
Why not shoot me dead
right here, right now...

413
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,309
and save trouble?

414
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,077
Do you people hire
only stunt drivers?

415
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,396
We're interested in
"The Ancient Enemy".

416
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,074
Not the tabloid stuff.
The hard science.

417
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,109
History is filled with
mysterious disappearances...

418
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,272
and neither archeologists
nor anthropologists can provide...

419
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,198
- explanations.
- For instance?

420
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,836
December 10th, 1939, in the
hills outside Nanking, in China...

421
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,997
an army of 3,000 Chinese soldiers...

422
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,316
vanished without a trace...

423
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,436
long before reaching the battlefield.

424
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,518
No bodies. No graves. No Witnesses.

425
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,954
The Mayan cities of Copán,
Piedras Negras, Palenque...

426
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,839
back in 60 A.D. Deserted overnight.

427
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,674
Hundreds of thousands
of Mayans missing.

428
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,520
Theories of disease
or war don't explain...

429
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,149
why there were no mass graves.
There's evidence...

430
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,271
that Mayan families vanished

431
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,791
after preparing dinners,
but before eating them.

432
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,793
There is the disappearance
of the English colony...

433
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,389
on Roanoke Island, in 1590.

434
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,193
Many others. Many.

435
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,031
Just what is this thing?

436
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,914
Chaos.

437
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,998
Chaos in the flesh.

438
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,317
You're looking at our field lab.

439
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,112
It's bacteriologically secure.

440
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,920
It's armored to withstand
point-blank mortar fire.

441
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,718
No terrorist can take it out.

442
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,114
We operate on the basis of...

443
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,316
very broken communication,

444
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,949
and an aerial recon.
Both inconclusive.

445
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,872
Our scientific team, grouped
for every contingency.

446
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,193
Let me remind you that Dr. Flyte's
name was found in Snowfield.

447
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,919
A victim scrawled it on a mirror.

448
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,278
A desperate, dying act.

449
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,916
The victim must've seen something
to lend credence to Dr. Flyte's theory.

450
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,069
Got a little...

451
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,958
breakfast and dinner here.

452
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,193
We're never going to get
out of here. None of us.

453
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,038
Hey, listen.

454
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,679
I don't know what it is...

455
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,713
but it's playing with us.

456
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,598
The lights, noises on the phone...

457
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,309
the moth with Wargle.

458
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,388
I don't know, but if we keep
our heads straight, we'll get out.

459
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,718
- I promise you.
- How can you be so sure?

460
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,831
Maybe we are going to make it.

461
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,835
Sheriff Hammond?

462
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,471
Deputies Wargle and
Shannon were here?

463
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,998
They were. They were killed
during the night.

464
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,429
Then it is ongoing.

465
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,275
The name on the mirror.
¿ How do you fit into this?

466
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,748
Reluctantly.

467
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,956
We need to know
what we're dealing with.

468
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,992
What kind of threat it is.

469
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,548
Biological, chemical or other.

470
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,159
I'm leaning toward "other."

471
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,239
Bernstein house, 214 Vail Street.

472
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,711
They were evidently
about to have dinner...

473
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,393
when something happened.

474
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,718
Recording. Residence
of Dr. Jennifer Pailey.

475
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,639
Kitchen. Evidence of
severe trauma, perhaps...

476
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,074
toxicological injury.

477
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,310
In the 48 hours...

478
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,036
prior to these events, did you
get reports of power failures...

479
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,350
phone interruptions, strange lights?

480
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,194
We haven't seen flying saucers,
if that's what you mean.

481
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,950
Should be a junction box here.

482
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,316
We'll tap into it, power up the lab.

483
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,315
Doctor!

484
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,916
Look at this.

485
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,116
Recording. At the base of
the statue of Mary...

486
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,273
almost like an offering...

487
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,393
there's a large accumulation
of metal buttons...

488
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,275
wristwatches, jewelry...

489
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,475
Everything metal.

490
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,153
Not an offering.

491
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,751
Undigested remains.

492
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,511
And a little something preserved...

493
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,910
and put aside for later...

494
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,913
like a spider might do it.

495
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,670
Got something.

496
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,635
Looks like a breach in the trunk lines.

497
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,311
That's the interrupted phone service.

498
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,234
Little ones to Him are drawn.

499
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,672
They are weak.

500
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,797
But he is strong.

501
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,155
Where's it coming from?

502
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,709
Yes, Jesus loves me.

503
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,954
It's nothing.

504
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,998
Oh, God! Oh, God!

505
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,594
Hold it, goddamn it!

506
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,752
It's sludge, man.

507
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,075
It's just...

508
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,476
plain, old stinking sewage.

509
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,233
Oh, my God.

510
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,519
You make that connection?

511
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,717
- Something here.
- What do you got?

512
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,119
In the next tunnel.

513
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,391
What the hell is that?
Move your ass out of there now!

514
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,549
Get out of there!

515
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,829
Move it! Now!

516
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,675
Reach, man!

517
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,514
Jesus Christ!

518
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,359
Sergeant Harker, meet me
outside CWB, right now.

519
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,158
I'm registering
no toxic fumes of any kind.

520
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,469
Here fella.

521
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,555
Here, boy!

522
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,114
He lived through it.

523
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,515
Come on!

524
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,076
But how did he live through it?

525
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,519
That's a good dog.

526
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,310
It's okay. That's a good dog.

527
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,710
That's a good boy. It's okay, yeah.

528
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,916
Better...

529
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,638
Better get away from him.

530
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,833
You like that, don't you?

531
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,114
Jesus, what the hell?

532
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,679
What is it?

533
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,473
Lockland, get out!

534
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,478
- Get away!
- Soldier, get up here!

535
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,399
Now!

536
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,949
Flyte.

537
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,111
You were brought here, Dr. Flyte.
Do your research.

538
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,596
Write the gospel.

539
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,829
Go.

540
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,670
It's here.

541
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,229
It's everywhere! All around us!

542
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,992
Holy Jesus!

543
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,834
Dr. Flyte, what is this?

544
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,199
My flesh.

545
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,953
Study it.

546
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,312
Write the gospel.

547
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,359
But do not try to leave.

548
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,119
Witnesses to the miracle.

549
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,435
I have to run an analysis.

550
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,079
And that's what I was born to do.

551
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,637
The lab is a tank. We are
getting out of here.

552
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,353
Against this thing,
the lab's vulnerable.

553
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,272
There are a hundred ways...

554
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,471
it could stop us.

555
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,436
Why aren't we dead,
like the rest of them?

556
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,668
It needed us...

557
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,118
to get to Flyte.

558
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,318
It's like he's some kind of...

559
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,199
disciple or something.

560
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,388
"Write the gospel".

561
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,551
And now Flyte's here.

562
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,718
If it can think, really think,
then we're finished.

563
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,152
Maybe it's like...

564
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,635
flatworm learning.

565
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,910
Like what?

566
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,634
Flatworms can learn
to negotiate a maze.

567
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,279
If you grind them up...

568
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,637
and feed them to another
batch of flatworms, batch two

569
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,110
can run the same maze
on the first try.

570
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,999
They absorb the knowledge
with the flesh.

571
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,792
They gave me a tour.

572
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,792
The oldest living thing
on the planet.

573
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,719
We would have heard of
it by now. It wasn't shy.

574
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,349
It lives out of sight, in the earth...

575
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,915
in deep geological structures.

576
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,879
- But if it comes up to feed...
- Rarely.

577
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,915
Mostly it sifts life
forms from the soil...

578
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,674
like a whale sifts
tiny krill and plankton...

579
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,555
from the ocean. No doubt
it feeds on marine life too.

580
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,634
It may lie dormant between
feeding for years or decades.

581
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,914
Over centuries, only
a tiny percentage

582
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,435
of its prey has been human beings.

583
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,517
It has absorbed knowledge...

584
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,831
acquired intelligence.

585
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,874
This thing can assume the form
of anything it's absorbed?

586
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,111
Maybe even imaginary creatures.

587
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,557
Anything the victim may have seen

588
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,952
or even dreamed about.

589
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,071
It knows everything people knew

590
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,353
about you, Dr. Flyte...

591
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,313
and about me.

592
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,515
What's happening?

593
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,351
Vocal mode initiated.

594
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,436
Tell the world the end begins here.

595
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,749
Who are you.

596
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,194
I am Baal.

597
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,913
I am Belial.

598
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,118
Demons. Devils.

599
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,631
Some victims must have thought
it was the devil.

600
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,912
It absorbed that
concept from them...

601
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,237
and believes that's what it is.

602
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,629
Why kill those people?

603
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,713
They are cattle.

604
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,109
Nut you let us live.

605
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,439
One of you has
theorized my existence.

606
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,759
It's like a pet monkey
learning a difficult trick.

607
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,069
He is my Matthew...

608
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,960
Mark, Luke and John.

609
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,676
Only in me can you
achieve immortality.

610
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,313
Not in God...

611
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,555
not in Christ...

612
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,638
only in me.

613
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,837
If we do what you say...

614
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,315
will we live?

615
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,036
- Hold on!
- What's happening?

616
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,909
It's playing with us.

617
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,395
Warning. Lab stability threatened.

618
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,749
All right, enough!

619
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,191
It's not a god, it's not a devil.
It's just a fucking animal!

620
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,429
Any living thing can be killed!

621
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,591
It is what wiped out the dinosaurs...

622
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,876
which were pretty tough customers!

623
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,953
I'm just saying I know
it's got a weakness!

624
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,719
- What weakness!
- Ego!

625
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,029
It thinks its Satan.

626
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,634
Satan had the biggest ego of all.

627
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,909
And he took a fall.

628
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,315
Right!

629
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,998
And turned the town into a fun house.

630
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,317
It manipulates us into
bringing you here, Dr. Flyte.

631
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,399
It wanted you to see it.
It wanted you to!

632
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,354
Show me how to kill
this fucking thing.

633
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,394
If there were a way, we wouldn't
have been given the tissue sample!

634
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,274
You're not listening.
It thinks it's all-powerful!

635
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,915
It's lived too long without fear.

636
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,675
For years nothing could kill it!
That makes it vulnerable.

637
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,714
What are these other
things we've seen?

638
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,593
Drones, phantoms...

639
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,159
detached, sent on a task.

640
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,992
They return to the mother mass...

641
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,429
underground.

642
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,833
Warning. Lab stability threatened.

643
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,308
Guess so.

644
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,793
How big is this thing?

645
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,709
Big.

646
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,678
How do you know for sure?

647
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,029
Logical deduction.

648
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,719
Logical deduction, yeah.

649
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,594
From a guy who writes
about Bigfoot for a living.

650
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,996
What about chemicals or acid?

651
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,639
You'd need a truckload.

652
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,314
And how would you
deliver it to the target?

653
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,915
Maybe nukes?

654
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,599
Same problem.

655
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,394
How do you find the target,
deliver a bomb to it...

656
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,158
and be sure you got it all?

657
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,794
Warning. Microbe
sample vault is open.

658
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,194
Thank you.

659
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,633
You're welcome.

660
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,235
You okay?

661
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,591
I was just wondering...

662
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,756
What?

663
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,753
Do you think all those
people it's taken...

664
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,672
they're still trapped and aware?

665
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,035
No.

666
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,551
No. They're gone.

667
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,835
Dead and gone.

668
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,151
Being trapped inside of it
would be like being in hell.

669
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,792
It's not that way.

670
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,957
I don't want to go to hell.

671
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,069
What?

672
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,109
Got something?

673
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,118
Petrolatum.

674
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,830
It's a lot more complex
than the composition...

675
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,031
of petroleum jelly, of course.

676
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,516
But there are similarities in the
ratio of hydrocarbons.

677
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,639
And a longer list of minerals
and chemicals than in the human body.

678
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,550
Hydrocarbons.

679
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,033
I wonder...

680
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,310
- What is it?
- Samples of bacteria, virus...

681
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,592
Plus a selection of
man-made microbes.

682
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,035
Oh, glorious day!

683
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,878
CBW 123, this is command post.
Do you copy?

684
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,789
What do you got?

685
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,992
CBW hasn't reported in.
I can't raise them.

686
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,236
Major, you'd better check this out.

687
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,319
It could hear us through
the electronics, not now.

688
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,669
What's in the vial?

689
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,435
Biosan-14. A genetically
engineered bacteria.

690
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,273
- A man-made disease?
- No.

691
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,949
Harmless to us,
it's a working bacterium.

692
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,675
Eats crude oil and excretes
harmless byproducts.

693
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,394
They use it to break
up oil spills.

694
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,717
Biosan-14 is new,
the most aggressive strain yet.

695
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,957
It can survive only in an
oil-rich environment. But then...

696
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,353
each microorganism reproduces
itself every 11 seconds.

697
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,028
That would swarm through oil.

698
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,152
Since the Gulf War,
they've carried a sample in case...

699
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,994
terrorists contaminate
an oil field with it.

700
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,437
You're saying that we
can use this stuff...

701
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,636
to attack The Ancient Enemy...

702
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,838
like it was an oil spill,
and infect it?

703
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,036
If its hydrocarbon structures
are similar to petroleum...

704
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,710
It's a big stretch, but...

705
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,796
It'll wonder why the power's off.

706
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,590
- It'll know we're up to something.
- It doesn't fear us.

707
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,154
It believes it's immortal.

708
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,435
Maybe it is.

709
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,756
Is one vial enough?

710
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:05,029
If it reproduces every 11 seconds,
we can have a lot in 1 hour.

711
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,230
True.

712
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,590
We need to find a way
to get at the mother mass...

713
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,233
and we need some kind of a...

714
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,510
delivery system for this stuff.

715
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,352
But if we do that...

716
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,634
will it kill it at all?

717
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,751
Unless there's a small inner core...

718
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,157
that can tear loose from the
mass and survive on its own.

719
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,075
I really just wanted you to say yes.

720
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,957
Jesus Christ.

721
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,912
I only want to tell the world.

722
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,279
So how do you propose to draw...

723
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,828
the whole mass to us?

724
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,349
What?

725
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,794
No.

726
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,118
Oh, no.

727
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,873
I'm here.

728
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,393
Your witness.

729
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:12,149
If I'm to tell the world,
I need to see...

730
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,033
all of you...

731
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,077
not just a drone.

732
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,828
You wonder what's going on in there?

733
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,199
They're preparing a weapon...

734
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,712
possibly a means to destroy you.

735
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,594
I don't believe him.
He's selling us out.

736
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,911
He's trying to save his own ass.

737
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,358
Wait for him to play his hand.

738
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,270
Specifically, it's a genetically
engineered bacterium...

739
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,278
capable of devouring your flesh.

740
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,437
Capable, they think,

741
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,953
of killing you.

742
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,837
They don't understand
that death is for mortals...

743
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,475
not for gods.

744
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,917
Even after all they've
witnessed tonight...

745
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:10,193
they still don't believe.
They still think you are an animal...

746
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,192
only a thing.

747
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,108
Show yourself.

748
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,196
Gods have nothing to fear.

749
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,035
Or do they?

750
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,915
Now.

751
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,438
Now would be a good time.

752
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,275
It's pissed off.

753
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,714
Infected.

754
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,389
Get in the lab.

755
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:13,556
Run!

756
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,235
I think we got it.

757
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,198
We got to get off the street.

758
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,474
I think it's infected.

759
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,630
Maybe.

760
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,075
Come on. It's crawling away to die.

761
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,436
Makes it even more dangerous.

762
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,952
Fuck you!

763
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,715
Dead yet?

764
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,193
Let's go.

765
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,713
Come on, you bastard.

766
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,268
You got some guns.

767
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:51,790
Ladies...

768
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,351
you wouldn't shoot an unarmed man.

769
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,994
A dumb question.

770
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:18,949
I fall...

771
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,719
...to pieces...

772
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,434
each time I see you again.

773
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,908
You want to see something?

774
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,153
It's limbo time!

775
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,998
How low can you go?

776
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,395
Get down!

777
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,558
Go! Go!

778
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,229
You girls slip me a Mickey?

779
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,189
Why are you killing me?

780
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,429
Help!

781
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,513
I'm going to let you live.

782
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,834
Let you live in me.

783
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,116
Forever.

784
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,395
Fuck you.

785
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,754
Always that urge
to shoot little boys.

786
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,516
No. This time I'm going to miss.

787
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,959
It's all right.

788
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,115
It's gone.

789
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,716
All those souls, maybe...

790
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,999
they're at peace.

791
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,509
Yes.

792
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,598
One wonders.

793
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,917
Still... it won.

794
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,429
What do you mean?

795
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,596
It wanted me to tell the world...

796
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,515
and that's what I'm going to do.

797
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,835
The Earth endures.

798
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:58,153
Over the eons, countless
species have flourished...

799
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:00,032
then perished.

800
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,708
In the town of Snowfield,
the four of us...

801
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,748
met and bested
an inhuman intelligence...

802
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,153
not from the stars...

803
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,277
but from the deep and secret realms...

804
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:15,075
of our own infinitely
misterious world.

805
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,356
This supremely powerful life force...

806
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,280
so adaptable, seemingly immortal...

807
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,238
is it gone?

808
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,078
If not...

809
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:30,719
it may one day be the cause
of humanity's extinction.

810
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,270
You believe that crap?

811
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:35,154
I don't know.
Stranger things have happened.

812
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,715
Patti said Glen was
abducted by aliens.

813
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,190
Glen wasn't abducted. He run off to L.A.

814
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,789
And you would too if
you was married to Patti.

815
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,359
Does that sound funny...

816
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,513
officer?

817
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,439
No, ma'am.

818
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,599
You want to see something?
