and down to Manchac's E.R.

472
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,355

- No, Manchac's a dump.

473

474
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,271
He's going to sit,
waiting to get transferred

475
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,396
or else they're going to
butcher him even worse.

476
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,751
- We got to get him to St. Francis.
- No, no, we can't move him.

477
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,514
He's lost too much blood already, OK?
I have to keep him stable.

478
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,868
All right, all right.

479
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,391

grab a signal, we'll radio the Medevac.

- Take me.

- No, no, no.

483

Yeah, OK? Beth is a mess right now.

Yeah, Gordon, you can't.

487

I'm not going to let her go on that boat
alone with swamp thing here. I'm going.

You can't win and trust me,
it never ends.

531
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,798
Why haven't you been back here
for three years?

532
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,791
Every summer, all the little
rich girls around here would

533
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,753
sign up for diving lessons
with Dennis Crim.

534
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,359
He was the hot blonde,
with sensitive blue eyes.

535
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,036
Some kind of teenage fantasy, I guess.

536
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,351
For two summers,
we did everything together.

537
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,190
Then I had to go to college, and
he was never going to leave the water,

538
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,198
so I broke it off.

539
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,629
So a few days
before I was supposed to leave...

540
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,194
...he took me to our favorite
diving spot to say goodbye.

541
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,316
We were only down there
for a few minutes...

542
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,553
...and suddenly I couldn't breathe.

543
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,712
I figured my air gauge was broken,
so I gave him the signal...

544
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,714
...and he just, he just stared at me.

545
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,389
And...

546
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,754
...I reached out to share his air and...

547
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,071
...and he just kind of drifted away.

548
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,589
Jesus.

549
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,077
Somehow I made it to the surface.

550
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,910
And I climbed up to our skiff and...

551
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,998
...I spun around to leave him there and...

552
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,676
...I cut his face open with the propeller.

553
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,115
It was an accident, Sara.

554
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,076
After I took him to the hospital...

555
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,919
...I never went back.

556
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,998
And that was on purpose.

557

brought you guys here.

this year.

579

maybe one came out of the Gulf,

580
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,478
flooded up over the interstate,
wound up here...

What do you want me to do?

629
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,833
I want you to get in the water.

630
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,793
What? No. I'm not going to get
in the water.

631
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,670
- In the water, now!
- Calm down.

632
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,314
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Get in the water.

633
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,750
Listen. I can't get in the water.
There's a...

634
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,995
A shark?

635
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,671
- Yeah, I know.
- Who do you think put them there?

636

Oh, my God.

00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,509
OK, OK.

wasn't a hammerhead.

What?

651
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,630
It swam right past me, and it was
a completely different shark.

Yeah, I just, I don't know

654
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,277

they open the floodgates

pouring in, maybe they...

00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,475
...maybe they snuck in somehow.
I don't know.

we can't take him back in the water.

how many, now, Red?

696
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,998
Forty-five, as of yesterday, but...

697
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,670
...we went diving this morning.

DENNIS: It's pretty, huh?

705
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,038
They're called photophores.

706
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,797
That means cells that light up.

They swallow their own teeth.
