1
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,881
Hey, you know what happened?.

2
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,982
Some kind of accident.
Those construction guys left

3
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,856
before the ambulance
even got here.

4
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,087
- Lights, right?.
- Yeah, two packs.

5
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,394
Does that work?.

6
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,765
I hope so.

7
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,606
Good one!.

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,380
The card
didn't go through.

9
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:26,748
- God, I'm sorry. Here, try this one.
- No prob.

10
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,252
There we go.

11
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,794
You have a good one.
See ya.

12
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,929
See ya.

13
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,909
- Hey, good evening, Daisy.
- Hey, Luis. What happened?.

14
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,241
They're working on
the electrical system today.

15
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,542
Junction box shorted out
as someone was working.

16
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,016
- Blew them through the third floor window.
- My God, that's awful!

17
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,343
There it goes again.

18
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,151
The contractor quit
right after it happened.

19
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,955
- Do you know who it was?.
- Joe Sterling, foreman.

20
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,359
- He's an older gentleman.
- The one who wore the plaid shirts?.

21
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,830
- That's him.
- He was a nice old man.

22
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,663
- Good night.
- Good night.

23
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,340
Steven!

24
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,070
Come on!

25
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,615
Daisy, it's Eva.

26
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,982
Your callback
has been rescheduled

27
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,715
for Wednesday at 3.. 00.

28
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,018
Wednesday at 3.. 00. Okay?.

29
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,184
God, I already changed
my shift twice.

30
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,286
Hi, Daisy. William here.

31
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,456
You never called me back.

32
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,466
Anyway, I thought
we could go hiking

33
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,093
in Angeles Crest
this weekend.

34
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,762
Give me a call.

35
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,609
Were you aiming
for Dante's third

36
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,443
or fourth circle of hell?.

37
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,983
It was just bad timing.

38
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,848
Honey, bad timing
is arriving late for dinner.

39
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,412
- This is fireballing the restaurant.
- We moved in on a crazy night.

40
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,322
They haven't even fixed the place up yet.
That's all gonna change.

41
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,258
- I just don't like it.
- Honey--

42
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,263
Sorry to interrupt.

43
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,494
Remember me?.
Byron, the building manager?.

44
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,538
Yeah, of course.

45
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,505
Hi. This must be
your wife Nell.

46
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,337
Yes.

47
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:02,278
I just dropped by to say hello.
I wanted to welcome you guys.

48
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,214
I know it's a bit of a shock
with all the hubbub

49
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,809
and emergency personnel,

50
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,820
but we're really
a quiet building.

51
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,618
Did I give you
the storage keys?.

52
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,489
- We have them.
- Okay, good.

53
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,621
Okay, well, I live in
the apartment below you guys.

54
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,824
Same apartment
Elizabeth Short lived in.

55
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,366
The Black Dahlia.

56
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,599
There's a lot of old history
in this building. It's so old.

57
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,802
There's so much to...
Do you wanna see the laundry room?.

58
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:32,878
Yeah.

59
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,779
Look, our faucets are leaking.
Like shooting out brown water.

60
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,182
And you said you were
gonna replace our stove.

61
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,188
Okay. Well, yeah.
We'll get Ned right on it.

62
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,953
Any fix-it problems you have,
just call Ned at extension 1 0.

63
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,319
He's our handyman
right on the premises.

64
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,422
No need to wait.

65
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,195
Shit.

66
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,169
- Do you need to take that?. Should I just go?.
- In a minute.

67
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,797
There's also a problem
with the shower.

68
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,373
Right.
Here's one really big plus.

69
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,109
You can always buzz Luis, the doorman,
and have him call Ned.

70
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,311
Or just let him know if somebody's
comin' over like this.

71
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,948
Luis, the vice chancellor will be here at 3..00
for finger sandwiches.

72
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,185
- Right, Byron.
- lsn't that great?.

73
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,961
You know, there's not too many buildings
in this price range

74
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,899
that offer the safety
and security of a doorman.

75
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,731
That's something.

76
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,704
Can I show you guys
the outside?.

77
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,073
Just wanna show you something
out in the hallway real quick.

78
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,645
This is really
quite interesting.

79
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,910
Now notice the unique
architectural designs.

80
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,649
It really adds to
the ambience of the building.

81
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,163
And we've got modern amenities
like the elevator.

82
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,260
Hey, guys, can you
hold that for me?.

83
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,306
Nice family. Good kid.
You'll meet 'em and get along great.

84
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,399
Feel right at home.
Listen, I've gotta run.

85
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,106
Really, we're a very friendly building.
Welcome. Welcome.

86
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,015
Let's go. Thanks. New people.
Teacher and a doctor.

87
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,816
- Our shower still doesn't work.
- Ned should take care of that.

88
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,726
Keys are in the kitchen, I think.

89
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,873
Steven! Steven.

90
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,841
We need to break in
the apartment.

91
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,469
- Uh-uh. You have not created the mood.
- Uh-huh.

92
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,016
That can be arranged.

93
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,624
The neighbors.

94
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,668
What now?.

95
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,748
Hang on.

96
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,350
Hold that thought.

97
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,592
- Yeah, do you like tea?.
- I guess.

98
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,427
'Cause I'm cleaning out my kitchen
and I have all this tea.

99
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,558
Never opened.
I'll bring it over.

100
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,431
Great. Thank you.

101
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,530
- I live next door. Saffron.
- I'm Nell.

102
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,339
And this is...Steven.

103
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,775
Hey, Luis.

104
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,039
- Yeah.
- Hans is coming over later.

105
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,842
- Got it.
- Mine's broken.

106
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:03,548
So, do you hear
all of the hammering?.

107
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,557
What?.

108
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,523
It's late at night
and it never stops.

109
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:11,255
Sometimes I think
that it's stuck inside my head.

110
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,215
Hi. I'm Julia.

111
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,387
Hi. I'm Julia.

112
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,653
- Austin!
- Hand meet door.

113
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,190
No. It should be
alphabetical.

114
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,261
- Philip, make sure I have a spare set of hose.
- Yes, dear.

115
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,692
Look, I've gotta go.

116
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,996
- Austin, did you leave school early?.
- No.

117
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,260
- Luis said you came home at noon.
- Honey.

118
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,064
- I don't have afternoon classes.
- He doesn't have afternoon classes.

119
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,604
Oh. Right.

120
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,468
So, aren't you guys gonna be late?.

121
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,238
Jesus, Philip, I can't wear
black hose with this!

122
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,176
- You said--
- No, I didn't mean that.

123
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,976
What's all the hoopla about?.

124
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,985
- I'm working a cancer society benefit.
- I love cancer.

125
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,853
Don't stay up
so late tonight. Okay?.

126
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:27,091
Hello?. No.
I don't know.

127
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,929
Missed it!

128
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,466
Bullshit!

129
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,704
You were hanging
all over her!

130
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:46,115
You're so full of shit!

131
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,311
I know everything that's going on!

132
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,186
You go around like a fucking bag lady!

133
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,250
You get so hysterical 'cause I don't have
enough drugs for you?.

134
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,593
Why do you always leave me?.

135
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,599
You're always leaving me!

136
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,432
- I love you! I do!
- No, you don't.

137
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,563
I fucking hate you!

138
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,201
I hate you! I hate you!
Get the fuck outta my house!

139
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,108
Sounds great. I'm out!

140
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:29,717
- Are you leaving?. Are you gonna come back?.
- I don't know if I'm comin' back.

141
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,282
Oh, God!

142
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,889
You're Ned, right?.

143
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,333
I'm doing repairs.

144
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,035
Which way is the laundry room?.

145
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,174
Go back outside, make a left.

146
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,747
You'll find it.

147
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,339
Hi, there.
Any of these washers free?.

148
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,341
Yup. Come on in.

149
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:28,106
Don't mind me.
Just folding my skivvies.

150
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,577
That one'll run hot no matter
what you tell it to do.

151
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:39,088
Oh, really?.
Thanks.

152
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,751
You new here?.

153
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,227
Yeah. My husband and l
just moved in tonight.

154
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,070
My name is Nell.

155
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,938
Charles Rooker.
Call me Chas.

156
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,342
You and your hubby actors?.

157
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,746
No.

158
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,546
He's just finishing up med
school, and I am a teacher.

159
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,787
Stable. Honest.
That's good.

160
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,588
Seen too many pretty ones who move here
and get their hearts broken.

161
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,925
Leave just to make room
for another.

162
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:23,058
Good for you
for inculcating young minds!

163
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:27,468
Well, hopefully
I'll get a job soon.

164
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,835
Steven's set though.

165
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,432
He's got residency at the E. R.
at the Wilshire Memorial.

166
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,680
- How 'bout you?. You lived here a long time?.
- Since '47.

167
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,189
- Right after the war.
- You've lived here since 1947?.

168
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,191
And still on my feet!

169
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:54,092
Hell, I was here
before Jack Lusman disappeared.

170
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,599
Lusman.
As in this building Lusman?.

171
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,695
Yup. He built it.

172
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,799
Wanted it to be a getaway

173
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,743
for all the movie stars

174
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,144
who shared his proclivities.

175
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,843
But they're fickle.

176
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:18,287
Discard one fad
just to embrace another.

177
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,517
Can't count on 'em
for anything.

178
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,528
'Course it didn't help

179
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,690
that a lot of the guys
working construction here

180
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,994
met a bad end.

181
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,662
What do you mean?.

182
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,251
Luis, it's Julia.

183
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,451
Yeah.

184
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,224
Here you go.
Catch.

185
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,698
- You're a lifesaver.
- It's a full-time job with you, isn't it?.

186
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,235
All this huffing and puffing
and runnin' in circles

187
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:09,273
- to get back to where you started.
- I'm gonna get you to come with me.

188
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,502
No, no, no.
I'm a stand-in-one-place kind of a guy.

189
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,273
- It's working.
- Yeah!

190
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,045
- Good night, Luis.
- Good night.

191
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,455
Hi, Julia.

192
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,889
Hello, Ned.

193
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,587
You've lost
a lot of weight.

194
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,564
Fifty-seven pounds.

195
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,903
I think you look pretty at any size.

196
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,909
Thanks.

197
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,735
Stop it! Stop it!

198
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,133
I told you, get out.
Get out!

199
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,798
What, what the fuck
is that?.

200
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,398
What the fuck is that?.

201
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,410
Stop it. Get out.

202
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,960
Ma'am, just stay
right there.

203
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,621
Get the fuck out!

204
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,790
Shut up and die, motherfucker!

205
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,733
- Police!
- Freeze!

206
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,030
What's goin' on here?.

207
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,740
Byron's helping me
run lines.

208
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,673
I have a callback.

209
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:29,178
Look. "Sweet Jesus,
what the fuck is that?.

210
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:33,115
- What the fuck is that??"
- "Shut up and bleed, motherfucker."

211
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,947
Mrs. Barrow,

212
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,785
need you to take
a look at this.

213
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,096
They were rehearsing.

214
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,392
Dude, this part is mine.

215
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,094
I am so sorry.

216
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,172
I really thought something
awful was happening.

217
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:58,902
That's okay. You were just being
a good neighbor. Break a leg.

218
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:33,076
- So these guys were acting.
- Yeah, they were actors.

219
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,279
How can you laugh at that?.

220
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:45,015
I can't believe you.

221
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,318
Sweetie, I'm laughing
with you.

222
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,759
Am I laughing?.
I don't think so!

223
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,228
We have to shell out
80 bucks to fix that door.

224
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,662
That's a great story.

225
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,293
In two days, you'll be
calling your whole family.

226
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,068
Nell, I'm sorry, hon.

227
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,269
No, it's all right.
It's okay, it's okay.

228
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,142
Jesus, these walls are cardboard.

229
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,178
Yep, that is what I'm talking about.

230
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,280
It has been like that all night.

231
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:22,087
You know,
what I'm gonna do is,

232
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:25,357
I'm gonna put up
some acoustic tiles,

233
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,761
some baffling here.

234
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,033
Oh, leave 'em alone.

235
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,107
They're finally making up.

236
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,372
Oh, God!

237
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,746
Hey, honey, you wanna call
the cops, or should l?.

238
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,027
Steven!

239
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,473
They aren't...

240
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,342
Yeah, they are.

241
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,443
Perhaps a family
that lived here long ago.

242
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,748
Maybe this is the way

243
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,790
they handled
the tooth fairy.

244
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:37,623
Those are not children's teeth.
They have gold fillings.

245
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,459
The roots are still attached to them
like they were wrenched out!

246
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,294
Honey, no visuals.

247
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,563
Well, the building's been
here since the '20s

248
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,506
so I'd say from the look
of the box,

249
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,876
that it's been here
a long time.

250
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,974
A lot of black magic
uses various body parts.

251
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,451
The ancient Saxons built
whole temples out of bones.

252
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,853
Ned, go take care of the damage
in the Burrow's apartment.

253
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:10,155
- And dispose of the teeth.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,094
You said these renovations
would be a minor inconvenience.

255
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,894
They're not even happening,
yet we're living in a madhouse!

256
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,368
I need rest, and Nell shouldn't have to put up
with all this.

257
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,962
Folks, I'm unsettled, too.

258
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,837
Teeth in the wall equals weird,
no question about it.

259
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,605
It's just part of the building's
charm and character.

260
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:31,773
There's a lot of history here,
and you're part of it.

261
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,348
And by the way,

262
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:43,792
if you break your lease,

263
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,796
you lose
your security deposit.

264
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,971
- We'll be okay without it.
- I don't think so.

265
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,977
This move set us back.

266
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,446
Steven, it just feels
wrong here.

267
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,211
I can't get another day off
to move, all right?.

268
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:10,151
We'll have to wait till the end of this rotation.

269
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,987
Not now.

270
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,323
I'll be back as soon
as I can, all right?.

271
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,693
We'll figure this out.
I promise.

272
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,430
Hi, Julia.

273
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,407
No. Wait a second.

274
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,136
Come on.

275
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,168
The government
seems so surreal

276
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,866
When sun and heat
is all I feel

277
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:20,843
It's a surrealistic summer

278
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:25,109
A surrealistic summer

279
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:29,414
As I sit here
slowly waiting

280
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:37,085
It's a surrealistic summer

281
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,961
Surrealistic summer

282
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,762
As I sit here
slowing waiting

283
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:49,238
I feel just like
a Dali painting

284
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,208
Oh, come on!

285
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,222
Thank you.

286
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,461
Who the fuck are you?.

287
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:23,462
My boyfriend's gonna be back
any minute. Get outta here!

288
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,802
Stay the fuck away from me,
you crazy fuck!

289
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:36,917
Help me! Somebody
help me! Please!

290
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,319
Please help me!

291
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,892
Please help me!

292
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,926
Let me go! Help me!

293
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,760
Oh, God!

294
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,272
She was screaming
and crying.

295
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,967
Please just check it out.

296
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,307
- She another actress, ma'am?.
- I would not call you if I didn't...

297
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,245
Her boyfriend could've
beaten her or worse.

298
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,048
Saffron?. You home?.

299
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,122
Ma'am, I know you mean well.

300
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,623
But this is your second call
in two days.

301
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,217
She and her boyfriend had
a horrible fight the other day.

302
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,023
They always do.

303
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,860
If you have a noise complaint,
I'll take care of it.

304
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,799
You would just tell me it was
part of the building's charm.

305
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,302
This guy is running a rat hole.
Look around you.

306
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,430
Historic building!
Thank you very much!

307
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,839
Enough! Both of you.

308
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,879
Sir, we're already here so just let us check out
the room, okay?.

309
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,676
- Fine.
- Open it up.

310
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,119
- Ned, open the door.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

311
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:51,688
- Police!
- Saffron, it's Byron. Are you okay?. Hello!

312
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,730
Stay here please, gentlemen.

313
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,800
It looks like
it usually does.

314
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,562
Saffron?.

315
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,735
Just like I told you, ma'am.
Nothing's going on here.

316
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,173
You didn't check the closets,
under the bed.

317
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,303
Are you trying to tell me
how to do my job?.

318
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,439
Nothing happened here.

319
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,204
You should come to bed.

320
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,874
No. Not her.

321
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:50,386
She probably spent the night
at her boyfriend's.

322
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,922
Will you please, please come to bed?.

323
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,723
I'm on call in four hours.

324
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,593
I'm sure she's fine.

325
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,065
You're right.

326
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,469
I'm sure it's nothing.

327
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,841
Come on.

328
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,639
Are you comin'?.

329
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,613
Luis?.

330
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,682
Ned?.

331
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,906
Is there a problem?.

332
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,177
No.

333
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,014
I'm fine.

334
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,527
Excuse me.

335
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,790
My name is Nell Barrow.
I'm Saffron's new neighbor.

336
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,990
I was just wondering.
Is she okay?.

337
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,536
- I thought I heard something.
- Fucking?.

338
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:56,164
No, a scream like.

339
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,607
She likes to hurt, too.

340
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,441
See, the thing is, is that
we went up to check on her,

341
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,777
and she wasn't there.

342
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,783
- Did you see--
- Lady.

343
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:11,286
What do you care whether she's in or not
unless you're fucking her, too.

344
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,687
No! I just thought
she might be hurt.

345
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:19,759
Hurt?. Excuse me, hurt because she's making
lots of noise?.

346
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:23,061
No, It's nothing. I thought
I heard her scream.

347
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,294
Did the fucking bitch go
to Ojai with Kevin?.

348
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,098
I'll tell you what,
neighbor lady,

349
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,934
if you see
Miss Dirty Legs again,

350
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,841
you tell her
that I am fucking outta here.

351
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,859
Hey, great taste
in shoes.

352
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,937
Hey, you, too.

353
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,038
How far did you run?.

354
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,168
Five miles I think.

355
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,110
Me, too.

356
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,144
- Julia.
- I'm Nell.

357
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,617
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

358
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,383
Hey, come to the patio.

359
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,220
Okay.

360
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,691
Are you kidding me?.

361
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,753
I haven't missed a day
of running in 14 months.

362
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:32,063
- I used to be enormous.
- I can't even imagine that.

363
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:35,468
- You look amazing!
- Thanks.

364
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,539
- You gotta show me these trails.
- Yeah.

365
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,513
- How 'bout tomorrow morning at 8..00?.
- That's great.

366
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,414
There's a great farmer's market
on Sunday mornings.

367
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,249
And a lot of good bookstores
a few blocks over.

368
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,518
Really?.
Gotta check 'em out.

369
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:59,119
Steven, of course,
is at the hospital all the time.

370
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,095
He's even at
the hospital today.

371
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,733
That's no fun.

372
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,166
You know,
he's a young doctor.

373
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,568
It's part of the deal.

374
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:14,474
But with moving thrown
in the mix, and this awful building.

375
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,176
I know.

376
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,513
Did you like... Providence?.

377
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,525
My dad died
three weeks ago.

378
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,534
Oh, God.

379
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,968
- I am so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

380
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,733
I opened my mouth and this came out.
I didn't-- l--

381
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,038
- I didn't mean to ruin our conversation.
- No, you didn't ruin anything.

382
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:50,636
Yes, I did. It just popped out. It's--

383
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,579
It's huge.

384
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:56,050
You lost the first man
you ever loved.

385
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,217
Yeah.

386
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,561
That's it.
That's it exactly.

387
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:19,340
What do you say that you and l
go find a place to get a piece of cake?.

388
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:20,705
Let's go.

389
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,581
Chocolate.

390
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,244
Luis, it's Julia.

391
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:38,412
I'm having a problem
with my bedroom door.

392
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,923
- Austin!
- Hey, Mom.

393
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,928
- My doorknob came off.
- I'll send Ned up.

394
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,498
You know what?.
I think I can do it myself.

395
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,762
I'll call back if I need to.
Thanks.

396
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,531
- No problem.
- Over and out.

397
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,015
Help! Help! Help!

398
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,149
Help! No!

399
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,384
Help! Help me!

400
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,011
You know you're not supposed to do
repair work on Sunday.

401
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,513
I didn't do any.
I didn't.

402
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,515
I received numerous noise
complaints yesterday.

403
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:17,144
It was him.

404
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,848
Ned, I appreciate your dedication
to the job here,

405
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,857
but just follow the guidelines.

406
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,325
We wouldn't want
your enthusiasm to result

407
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:27,488
in another noise complaint
or bring the police again.

408
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,863
- Yes, sir.
- Good, I'm glad we cleared that up.

409
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,994
I'm gonna go fix
that door.

410
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,499
Luis, I was supposed
to meet Julia.

411
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,235
Did she leave already?.

412
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,834
- No.
- Maybe I have the wrong time.

413
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,537
I'm sorry.
I haven't seen her.

414
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,417
Julia?.

415
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,921
It's Nell.

416
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,231
- Thanks, Luis.
- Hey, Nell.

417
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,959
Did I miss Julia?.

418
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,367
No, she didn't come down.

419
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:46,703
Her car's in the garage.
She should be here.

420
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,290
Smoking pot is one thing.

421
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,624
He was taping that girl
across the hall.

422
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,857
You sure it wasn't
a porn site?.

423
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,331
He's spying
on our neighbor.

424
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,665
You know, the one who
used to look like a whale.

425
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,773
- Excuse me.
- Good day.

426
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,879
Julia, it's Nell.

427
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:35,220
Please, please
open up the door.

428
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,725
Are you okay?.

429
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,306
- What?.
- May I please speak with you for a moment?.

430
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,466
What, are you
the new shrink?.

431
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:53,804
No. My name is Nell.

432
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,778
- I just moved in down the hall.
- What do you want?.

433
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,508
Listen. I know that you've
been taping Julia.

434
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:02,676
- Jesus Christ! My mom--
- No, please. I just want to look at it.

435
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,617
No fucking way!
That's freaky.

436
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,814
I think something
happened to her.

437
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,518
Can I please just see
the inside of her apartment?.

438
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,220
Or the tape that
you did yesterday?. Please.

439
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,728
Sorry. No can do.

440
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,061
Parents made me erase
the hard drive.

441
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,157
Sorry.

442
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:23,901
- Please come home now.
- What happened, hon?. Are you okay?.

443
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,998
I don't wanna be alone.
I need you here.

444
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,475
Listen, are you okay?.
Is this an emergency?.

445
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,377
Are you okay?.
Are you hurt?. What?.

446
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,506
I'm sorry.
I've gotta go.

447
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:37,451
No! Can't I please have five minutes
of your undivided attention?.

448
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:41,581
Do you know what kind of pressure
I'm under?. I'll be right there.

449
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,820
- And then I come home to--
- You come home to what?.

450
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:48,329
Hold on, you guys. I'll be right there.
I'm sorry, Nell. I'm sorry.

451
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,491
I'm just-- I'm frustrated.
I'm freaking out.

452
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,330
It's crazy right here.

453
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,303
I've got to go, all right?.
Just be calm. Take it easy.

454
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:59,273
I'll be home as soon as I can.
I love you. Okay?.

455
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,674
Honey, okay?.

456
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,679
- I love you, too.
- Good-bye. I love you. Sit tight.

457
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:53,059
Damn it.

458
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,029
Oh, God!

459
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:03,101
I am so sorry.
I didn't even see you.

460
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,141
It's okay. I've always been
a wallflower of sorts.

461
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,677
How are you, Nell?.

462
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,383
I don't know. I--
Have you seen Julia today?.

463
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,510
Julia Cullingham?.
She lives here.

464
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:25,225
The walls listen.

465
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,621
The Lusman's an odd bird.

466
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,791
What do you mean, Chas?.

467
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,893
Buildings have personalities
just like people.

468
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:37,496
I've lived here for decades
and haven't figured out this one.

469
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,701
Took me a long time
to feel at home here.

470
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,008
Now I can't be
anywhere else.

471
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,709
I'm glad to hear that. I can't believe
how long you've lived here.

472
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,343
What is it, 60 years?.

473
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:54,185
I came out as a contract player
at Grand Street Pictures.

474
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:57,590
Look at me... right there.

475
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,528
Handsome devil,
wasn't l?.

476
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:04,099
They paid me $50 a week.

477
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,295
More than enough
to cover my fees here.

478
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,395
This is a great picture
of you.

479
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,599
See you, Nell.

480
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,871
- Your magazine.
- All these changes,

481
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:19,574
these renovations,
they can't be good.

482
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:24,985
Opening the place up like a patient
anesthetized upon a table.

483
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,556
Not good.

484
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,648
At least we have
a doorman.

485
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,060
It's not about
what can get in.

486
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:37,395
It's about
what's already here.

487
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:43,130
Don't worry.
You'll find your friend.

488
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,216
Okay.

489
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,659
Room 504 should be...

490
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,333
This way.

491
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,504
Okay, 506.

492
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:57,172
505.

493
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:07,113
504.

494
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:19,360
502. 501.

495
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,495
502. 503.

496
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:30,775
506, 505, 50...4

497
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,999
Yes?. What is it?.

498
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:03,045
Is there an apartment
number 504?.

499
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:07,378
Can you handle this?.
Jesus Christ.

500
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,124
No.

501
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:22,230
503. 505. No 504.

502
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,732
Don't you think
that's weird?.

503
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:28,326
I'm really not understanding your fascination
with a building you despise.

504
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,269
Is this about
the deposit or--

505
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,399
Look, there's no 304 either.

506
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,670
All the keys
are on the wall.

507
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:43,185
Each floor is missing
the same apartment.

508
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:47,382
Look, no 404, no 204,

509
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,617
no 1 04.

510
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,318
You've got a sharp eye.

511
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:53,328
No one's ever noticed
that before.

512
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,489
But why?.

513
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,864
There is no why.
There's no mystery here.

514
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,995
I mean, skyscrapers
don't have a 1 3th floor.

515
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,767
This building
doesn't have certain rooms.

516
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,569
Just chalk it up

517
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:10,840
as another one of
the Lusman's charming oddities.

518
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,505
Is that all?.

519
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,459
You live at the Lusman?.

520
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,759
You're there
right at the end, baby.

521
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,959
Pale rider's galloping in.

522
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:35,629
You're lucky to see what it once was
before the quote, unquote improvements.

523
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,798
There's some strange things
about that building.

524
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:41,502
You wanna know about
the symbols, right?.

525
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,580
- Yeah, I can tell you some stories.
- What stories?.

526
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,707
- I thought they were just decoration.
- Hell, no.

527
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:50,718
Lusman had those symbols there
for a reason. Bad juju.

528
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,015
That's what they're about.

529
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,421
- You sure you wanna hear all this?.
- Yes.

530
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,425
Lusman hung out
with these hipsters,

531
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:01,156
and all sorts of black magic.
The Talman Lunar Cult.

532
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:04,233
Main guy was
some aerospace pioneer

533
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,861
trying to fuse
science and magic.

534
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,462
Back in the day,
the Lusman was as scary

535
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,098
to the squares as Cielo Drive
was after Manson.

536
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,171
- Do you know it's missing apartments?.
- Lay that on me again.

537
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,647
Yeah. Each floor is missing
the same apartment.

538
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,775
And there's no record of it.

539
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,987
Wild.

540
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,079
Check this out.

541
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,420
It's one of the great
untold stories.

542
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:32,256
Lusman got all these stars
to invest in his place.

543
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,058
And then all of a sudden,
bam, shit goes down.

544
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,657
The scandal sheets start blasting him
for his cult connections.

545
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,065
Construction workers
are dying.

546
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,229
City goes in
and shuts him down.

547
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,638
Poor old Jack spends ten years
finishing the place by himself.

548
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,835
Didn't you say
the symbols meant something?.

549
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:50,003
Oh, yeah.
Each one's part of a spell.

550
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:53,276
- So they say.
- They're all over the blueprints.

551
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:56,477
Oh, let me see that.

552
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,077
Oh, man!
This is awesome!

553
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,157
Oh, yeah.
Wacky Jack done good.

554
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:02,849
Everything's connected.

555
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,052
- Where's the side view?.
- Right here.

556
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,657
See, they're stacked on top of each other
like a deck of cards.

557
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:13,099
With stairs running through the whole thing,
from the basement on up.

558
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,865
There are whole rooms
in there!

559
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,463
Our minds don't work
with these sort of spatial anomalies.

560
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:22,033
Each room takes a little bit here and a little bit
there so nobody knows the difference.

561
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,204
Wacky Jack's
a fucking genius.

562
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,750
Wait. Slow down.
What are you saying?.

563
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,411
There's a whole town house
inside your building.

564
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,647
The only problem is
there's no entrance.

565
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,054
It's like a wonderland
without a little green pill.

566
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,353
It's like Oz without
a yellow brick road.

567
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,095
Do you have anything else?.

568
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:45,634
Yeah. They took a bunch of photos
at the groundbreaking.

569
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,314
Okay, first floor,
second floor.

570
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,488
Okay, first floor.

571
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,701
Triangle.

572
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,678
One, two, three.

573
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,113
So, you get the part?.

574
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:52,058
You know the saying.
You win some, you lose some.

575
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:56,063
And some get washed away
by an Old Testament-style flood.

576
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:58,258
Yeah, I hear ya.

577
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,695
- Hey, good evening, Nell.
- Hi.

578
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,679
Shit.

579
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:28,655
Luis, I'm stuck
in the goddamn elevator!

580
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,189
Shit.

581
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:57,384
You've got
to be kidding me.

582
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,632
Luis, get me
the hell outta here, man!

583
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:22,246
Third floor, baby.
You can do it.

584
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,862
What are you--

585
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:41,790
Yup.

586
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,639
Thank God for backups.

587
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,819
Help!. Help!.

588
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:02,288
Holy shit!

589
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:05,087
Help!. No!.

590
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,685
Help!. Help me!.

591
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,757
Come on, open up!

592
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:54,927
- Hey. What are you doing?.
- I need to see your wife.

593
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,971
- What?.
- Her friend's fucking dead.

594
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,064
- What are you talking about?.
- Jesus Christ! She's dead!

595
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:02,269
What in the hell are you talking about?.
Nell?. Nell!

596
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,195
Julia?. Julia!

597
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:37,988
Please, let me get out of here.
Please, God, please.

598
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:15,203
Help!.

599
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:18,296
She was right.
She was right the whole time.

600
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:23,478
Oh, my God.

601
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:29,542
The lines are dead.

602
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,431
It's a quirk in the building.

603
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,499
- Byron, you've heard the rumors.
- Bullshit!

604
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,500
- She's in danger!
- She's delusional.

605
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:55,570
Julia's dead.
Go to her room. You'll see.

606
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:59,835
Just take it easy, man!
There's nothing going on here!

607
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,082
Then what's this?.

608
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,128
Look, look, look!
There's these cracks.

609
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,828
- Austin, go get the police!
- Right.

610
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:05,729
Be careful.

611
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,152
Oh, my God! What is this?.

612
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:33,524
- Nell! Nell!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

613
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,688
- Oh, my God! Wait!
- Nell!

614
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,961
- Shut up!
- Oh, God!

615
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,536
What the fuck?.

616
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:48,508
We gotta get the police and let them come in
with their body armor and guns.

617
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,204
- She could be dead by then!
- So could we.

618
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:55,147
- We can't wait for the police.
- Why not?. We stay together.

619
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:58,242
I can't believe this is
here and no one knew about it.

620
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,686
- What is this place?.
- It's where you come to die.

621
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,315
- What the fuck does that mean?.
- You've heard the same stories I have.

622
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:05,620
What stories?.

623
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,161
Things the residents say.
Noises they can't explain.

624
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:11,960
- Like something lives in the walls.
- Rats.

625
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,224
Well, then you go back!

626
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:17,772
Luis and I'll--
Where's Luis?.

627
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,340
Luis?.

628
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,544
No!

629
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:25,513
No!

630
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,786
No! No!

631
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,266
No! No!

632
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:09,123
No! No!

633
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,868
What is this?.

634
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:29,173
- Can we get outta here?.
- Stop talking.

635
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,508
- Are you crazy?.
- Listen!

636
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:35,981
There's somebody here.
There's someone--

637
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,130
Nell, it's me.

638
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:51,563
- Steven!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.

639
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,225
Thank God!

640
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,637
How'd you get in here?.
How can we get outta here?.

641
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,332
There's a trap door on the roof.

642
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:19,158
Just kill me!

643
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:43,310
- Steven!
- You okay?. Come here.

644
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:57,062
Okay, okay.

645
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,735
Oh, my God.

646
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:17,512
Come on, we gotta go.
Let's go, let's go.

647
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,645
Let's go. Let's go.

648
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:47,044
- Oh, my God!
- Come on, come on.

649
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,379
Steven.

650
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,384
Steven, it's a spell!

651
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:55,812
The building is a spell,
Steven!

652
01:19:55,924 --> 01:20:00,258
Steven, the symbols are part
of the spell.

653
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,296
Nell, be quiet. Be quiet.

654
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:05,389
Nell! Be quiet.

655
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,401
I'm gonna
get you outta here.

656
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:11,097
Come on. Let's go.

657
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,045
All this death.

658
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,912
It taps into something.
It taps into something.

659
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:26,419
It taps into something that keeps him here.
It keeps him alive.

660
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:42,864
If they change the building,
they'll destroy him.

661
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:06,018
Back up, back up, back up!

662
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:10,325
No, Steven, no! It's okay!
It's okay, Steven.

663
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:13,265
- Nell!
- Chas.

664
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:19,500
Please. He knew I told you
about the room.

665
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:22,907
I didn't think
he'd find out.

666
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:27,107
Why?. Why did you tell me
about the room?.

667
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:30,742
I knew you were the one
meant to find it.

668
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:48,398
The separation between life
and death is not the same for him.

669
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:50,630
He was a coffin birth,

670
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:54,231
fighting his way out
of his mother's womb

671
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:57,869
as she laid in her casket.

672
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:02,109
The mourners heard his cries.

673
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:06,051
Pulled him out.

674
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:09,055
He was born of death.

675
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:14,819
I can get you out of here,
but we don't have much time.

676
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,693
Come.

677
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:10,946
I'm so sorry.

678
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,634
Steven!

679
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:35,937
Run, run, run.

680
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:38,342
Tell me you can hear me.
Can you hear me?.

681
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:43,014
Tell me, can you hear--

682
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:56,592
No!

683
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:16,540
No!

684
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,164
Please.

685
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:04,984
You're hurt, baby.
You're hurt.

686
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:06,651
Did he hurt you?.

687
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,965
We need
more officers here now!

688
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:20,734
Puncture wound to the abdomen.

689
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:24,703
Don't talk.

690
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:28,111
They'll take good care of him, ma'am.
Let them do their work.

691
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:31,811
I'll be okay. I'll see you at the hospital.
I love you.

692
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,855
Don't talk. Don't talk.

693
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,731
Jacobs.

694
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,926
Okay, guys, on three.

695
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,630
One, two, three!

696
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:54,294
You go to hell.

697
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:29,957
- Can you hear me?.
- Mrs. Barrows?.

698
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:32,897
Get the paramedics.
Room 306.

699
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,060
He's dead.
You understand me?. He's dead.

700
01:29:56,324 --> 01:30:00,317
