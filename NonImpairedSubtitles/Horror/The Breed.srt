1
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,500
You're lost.

2
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm not lost.
I just don't know exactly where we are.

3
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,500
Maybe I should steer for a while.

4
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,000
Whoa. I'm a little buzzed.

5
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,800
Man, you are so cute
when you're hammered.

6
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,800
- I'm not hammered.
- You sure are.

7
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey, look.

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm busy here.

9
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,900
Land.

10
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,700
You see? We're not lost, we're just
on some creepy island penal colony.

11
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,200
You know what?
I'm gonna go and find that bar.

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,600
- Ok.
- Ok.

13
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,000
- Woof!

14
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,300
Woof!

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,200
Hey, wait up!
I've just gotta finish tying up here.

16
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,500
Ow!

17
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,400
Hello?

18
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,800
Hello?

19
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,600
Luke?

20
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,300
Jenny?

21
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,600
Jen?

22
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,200
There it is.

23
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,900
- What?
- There it is! You excited?

24
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Three final exams, two biology labs
and a term paper due in four days

25
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,100
and I let you convince me to go
for a party weekend.

26
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,500
It's my duty
as the irresponsible brother.

27
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,000
To make sure I never get
into medical school?

28
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,700
The burden of the smart guy!

29
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,700
I got two words for you -
Communications Major.

30
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm a fan of the five-year program.

31
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,700
This is why I had to study
in the library.

32
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Noah has turned our dorm room
into prime happy-hour real estate.

33
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,200
Because I read the brochure that said
it's Ok to have fun in college.

34
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,000
- I have fun!
- You have fun, when?

35
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,500
Baby, you'll have the last laugh
when you're a doctor...

36
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,000
and they're stuck living off of ramen
noodles and unemployment cheques.

37
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,600
Oh!

38
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,100
- That's not a bad thing.
- Bill Gates never went to college!

39
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,300
Just fly the plane, Maverick.

40
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,000
Gosh, Mattie, this place is incredible.
I can't believe it's yours.

41
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,900
Ours. It's "ours."

42
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,300
God, it must really suck
being a trust-fund baby, huh?

43
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,300
When my uncle died,
I only got Sonics season tickets.

44
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,900
Our Uncle Frank wasn't rich.
This house was all he owned.

45
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,500
- Lived here for... what?
- 20 years.

46
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,400
...20 years, doing nothing but studying
birds, watching animals...

47
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,400
Talking to trees, guzzling whisky.

48
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,700
Yeah, he was a little eccentric.

49
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,400
Johnny and our uncle
never really got each other.

50
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,800
- No one ever gets me.
- I got you.

51
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,000
You got me so much,
you dropped my ass.

52
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,300
Hey...

53
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,700
- Come on.
- Oh. Sorry, man.

54
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,900
Overgrown chic! I love it.

55
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,500
Come on, let's get inside.

56
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,100
Man, I missed this place, Johnny.

57
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,700
Ah, the zip line.
I'm going on that.

58
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Here we are.
Home sweet home, huh?

59
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,800
- I love it!
- Wow!

60
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,900
How long has it been
since you guys were here?

61
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,900
God, ten... How old were you when
you sunk Uncle Frank's car in the bay?

62
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,200
I was 12 and bored.

63
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,500
12. So... 13 years.

64
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm surprised he left us the place.
He was afraid you'd burn it down.

65
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,700
- I still can.
- Poor house.

66
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Check out the wine cellar.
Whoa!

67
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,000
- An M5 Medoc? God, this is fancy!
- Yes, yes!

68
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,400
In M5 I was still playing
with Rainbow Brite.

69
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,100
Yeah? And looking good doing it.

70
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,400
- We can't get into his wine, it's...
- What?

71
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,400
It's... I don't know.
It's disrespectful or something.

72
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
You know what? Let's all be quiet.

73
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,000
Lucky for you guys I came prepared.

74
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,800
- What you got?
- Anybody know what time it is?

75
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,600
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

76
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Margarita-30!

77
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,100
Where's the blender?
Come on, baby.

78
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,300
Chips, salsa...

79
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,300
hot dogs, beer...

80
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,900
Soy milk? Flaxseed oil? Kasha?
What the hell is kasha?

81
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,500
That's Nikki's. She's a health-food nut.

82
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,200
Her body looks like no vegetarian
I've ever seen.

83
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,500
Ooh!

84
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,500
Have a good time.
Don't be a little vagina this weekend.

85
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,900
Ok, that's offensive, A,
and B, I am gonna have a good time.

86
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,000
- You still remember how to do this?
- Yes. Go.

87
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,600
Ah, the memories.

88
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,300
The car that was once a submarine.

89
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Give the nozzle a turn.
If you smell gas, run.

90
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,900
Thank you.

91
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,700
Hey, look. The keys are still in the car.

92
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,700
That thing hasn't been used for ages.
It's never gonna start.

93
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,400
Given your history,
it's probably a good thing.

94
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,500
German engineering at its finest.

95
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,600
Come on! Oh! Oh...

96
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,400
What's wrong?

97
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,300
The only thing separating me
from my immediate personal happiness

98
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,800
is John and Matt's skill
with a generator.

99
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,200
Then we'd better start drinking
these... before they go...

100
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,100
Yes! That's what I'm talking about!
That's what...

101
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,500
Why, blender?

102
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,100
- What happened?
- What do we do?

103
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,300
I saw the fuse box in the basement.

104
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,400
- You know how to fix a fuse?
- Hell, no. You?

105
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,000
- No!
- Well...

106
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,000
maybe we could figure it out together.

107
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,900
Ok, Ok...

108
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,600
a young, handsome brother...

109
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,100
...takes blonde little bad girl

110
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,800
into the dark, dusty basement with him.

111
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,400
- I got it.
- Ok, you go ahead.

112
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,400
Young... attractive... virgin...

113
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,200
pushes obnoxious
asshole in the basement!

114
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,600
Are you really a virgin?

115
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,800
Wouldn't you like to know?
Er... yes.

116
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,300
Ooh! Vintage.

117
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Here's the fuse box.

118
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,400
- Look, there's the fuse.
- New one?

119
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,300
Yeah... Oh. You see?
That one's blown.

120
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,900
- This one?
- Yeah.

121
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,300
- Sorry.
- Dude!

122
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,100
It was this thing! I'm sorry!

123
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,500
- You scared?
- No. Where is this?

124
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,500
- Oh! Got it! Got the fuse.
- Yeah.

125
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,400
- Should I put it in?
- Oh, God, yeah.

126
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Eugh!

127
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,800
- Ok, here's the master switch.
- Ok, try it.

128
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,100
- Ready?
- Yeah... Yes!

129
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,400
- You weren't supposed to find that.
- Why?

130
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,100
It's just a secret attic
for make-out parties.

131
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,700
You were nine the last time
you came here, silly.

132
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,500
And?

133
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,300
I was a very early bloomer.

134
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,900
If everybody knew the Matt that I know,
it'd be so hard to keep you to myself.

135
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,100
No, it wouldn't.

136
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,200
Which room should we take?

137
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,700
The one farthest from my brother's?

138
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,900
Ideal.

139
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,400
Two years and it's still awkward.

140
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,900
I apologised to him a thousand times
about us, but he's still mad.

141
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,900
He's not mad, he's John.

142
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Are you trying to fulfil
some adolescent fantasies?

143
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,700
I might be.

144
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,200
Uh-uh. There.

145
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,800
- A secret make-out party.
- Uh-oh.

146
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,200
It's on!

147
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,200
You know you're gonna kill
yourself.

148
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,600
You'll never believe what I found
in the attic.

149
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,300
Ah.

150
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,600
Ah, the house flag.
We were such dorks.

151
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,800
At least one of us has changed, huh?

152
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,900
- That rope's gotta be 20 years old.
- It feels Ok to me.

153
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,600
John, really.
Hemp like that deteriorates.

154
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:12,400
I brought climbing rope with me.
You can string it with a Dynaloc.

155
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,400
Whoo!

156
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,200
- Once a brute, always a brute.
- Whoo!

157
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,600
Sometimes it stuns me
that you two are related.

158
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,200
Usually people who live
on the edge like that die young.

159
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,100
Johnny wouldn't be caught dead dying.

160
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,100
It would make him look bad.

161
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,500
What? All work and no play.

162
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
You sound like Johnny.

163
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,600
Well, he wants you
to enjoy yourself too.

164
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,300
- Right.
- He does.

165
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,200
Remember when we were 13 and he
threw you your first boy-girl party?

166
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
- When your mum went out of town?
- I do.

167
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,500
And we played Truth or Dare

168
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,200
and watched, er... What was that called?

169
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,000
"Wild On lbiza"?

170
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,900
- And he dared you to kiss me.
- And I did.

171
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,900
Then I cried.

172
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,100
I don't think my male ego
ever recovered from that.

173
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,900
I think you're doing just fine.

174
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,000
- You think?
- Yeah...

175
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,900
Have fun, Ok?

176
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,900
- Did you ever...
- No.

177
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
We've been friends for a long time,
plus I got with too many of her girls.

178
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,300
- Too many! What's too many?
- For a chick, any is...

179
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,400
- Any is too many?
- Any is too many.

180
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,600
Hi!

181
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,200
- Ok...

182
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,500
Whoa!

183
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,500
Nice shot, Robin Hood.
That's so white of you.

184
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,100
- You wanna give it a shot?
- What?

185
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,800
- Do you wanna try?
- Er... no.

186
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,500
All right.

187
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,200
See? It's that easy.

188
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,700
You guys hear that?

189
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,300
Oh, my God.

190
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,600
It's so cute.

191
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,400
Where is it from?

192
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
- You better leave that thing alone.
- Can I see it?

193
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,900
He just peed on you.

194
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's a boy.

195
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,000
- It can't be more than 8 or 9 weeks old.
- You go, Dr. Ruth.

196
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,700
What kind of dog is that?

197
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,800
Well, it looks like a German Shepherd,
but he's big. Really big.

198
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,300
I thought we were the only ones
on the island.

199
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,300
He was probably abandoned
by some boaters.

200
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Hey, guys, I have an idea. Hold on!

201
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,200
Ssh! I have an idea, a good idea.

202
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,100
- Let's eat him.
- You're such a dick.

203
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,700
I'm serious.
We'll put him on the target...

204
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,800
I got my iPod. Please, please.

205
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,700
Here's to that!

206
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,900
You like it here, huh?

207
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,800
Let's keep him with us tonight,
you guys.

208
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,800
You like it here?

209
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,500
Wait, wait. No TV,

210
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,000
no phone, no Maxim?

211
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,600
Some people like a break
from civilisation.

212
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,700
All right. Sure. I'm for the whole
kumbaya-granola thing,

213
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,500
as long as when it's over,

214
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,700
there's a fifth of Jager
and internet porn waiting for me.

215
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,300
Noah, sometimes it amazes
me that you're still single.

216
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,200
Here's to being single, seeing double,
sleeping triple...

217
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,600
- and to multiple orgasms.
- Yeah, by yourself.

218
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,800
Ooh!

219
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,700
Oh!

220
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,100
What's that in the cellar?
You hear that?

221
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,700
- Is that an M5 Medoc calling me?
- Yes.

222
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,500
You are gonna drink the cheap stuff
and you are gonna like it.

223
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,300
You are a cruel, cruel man.
But I still love you.

224
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,000
Uh-uh. That cute stuff's
not gonna work on me.

225
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,300
I'm a cat person.

226
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,000
Cheap enough?
That little sucker growled at me.

227
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,400
You piss on that rug, you're dead.

228
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,000
Hey!

229
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,800
He was just kidding! Come back!

230
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,600
Meanies.

231
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,400
That dog is weird. He just growled at me
for no good reason.

232
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,900
I said I liked cats.
I wasn't talking about the musical.

233
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,500
This little dog is harmless.
Chicken.

234
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Don't worry, he'll come back.
He knows there's food here.

235
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,400
You wanna find him?

236
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,400
- I wanted to sleep with him.
- You were sleeping with me!

237
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,400
She was gonna make love to me
and then sleep in your bed.

238
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,000
That's Ok.

239
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,000
I see cancer patients every Thursday.
That's my charity work for the week.

240
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,700
Oh! Funny!

241
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,300
The folks got jokes tonight.
You all want some?

242
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,900
Here, pup. Where are you?

243
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,700
- You see him?
- Uh-uh.

244
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,800
This is bringing me back memories

245
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,200
from Ghost in the Graveyard.
Remember? When we were ten?

246
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,200
I don't remember that.

247
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,600
- Yeah, you were too cool back then.
- I'm still too cool.

248
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,100
- Right.
- Over there. There he is.

249
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,600
Hey, pup, there you are.
There you are! Come here.

250
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,800
Sara!

251
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,900
You Ok?

252
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,900
Here.

253
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,600
Ok?

254
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,300
It bit me.

255
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
All right, you're Ok.

256
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
You're Ok. Come on, let's go.

257
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,800
It just attacked you, unprovoked?

258
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,900
Yeah. Came out of nowhere.

259
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
It was probably just protecting
its young

260
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,200
but the rules say you gotta treat
any bite by an unknown animal

261
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,100
as a possible rabies infection.

262
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,800
But listen, you will not get rabies.
I know what I'm talking about.

263
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,000
There isn't a single case
of somebody who's gone through

264
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,000
a proper post-exposure treatment
who's then contracted the disease.

265
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,900
Isn't that where they gotta stick
a bunch of needles under your skin?

266
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,200
It's a little simpler than that.

267
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,400
- A little simpler?
- I think we should get the plane ready.

268
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,800
- You wanna leave?
- We should get Sara to a doctor.

269
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,100
Remember when I got that rabies shot
cos of that bat in the Bahamas?

270
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,600
You don't have to start right away.

271
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,200
- You really don't, if you're feeling Ok.
- Is that true?

272
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,800
As long as you have your first shot
within a week, yes.

273
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,100
But... there's no pressure.

274
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,300
Well, then I'm cool.
I'll be fine, you guys.

275
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,000
- She's fine.
- Sara?

276
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,600
Mattie, the point of this weekend
was for you to live a little,

277
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,500
so don't use this as an excuse.
That's bullshit.

278
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah, it's true, I'm fine. I mean, really.
It was scary!

279
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,300
Nothing that a little drinking can't cure.

280
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,800
Could someone give me a drink?
I need a drink.

281
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,100
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Sure I'm sure.

282
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,200
What are you thinking about?

283
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,000
There was this company
who leased some land

284
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,900
on the other side of the island,
a couple of miles away.

285
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Anyway, they built a compound
for training dogs.

286
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,700
When I was little, my uncle
used to walk me over there

287
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,100
and we'd play with all
the little puppies.

288
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,600
I think that's when I decided
I wanted to be a vet.

289
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,000
About a year ago...

290
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,600
...one of the dogs got rabies.

291
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,900
It started spreading
and all the dogs got it,

292
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,200
and my uncle told me
they had to put them down.

293
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,100
- That's horrible.
- Mmm.

294
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,500
So I assumed
they had been killed, but...

295
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,200
...after seeing that dog today...

296
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,800
So you think some of them survived?

297
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,300
That's just it.

298
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,600
If they had rabies and escaped, they
would've been dead a long time ago.

299
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,500
In dogs, rabies is always fatal.

300
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
So, what are you saying?

301
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,300
I don't know.

302
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,000
Oh!

303
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,400
Sorry. I didn't see you.

304
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,900
What are you doing?

305
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,100
I couldn't sleep.

306
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,900
- You?
- Me, neither.

307
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,000
You look like an angel.

308
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,700
Ow! Damn it!

309
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,200
Easy, tiger.

310
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,900
Go away.

311
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Go away.

312
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,000
So, how about doing
some swimming today?

313
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,000
Maybe hang out by the dock?

314
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,400
Maybe when your leg feels better?

315
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,900
I'm fine.

316
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,200
How did I wind up dating
an outdoorsy type?

317
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,100
I don't know. I think it's
a lot better than living in a library.

318
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm outdoorsy as long as
beautiful women in thongs are involved.

319
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,600
Do you ever get tired
of making an ass of yourself?

320
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,700
Not really. I figure
it's a part of my charm.

321
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,100
Yo. Excuse me.

322
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,300
I'm still hungry.

323
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,900
- Knock yourself out.
- I'll make more.

324
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,200
No, that's cool.

325
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,500
- Morning, guys.
- Good morning.

326
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,700
Boys and their toys.

327
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,300
I thought I'd take a walk in the woods
and find something to shoot.

328
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
I hope you mean something inanimate.

329
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,400
- Gosh, no, I thought I'd hunt for Bambi.
- Just checking.

330
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,800
I'm gonna come with you. I haven't
been around the island for years.

331
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,500
- You guys wanna come?
- Noah, come on.

332
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,500
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

333
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,700
Enjoy your breakfast.

334
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,600
Actually, I think I'm gonna stay here.

335
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm not keen on that dog running around.

336
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,900
- Ok. We'll be careful.
- Keep him away from Thumper, too.

337
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Come on.

338
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,200
No deer. No droppings.

339
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,000
You hear anything?

340
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,900
No.

341
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,700
It makes you wonder
where all the animals are.

342
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,100
Are you guys trying
to freak me out or something?

343
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,200
Is this like a game you play?
What?

344
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,600
- No, I'm serious.
- He's referring to inanimate animals.

345
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,800
You think Sara is feeling Ok?

346
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,400
I hope so.

347
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,100
- She's looking pretty good these days.
- Don't.

348
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,100
- What?
- Don't go there.

349
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,100
Why not?

350
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,200
She's obviously into me, so why
shouldn't I just go for it?

351
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

352
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,000
Because I've seen
how you treat women.

353
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,600
Because you're good
at saving them

354
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,500
doesn't always mean I'm the one
that ruins them.

355
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,500
- Brother in love.
- It's all right, man.

356
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,100
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yeah.

357
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Are you sure?

358
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,500
I made out with John.

359
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,600
- So that's what's bothering you?
- Kind of, yeah.

360
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,600
- Why?
- Nice.

361
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,800
I don't know. I guess I thought
the rabies was settling in.

362
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,700
Very funny.
No, actually, I feel fine.

363
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,100
I feel great. I've got like this
adrenaline inside.

364
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,800
From John kissing you?

365
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,000
- Maybe.
- Well, might as well.

366
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,900
- You've liked him since you were 14.
- How did you know?

367
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,900
Who doesn't know that?
Everybody knows.

368
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,800
Oh, really?

369
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,700
Ok, then I hate everybody
right now.

370
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,300
Any day, Mcknight!

371
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,700
Can a brother not get
some alone time?

372
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,900
Damn!

373
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,700
Nice doggy.

374
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,500
Nice doggy.

375
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Good boy.

376
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,000
Oh!

377
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,100
Ok, Ok...
It's fine. It's fine.

378
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,600
John! Matt! Hey!

379
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,600
Oh! Oh!

380
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,600
Oh!

381
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,200
- What happened?
- What are you doing?

382
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,400
The dogs on this island
are not friendly!

383
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,100
- You afraid of a dog?
- No, dogs, man. Plural.

384
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,800
- How many?
- Three, but it sounded like more.

385
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,400
You hear that?

386
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,900
You believe me now?

387
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,600
Oh!

388
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,900
They don't want you here.

389
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,200
The dogs, they don't want you here.

390
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,100
Help!

391
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,100
- Get back!
- We gotta help him!

392
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,600
What's up?

393
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,600
Nothing.

394
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,700
The house.

395
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,900
- Hey!
- Go to the house.

396
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,500
- What?
- Here they come.

397
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,500
What?

398
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,600
Run!

399
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,200
- Run to the house!
- Oh, my God! Run!

400
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,700
Run! Hurry up!

401
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Come on, you guys!
Hurry up!

402
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,800
Hey!

403
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,000
Mattie, no!

404
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,600
This ought to be fun.

405
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
- Argh! Argh!
- Damn!

406
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,300
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

407
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,100
God, I'm so sorry, Nikki.

408
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
That's Ok.

409
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,600
For all I know,
you could've saved my life.

410
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,900
I don't know if I'm the life-saving kind.
I couldn't save that guy in the woods.

411
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,500
- I thought we were the only ones here.
- He came out of nowhere.

412
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,800
They ripped the shit out of him.

413
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,200
I know! Death by dog is brutal!

414
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,000
None of this makes sense!
There's no reason dogs could do this!

415
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,600
These have the characteristics
of a rabid dog.

416
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,700
- But if they had rabies, they'd be dead.
- Then what is it?

417
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,500
- You know that dog compound?
- The seeing-eye dog facility, yeah.

418
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,800
What if they were actually training
attack dogs, right?

419
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,200
A year ago they shut the compound
down because of a rabies outbreak.

420
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,800
So, attack dogs plus a weird strain
of rabies equals what?

421
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Scary-ass Lassies, that's what!

422
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,500
- Relax.
- They don't want us here.

423
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,200
That's what the dude in the woods said.

424
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,500
Twice.
Who cares?

425
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,100
We need to be focusing
on getting the hell outta here!

426
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,900
I'm in serious need of some painkillers...

427
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,700
and there's something wrong with Sara.

428
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,300
You feel it, don't you?

429
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,700
- Is something wrong with you?
- It comes and goes.

430
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,600
We've gotta be smart here,
smarter than these dogs.

431
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,900
Everybody just shut up! You're all
driving me crazy right now! Wild dogs?

432
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,500
Nikki's right, we gotta get outta here!

433
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,100
Sara needs help
and we're gonna do that!

434
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,400
But first, we'll stay in here
where it's safe, let the dogs disperse,

435
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,400
then get in the plane
and get the hell out...

436
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,900
I don't wanna be here
any more.

437
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,400
What do we do?

438
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,800
We get outta here.

439
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,900
Ready?

440
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,000
The dogs are on the dock.

441
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,800
It's like they know we wanna leave.

442
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,600
You gotta be kidding me!

443
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,900
What?

444
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,600
- The plane's drifting away.
- It can't be. I tied it myself.

445
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,900
Look, then.

446
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Shit. If it hits the channel,
it's lost.

447
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,700
The dogs are gone.

448
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,100
You guys, you guys...

449
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,500
- I don't wanna go out there.
- You're going.

450
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,800
You'll have to swim.
No one else can bring the plane back.

451
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,600
- I know.
- Just give me this.

452
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,200
For your brother being a screw-up,
he's stepping up and being a badass.

453
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,400
I can't believe this.
They chewed through it on purpose.

454
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,700
Listen, I don't know what the hell
is going on around here

455
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,500
but dogs can't think like that.
They can't plan.

456
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,900
If a dog chews through rope,
it's because dogs like chewing rope!

457
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,900
Come on, John.

458
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,000
He's almost there.

459
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Shit!

460
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,100
- Come on, swim back, man!
- Swim!

461
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,700
- The dogs!
- Hurry!

462
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:17,200
- Stop looking back!
- Swim! Swim faster!

463
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,600
You're fine!

464
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,000
Bitch! Back to the house!
Come on!

465
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,900
Hurry up!
Go! Go! Hurry up! Go!

466
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,900
Run!

467
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,100
Go! Go! Get inside!

468
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,200
Come on, get up the stairs!

469
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,500
Shut the door! Shut the door!

470
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,900
But how did the dogs
even get on the plane?

471
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,500
I once saw a dog balance
a marshmallow on his nose.

472
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,200
Still no service.

473
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,600
- You're running a fever.
- I am?

474
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,200
Don't worry, it wouldn't be rabies yet.
It could be some other kind of infection.

475
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,900
Great.

476
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,500
All right, pros and cons.
What are the negatives?

477
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,500
Negatives? Well, everything.

478
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,200
It's dangerous just trying to get
to the garage.

479
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,500
We don't know if the car will start
or what we'll find across the island.

480
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,500
- Whatever got that guy here.
- With our luck, he parasailed in!

481
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,400
The compound has gotta have
some kind of communications system.

482
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,600
Hopefully it's not equipped
with some crazy Old Yellers.

483
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,000
Look, we can't stay here.
We gotta get off this island.

484
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,600
Ok. Ok?

485
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,800
Ok, damn!

486
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,100
All right, eeny...

487
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,200
Meeny...

488
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,900
Miney...

489
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,700
I'll go.

490
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,300
- lt'll lift right off.
- I don't want you to go.

491
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,900
- I don't want anyone to go.
- I'll be fine. I'll be really quiet.

492
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,100
How much do you weigh?

493
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,900
You know how much I weigh, baby.
You're not doing this.

494
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,800
Speed climbing champion three years
running. I weigh 120 pounds.

495
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,100
I could do this with my hands tied.

496
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,700
You were injured badly.

497
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,000
I know my limits.

498
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,200
This cable can't support you.

499
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,300
I know what I'm talking about.
Think about it.

500
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,600
I mean it. Think about it.

501
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,200
- You didn't get any on the handles?
- No, you'll be fine.

502
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,000
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

503
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,600
You gotta be kidding me.

504
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,900
They're here.

505
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,100
Hurry, Nikki.

506
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,100
Hey! Hey!

507
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,000
Hey!

508
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,000
Dogs! Dogs!

509
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,300
Dogs! Dogs, over here! Come on!

510
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,100
Come on!

511
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,300
Come on! Piece of shit!

512
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:16,500
- Hey! Are you Ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

513
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,900
Just seems like it's gonna be dinnertime
over here soon.

514
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,100
Hang on.
We got something worked out.

515
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,400
Come on, guys!

516
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,800
- Let's go!
- Yep!

517
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,300
- Good?
- More slack! Watch yourself!

518
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,500
- You didn't hit her this time!
- I'm gonna tie the line to the rope.

519
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,700
- Pull it across.
- All right.

520
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,900
Here it is!

521
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,800
All right, pull it, pull it!

522
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,600
Hurry!

523
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,800
Come on.

524
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,600
Behind you! Jump!

525
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,700
Come on!
Nice shot. We got one, man!

526
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,900
Come on, pull!
Bring her in, bring her in.

527
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
Get off the harness!

528
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,000
Hey.

529
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,500
You have to talk to me.

530
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,600
I'm not in pain but...

531
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,000
I think I'm in trouble.

532
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,400
- I'm so sorry for this, Sara.
- Don't be. It's not your fault.

533
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,700
- Yes, it is.
- Matt!

534
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,700
It's Ok.

535
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,000
This is Ok?

536
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,400
None of this is Ok.

537
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,200
We should've left this morning.
We should never even have come here.

538
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,600
I didn't know this was supposed
to happen.

539
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,800
Of course you didn't. Because
you don't think, you just do,

540
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,500
only this time you dragged
all of us down with you.

541
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,700
Nikki, just let it happen.

542
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:52,300
Does this make you feel better?
Lay it all on me. I'm the fuck-up.

543
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,500
Mum knows it. Dad knew it.
It's never you. It's always me.

544
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,800
It is always you. I wasn't given
the room to make mistakes.

545
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,200
- That room was filled with yours.
- I just wanted you to have fun.

546
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,200
Bullshit. You wanted me to act like you

547
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,700
cos if there's two of us it would make
you seem less of a disappointment.

548
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,000
It must be nice to have your life
so together.

549
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,000
Dad would be proud.

550
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,100
What's up? You all right?

551
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,800
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

552
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,900
You know, er...

553
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,200
when our Dad got sick...

554
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,400
...I knew Matt was pissed at me
for bailing,

555
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,500
but I just didn't know what to do.

556
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,500
After he died, I tried to make it up
to him. I tried to be around more.

557
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,800
I just didn't know
he hated me so much.

558
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,700
He doesn't hate you
as much as he thinks he does.

559
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,900
- All evidence to the contrary.
- He loves you, John.

560
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,500
He's here for you.
Mr Responsible skipped school,

561
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:31,000
a week away from his finals, just to
spend a weekend with his big brother.

562
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,100
- He can't say no to you.
- Yeah, look where it got him.

563
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,900
None of this is your fault.

564
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,600
You'll get through this.

565
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,900
Besides, you're a hard guy
to stay angry at.

566
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

567
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,100
Even I don't hate you
quite as much as I used to.

568
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,600
"Quite."

569
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,300
I really love him, you know.

570
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,700
I know.

571
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,500
I'm glad.

572
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,900
- Hey.
- Want a sip?

573
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,700
Uh-huh.

574
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:17,200
Your uncle had
very eclectic musical tastes.

575
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,600
That's putting it nicely.

576
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,800
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

577
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,200
Hey. You're gonna be fine.

578
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,500
I feel awful.

579
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,400
Why? You guys have been wanting
to do that for years.

580
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,700
You'll both recover.
I hope so.

581
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,300
- You ready to turn this mother out?
- Yes!

582
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,800
- Ready?
- Come on, Mr DJ.

583
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,600
The fuse?
- Yeah. I'll get it. I know where it is.

584
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,200
- I'll come with you.
- No, no. Relax, relax.

585
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,300
Each of you has your job.
You're the future doctor -

586
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,800
smart and calm under pressure.

587
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,700
You're the Eagle Scout
in black sheep's clothing -

588
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,200
quick with a weapon
and handy with a sea plane.

589
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,400
You're the perky, athletic one -
very randy to have around.

590
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,300
And you... you look incredibly sexy
in a bikini.

591
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,400
Now where does all that leave <i>moi?</i>

592
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,400
I'm the one who knows
where the fuse box is.

593
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,900
He's in need of psychiatric help.

594
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,800
Why have they always gotta put
the fuse box in the basement? Damn.

595
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,800
Ok.

596
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,800
Oh!

597
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,200
You're mine, baby.

598
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,500
Oh! You gotta be kidding me.

599
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,900
Almost, baby.

600
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Stay with Sara.

601
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,700
No!

602
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,800
Matt, slide that over here!

603
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,700
They're coming
through the door, Nikki! Hurry!

604
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,700
Come on, come on!
Come on, hurry up!

605
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,500
Get Sara and get upstairs now!
Get upstairs!

606
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Get upstairs!
Get to the attic!

607
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,300
Oh no!

608
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,400
Hurry up!

609
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,300
Matt!

610
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,100
Grab this!

611
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,400
- Ok?
- Let's go, let's go!

612
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,600
Hurry!
Let's go!

613
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,600
Get the rope!

614
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,700
- You Ok?
- My shoulder.

615
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,800
Oh, my God! You got bitten!

616
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,000
None of this seems real.

617
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,500
I can't believe that Noah is dead.

618
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:08,100
Ok, look, we'll get out of here.
We'll get you guys to a doctor,

619
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,800
Whatever it is,
they're gonna figure it out.

620
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,500
Go away!

621
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
- Hey, Sara, please...
- Get off me!

622
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,500
- I'm so sorry.
- That's Ok.

623
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,600
- You know I didn't mean that.
- That's Ok. Come here.

624
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,500
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

625
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,400
- I promise.
- Ok.

626
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,900
I just don't feel right.

627
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,600
I know.

628
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,600
You'll be all right.

629
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,700
Johnny.

630
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,100
AMCS.

631
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,400
Army Mountain Combat School,
that's who leased the compound.

632
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:32,000
- So they were training attack dogs?
- Could be experiments that went wrong.

633
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,900
Why would Uncle Frank
have these papers?

634
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,200
Uncle Frank wouldn't be involved
with something like this.

635
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:45,000
- He was an animal rights activist.
- keep telling yourself that.

636
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,700
They probably told him what
he told me - that the dogs got rabies,

637
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,700
it spread, and that's why
they had to put them all down.

638
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,900
Well, they missed a few.

639
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,600
- Clear?
- Yeah, we're good.

640
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:57,300
You guys get in the room.
Stay there.

641
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,500
- Be careful.
- I will.

642
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,000
What's that smell?

643
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,200
They've marked their territory.

644
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,300
We're the ones trespassing now.

645
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,700
You ready for this?

646
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,800
No. You?

647
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
No.

648
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,300
Jesus, Matt. Matt!

649
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,500
What is he doing? Is he insane?

650
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,000
He's not afraid.

651
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,900
So sad.

652
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,500
I've waited ten years
for him to notice me.

653
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,300
What are you talking about?

654
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,300
It feels over.

655
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,500
It's not over. Don't talk like that.

656
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,800
Pop the clutch!

657
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,900
Shit!

658
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,400
Come on, Mattie.

659
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,700
Come on, Mattie!

660
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,200
- Give me the bow.
- Here.

661
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,100
Heads up, Mattie!

662
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,600
Come on, come on.

663
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,300
We need more speed.

664
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,000
Hold on!

665
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,400
Better work this time!

666
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,300
- Cool.
- Piece of cake.

667
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,400
They don't like the noise.

668
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,100
Let's go!

669
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,500
I don't think I'm gonna make
those finals, Johnny.

670
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,400
Shit!

671
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,900
Hold on to him!

672
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,200
Sara won't come down.
You've gotta help.

673
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,200
I got it, Mattie.

674
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,200
- I tried everything.
- Get in.

675
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,200
Sara!

676
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,100
- Sara.
- Go away.

677
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,900
- No.
- Get out!

678
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,400
- No!
- I won't make it.

679
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,400
I don't care! Get up! On your feet!

680
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,600
Get out of my house!

681
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,400
- John, out the window!
- I'm not leaving!

682
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,200
You understand?
If I break eye contact, it's over.

683
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,600
I will be right behind you.

684
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,100
- Gone?
- Yeah.

685
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,100
You Ok?

686
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,200
Sara!

687
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,800
- Sara!
- No, no.

688
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,800
- No!
- Come on!

689
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,100
That fence didn't used
to be here.

690
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,200
We'll break through it with the car.

691
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:38,800
What if the fence is the only thing
standing between us and those dogs?

692
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:41,300
That's true.

693
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,000
Ok... Ok,
but we'll leave the car running.

694
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,400
If we turn it off, we don't know
if it'll start again.

695
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,900
The car's not gonna
get us off this island.

696
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Well, if we need to,
it'll get us the hell out of here.

697
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,400
Come on.

698
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,200
There's gotta be a radio here.
It's no good if there's no power.

699
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,600
- Look.
- Solar panel.

700
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,000
- We could hook onto that, right?
- Yeah.

701
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,800
- Were you ever here?
- No, not inside.

702
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,900
Looks like an attack-protection suit.

703
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,500
What the hell is all this stuff?

704
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:02,400
This was not a training facility.
Something else was going on here.

705
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,500
They weren't training anything.

706
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,800
They were genetically redesigning them.
They were playing God.

707
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,200
No!

708
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,900
Let's keep moving.

709
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,000
Here's a radio.

710
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,600
No power.

711
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,800
All right, how do we hook in
to the solar power?

712
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,700
The batteries have to be
around here somewhere.

713
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,600
Down here.

714
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,400
- Batteries.
- All right, good.

715
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,800
I'm gonna check the main first.

716
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,700
Hit the breaker.

717
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,400
These batteries
are never gonna charge.

718
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,400
They're too rusted. Look.

719
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,200
No, they're the old lead-acid kind.
They'll hold a charge forever.

720
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,100
Positive to positive.
Negative to negative. Just like a car.

721
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,200
You good?

722
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,000
- Nice.
- Right.

723
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,700
How do you know all this?

724
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,800
You'd be surprised what an irresponsible
fuck-up can pick up over the years.

725
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,400
Ok, here we go.

726
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,300
Does it Work?

727
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,500
- It's dead.
- Still no signal.

728
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,200
Give me that cell phone.
Open the back.

729
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,800
We can hook up this phone
to the radio tower.

730
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:00,600
It's a giant antenna. By itself,
a cell gives you two, three miles,

731
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:05,400
but a tower like that gives you
over 100. We attach the cell phone...

732
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,900
here to the radio antenna.

733
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,500
- Shit. No signal.

734
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:19,000
Wait a minute, guys. Look right there,
on the radio tower.

735
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,200
- There's a cable detached.
- I'll go.

736
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,600
- We gotta stick together.
- I'll go.

737
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:29,200
You guys stay here. Once I connect
the cables, you're gonna see this signal.

738
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:35,100
When you see the signal, you wanna
turn on the antenna amplifier here.

739
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,000
All right.

740
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:41,400
Hey... Be careful.

741
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,100
We're gonna get outta here.

742
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:07,100
What's wrong?
Baby, calm down, sit down.

743
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,000
It's just...

744
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,800
What happened to Sara
is gonna happen to me.

745
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,500
Matt, don't talk like that.
You're gonna drive yourself crazy.

746
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,500
What's wrong?

747
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,700
What?

748
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,700
They're inside.

749
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,200
What are you talking about?

750
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,500
For the dogs to survive
being put down

751
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,900
they would've had
to find a way to escape.

752
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,700
If they found a way out
of the compound...

753
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,100
They found their way back in.

754
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,500
John.

755
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,200
Argh!

756
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,300
Oh, my God!

757
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:34,300
Give Cujo my best.

758
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,900
Nikki!

759
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,900
- Nikki!
- No!

760
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,200
Stop it! Listen! Listen to me!

761
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,100
There is a boat on the other side
of this fence!

762
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,300
It's our only way out!

763
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,800
We're not getting off this island, John!

764
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,400
Need a ride?

765
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:45,800
- I thought you were dead.
- Any ideas?

766
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,200
Hang on!

767
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,300
Come on!

768
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,600
- You Ok?
- Yeah.

769
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,300
Go!

770
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,600
John, get the boat started.

771
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,600
Jump on!

772
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:12,200
What do you think's gonna happen
to you guys?

773
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:18,400
Find a doctor that can cure it.

774
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,500
- What if he can't?
- He has to.

775
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,800
I need some sleep.
