1
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,205
Dr. Hill.

2
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,673
Dr. Bassett.

3
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,174
Where's the patient?

4
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,510
I hated
to drag you out of bed.

5
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,812
Will you let me go
while there's still time?

6
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,803
You'll soon see why I did.

7
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,953
Will you tell
these fools I'm not crazy?

8
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,122
Make them listen to me
before it's too late!

9
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
I'll listen to you.

10
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,489
Let him go.

11
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,497
Who are you?

12
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,999
I'm Dr. Hill
from the state mental hospital.

13
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,634
I'm not insane!

14
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,136
Let him go!

15
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,239
Doctor,
now you must listen to me.

16
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,640
You must understand me.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,443
I am a doctor, too.
I am not insane.

18
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,911
All right.

19
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:29,143
Suppose we sit down,
and you tell me what happened?

20
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,654
Well, it started--

21
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,157
for me,
it started last Thursday...

22
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,660
in response to an urgent
message from my nurse.

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,664
I'd hurried home
from a medical convention.

24
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,191
At first glance,
everything looked the same.

25
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,866
It wasn't.

26
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,666
Something evil had taken
possession of the town.

27
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,177
These two.

28
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,678
Here you are.

29
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,114
Thank you, sir.
There you are.

30
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,604
Thank you.

31
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,381
Morning, Mr. Fisher.

32
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,123
Doc!

33
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,624
Hiya, Sally.

34
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,127
Hi. Welcome home.
I'm glad you're back.

35
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,828
How's Mickey and the baby?

36
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:19,098
Fine, but everybody else
in Santa Mira needs a doctor.

37
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,633
You've got an office
full of patients.

38
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,435
Oh, no.
On my first day back?

39
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,871
Some of them have
been waiting for two weeks.

40
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,973
Why didn't you send them
to Pursey or Carmichael?

41
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,143
Most of 'em wouldn't go.
They want to see you.

42
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,633
Oh?

43
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,686
What's the matter with them?

44
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,054
They wouldn't say.

45
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,353
Usually people can't talk enough
about what's ailing them.

46
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,360
For instance,
Wally Eberhard was in twice...

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,029
and called three times,
but he wouldn't say about what.

48
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,197
That's funny.

49
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,899
Nobody would talk--
from Becky Driscoll...

50
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,401
down to that fat
traffic cop Sam Janzek.

51
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,239
Becky Driscoll?
I thought she was in England.

52
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,743
She got back a few days ago,
and she wanted to see you.

53
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,678
Are you still interested?

54
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,681
My interest in married women
is strictly professional...

55
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,684
or yours would have been
a lost cause long ago.

56
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,354
-How was the convention?
-Wonderful.

57
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,016
They wept with envy
when I read my paper.

58
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,960
Come back here!

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,120
Jimmy!

60
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,566
What's the matter,
Mrs. Grimaldi?

61
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,625
It's nothing. He just don't
want to go to school.

62
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,140
If I were you, I'd have
a talk with his teacher.

63
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,142
I will when I get time.

64
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,244
What's the matter?
Has Joe been sick?

65
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,346
No.
We gave the stand up.

66
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,682
-Too much work.
-Oh.

67
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,550
The boy's
panic should have told me...

68
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,753
it was more than school
he was afraid of...

69
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,388
and that littered,
closed-up vegetable stand...

70
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,690
should have
told me something, too.

71
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,158
When I last saw it,
less than a month ago...

72
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,794
it was the cleanest
and busiest stand on the road.

73
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,529
That's strange.

74
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,098
She was in to see you, too--
last Friday.

75
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,834
I tried to get her to see
Doc Pursey, but she wouldn't.

76
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,003
She said only you
could help her.

77
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,238
Whatever it was...

78
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,537
it couldn't have been
too serious, I guess.

79
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,047
One minor concussion,
two cases of the common cold...

80
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,049
and six canceled appointments.

81
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,551
Looks like you rushed me here
for nothing.

82
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,054
I don't understand it.
They couldn't wait to see you.

83
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,556
But you're still booked up solid
for the afternoon.

84
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,327
I bet they don't show.
Look, there's Wally Eberhard...

85
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,529
talking somebody
into buying some insurance.

86
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,763
There's nothing wrong with him.

87
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,128
Bill Bitner's taking
his secretary to lunch.

88
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,801
And speaking of lunch...

89
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,403
will you tell whoever that is
that I'm out having mine?

90
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,571
Is Dr. Bennell in?

91
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,506
Yes, he's here.

92
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,275
Do you suppose
he has time to see me?

93
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,143
If he hasn't,
something's wrong with him.

94
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,337
Go right in.

95
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,773
Becky.

96
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,418
Almost five years.

97
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,686
It's wonderful to be home again.

98
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,921
I've been away so long...

99
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,515
I feel almost like a stranger
in my own country.

100
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,660
Hope you don't mind my coming
without an appointment.

101
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,895
Not at all.
What'll you have?

102
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,630
We're pushing appendectomies
this week.

103
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,798
Oh, Miles.

104
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,101
I don't know,
maybe I clown around too much.

105
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,103
Pretty soon, my patients...

106
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,605
won't trust me
to prescribe aspirin for them.

107
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,107
Seriously, what's the trouble?

108
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,275
It's my cousin.

109
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,243
Wilma?
What's the matter with her?

110
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,314
She has a...

111
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,950
I guess you'd call it
a delusion.

112
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,319
You know her uncle?
Uncle Ira?

113
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,920
Sure. I'm his doctor.

114
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,957
She's got herself
thinking he isn't her uncle.

115
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,792
How do you mean?
That they're not really related?

116
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,495
She thinks
he's an impostor or something...

117
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,397
someone who only looks like Ira.

118
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,798
Have you seen him?

119
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,032
I just came from there.

120
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,536
Is he Uncle Ira,
or isn't he Uncle Ira?

121
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,704
Of course he is.

122
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,806
I told Wilma that,
but it was no use.

123
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,575
Please, would you stop by
and have a talk with her?

124
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,144
Sally says I'm booked up
for the afternoon...

125
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,813
but why don't you ask her
to come in and see me?

126
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,303
I'll try.

127
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,684
How about some lunch?

128
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,016
I can't.
I'm meeting Dad at the store.

129
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,959
When did you get back?

130
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,629
I came back from London
two months ago.

131
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,063
I've been in Reno.

132
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,231
Reno?

133
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,100
Reno.

134
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,601
Dad tells me
you were there, too.

135
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,103
Five months ago.

136
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,105
Oh, I'm sorry.

137
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,606
So was I.

138
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,109
I wanted it to work.

139
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,546
I guess that makes us
lodge brothers now.

140
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,747
Yes.

141
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,817
Except I'm paying dues
while you collect them.

142
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,978
Ha ha ha! Miles.

143
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,462
-Hello, doc.
-How are you?

144
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,629
Sam!

145
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,631
At it again, eh?

146
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,966
My nurse tells me
you were in last week...

147
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,135
and wanted very much
to see me.

148
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,126
It wasn't anything important.

149
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,140
Didn't he go to college with us?

150
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,142
Quit his second year
to get married...

151
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,644
like I wanted us to do.

152
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,247
Just be thankful
I didn't take you seriously.

153
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,782
You be thankful.

154
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,250
I found out
that a doctor's wife...

155
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,952
needs the understanding
of an Einstein...

156
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,587
and patience of a saint.

157
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,088
And love?

158
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,090
I wouldn't know about that.

159
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,092
I'm just a general practitioner.

160
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,595
Love is handled
by the specialists.

161
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,598
Here's where I leave you.

162
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,099
You know something?

163
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,603
This is where you left me
the last time.

164
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,093
Hiya, Johnny.

165
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,980
Sally, I'm off.

166
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,148
Tell the answering service
I'll be at home.

167
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,617
Good night, doc.

168
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,719
I'm not going in there!

169
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,388
Stop all this nonsense.

170
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,625
Hey! Take it easy!

171
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,627
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?

172
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,629
Yes, Doctor.
Can I talk to you a moment?

173
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,564
Sure. I almost
ran you down this morning.

174
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,633
You got to be careful
when you run out in the road.

175
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,134
Come on.

176
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,624
Come on.

177
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,074
Hey! Hey! Hey!

178
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,577
Hey! Slow down now.

179
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,312
School isn't as bad as all that.

180
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,880
School isn't what upsets him.

181
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,248
It's my daughter-in-law.

182
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,751
He's got the crazy idea
she isn't his mother.

183
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,252
She isn't! She isn't!

184
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,854
Don't let her get me!

185
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,982
Nobody's going
to get you, Jimmy.

186
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,165
How long has this been going on?

187
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,935
An hour ago,
I found him in the cellar.

188
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,271
He wouldn't say anything until
I started to phone his mother.

189
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,106
That's when he said Anna
wasn't his mother.

190
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,609
Could you keep him
with you for a day or so?

191
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,245
Give him one of these every
four hours during the day.

192
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,113
Call me tomorrow and let me know
how he's feeling.

193
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,615
Yes, Doctor, thank you.

194
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,784
Don't let her get me!

195
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,809
Nobody's going to get you.

196
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,127
All right, Jimmy.

197
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,629
Open your mouth.

198
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,130
Shut your eyes.

199
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,232
In the words of the poet...

200
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,168
I'll give you something
to make you wise.

201
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,638
That's a good boy, Jimmy.

202
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,673
I'm not going home ever.

203
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,009
You're staying at your
grandmother's. Call his mother.

204
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,344
She's not my mother!

205
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,679
All right. Run along.
Everything's going to be OK.

206
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,214
You be a good boy now.

207
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,649
Good night, Doctor.

208
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,843
Good night.

209
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,188
I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.

210
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,656
I'm going to stop off
and see Wilma Lentz.

211
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,358
Should I call the boy's mother?

212
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,360
Yes.
Tell her what happened...

213
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,528
and that I suggested
the boy spend the night...

214
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,189
at his grandmother's house.

215
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,673
Hello, Miles.

216
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,142
Nice to see you, Wilma.
Becky.

217
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,577
Let's have it.

218
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,245
You talked to him.
What do you think?

219
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,480
It's him.

220
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,548
He's your Uncle Ira, all right.

221
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,072
He is not.

222
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,693
How is he different?

223
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,827
That's just it.

224
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,830
There is no difference
you can actually see.

225
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,166
He looks, sounds, acts,
and remembers...

226
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,367
like Uncle Ira.

227
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,935
Then he is your Uncle Ira.

228
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,339
You see that?
No matter how you feel, he is.

229
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,841
But he isn't.
There's something missing.

230
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,211
He's been a father to me
since I was a baby.

231
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,780
Always when he talked to me...

232
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,417
there was a special look
in his eye.

233
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,718
That look's gone.

234
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,521
What about memories?
There must be certain things...

235
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,990
that only you and he
would know about.

236
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,158
There are.

237
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,593
I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all...

238
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,858
down to the last small detail,
just like Uncle Ira would.

239
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,167
But, Miles...

240
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,668
there's no emotion.

241
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:43,836
None!

242
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,672
Just the pretense of it.

243
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,674
The words, gesture,
the tone of voice...

244
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,643
everything else is the same,
but not the feeling.

245
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,948
Memories or not,
he isn't my Uncle Ira.

246
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,017
Wilma, I'm on your side.

247
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,785
My business
is people in trouble...

248
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,220
and I'm going to find
a way to help you.

249
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,989
No one could possibly
impersonate your Uncle Ira...

250
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,592
without you
or your Aunt Eleda or even me...

251
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,594
seeing a million
little differences.

252
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,663
I want you to realize that.

253
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,798
Think about it,
and then you'll know...

254
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,102
that the trouble is inside you.

255
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,571
Wilma, where are you?

256
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,473
Out on the lawn.

257
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,374
Say nothing to her.

258
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,311
Why, Miles,
I didn't know you were here.

259
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,512
Welcome home.

260
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,747
Hello, Mrs. Lentz.

261
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,915
Did you ask Miles
to stay for dinner?

262
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,083
Can't tonight.

263
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,351
I'm making spoon bread.

264
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,853
Please, don't tempt me.

265
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,087
Maybe next time.

266
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,089
Wilma, where are my glasses?

267
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,024
I think
they're on the mantelpiece.

268
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,355
I'll go with you.

269
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,606
Am I going crazy?

270
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,608
Don't spare me.
I've got to know.

271
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,610
No, you're not.
Even these days...

272
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,279
it isn't as easy to go crazy
as you might think.

273
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,047
But you don't have to be
losing your mind...

274
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,483
to need psychiatric help.

275
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,019
I'd like you to see
a doctor friend of mine.

276
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,855
-A psychiatrist?
-Dan Kauffman.

277
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,723
I'll make an appointment
for you tomorrow.

278
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,263
All right.

279
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,788
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.

280
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,162
Better break this up,
or he'll start wondering.

281
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,309
Wondering what?

282
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,845
If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help...

283
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,681
and I don't want either of you
to worry about me.

284
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,916
I'll be all right.

285
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,484
Sure you will.

286
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,586
Staying here, Becky?
Or may I drive you home?

287
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,121
Would you like me to stay?

288
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,924
Of course not.
Good night.

289
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,414
Good night.

290
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,104
Nice having Becky
back again, eh, boy?

291
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,594
Sure is.

292
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,812
In the back of my mind...

293
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,581
a warning bell was ringing.

294
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,316
Sick people
who couldn't wait to see me...

295
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,318
then suddenly
were perfectly all right.

296
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,620
A boy claiming
his mother wasn't his mother.

297
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,689
A woman claiming her uncle
wasn't her uncle.

298
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,057
But I didn't listen.

299
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,992
Obviously, the boy's mother
was his mother.

300
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,128
I had seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.

301
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,264
There was no doubt of that
after I talked to him.

302
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,566
Miles, he is Ira?

303
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,336
Of course he is.
What do you mean?

304
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,504
It's just Wilma's so positive.

305
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,073
Will she be all right?

306
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,574
I think so.

307
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,509
I'm a doctor,
according to my diploma...

308
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,945
but I don't really know
what Wilma's trouble is.

309
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,248
I could start talking
psychiatrical jargon...

310
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,240
but it's out of my line
and in Dan Kauffman's.

311
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,521
I wish you didn't have
to go home for dinner.

312
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,513
I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.

313
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,095
I could pick you up
at 7:00.

314
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,596
Well...

315
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,199
It's summer,
and the moon is full.

316
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,400
"I know a bank...

317
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,236
MILES,  
"where the wild thyme grows."

318
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,931
You haven't changed a bit.

319
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,820
Whup! Whoa! Watch out!

320
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,055
Sorry.

321
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,424
Hey, Miles,
when did you get back?

322
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,659
This morning.
How are you, Danny?

323
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,826
This is Miss Driscoll.

324
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,762
Dr. Kauffman--
our one and only psychiatrist.

325
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,964
Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.

326
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,499
I should.
I brought her into the world.

327
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,000
You did us all a favor.

328
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,769
This saves me a phone call.

329
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,538
I've got a kid and a woman
who need a witch doctor.

330
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,273
Boy says his father
isn't his father...

331
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,409
and the woman says her sister
isn't her sister?

332
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,010
That's pretty close.

333
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,012
I knew you'd been
studying hypnosis...

334
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,814
but when did you start
reading minds?

335
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,316
He doesn't have to read them.

336
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,284
I've sent him a dozen patients
since it started.

337
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,320
What is it?
What's going on?

338
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,822
I don't know.
A strange neurosis...

339
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,625
evidently contagious--
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

340
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,422
In two weeks,
it's spread all over town.

341
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,829
What causes it?

342
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,457
Worry about
what's going on in the world.

343
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,102
Make room
for Wilma Lentz tomorrow.

344
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,738
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.

345
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,898
So long, Danny.

346
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,548
This is the oddest thing
I ever heard of.

347
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,483
Let's hope we don't catch it.

348
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,485
I'd hate to wake up
some morning...

349
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,153
and find out you weren't you.

350
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,489
I'm not the high-school
kid you used to romance.

351
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,724
How could you tell?

352
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,891
You really want to know?

353
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,051
Mm-hmm.

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,662
Mmm.
You're Becky Driscoll.

355
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,073
Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.

356
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,576
Has ever since you got back.

357
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,579
Is this an example
of your bedside manner, Doctor?

358
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,070
No, ma'am.
That comes later.

359
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,460
Good evening, Doctor.

360
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,429
What happened
to the crowd tonight?

361
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,057
I don't know.
It's been this way for weeks.

362
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,302
At least we don't
have to wait for a table.

363
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,571
Take your pick.
Here or here.

364
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,407
Here, I think.
Shall we?

365
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,574
Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,976
Where's the band?

367
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,979
Business slumped,
so I had to let them go.

368
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,247
There's the jukebox, though.

369
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,015
Shall we dance?

370
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,984
I hope you didn't
let the bartender go.

371
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,986
I'm the bartender.
Martinis?

372
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,817
Two. Dry.

373
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,150
Very dry.

374
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,228
Miles, I don't care
what Dr. Kauffman says.

375
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,496
I'm worried.

376
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,265
You are in the capable hands...

377
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,500
of your personal physician.

378
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,002
Oh, Doctor.

379
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,504
Ah, there's our evening.

380
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,994
Sorry.

381
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,510
Thanks.

382
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,012
Dr. Bennell.

383
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,615
Jack Belicec wants you
to come to his house right away.

384
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,451
He says it's urgent.

385
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,442
Thank you.

386
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,956
Better hold those drinks.

387
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,124
Emergency.

388
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,626
At least they called
before we ordered dinner.

389
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,794
How hungry are you?

390
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,096
I can wait.

391
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,464
It may be a while.

392
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,965
I'll go with you.

393
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,956
Sorry.
We'll be back later.

394
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,973
There's Jack.

395
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,365
What's the matter?
Teddy sick?

396
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,100
No.

397
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,369
Thank heaven.
I thought you'd never arrive.

398
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,770
Then who is sick?

399
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,005
Nobody.

400
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,808
Then why'd you
drag me away from my dinner?

401
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,977
You won't believe it
until you see it.

402
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,278
Hello, Becky.

403
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,870
-Hello, Becky.
-Hi, Teddy.

404
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,920
Could you forget
you're a doctor a while?

405
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,188
Why?

406
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,290
I don't want you
calling the police.

407
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,759
Quit acting like a writer.

408
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,319
Maybe you can tell me.
You're the doctor.

409
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,597
Miles, put the light on
over the pool table.

410
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,882
Go on. Pull it down.

411
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,027
What do you make of it?

412
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,204
Who is he?

413
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,604
I have no idea.

414
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,041
Its face, Miles.
It's vague.

415
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,719
Like the first impression
that's stamped on a coin.

416
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,886
It isn't finished.

417
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,054
You're right.

418
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,056
All the features
but no details...

419
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,825
no character, no lines.

420
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,760
It's no dead man.

421
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,762
Have you got
an ink pad around the house?

422
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,831
There's one in the desk.
Why?

423
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,000
I want to take
the corpse's fingerprints.

424
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,302
Of course
it's a dead man.

425
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,038
I don't know,
but I've got a feeling that...

426
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,907
I know this sounds crazy,
but if I should do an autopsy...

427
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,001
I think I'd find every organ
in perfect condition...

428
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,278
as perfect
as the body is externally...

429
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,287
everything in working order.

430
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,347
All set to go. Hold that down.

431
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,730
These are blank.

432
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,033
Waiting for the final
finished face...

433
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,668
to be stamped onto it.

434
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,304
But whose face?

435
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,169
Tell me that.

436
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,534
We could all use a drink.

437
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,112
Bourbon all right?

438
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,314
Fine.

439
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,882
Not for me, thanks.

440
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,184
Miles, answer me.
Whose face?

441
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,053
I haven't the slightest idea...

442
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,354
have you?

443
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,757
How tall would you say
that thing is?

444
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,759
Oh, 5'10", thereabouts.

445
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,761
How much does it weigh?

446
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,265
It's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.

447
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,530
Jack's 5'10"
and weighs 140 pounds.

448
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,937
Ow!

449
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,273
Teddy, will you stop
talking nonsense?

450
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,277
I'm sorry, darling,
but it isn't nonsense.

451
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,280
Becky, you don't think
it's nonsense, do you?

452
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,648
Of course it is.

453
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,283
Jack's standing here
in front of you.

454
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,719
Of course I am,
bleeding to death.

455
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,886
Excuse me.

456
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,054
You know what?

457
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,318
I'm afraid you may live.

458
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,860
Here, this should fix it.

459
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,795
Miles,
shouldn't we call the police...

460
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,798
and have them take
that dead body out of here?

461
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,801
I'm afraid
it isn't just a dead body.

462
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,291
Thanks.

463
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,736
I wonder if...

464
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,250
What?

465
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,085
I wonder
if there's any connection.

466
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,854
What do you mean?

467
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,256
There's something
strange afoot in Santa Mira.

468
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:15,761
Dr. Kauffman calls it
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

469
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,263
Becky's cousin's got it,
for one.

470
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,499
She thinks that her uncle
and her aunt...

471
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,267
aren't her uncle and her aunt.

472
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,770
There's several cases
of such delusion.

473
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,773
This isn't you yet...

474
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,765
but there is
a structural likeness.

475
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,512
It's fantastic.

476
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,614
There must be some reason
this is here.

477
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,616
Would you be willing
to sit up...

478
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,551
and see what your friend's
next move is?

479
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:43,021
If nothing happens by morning,
call the police.

480
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,523
If something happens...

481
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,358
call me, will you?

482
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,019
You know I will.

483
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,134
Good night.
Take it easy.

484
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,302
Sure.

485
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,637
Nothing will happen.

486
00:23:58,637 --> 00:23:59,871
Good night, Becky.

487
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,039
If it does...

488
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,940
it'll make a charming,
bloodcurdling mystery story.

489
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,486
I was careful
not to let Becky know...

490
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,754
but I was really scared.

491
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,924
Dan Kauffman's explanation
of what was wrong in town...

492
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,325
mass hysteria...

493
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,317
couldn't explain away that body
on Jack's billiard table.

494
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,444
Come in
while I turn the lights on.

495
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,779
You're a forward wench...

496
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,781
dragging me into a dark hallway
to be kissed.

497
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,116
I'm dragging you
into a dark hallway...

498
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,352
because I'm scared of the dark
tonight.

499
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,521
I'd better stay
and tuck you in.

500
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,045
That way lies madness.

501
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,926
What's wrong with madness?

502
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,757
Madness.
Now good night.

503
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,739
It's about time
you two got home.

504
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,675
Dad, what are you doing
in the basement this late?

505
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,077
Working in my shop.

506
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,311
Want a nightcap, doc?

507
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,646
No, thanks.
It's kind of late.

508
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,748
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.

509
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,250
Good night.

510
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,751
Good night.

511
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,742
Good night, Miles.

512
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,620
Aaah!

513
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,289
Look, Jack!

514
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,291
It's you! It's you!

515
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,226
No, no!
You mustn't go near it!

516
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,228
Get out of here! Please!

517
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,718
Please!

518
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,197
Miles!

519
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,235
What happened, Jack?

520
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,737
Teddy says the thing
in our place is me...

521
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,640
right down
to the cut on my hand.

522
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,075
I didn't wait to look.

523
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,244
It's alive! It's alive!

524
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,746
The hand was cut and bleeding!

525
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,749
And the position
of the body had changed!

526
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,478
Here, here. Take this.

527
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,883
I'll call Danny Kauffman.

528
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,712
Hello?

529
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,913
Hello, Danny?

530
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,081
Yeah?

531
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,383
Something's happened.
I've got to see you.

532
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,485
Will you get over here fast?

533
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,520
It's important.

534
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,954
Oh...OK.

535
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,893
He's on his way.

536
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,729
I'll make some coffee
and be right with you.

537
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,162
Good deal, Miles.
Thanks.

538
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,000
What about Becky?
Do you think she's all right?

539
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,482
Dad, what are you
doing in the basement this late?

540
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,847
Working in my shop.

541
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,187
I don't know what it was...

542
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,489
call it a premonition...

543
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,492
but suddenly, I had the feeling
that Becky was in danger.

544
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,483
I had to get to her
as quickly as possible.

545
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,649
I was going
to ring the bell...

546
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,879
but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.

547
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,782
Something was wrong
in this house.

548
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,326
Becky.

549
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,493
Becky!

550
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,824
Becky!

551
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,863
Miles, will you tell me
what happened?

552
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,198
The same thing.

553
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,633
I found another one...

554
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,334
in the cellar
at Becky's house...

555
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,870
coming to life
while I stood there watching it.

556
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,372
It was Becky.

557
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,208
Yeah? I want to see
one of these bodies.

558
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,676
All right.

559
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,545
You're going to bed,
and you're staying with her.

560
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,814
Put on your clothes.
We'll go to Jack's first.

561
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,316
Got any coffee around here?

562
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,885
Yeah.
You'll find some in the kitchen.

563
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,820
He doesn't believe me, Beck.

564
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,981
He will.

565
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,903
Somebody's playing games!

566
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,039
Rough ones.

567
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,675
There's a blood spot.

568
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,210
What you saw was the body
of a murdered man.

569
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,845
Did you examine it carefully?

570
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,013
Yes.

571
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,115
I don't know
what's happened to it.

572
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,484
It wasn't an ordinary body.
There wasn't a mark on it.

573
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,620
I checked it, too.
Not a scratch.

574
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,854
You can kill a man...

575
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,856
by shoving an ice pick
into the base of his brain...

576
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,392
leaving a puncture so small
the naked eye can't see.

577
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,028
You're ignoring the fact
this wasn't a normal body.

578
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,730
What about the hand
Teddy mentioned?

579
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,100
I heard lots of things
Teddy said and none made sense.

580
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,336
Hold on, pal.
I was here, too.

581
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,104
So was Miles.

582
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,373
Look, we took his fingerprints.

583
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,276
Look at that.
Tell me why it didn't have any.

584
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,912
He didn't want any,
so he took them off with acid.

585
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,680
Stop trying
to rationalize everything.

586
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,515
We have a mystery on our hands.

587
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,984
Sure. A real one.

588
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,486
Whose body was it,
and where is it now?

589
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,154
A completely normal mystery.

590
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,991
Whatever it is, it's well within
the bounds of human experience.

591
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,659
Don't blow things
out of proportion.

592
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,028
I wouldn't if I hadn't
looked in Becky's cellar.

593
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,863
How do you explain the body
I saw there?

594
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,431
I don't think you saw one.

595
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,766
And the body here?

596
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,168
I know you saw it.
Three others saw it, too.

597
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,903
But I dreamed up
the second one?

598
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,006
Doctors can have
hallucinations, too.

599
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,074
The mind is a strange
and wonderful thing.

600
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,443
I'm not sure it'll ever be able
to figure itself out.

601
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,013
Everything else, maybe--
from the atom to the universe--

602
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,414
everything except itself.

603
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,916
Nevertheless,
I saw Becky's double...

604
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,351
and the body that we saw here...

605
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,520
bore an uncomfortable
resemblance to Jack.

606
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,188
Mighty uncomfortable.

607
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,520
Let's go to Becky's
and have a look.

608
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,864
Where's your
girlfriend's double?

609
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,025
OK, skeptic,
lift the lid.

610
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,112
There's a body here,
all right.

611
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,814
-It's Becky's double.
-It sure is.

612
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,145
Take another look.

613
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,588
Now you see it,
now you don't.

614
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,558
It was there--
half-hidden by that blanket.

615
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,728
You said
you saw it there just now.

616
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,896
I thought I did.

617
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,798
Why did you come here
tonight?

618
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,499
You'd seen a dead man
at Jack's...

619
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,834
an average-sized man.

620
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,003
The face in death
was smooth and unlined...

621
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,572
bland in expression,
which often happens.

622
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,007
You had just become aware...

623
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,876
of a curious, unexplainable,
epidemic mass hysteria.

624
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,013
Men, women, and children
suddenly convinced themselves...

625
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,881
that their relatives weren't
their relatives at all...

626
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,150
so your mind
started playing tricks...

627
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,286
and reality became unreality.

628
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:51,222
The dead man became
Jack's double in your eyes.

629
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,390
Come off it, Dan.

630
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,592
I know
it's all hard to believe...

631
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,361
but these things happen--
even to witch doctors like me.

632
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,131
I saw her here!
She was real!

633
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,166
You saw her
in every tiny detail...

634
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,535
as vividly as anyone
has ever seen anything...

635
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,904
but only in your mind.

636
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,805
Danny, talk all night,
but you're not convincing me.

637
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,479
What are you doing in my cellar?

638
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,482
Using it for an office.
These gentlemen are patients...

639
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,780
badly in need
of psychiatric treatment.

640
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,787
They've been having nightmares.

641
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,088
If you're drunk,
you'd better sober up quick.

642
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,323
The police are coming.

643
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,657
No, we're not drunk.

644
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,793
Nothing that simple.
Pull up a chair.

645
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,328
Why, you're all crazy.

646
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,763
What's going on down there?

647
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,799
Hello, Nick.
Glad to see you.

648
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,836
You saved these two characters
a trip to the station.

649
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,573
They want to report
finding a body and losing it.

650
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,342
Where? When?

651
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,377
At my place about 7:00.

652
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,980
Why did you
wait so long to report it?

653
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,448
You know better than that, doc.

654
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:54,018
It was a curious sort
of a body...

655
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:57,388
and then it wasn't there
anymore.

656
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,791
I have a good mind
to throw you both in jail.

657
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,161
If you'd seen it,
you'd understand why we waited.

658
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,330
Thin man...5'10"...

659
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,199
fingerprints burned off
with acid?

660
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,569
Just seen it on the slab
in the morgue.

661
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,803
Turned up
in a burning haystack...

662
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:16,307
on Mike Gessner's south pasture
two hours ago.

663
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,709
Now break it up!

664
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,301
Go on home!

665
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,977
You win.
Pick up the marbles.

666
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,696
Good morning.

667
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,027
Good morning.

668
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,869
Orange juice.

669
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,737
Thank you.

670
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,472
How do you
like your eggs?

671
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,141
Any way you'd like.

672
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,409
Boiled, two minutes?

673
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,577
Two minutes?

674
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,078
Mm-hmm.

675
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,340
OK.

676
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,949
You know...

677
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,018
dragging you out of bed
last night was some trouble...

678
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,353
but it was worth it.

679
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,479
Seriously, Miles.

680
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,450
What was that?

681
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,954
Who is it?

682
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,665
It's the gas man.

683
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,893
Morning, doc.

684
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,270
Good morning, Charlie.

685
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,538
I guess I'm a little jittery.

686
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,473
Not getting enough sleep.

687
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,208
I won't bother you anymore.

688
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,444
Putting a meter outside
on the patio.

689
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,645
OK.

690
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,981
The eggs will be hard-boiled.

691
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,515
Did you do this
for your husband?

692
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:32,683
Mm-hmm.

693
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,385
Didn't your wife
do this for you?

694
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,255
Yes. She liked to cook.

695
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,423
That's one of the reasons
why I'm single--

696
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,460
I never was there
when dinner was on the table.

697
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,928
Take my advice...

698
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,630
and don't get mixed up
with a doctor.

699
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,998
They're seldom at home.

700
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,000
What would you say
if I told you...

701
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,502
I was already
mixed up with a doctor?

702
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,938
I'd say it was too good
to be true.

703
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,474
Things like this
can happen all of a sudden.

704
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,908
What's "all of a sudden"
about two people...

705
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,899
who've been friends
most of their lives?

706
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,446
Good morning.

707
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,048
Good morning.

708
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,349
I thought
I smelled some coffee.

709
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:06,517
Why didn't you give me a call?

710
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,818
I didn't want to wake Teddy.

711
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,554
She's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.

712
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,290
Good.

713
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,192
But I don't feel
she should go home right away.

714
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:18,462
Would you mind taking in
boarders for a while?

715
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,799
Or do you have something else
in mind?

716
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,468
I was toying with an idea...

717
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,936
but you can stay.

718
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,672
Here, Jack.

719
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,799
Thank you, doll.
I'll take it to Teddy.

720
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,952
Miles, did you make
that appointment for me...

721
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,120
with the psychiatrist?

722
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,622
Yes. 2:00.

723
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,825
I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.

724
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,361
I woke up this morning,
and everything was all right.

725
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,697
-You don't know my relief.
-Yes, I do.

726
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,333
Will you call Becky
and tell her? She was worried.

727
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,500
All right.

728
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,002
She's at your house.

729
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,537
At your house? Why?

730
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,131
It's a long story,
but she'll tell you about it.

731
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,616
Becky's still at his house.

732
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,928
All right.

733
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,499
Good morning.

734
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,434
Good morning, Sally.

735
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,902
Take a peek at what's
in the reception room.

736
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,310
Mother,
why don't we go home?

737
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,073
In a little while,
Jimmy.

738
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,280
He certainly made
a quick recovery.

739
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,923
I guess we all have.

740
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,158
But driving home...

741
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,494
I had a lot of questions
and no answers.

742
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,463
How could Jimmy and Wilma
seem so normal now?

743
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,399
Surely I had done nothing
to cure them.

744
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,335
Maybe they wanted me
to feel secure, but why?

745
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,838
Well...

746
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,840
I hope
you didn't forget the steaks.

747
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,342
I never forget anything.

748
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,378
Don't worry about him.
He's completely housebroken.

749
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,046
I need a martini, Beck.

750
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,214
Onion or olive?

751
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,517
Doesn't matter.
I want to pour it on the coals.

752
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,718
They just won't burn.

753
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,653
A martini isn't dry enough.

754
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,855
I'll get you something
that'll start it.

755
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,516
For drinking purposes.

756
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,660
You're looking shipshape.

757
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,218
Thank you, sir.

758
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,469
Here we are.

759
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,120
Jack! Jack!

760
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,795
Ugh.

761
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,006
They're like huge seedpods!

762
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,602
This must be how that
body in my closet was formed.

763
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,916
Where are they from?

764
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,252
I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods...

765
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,120
they must grow someplace
on a plant.

766
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,957
And somebody or something wants
this duplication to take place.

767
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,625
But when they're finished...

768
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,793
what happens to our bodies?

769
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,027
I don't know.

770
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,196
When the process is complete,
probably the original...

771
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,631
is destroyed or disintegrates...

772
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,799
No! Wait!

773
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,267
Sorry,
but I take a dim view...

774
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,902
of watching my own destruction
take place.

775
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,238
There isn't any danger
until they're completely formed.

776
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,039
We learned that last night
at your house.

777
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,041
Your blank
didn't change right away.

778
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,066
Not until you fell asleep.

779
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,848
Miles, when the change
does take place...

780
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,884
do you suppose
there's any difference?

781
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,151
There must be.

782
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,988
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.

783
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,323
So did I.

784
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,692
My father.

785
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,295
That must be
what he was doing...

786
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,098
in the cellar last night--
placing one of these.

787
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,266
I'm sorry.

788
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,334
I felt something wrong,
but I thought it was me...

789
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,003
because I'd been away
for so long.

790
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,338
They must be destroyed,
all of them!

791
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,840
They will be--
every one of them.

792
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,109
We're going to have
to search every building...

793
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,377
every house in town.

794
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,078
Men, women, and children
have to be examined.

795
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,313
We've got some phoning to do.

796
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,614
I'm going to stay
and watch them.

797
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:31,782
I'm staying with you.

798
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,017
Don't call the police!

799
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,251
Nick Grivett
didn't find any body...

800
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,809
on a burning haystack!

801
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,394
Why don't you call
Danny? Maybe he can help.

802
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,862
Danny?

803
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,063
No.

804
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,831
I'm afraid it's too late
to call Danny, too.

805
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,300
What are you going to do?

806
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,467
Get help.

807
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,493
I hope whatever's taking place
is confined to Santa Mira!

808
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,546
Operator.

809
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,648
This is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency.

810
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,818
I want to talk to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in L.A.

811
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,253
Can you convince them?

812
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,588
I've got to.

813
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,189
Where did they come from?

814
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,992
So much has been
discovered these past few years.

815
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,160
Anything is possible.

816
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,995
Maybe the results
of atomic radiation...

817
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,297
on plant life or animal life...

818
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:23,834
some weird alien organism,
a mutation of some kind.

819
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,537
Why should they take the form
of people--of us?

820
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,672
I don't know.

821
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,873
Whatever it is...

822
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,675
whatever intelligence
or instinct it is...

823
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:35,346
that can govern the forming
of human flesh and blood...

824
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,214
out of thin air is...

825
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,749
well,
it's fantastically powerful...

826
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,918
beyond any comprehension,
malignant.

827
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,152
All that body
in your cellar needed...

828
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,521
was a mind, and it was...

829
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,957
And it was taking mine
while I was asleep.

830
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,059
I could take
that pitchfork myself, and--

831
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,395
On your call
to Los Angeles, Doctor...

832
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,963
they don't answer.

833
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,532
Try again! That office
is open day and night!

834
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,330
If they've taken over
the phone office, we're dead.

835
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,475
Is that me?

836
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,951
This is an emergency!
Emergency!

837
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,010
Look, there's been--Hello?

838
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,791
Operator,
get me a better connection.

839
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,224
I'll try, Doctor.

840
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,928
It's no use.

841
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,930
All the Los Angeles circuits
are dead.

842
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,833
OK, try Sacramento!
Give me the state capital.

843
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,858
I want to talk to the governor.

844
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,406
The Sacramento
circuits are busy, Doctor.

845
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,964
I'll call you back.

846
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,678
All right.

847
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,168
All right.
I'll wait for your call.

848
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,041
I'll take the phone outside.

849
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,458
Jack, they've got the phone.

850
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,427
You and the girls take your car
and make a run for it.

851
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,329
First town you get to,
yell for help.

852
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,530
What about you?

853
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,932
That phone
is gonna ring soon.

854
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,401
If nobody answers,
they'll block the roads.

855
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,569
I'll stall them.

856
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,837
Then what?

857
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,238
Try and find out
what's in back of this.

858
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,873
-I'm staying.
-No!

859
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,704
Miles,
don't ask me to leave you.

860
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,678
Jack, get going.

861
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,246
Miles, I can't--

862
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,748
Somebody's got to go,
or we don't get help!

863
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,382
Please,
let's get out of here!

864
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,111
Watch out for yourselves.

865
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,422
Go over by the phone.
Stay there.

866
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,719
If it rings, call me.

867
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,464
Hello.

868
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,899
Is Dr. Bennell there?

869
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,134
-Yes. I'll get him.
-Never mind.

870
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,436
Just tell him the Sacramento
circuits are still busy...

871
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,105
and ask him if he wants me
to keep trying.

872
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,473
All right. Hold on.

873
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,575
Miles,
the circuits are still busy!

874
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:52,943
Tell her to keep trying!

875
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,104
Also, try San Francisco
and Washington!

876
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,920
We're getting
out of here right now.

877
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,154
Where are we going?

878
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,314
Sally's!

879
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,827
We're still unable
to get through to Los Angeles.

880
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,196
Do you wish me to keep trying?

881
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,424
Dr. Bennell?

882
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,333
Dr. Bennell?

883
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,135
I needed
someone I could trust...

884
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,271
and I figured Sally, my nurse,
was my best bet.

885
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,441
I decided to try to phone her
to see if she was at home.

886
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,443
Maybe they hadn't
taken over the pay phones.

887
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,712
I'll try the pay phone.

888
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,714
Hey, Mac!

889
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,482
Oh, hi, doc.
How are you?

890
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,152
Will you get me
a couple gallons fast?

891
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,321
Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry!

892
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,686
Get the windshield, will you?

893
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,884
I have to have the keys
to open the gas tank.

894
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,633
Somebody sick out this way?

895
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,468
There's been an accident.

896
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,604
Funny.
We haven't heard about it.

897
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,239
It just happened.

898
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,674
Before I could
even get her number...

899
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,776
I saw Mac closing
the trunk of my car.

900
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,078
He could have been
checking my spare tire...

901
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,713
but I didn't think so.

902
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,881
That should do it.

903
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,082
Thank you.

904
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,283
All set?

905
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,818
-All set, doc.
-Fine. Thanks.

906
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,309
-Put it on my bill, will you?
-Sure, doc.

907
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,840
What's the matter?

908
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,201
We've got to make it
to Sally's house.

909
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,883
I wasn't sure
I could trust anyone...

910
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,374
but I took a chance
and drove to Sally's anyway.

911
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,261
When I saw several cars
in front of the house...

912
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,819
I decided to play it safe.

913
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,036
What's wrong?

914
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,038
Probably nothing,
but we're not going in there...

915
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,273
until I'm sure it's safe.

916
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,442
Slide under the wheel
and get out of here fast...

917
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,774
if anybody shows up
looking for us.

918
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,639
The baby asleep yet, Sally?

919
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,575
Not yet,
but she will be soon...

920
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,777
and there'll be no more tears.

921
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,612
Shall I put this in her room?

922
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,280
Yes. In her playpen.

923
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,517
No, wait.
Maybe I'd better take it.

924
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,918
Why don't you go in, Miles?

925
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,613
We've been waiting for you.

926
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,362
Becky, start the car!
Quick!

927
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,091
Becky, get going!

928
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,543
Attention, all units...

929
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,446
attention, all units--
apprehend and detain...

930
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,349
Dr. Miles Bennell
and Becky Driscoll...

931
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,717
now believed heading north...

932
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,685
in a black and white
Ford sedan...

933
00:50:55,685 --> 00:51:00,791
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

934
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,926
All units designated
as roadblocks...

935
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,461
move to your stations.

936
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,662
It is urgent.

937
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,464
These two persons
must be detained...

938
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,699
and not permitted
to leave Santa Mira.

939
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,860
Repeat--it is urgent...

940
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:19,476
Be on the lookout for a 1 955
black and white Ford sedan...

941
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:23,936
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

942
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,718
We'll try to make it
to my office.

943
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,208
Cut into that alley
on the right.

944
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,285
[Door opens]

945
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,080
Do you think he'll come back?

946
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,116
I don't think they'll
check again before morning.

947
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:43,210
By then, Jack should be here
with help.

948
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,595
What if
Jack doesn't get through?

949
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,163
He's gotta get through.

950
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,031
Here. Take two of these.

951
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,022
They'll help you to stay awake.

952
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,087
We can't close our eyes
all night.

953
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,679
We may wake up changed...

954
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:22,250
into something evil and inhuman.

955
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,695
In my practice,
I've seen how people...

956
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,365
have allowed their humanity
to drain away.

957
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:32,102
Only, it happens slowly
instead of all at once.

958
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,970
They didn't seem to mind.

959
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,039
But just some people.

960
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,541
All of us--a little bit.

961
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:42,112
We harden our hearts
and grow callous.

962
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,080
Only when we have to fight
to stay human...

963
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,751
do we realize how precious
it is to us...

964
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,082
how dear...

965
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,179
as you are to me.

966
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,002
Maybe that's Jack
trying to find us.

967
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,266
He'd know better
than to use the phone.

968
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:11,132
Where is he?

969
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,637
Why doesn't he come?

970
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,246
Just like any Saturday morning.

971
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,528
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner...

972
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:35,231
Jim Clark and his wife Shirley
and their kids...

973
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,000
people I've known all my life.

974
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,194
What time is it?

975
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,239
Seven forty-five.

976
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,275
Yeah, I know.

977
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,576
It's too early to be so busy.

978
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,646
What are they doing here?

979
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,648
There's the answer.

980
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,217
There must be strangers in town.

981
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:57,187
They're waiting for the bus
to come and go.

982
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,849
There isn't another one
through here until 1 1 :00.

983
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:56,336
Farmers.

984
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,817
Grimaldi, Pixley...

985
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,152
Gessner!

986
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,653
Crescent City.

987
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:07,690
If you have Crescent City
families, step to truck one.

988
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,759
Crescent City...

989
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,761
the first truck.

990
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,263
Redbank.

991
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,266
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

992
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,334
go to truck number two.

993
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:21,371
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

994
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,772
truck number two.

995
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,607
Havenhurst...

996
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,276
the third truck.

997
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,445
Havenhurst--
the third truck.

998
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,080
Mill Town--the third truck.

999
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,284
Mill Town--the third truck.

1000
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,286
Valley Springs...

1001
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,787
the third truck.

1002
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,522
Valley Springs...

1003
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,024
First our town...

1004
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:44,027
then all the towns around us.

1005
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,528
It's a malignant disease...

1006
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,530
spreading through
the whole country.

1007
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,365
That's all for today.

1008
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,799
Be ready again tomorrow.

1009
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:08,251
I can't wait for Jack
any longer. Stay here.

1010
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,419
You're not going out there?

1011
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:10,987
I've got to stop them!

1012
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,648
Wait! We're safe here!

1013
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,995
They're not here.
I hope we're not too late.

1014
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,428
Jack! Thank God!

1015
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:24,167
The whole town's been
taken over by the pods!

1016
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,670
Not quite.
There's still you and Becky.

1017
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,672
Miles, it would have
been so much easier...

1018
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,107
if you'd gone to sleep
last night.

1019
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,940
Relax.
We're here to help you.

1020
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,680
You know better than that.

1021
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,182
Where do you want us
to put them?

1022
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,550
Would you like
to watch them grow?

1023
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,919
-No, thanks.
-Put them in there.

1024
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:46,122
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.

1025
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,991
Once you understand,
you'll be grateful.

1026
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,326
Remember how Teddy and I
fought against it.

1027
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,628
We were wrong.

1028
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,129
You mean Teddy doesn't mind?

1029
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,632
Of course not.
She feels exactly the way I do.

1030
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,133
Let us go!

1031
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,368
If we leave town,
we won't come back.

1032
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,905
We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.

1033
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,506
Don't fight it, Miles.
It's no use.

1034
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,976
Sooner or later,
you'll have to go to sleep.

1035
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,612
I'll wait for you in the hall.

1036
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:12,782
Miles,
you and I are scientific men.

1037
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,951
You can understand the wonder
of what's happened.

1038
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,754
Just think.
Less than a month ago...

1039
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,622
Santa Mira
was like any other town--

1040
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,057
people with nothing
but problems.

1041
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,060
Then out of the sky
came a solution.

1042
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,063
Seeds drifting through space
for years...

1043
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,065
took root in a farmer's field.

1044
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,067
From the seeds came pods...

1045
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,469
which had the power
to reproduce themselves...

1046
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:37,206
in the exact likeness
of any form of life.

1047
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,709
So that's how it began...

1048
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,643
out of the sky.

1049
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,482
Your new bodies
are growing in there.

1050
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:49,485
They're taking you over
cell for cell...

1051
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,987
atom for atom.

1052
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,488
There's no pain.

1053
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,223
Suddenly, while you're asleep...

1054
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:57,660
they'll absorb your minds,
your memories...

1055
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,230
and you're reborn
into an untroubled world.

1056
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,733
Where everyone's the same?

1057
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,735
Exactly.

1058
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,704
What a world.

1059
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,740
We're not the last humans left.

1060
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,642
They'll destroy you!

1061
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,712
Tomorrow,
you won't want them to.

1062
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,202
Tomorrow, you'll be one of us.

1063
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,353
I love Becky.

1064
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,788
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?

1065
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,458
There's no need for love.

1066
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,360
No emotion?

1067
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,697
Then you have no feelings,
only the instinct to survive.

1068
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,500
You can't love or be loved!
Am I right?

1069
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,102
You say it
as if it were terrible.

1070
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,804
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.

1071
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:45,308
It didn't last.
It never does.

1072
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,878
Love, desire, ambition, faith--

1073
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,981
without them, life's so simple,
believe me.

1074
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,917
I don't want any part of it.

1075
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,819
You're forgetting
something, Miles.

1076
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,987
What's that?

1077
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,251
You have no choice.

1078
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,296
I guess we haven't any choice.

1079
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,490
Good.

1080
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:20,701
I want to love and be loved!

1081
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,081
I want your children.

1082
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:28,084
I don't want a world
without love or grief or beauty.

1083
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,353
I'd rather die.

1084
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,854
No.

1085
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,048
No.

1086
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:38,728
Not unless there's no other way.

1087
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,363
Why didn't they
give us a shot...

1088
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,865
or a sleeping pill or something?

1089
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:46,357
Drugs dull the mind.
Maybe that's the reason.

1090
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:57,480
No. It wouldn't work.

1091
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,383
I might get one or even two,
but I couldn't get three.

1092
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,051
You're forgetting something,
darling--me.

1093
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,252
It isn't three against one.

1094
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,447
It's three against two.
Give me a knife.

1095
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,313
No.

1096
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:15,517
There.

1097
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,629
Go by the desk.

1098
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,623
What's going on in there?

1099
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:50,293
Miles!
Unlock the door!

1100
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,028
Miles, open the door!

1101
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,696
Open the door, Miles!

1102
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,357
JACK,   Aah!

1103
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,094
Open the door!

1104
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,941
Oh! Aah!

1105
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:16,512
Oh!

1106
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,294
Our only hope is
to make it to the highway.

1107
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:41,844
That does it.

1108
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,614
The only other way
is out the front door...

1109
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,282
and there's bound
to be somebody watching.

1110
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:47,840
We'll have to chance it.

1111
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,800
Keep your eyes
a little wide and blank.

1112
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,290
Show no interest or excitement.

1113
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:33,829
Well, Sam,
we're finally with you.

1114
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:35,064
They were supposed
to let me know.

1115
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,700
The chief said he'd phone
the station, then call me.

1116
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,336
He phoned,
but the line was busy.

1117
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,270
He's calling again now.

1118
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,107
Aah!

1119
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,574
Watch out!

1120
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,074
I'm sorry, Miles.

1121
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,266
This is Janzek.
They got away.

1122
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,494
Turn the main siren on.

1123
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,307
Hey! Stairs!

1124
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,824
It's only a few steps more.

1125
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,111
Come on!
They went this way!

1126
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,339
They're over there!

1127
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:26,495
Miles, I can't.

1128
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,497
I can't go on.

1129
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,328
Yes, you can.

1130
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,350
Here's her sweater!
They must be in the tunnel!

1131
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,168
Look, Tommy,
you go that way!

1132
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,680
Give up!
You can't get away from us!

1133
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,377
We're not going to hurt you!
Give up!

1134
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:07,563
They're not in the tunnel.

1135
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,798
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on.

1136
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,289
Let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.

1137
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:23,244
Miles,
I can't stay awake much longer.

1138
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,683
I think they're all gone now.

1139
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:31,050
We'd better start, or we'll
never make it to the highway.

1140
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:32,715
Miles, I've never heard
anything so beautiful.

1141
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,083
It means we're not
the only ones left...

1142
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,218
to know what love is.

1143
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:39,421
Stay here, and pray
they're as human as they sound.

1144
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,786
Bye, darling.

1145
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:39,281
This is station KCAA,
the 24-hour platter parade...

1146
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:40,578
the station of music--

1147
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,373
Becky.

1148
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:15,944
Becky!

1149
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:21,849
Becky?

1150
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,727
Becky, where are you?!

1151
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,422
I'm here, Miles.

1152
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,234
You didn't go to sleep?

1153
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:33,735
I'm so tired.

1154
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,972
They weren't people.
It was more of them.

1155
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,674
They're growing thousands
of pods in greenhouses.

1156
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:40,576
We've got to get away.

1157
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:42,644
I'm exhausted, Miles.

1158
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,635
I can't make it.

1159
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,758
We can't make it
without sleep.

1160
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,592
Yes, we can.

1161
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:28,123
I went to sleep,
Miles, and it happened.

1162
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,920
Oh, Becky.

1163
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,095
They were right.

1164
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,097
I should never have left you.

1165
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,793
Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.

1166
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:40,965
No.

1167
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:43,772
Never!

1168
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,374
He's in here!

1169
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,409
He's in here!

1170
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,536
Get him! Get him!

1171
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,689
I've been afraid
a lot of times in my life...

1172
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,591
but I didn't know
the real meaning of fear...

1173
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:06,662
until I had kissed Becky.

1174
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,097
A moment's sleep,
and the girl I loved...

1175
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,833
was an inhuman enemy
bent on my destruction.

1176
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,303
That moment's sleep
was death to Becky's soul...

1177
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,038
just as it had been
for Jack and Teddy...

1178
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,906
and Dan Kauffman
and all the rest.

1179
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,474
Their bodies were now hosts...

1180
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:22,911
harboring an alien form
of life, a cosmic form...

1181
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,614
which, to survive,
must take over every human man.

1182
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:27,416
So I ran, I ran...

1183
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,885
I ran as little Jimmy
had run the other day.

1184
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:32,054
My only hope was to get away
from Santa Mira...

1185
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:33,322
to get to the highway...

1186
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,586
to warn the others
of what was happening.

1187
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,240
Wait!

1188
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,743
Let him go!
They'll never believe him.

1189
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,278
Help! Help!

1190
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:57,579
Wait!

1191
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:59,911
Help! Help! Wait!

1192
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:04,953
Wait! Stop!
Stop and listen to me!

1193
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,455
Listen to me!

1194
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:10,459
Those people that are coming
after me! They're not human!

1195
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,394
Listen to me!
We're in danger!

1196
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,262
Get out of here!

1197
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,765
You're in danger! Please!

1198
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,400
Get out of here!
Go on!

1199
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,868
Get moving!

1200
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,870
They're after all of us!

1201
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,271
All of us!

1202
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,973
Listen to me!

1203
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:28,238
There isn't a human being
left in Santa Mira!

1204
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,279
Stop!

1205
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,782
Pull over! I need your help!

1206
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:35,283
Something terrible's happened!

1207
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:36,818
You're drunk!
Get out of the street!

1208
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,809
Get out of here! Go on!

1209
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,335
Are you crazy,
you big idiot?

1210
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,805
Look!
You fools! You're in danger!

1211
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:59,307
Can't you see?
They're after you!

1212
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,243
They're after all of us!

1213
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,311
Our wives, our children,
everyone!

1214
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:05,447
They're here already!

1215
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:07,282
You're next!

1216
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:08,950
You're next!

1217
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,452
You're next!

1218
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:11,953
You're next!

1219
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,443
You're next!

1220
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:24,566
You don't believe
a word of this, do you?

1221
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,201
Sure, it's fantastic,
but it happened.

1222
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,303
Don't just sit there
measuring me for a straitjacket!

1223
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:30,794
Do something! Get on the phone!
Call for help!

1224
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,773
What's the use?

1225
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,361
What do you think?
Will psychiatry help?

1226
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,131
If all this
is a nightmare, yes.

1227
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,466
Of course it's a nightmare.

1228
01:18:57,466 --> 01:19:00,469
Plants from another world
taking over human beings.

1229
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,061
Mad as a March hare.

1230
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,142
What have we here?

1231
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,877
He ran his truck
through a red light.

1232
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,779
Greyhound bus
smacked him broadside...

1233
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,047
and tipped him over.

1234
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,448
Put him in the O.R.

1235
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:15,250
Will you take over Bennell
for me?

1236
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,518
Certainly.

1237
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:17,953
How badly is he hurt?

1238
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,478
Both legs, left arm,
broken all to bits.

1239
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:23,191
We had to dig him out...

1240
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:26,828
from under the most
peculiar things I ever saw.

1241
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:28,163
What things?

1242
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:29,331
I don't know what they are.

1243
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,966
I never saw them before.

1244
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,935
They looked like, uh,
great big seedpods.

1245
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:36,271
Seedpods?

1246
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,806
Where was the truck
coming from?

1247
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:39,137
Santa Mira.

1248
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,816
Get on your radio
and sound an all-points alarm.

1249
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:49,684
Block all highways
and stop all traffic...

1250
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:52,175
and call every law enforcement
agency in the state.

1251
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,992
Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

1252
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,323
Yes, it's an emergency!
