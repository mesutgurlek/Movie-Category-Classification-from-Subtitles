1
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:14,864
Where do I begin?

2
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:19,734
I guess with the idea that sometimes
things happen that we don't understand.

3
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:23,137
Maybe we shouldn't try to.

4
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:29,345
My dad had been assigned to inspect
the military southern sector of the EPA.

5
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:34,254
My stepmother, my half-brother and I
spent two months on the road with him.

6
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:39,292
It's hard being in a car with a 6-year-old
and the woman who replaced your mom.

7
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,895
But nobody asked me what I wanted
to do that summer.

8
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,726
I guess things do happen for a reason...

9
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:50,832
...even if you don't like what that reason is.

10
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:20,034
Come on.

11
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,472
Fill it up.

12
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:29,571
- You got a rest room?
- It ain't great, but we've got one.

13
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:32,206
- Not the "big old fat" part.
- Which part?

14
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:34,373
- Can I have a soda?
- No.

15
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,749
- I see you're from Washington, D.C.
- That's right.

16
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,287
Long way from home.

17
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:01,667
You're bad. You're bad.

18
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:05,309
You're scared.

19
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:06,404
Good.

20
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:10,909
They're out there.

21
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:13,454
They're everywhere!

22
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,354
They get you when you sleep.

23
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:18,156
They get you when you sleep, you hear?

24
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:20,826
Get out, or you'll be next!

25
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:24,126
Dad! Dad!

26
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:27,099
There's a psycho in there!

27
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,161
- In the bathroom?
- He's got a knife!

28
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:33,239
Sweetheart?

29
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,370
Maybe you should let him go in first.
He's got a gun.

30
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:39,774
Maybe you'd better come back here, honey.

31
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,079
There's nothing here.

32
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:50,454
There's no one in there.

33
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:53,222
You okay?

34
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:54,728
No one's there?

35
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:57,695
Marti, are you okay?

36
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,136
Are you all right? What did he want?
Maybe we should file a police report.

37
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:08,303
"They get you when you sleep."

38
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:10,912
I remember thinking he was crazy...

39
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:14,815
...but I also remember thinking
we spend half our lives asleep.

40
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:21,287
'Morning, sir.

41
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,025
I'm Steve Malone. I'm with the EPA.

42
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:26,062
General Platt's expecting us.

43
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:27,890
One moment.

44
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:39,838
Follow the signs to Sector C.

45
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:20,874
I got it.

46
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:25,146
Fifty-nine. There are three doors,
so it should be...

47
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:28,486
Let's see. It's this...

48
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:30,719
How'd you know that?

49
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:33,786
He's so smart. This kid of ours is so smart.

50
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,458
How'd you know it was that door?

51
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,225
Tie your shoelaces.

52
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:40,962
I'll do it.

53
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:43,299
Are you sure this is the right door?

54
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:52,743
This is it?

55
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,381
Great.

56
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:02,753
Andy, come on. Help me unload the car.

57
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:13,369
Come on, I'm going to get there
before you do.

58
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:50,800
Andy, honey, slow down.

59
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:52,637
There are only two bedrooms.

60
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,403
You've got to share with your brother then.

61
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:01,210
Steve, can you give me a hand up here?

62
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:03,910
Don't work too hard.

63
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:31,238
If we'd known what was waiting for us,
we would've run.

64
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,645
But, in the end, it had to happen.

65
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:37,819
And so it began.

66
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:46,253
- This is a restricted area, miss.
- What?

67
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,333
You shouldn't be here
without security clearance.

68
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,199
What's up?

69
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,212
Get in the car.

70
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:29,402
I'm Jenn.

71
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:30,504
Marti.

72
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,165
Thanks for picking me up.

73
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:34,142
No problem. They're dicks.

74
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,141
What was that all about?

75
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:40,146
God knows. They always have
a bug up their ass. Ignore them.

76
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,747
So what heinous misfortune
brings you here?

77
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,583
A month in hell with my dad and his wife.
He's with the EPA.

78
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:50,692
EPA, cool! Hippies saving the planet.

79
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,019
Look at those goons.

80
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:57,531
They actually volunteered for this crap.
Can you believe it?

81
00:10:58,535 --> 00:11:00,526
What are you doing here?

82
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,029
Not much.

83
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,935
My dad runs the place.

84
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,773
He does?

85
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:12,672
Mom? There's somebody here.

86
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:46,780
Look at this shit.

87
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:48,942
This is why my dad's an insomniac.

88
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:52,278
He's afraid she'll burn the house down
in her sleep.

89
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:57,217
Mom, this is Marti. Marti, my mom.

90
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,492
Vodka. Want some?

91
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:08,395
Mom's an alcoholic.
The experts say that means I'll be one too.

92
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:12,841
Let's go. Come on.

93
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:15,339
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Platt.

94
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:50,610
And I don't know what's wrong
with the kids.

95
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,673
They treat me like I'm some stranger
rather than their father.

96
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:01,850
Why are you here?

97
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:03,486
What do you want?

98
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:28,810
You're young, but you're old.

99
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:32,985
Steve, you're going to get a mucho kiss.

100
00:13:36,326 --> 00:13:38,419
Time for your mucho.

101
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:45,194
Carol doesn't like mucho kisses.

102
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,874
- Hi, honey.
- Did we wake you?

103
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:54,273
- Sorry.
- What's wrong?

104
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:55,777
I had a nightmare.

105
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:59,005
Come here. I'll give you a kiss
and a big hug.

106
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:01,212
A bad dream can't hurt you.

107
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:03,718
Everybody has bad dreams, honey.

108
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,214
It's okay.

109
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:08,518
It's okay. Come on,
I'll take you back to bed.

110
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:12,722
What the hell was that?

111
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:41,080
Have you ever been in the military?

112
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:42,181
No, General.

113
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:46,854
Then you know absolutely nothing about
biological and chemical warfare, do you?

114
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,069
It seems to me...

115
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:02,767
...that it'd be a lot more dangerous
to move this stuff around...

116
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:05,278
...than to leave it where it is.

117
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:09,284
If these chemicals are safely stored,
you have nothing to worry about.

118
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:12,082
I have nothing to worry about?

119
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,585
Explain that.

120
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:22,621
Come in here, Captain.

121
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:27,136
Yes, sir.

122
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:31,299
Escort Dr. Malone around the base.
Show him what he needs to see.

123
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:33,875
Let him take samples and run tests.

124
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:37,274
Then do whatever you have to
to expedite his departure.

125
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:01,564
Mr. Malone?

126
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,400
Good afternoon, sir.

127
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:09,010
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

128
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:12,479
Can you give us some space?
I want to talk to him.

129
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm Major Collins,
head of the base medical corps.

130
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:21,583
Hold on.

131
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,795
I wanted to meet you...

132
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:30,162
...and extend my cooperation
to you personally.

133
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:31,830
Thank you.

134
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:38,971
I'm very interested in the effects exposure
to these chemicals can have on people.

135
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:40,369
Effects?

136
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:45,605
You got a lot of chemicals on this base.
They're all pretty toxic.

137
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:48,682
Effects? Physically,
they could be devastating.

138
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:52,117
Not physically. I'm referring
to psychological effects.

139
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:53,949
I'm not following you.

140
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:57,115
Can they affect brain patterns?

141
00:16:57,527 --> 00:17:00,792
Can they interfere with
chemo-neurological processes?

142
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:03,329
Can they foster psychoses, paranoias...

143
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:05,291
...narcophobias?

144
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,534
I'm a chemist, not a psychiatrist.

145
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:09,932
I don't know.

146
00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:11,534
Simply...

147
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,969
...can they alter one's view of reality?

148
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:17,210
Let me be frank.

149
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:20,411
I'm seeing people at the infirmary...

150
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,345
...who are exhibiting...

151
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:25,477
...extreme delusional fixations.

152
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:27,716
People...

153
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:30,419
...afraid to sleep.

154
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:32,927
People afraid to...

155
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:36,996
...deal with family members.
Afraid of them.

156
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,995
Exhibiting...

157
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,799
...paranoia about others...

158
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:44,203
...about other people's identities.

159
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,072
People afraid of themselves.

160
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,847
Suddenly, I got a camp full
of very displaced people.

161
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:58,682
I don't know what you're seeing,
but it's not the PCBs.

162
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:01,846
That phenomenon is not
part of the symptomology.

163
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,954
Keep me up to date on your research.

164
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:10,857
I'm worried about these... people.

165
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,371
Better take a vacation, Doc.

166
00:18:30,553 --> 00:18:32,885
We have equipment for Dr. Malone.

167
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,551
Come in.

168
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:32,507
What are you doing in there?

169
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,242
Delivering the boxes.

170
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,949
Are you through?

171
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:45,855
Good.

172
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,122
Very good.

173
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,163
Good work.

174
00:19:57,206 --> 00:19:58,901
Very good work.

175
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:08,816
Very good.

176
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,552
Okay, all done?

177
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,624
Everyone hold your picture up.

178
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,524
Very good.

179
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,898
Good.

180
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:28,968
Very good.

181
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,864
"When it's over, let's do it again."

182
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:40,265
Hey, little man!

183
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:43,703
Hey, little man!

184
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:52,947
- What are you doing?
- Running away.

185
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:54,714
What are you running from?

186
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,223
The bad people.

187
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:58,450
The bad people?

188
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:01,024
Come, we'll take you home.

189
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:07,292
- Your folks in the military?
- No.

190
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:10,235
Sector C, Petey.

191
00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:46,240
There's my bike!

192
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,833
That's your bike? Okay, pull it over.

193
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,121
Sure this is the house?

194
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:11,956
What's going on?

195
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:14,291
Found him wandering around.

196
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,962
We figured he was lost.

197
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:20,603
You should be in day care.

198
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,370
I hate that place.

199
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:23,835
What happened?

200
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:25,904
They all had the same pictures.

201
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:29,476
They tried to make me go to sleep.

202
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:32,376
Tried to make me go to sleep.

203
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:36,950
Sorry to have troubled you.

204
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:38,485
No trouble.

205
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,221
What're you doing home?

206
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:42,457
Are you an MP, or something?

207
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:45,326
No, I'm a chopper pilot.

208
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:48,559
Thanks for bringing him home.

209
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:51,901
Maybe I'll see you around.

210
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:53,905
Where?

211
00:23:57,846 --> 00:24:01,009
Top Gun? It's on Route 8.
It's the only club around.

212
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:03,407
Name's Tim.

213
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:06,585
Marti.

214
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:12,520
- No problem at all.
- Thanks.

215
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:13,754
Take care.

216
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:17,197
- Thank you.
- No problem.

217
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,528
Appreciate it.

218
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,363
Thanks very much.

219
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:22,361
All right. Take care.

220
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:24,599
- Say, "Thank you."
- Thank you.

221
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,112
What's this about, "The kids don't
like me?" How could they not?

222
00:24:33,282 --> 00:24:36,115
He's the new kid.
It's his first day at school.

223
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:39,646
The faster he goes back,
the faster he'll make friends.

224
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:52,964
- Hi.
- Hey, chick.

225
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:55,135
Get your coat. Let's go.

226
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,331
Where are we going?

227
00:24:57,406 --> 00:25:00,068
Out. Anywhere. Anywhere but here.

228
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:04,138
Jenn Platt, Carol.

229
00:25:06,248 --> 00:25:09,308
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you knew...
Steve!

230
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:11,680
Marti has a friend here. Want anything?

231
00:25:11,754 --> 00:25:13,881
- We don't have much.
- I'm fine.

232
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:15,753
We have milk, orange juice...

233
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:17,686
I could make lemonade. Or tea.

234
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,988
We have mint.

235
00:25:19,094 --> 00:25:21,528
- Jenn Platt. Nice to meet you.
- Steve Malone.

236
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:22,586
Popcorn?

237
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:25,258
- I'm fine.
- Did you say "Platt"?

238
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:27,097
Yes, the general's daughter.

239
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:30,433
I came by to take Marti
and show her around.

240
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:32,763
Where?

241
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:36,009
The base. The rec center.

242
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:39,173
When are you planning to be home?

243
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:40,940
12:00?

244
00:25:46,688 --> 00:25:47,780
Done! Let's go.

245
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,251
But do be home by 12:00. That's all I ask.
Just be home by 12:00.

246
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:53,452
Nice meeting you.

247
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:56,293
That's a really interesting outfit
you've got on.

248
00:26:00,436 --> 00:26:02,267
- Here?
- This is it.

249
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,302
I don't have any ID.

250
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:08,809
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
Just come.

251
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,381
Oh, man, where is everybody?

252
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:27,723
Hey, ladies.

253
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:29,657
You want to dance?

254
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:31,160
Lambada?

255
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:37,729
Look who's here.

256
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:39,897
I don't believe my eyes. Jenn.

257
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:42,910
Where is everybody?
Word get out that you'd be here?

258
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:45,103
They heard your old man was coming.

259
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,341
Yeah, to court-martial your ass.

260
00:26:47,516 --> 00:26:50,007
- This is Pete and...
- Marti.

261
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:52,076
You know each other?

262
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:53,854
We met earlier.

263
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:56,523
When? You just got here yesterday.

264
00:26:58,594 --> 00:27:00,357
What do I do to get a drink here?

265
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:02,420
You want a drink? Have a drink.

266
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:03,690
Come here.

267
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,698
You can have anything.

268
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:08,030
You know that.

269
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:13,472
This is romantic.

270
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:14,698
Now what?

271
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:17,040
Let me dazzle you with my stick work.

272
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:18,374
Or not.

273
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:20,447
I mean, let's play some pool.

274
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:22,583
All right, let's go.

275
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:31,381
Sit down.

276
00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:36,223
How are you?

277
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:37,957
Good.

278
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,732
How's your brother?

279
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:42,834
He's kind of weirded out.

280
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,298
Can I get you a drink?

281
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,070
Yeah. I'll have whatever he's having.

282
00:27:52,147 --> 00:27:53,637
Yeah, right.

283
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,650
Hey, Melissa,
can I get a couple of beers, please?

284
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,809
Andy's a nice kid.

285
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:01,920
Do you want him?

286
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:03,822
Do I want him?

287
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:18,636
Shit!

288
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:20,335
What's wrong?

289
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:22,101
- I know that guy.
- What guy?

290
00:28:22,177 --> 00:28:23,166
He scared me.

291
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:27,606
What'd you do to her?

292
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:31,042
What are you talking about?

293
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:34,346
In the gas station.

294
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:39,359
Your girlfriend's had too much to drink.

295
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:41,526
You should take her home.

296
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,960
Oh, Tim.

297
00:28:46,301 --> 00:28:47,632
It's okay.

298
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,471
Guess I made a mistake.

299
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,812
I was 7 when she died.

300
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:09,050
I didn't expect my dad to marry again.

301
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:11,984
Stupid, huh?

302
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:16,659
You must really miss her.

303
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:19,061
What was your mother like?

304
00:29:20,435 --> 00:29:23,268
You always remember the good things
about people.

305
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:31,576
I miss her.

306
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:40,987
Did you ever play, "I Never"?

307
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:42,281
What's that?

308
00:29:42,357 --> 00:29:44,052
You put your hands up...

309
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:48,662
...and the object is to make the other guy
drop all his fingers down.

310
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:51,696
So, if I were to say...

311
00:29:52,434 --> 00:29:54,425
..."I've never been to Mars"...

312
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:58,132
...then neither of us put our fingers down,
'cause we haven't been there.

313
00:29:58,206 --> 00:30:01,505
But if you said, "I never wore a dress"...

314
00:30:02,277 --> 00:30:05,110
...then I'd have to put a finger down.
Get it?

315
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:07,781
- Okay, go ahead.
- You start.

316
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:12,051
I've never eaten Brussels sprouts.

317
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:21,724
I've never been in a helicopter.

318
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:29,929
I've never tried to give
my kid brother away.

319
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:35,337
I've never shot anyone.

320
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:47,419
When?

321
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,648
Kuwait.

322
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:10,468
I never hide my feelings.

323
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:03,073
- What's the matter?
- It's Mommy!

324
00:34:03,184 --> 00:34:06,051
- What about Mommy?
- Her head came off. She's dead!

325
00:34:06,121 --> 00:34:09,284
- There's Mommy, right there.
- She's not my mommy!

326
00:34:09,457 --> 00:34:11,789
- What happened?
- He had a bad dream.

327
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:15,528
It's okay. I'll put you to bed.

328
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:17,790
No! That isn't my mommy!

329
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:28,134
Wait!

330
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:29,365
Wait!

331
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:38,447
Take your brother inside.

332
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:40,553
Take him inside. Do it.

333
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:46,656
- Are you aware she's underage?
- No, sir.

334
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:49,663
You aware you're giving booze
to an underage girl?

335
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:51,421
You weren't aware of that?

336
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:53,160
- No, sir.
- No?

337
00:34:54,102 --> 00:34:55,694
- That's funny?
- No, sir.

338
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,704
Don't come here anymore.

339
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:01,831
Come on.

340
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,111
I'm not lying, Marti!

341
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:12,183
Nobody said you were.

342
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:14,888
I had nightmares when I was your age.

343
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:16,617
They go away all by themselves.

344
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:18,688
She's not Mommy, Marti.

345
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:22,487
She is your mommy. She loves you a lot.

346
00:35:23,064 --> 00:35:24,588
My mommy died.

347
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:30,427
- I don't want to talk. I'm angry.
- Dad, please.

348
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:33,438
I can't trust you.
You're drunk and an hour late.

349
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:35,269
I'm not drunk.

350
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:37,038
And you've known him 100 years...

351
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:40,707
I had one lousy beer and came home
half an hour late!

352
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:43,540
Big deal! I'm not a fucking 10-year-old!

353
00:35:43,652 --> 00:35:46,553
Don't use that language.
You don't talk that way to me.

354
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:49,215
Why? It's the only time you'll listen.

355
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,924
- That's not true.
- Bullshit!

356
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:54,559
You never listen to me. Why do I bother?

357
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:55,527
Wait.

358
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,621
Wait! Wait!

359
00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:12,395
Would you stop kicking the table, please?

360
00:37:16,478 --> 00:37:17,536
Thank you.

361
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:39,825
I can't wait until I'm 18.

362
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:42,568
Why? Think you won't be my daughter?

363
00:37:43,738 --> 00:37:45,501
I'll still be your daughter.

364
00:37:45,774 --> 00:37:47,935
I just won't have to listen to you.

365
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:50,006
You don't listen to me now.

366
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,148
If you want to go so bad,
you don't have to wait until you're 18.

367
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,118
Just go now.

368
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,351
You'd like that.

369
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:07,584
Then it'd just be you three.

370
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:27,272
Want to go back to day care,
or stay home with Mommy?

371
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,444
My mommy's dead.

372
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:17,662
Okay. Come down.

373
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,206
Be very careful with that stuff.
It's very toxic.

374
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:32,134
Watch out!

375
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:50,190
Get an ambulance and a clean-up crew.

376
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:53,690
Get back. We'll take care of him.

377
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,931
What the hell's the matter with you?
Get an ambulance!

378
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,601
Jesus, what is that?

379
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:02,308
Nothing.

380
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:03,537
Shit!

381
00:40:36,277 --> 00:40:37,676
Is Jenn here?

382
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,644
Come on up.

383
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:55,322
Try this.

384
00:40:57,298 --> 00:40:58,390
Taste it.

385
00:41:00,702 --> 00:41:02,533
- It's water.
- That's right.

386
00:41:02,737 --> 00:41:05,001
There's always vodka in this glass.

387
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,104
Maybe she went on the wagon.

388
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:11,736
If she were on the wagon,
she'd be climbing the walls.

389
00:41:13,314 --> 00:41:14,713
I'm leaving now.

390
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:16,449
Where are you going?

391
00:41:17,085 --> 00:41:19,679
We're playing bridge at the Smythe's.

392
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:26,117
What?

393
00:41:26,427 --> 00:41:28,327
She doesn't know how to play bridge.

394
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:44,409
Sir, there's been an accident
in the storage warehouse.

395
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,571
Initial reports indicate camp personnel
have been injured.

396
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:51,478
We're preparing a written summary.
I'll have it for you in an hour.

397
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:53,411
Thank you, Captain.

398
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:35,558
I took it off the suit fibers.

399
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,794
I ran the entire herbicide screen.
I still don't know what it is.

400
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:44,199
I'll send you the sample tomorrow.
Give it the full GCMS.

401
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:49,466
I'm telling you, I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

402
00:42:49,577 --> 00:42:50,407
Ever.

403
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:54,513
It scares me. It's not blood.
I don't know what the hell it is.

404
00:42:55,149 --> 00:42:56,480
Run a protocol...

405
00:42:56,551 --> 00:42:58,542
...and get back to me quickly.

406
00:43:25,346 --> 00:43:27,177
I want to go home.

407
00:43:28,015 --> 00:43:31,746
Dad promised as soon as he's done
with his tests, we'll leave.

408
00:43:34,922 --> 00:43:36,583
It's going to be okay.

409
00:43:38,192 --> 00:43:40,592
It happens when you sleep.

410
00:43:44,098 --> 00:43:45,190
What does?

411
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:46,697
You die.

412
00:43:47,702 --> 00:43:49,033
Tub's full.

413
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:55,769
Hurry, it's going to overflow.

414
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:15,885
Get in bed.

415
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:22,399
I said, get in bed.

416
00:44:29,577 --> 00:44:30,805
Night-night.

417
00:45:41,816 --> 00:45:43,477
Is your back sore?

418
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:46,719
Want me to give you a massage?

419
00:45:47,054 --> 00:45:48,521
Yeah, lie down.

420
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:55,060
Lie down.

421
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:02,659
Marti's really mad at me.

422
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:05,163
She'll get over it.

423
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:06,533
You'll see.

424
00:46:07,008 --> 00:46:08,737
Wake up in the morning...

425
00:46:09,076 --> 00:46:10,566
...be another day.

426
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:13,236
Be like none of it happened.

427
00:46:13,748 --> 00:46:15,340
She'll be okay.

428
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:18,741
It'll be over.

429
00:46:21,255 --> 00:46:22,745
I love you.

430
00:46:23,758 --> 00:46:25,692
I love you too.

431
00:46:27,028 --> 00:46:28,359
Just let go.

432
00:49:45,226 --> 00:49:47,387
Daddy! No! Wake up!

433
00:50:15,923 --> 00:50:17,686
Wake up! Wake up!

434
00:50:19,493 --> 00:50:21,688
Wake him up! Get him dressed!

435
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,855
759, Sector C.

436
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:29,031
We got to go! We got to go right now!

437
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:32,095
- Listen to me.
- You don't understand! We got to go!

438
00:50:32,873 --> 00:50:34,807
Go where?

439
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,900
Go! What're you talking about?

440
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:39,136
Steve, this is important.

441
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:41,712
Go where?

442
00:50:44,952 --> 00:50:47,682
That's right. Go where?

443
00:50:48,355 --> 00:50:50,186
Are you listening?

444
00:50:50,858 --> 00:50:54,191
What happened in your room
is not an isolated incident.

445
00:50:54,461 --> 00:50:56,827
It is happening everywhere.

446
00:50:56,897 --> 00:50:58,626
- What?
- Where would we run?

447
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,429
Where are you going to go?

448
00:51:01,702 --> 00:51:03,431
Where are you going to run?

449
00:51:03,804 --> 00:51:05,601
Where are you going to hide?

450
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:07,304
Nowhere.

451
00:51:07,374 --> 00:51:10,434
Because there's no one like you left.

452
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:13,168
That's right.

453
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:16,377
Oh, God.

454
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:20,211
That's right. That's good.
You're listening now.

455
00:51:21,488 --> 00:51:23,820
Now I know you're frightened, Steve.

456
00:51:24,491 --> 00:51:26,823
I know you're scared. That's okay.

457
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:29,359
I understand that you're confused.

458
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,921
Let me tell you something, Steve.

459
00:51:32,066 --> 00:51:35,331
All that anger, all that fear and confusion...

460
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:38,502
...it's going to melt away.
It's going to go away.

461
00:51:38,906 --> 00:51:42,569
It's going to go away. Go to sleep.
Wake up. It's very simple.

462
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,338
In the morning, you'll feel wonderful.

463
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:49,240
- We'll be together. We're connected.
- What's happening?

464
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:50,544
We're together.

465
00:51:50,618 --> 00:51:52,677
Your fear. That's good. Let it go.

466
00:51:56,123 --> 00:51:58,614
Get away from me!
Get away from my kids!

467
00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:44,059
This way!

468
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:47,070
Go on, we'll cover you!

469
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:48,802
Move it out, mister!

470
00:52:55,816 --> 00:52:57,408
What's all that noise?

471
00:53:02,756 --> 00:53:04,724
Petey, those are gunshots.

472
00:53:15,102 --> 00:53:17,263
Pete, where the fuck are you?

473
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:28,105
What's going on?

474
00:53:30,951 --> 00:53:32,509
Sit down, Timbo.

475
00:53:33,687 --> 00:53:35,587
What the hell's going on?

476
00:53:37,558 --> 00:53:38,752
Hey, Justin.

477
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:41,385
Go to sleep, Timbo.

478
00:53:41,962 --> 00:53:43,657
What is this, a joke?

479
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:46,055
Just go back to bed.

480
00:53:46,633 --> 00:53:48,260
What's with the needle?

481
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:50,534
What is this?

482
00:53:51,872 --> 00:53:53,271
What're you doing?

483
00:53:56,844 --> 00:53:58,971
I told you to go to bed, didn't I?

484
00:54:39,253 --> 00:54:40,914
Take my watch.

485
00:54:42,356 --> 00:54:44,586
I gotta try to find us some help.

486
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,259
Be back in a couple of hours.

487
00:54:50,364 --> 00:54:51,854
You'll be okay.

488
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:54,023
You'll be okay.

489
00:54:54,201 --> 00:54:56,135
Do what your sister tells you.

490
00:54:56,203 --> 00:54:57,761
Where are you going?

491
00:54:57,938 --> 00:55:00,270
To find us a way out of here.

492
00:55:01,542 --> 00:55:03,533
Just be very quiet, okay?

493
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:13,614
Don't worry, sweetheart.

494
00:55:13,954 --> 00:55:16,286
I won't let anything happen to you.

495
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:24,518
I need an outside line.

496
00:56:26,126 --> 00:56:29,618
Sorry, Major Collins,
all the lines are busy at present.

497
00:56:29,796 --> 00:56:33,357
Stay where you are.
I'll keep trying and call you back.

498
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,691
How do you know my name?

499
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,700
I didn't tell you my name!

500
00:56:38,872 --> 00:56:41,238
How the hell do you know my name?

501
00:56:55,555 --> 00:56:56,647
Major.

502
00:57:01,895 --> 00:57:02,793
Back!

503
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:05,391
It's me. It's Steve Malone.

504
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,796
Remember me?

505
00:57:08,335 --> 00:57:10,235
I know who you are. You...

506
00:57:10,337 --> 00:57:12,328
...stay... back.

507
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:14,397
You gotta help me.

508
00:57:14,841 --> 00:57:16,775
No time left. My kids are in danger.

509
00:57:16,843 --> 00:57:18,174
My wife is...

510
00:57:19,012 --> 00:57:20,673
Do you have a car?

511
00:57:26,586 --> 00:57:27,917
Please. Come on.

512
00:57:27,988 --> 00:57:29,979
It's too late to run.

513
00:57:30,257 --> 00:57:31,554
It's too late!

514
00:57:32,893 --> 00:57:34,520
They've taken the base!

515
00:57:35,262 --> 00:57:39,358
All we can do is wait
until they come and then...

516
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:40,861
The keys.

517
00:57:41,535 --> 00:57:42,866
The keys.

518
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:44,931
They'll follow you.

519
00:57:47,941 --> 00:57:49,499
They'll follow you.

520
00:57:51,578 --> 00:57:52,806
That's how they work.

521
00:57:53,447 --> 00:57:56,177
We gotta stand up and fight back now!

522
00:57:58,885 --> 00:58:00,443
I've got a gun for you.

523
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:02,884
I've got a gun for you too.

524
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,180
We'll give them hell!

525
00:58:05,459 --> 00:58:07,154
We'll give them hell.

526
00:58:08,228 --> 00:58:11,061
We'll show them what the human race
is really made of.

527
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,692
Want some?

528
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:20,035
Stay with me, Doctor. We have to go.

529
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,429
Now.

530
00:58:24,745 --> 00:58:27,908
You can't sleep. You gotta make sure
you don't sleep.

531
00:58:41,461 --> 00:58:42,450
Come on.

532
00:58:44,431 --> 00:58:45,557
Please.

533
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,731
Please.

534
00:58:52,773 --> 00:58:54,365
The head cabbage.

535
00:58:56,109 --> 00:58:58,168
Well, well, well, well, well.

536
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,509
Be realistic, Major.

537
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:04,280
Put it down.

538
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:08,452
Not before I unload a few
into you onion-heads.

539
00:59:08,622 --> 00:59:10,590
Relax, Major. Take it easy.

540
00:59:11,224 --> 00:59:12,885
You disappoint me.

541
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,190
You're a man of medicine.

542
00:59:16,363 --> 00:59:19,628
You're supposed to preserve life,
not take it.

543
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,199
You bastard!

544
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:24,269
You call what you are "life"?

545
00:59:25,539 --> 00:59:27,029
I know who you are!

546
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:29,298
- I know who you are!
- Do you?

547
00:59:33,046 --> 00:59:34,536
Amphetamines.

548
00:59:34,648 --> 00:59:38,311
I know what happens when you bastards
catch somebody sleeping.

549
00:59:38,718 --> 00:59:39,878
Want a few?

550
00:59:41,388 --> 00:59:43,583
Look what your fear has done to you.

551
00:59:44,658 --> 00:59:46,125
Can't you see?

552
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,994
When all things are conformed...

553
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:52,389
...there'll be no more disputes.
No conflicts.

554
00:59:52,899 --> 00:59:54,389
No more problems.

555
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:57,831
Abandon yourself and join us.
There are hundreds...

556
00:59:58,004 --> 01:00:00,234
...even thousands of us here.

557
01:00:00,407 --> 01:00:03,308
We've traveled light years
throughout the universe...

558
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:06,072
...always surviving, growing stronger.

559
01:00:06,246 --> 01:00:08,237
Because we've learned...

560
01:00:08,682 --> 01:00:11,014
...it's the race that's important...

561
01:00:11,518 --> 01:00:12,985
...not the individual.

562
01:00:14,187 --> 01:00:16,587
The individual's always important.

563
01:00:16,857 --> 01:00:20,315
- Only unity guarantees survival.
- So you must join us.

564
01:00:20,427 --> 01:00:23,590
- The human race is doomed.
- Accept it.

565
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,161
It's a better way.

566
01:00:25,232 --> 01:00:27,826
- Stay back!
- It's a matter of survival.

567
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:31,526
Stay back! Stay back!
I'm warning you to stay back!

568
01:00:31,938 --> 01:00:33,030
Doctor...

569
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,940
...put the gun down.

570
01:00:38,945 --> 01:00:40,879
You'll never get my soul.

571
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:43,881
Never.

572
01:00:53,293 --> 01:00:55,955
"Nobody likes us

573
01:00:56,229 --> 01:00:58,891
"Everybody hates us

574
01:00:59,466 --> 01:01:02,128
"Going to the garden...

575
01:01:02,302 --> 01:01:04,293
"...to get worms

576
01:01:06,173 --> 01:01:10,166
"Long, thin, slimy ones

577
01:01:10,343 --> 01:01:13,005
"...short, fat, juicy ones...

578
01:01:14,748 --> 01:01:18,775
"...itsy-bitsy, fuzzy worms

579
01:01:22,255 --> 01:01:24,815
"First, you bite the head off

580
01:01:25,759 --> 01:01:28,421
"Then you suck the juice out

581
01:01:29,329 --> 01:01:32,321
"Then you throw the rest away"

582
01:01:44,678 --> 01:01:46,009
Everybody okay?

583
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:48,574
I found us a way out of here.

584
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,759
Dad, they're everywhere!

585
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:44,359
Where are we going?

586
01:02:45,472 --> 01:02:47,804
I know what I'm doing. Don't worry.

587
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:53,204
Just don't show any emotion.

588
01:02:53,446 --> 01:02:55,107
They can be fooled.

589
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:19,464
I know where I'm going.

590
01:03:21,341 --> 01:03:23,468
I know exactly what I'm doing.

591
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:35,086
Where are you going?

592
01:03:39,292 --> 01:03:40,156
Stop!

593
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,294
Let go! Let go!

594
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,820
Shit! Shit!

595
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:47,795
Don't make me hurt you. Just calm down.

596
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:50,758
What's going on?

597
01:03:50,837 --> 01:03:52,031
Let her go!

598
01:03:52,939 --> 01:03:54,031
Leave her alone!

599
01:03:54,741 --> 01:03:56,208
Shoot him! Shoot him!

600
01:03:56,276 --> 01:03:58,642
- What's happening?
- He's not my father!

601
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:00,239
It's not him!

602
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:01,540
Shoot him!

603
01:04:01,614 --> 01:04:05,277
- Just back up. Back up. Put it away.
- Don't listen!

604
01:04:05,785 --> 01:04:08,185
- Shoot him!
- What do you mean?

605
01:04:08,254 --> 01:04:09,221
Stay back.

606
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:11,951
It's not my dad! He killed my father.

607
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:14,684
- Put it away.
- It's not my dad!

608
01:04:14,961 --> 01:04:17,293
- They killed my father!
- Just relax...

609
01:04:17,364 --> 01:04:19,355
- Shoot him!
...and put it away.

610
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:21,957
What are you doing?

611
01:04:55,902 --> 01:04:57,494
Marti, let's go.

612
01:05:06,413 --> 01:05:07,744
Come on, Marti!

613
01:05:56,663 --> 01:05:57,789
There's my chopper.

614
01:05:58,164 --> 01:06:00,394
It's too dangerous, so I'm going alone.

615
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:02,660
Watch for me. I'll land it over here.

616
01:06:02,735 --> 01:06:05,135
Be ready to make your move
when I touch down.

617
01:06:09,509 --> 01:06:11,409
We'll get out of here.

618
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,844
Ready for that ride I promised you?

619
01:06:17,684 --> 01:06:18,810
All right.

620
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,820
Just act like one of them.

621
01:06:24,424 --> 01:06:26,153
Be careful.

622
01:07:03,296 --> 01:07:05,264
Nobody believed me.

623
01:07:32,025 --> 01:07:34,118
I figured you'd try a bird.

624
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:37,585
What do you mean?

625
01:07:39,232 --> 01:07:41,166
You know what I mean.

626
01:07:42,835 --> 01:07:44,894
Now we're all the same, Petey.

627
01:07:46,839 --> 01:07:48,739
So what are you running from?

628
01:07:49,342 --> 01:07:50,741
Who's running?

629
01:07:51,244 --> 01:07:52,643
I've got orders.

630
01:08:04,023 --> 01:08:06,184
We're all one happy family now.

631
01:08:09,462 --> 01:08:10,429
Happy?

632
01:08:13,066 --> 01:08:14,328
What's that?

633
01:08:17,403 --> 01:08:19,769
You're wasting my time, Lieutenant.

634
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:22,403
They're waiting for light support.

635
01:08:24,877 --> 01:08:26,310
Hey, Timbo...

636
01:08:26,846 --> 01:08:28,438
...just so you know...

637
01:08:30,883 --> 01:08:32,874
...I fucked your girlfriend.

638
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:44,692
Okay, let him at the bird.

639
01:09:24,837 --> 01:09:27,203
- What are you doing?
- No! Don't!

640
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:32,510
You're making a mistake!

641
01:13:48,034 --> 01:13:49,023
Don't!

642
01:13:54,273 --> 01:13:55,262
Please.

643
01:14:02,882 --> 01:14:03,814
Wake up!

644
01:14:03,883 --> 01:14:04,872
Wake up!

645
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,279
Try and wake up! Come on!

646
01:14:24,236 --> 01:14:25,828
Camp Perry, Ohio.

647
01:14:32,578 --> 01:14:34,375
West Point, New York.

648
01:14:38,017 --> 01:14:39,780
Fort Knox, Kentucky.

649
01:14:50,096 --> 01:14:51,791
You can do this, Marti.

650
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:55,523
You're doing fine. Just walk with me.

651
01:14:56,035 --> 01:14:58,162
Fort Monroe, Virginia.

652
01:15:02,775 --> 01:15:04,936
Fort Bliss, Texas.

653
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,443
Where's Andy, Tim?
He's got to be in there.

654
01:15:13,686 --> 01:15:15,176
I didn't see him.

655
01:15:15,354 --> 01:15:16,844
He wasn't in there.

656
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:40,301
My chopper's right up there.

657
01:15:43,716 --> 01:15:45,980
I'm not leaving without my brother.

658
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:48,985
We'll get help, then come back for him.

659
01:15:52,892 --> 01:15:55,884
Do what you want,
but I'm not leaving without him.

660
01:16:04,103 --> 01:16:06,833
Didn't I tell you this place
was a freak show?

661
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:15,079
Where are you going?

662
01:16:18,517 --> 01:16:19,848
We got work to do.

663
01:16:21,854 --> 01:16:24,015
I saw Andy. He's looking for you.

664
01:16:30,763 --> 01:16:31,991
Where?

665
01:16:57,957 --> 01:17:01,449
Marti, don't leave me!
Marti, wait, don't go!

666
01:17:03,496 --> 01:17:05,327
Don't leave me here!

667
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,343
Go! Go!

668
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:45,830
Andy, don't! What are you doing? No!

669
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:49,196
Get him off me!

670
01:17:49,441 --> 01:17:51,170
Andy, what are you doing?

671
01:17:57,016 --> 01:17:58,608
Throw him out!

672
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:01,518
Throw him out!

673
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:04,951
He's not your brother!

674
01:18:05,524 --> 01:18:07,116
Throw him out!

675
01:18:49,268 --> 01:18:50,929
Should we go after them?

676
01:18:51,003 --> 01:18:53,665
Let them go. No one'll believe them.

677
01:19:31,176 --> 01:19:32,507
I'm sorry, Marti.

678
01:20:16,288 --> 01:20:18,722
They said nobody would believe us.

679
01:20:19,325 --> 01:20:21,987
Who could believe such a crazy story?

680
01:20:22,895 --> 01:20:25,295
I could hardly believe it myself.

681
01:20:30,569 --> 01:20:33,060
They had destroyed everyone I loved.

682
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,932
Our reaction...

683
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:37,633
...was only human.

684
01:20:48,854 --> 01:20:52,255
Revenge, hate, remorse, despair, pity...

685
01:20:53,292 --> 01:20:55,021
...and, most of all, fear.

686
01:20:55,127 --> 01:20:58,961
I remember feeling all those things
as I watched the bombs explode.

687
01:21:12,978 --> 01:21:14,969
How I hated them.

688
01:22:07,533 --> 01:22:10,093
Army helo-1, this is Atlanta Ground.

689
01:22:10,436 --> 01:22:12,768
You're onscreen with clearance to land.

690
01:22:13,071 --> 01:22:15,631
Runway 2-7, taxiway alpha.

691
01:22:16,108 --> 01:22:18,167
Hover taxi via east-west parallel.

692
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,844
Ground crew standing by
at Army guard ramp.

693
01:22:21,113 --> 01:22:22,671
Roger that, Atlanta.

694
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:26,284
This is High-Bird 1 1. Two-mile final.
We're coming in.

695
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:04,682
They get you when you sleep...

696
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:08,853
...but you can only stay awake so long.

697
01:23:22,374 --> 01:23:24,365
Where will you go?

698
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:27,301
Where will you run?

699
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,641
Where will you hide?

700
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:33,140
Nowhere.

701
01:23:33,852 --> 01:23:35,752
Because there's no one...

702
01:23:36,121 --> 01:23:37,349
...like you...

703
01:23:37,589 --> 01:23:38,578
...left.
