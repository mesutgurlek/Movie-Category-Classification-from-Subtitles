1
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,038
Get off the phone!

2
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,237
- Gina... McDonald.
- McVey.

3
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,137
Green Volvo.

4
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,199
Cherokee. Jeep.

5
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,040
Right.

6
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,221
- Who are these for?
- Dr. Waters.

7
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,356
- Interesting.
- What?

8
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,594
Well, do you notice anything?

9
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,192
They're back-to-front?

10
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,007
No, look.
Left and right tags.

11
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,973
The heart's on the
right side of the body?

12
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,066
Dextrocardia with situs inversus.

13
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,112
It's not uncommon, but it's pretty rare.

14
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,239
One in every thousand.

15
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,243
Hello?

16
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,755
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

17
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,594
Sounds loud over there.

18
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,393
You got some happy clients.

19
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,629
No, I'm trying to keep them away
until it looks in better shape.

20
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,761
I'm sure it's going to look great.

21
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,040
Listen, I'd better go before
one of these guys kills himself.

22
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,578
What time are we meeting tonight?

23
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,670
Seven. Don't be late.

24
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,908
I won't.

25
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,176
Bye.

26
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,481
Happy birthday.

27
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,931
Surprise!

28
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,338
Happy birthday!

29
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,867
Scared the crap out of me.

30
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,708
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thanks.

31
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,907
Happy birthday.

32
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,347
You didn't have to do this.

33
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,512
Please, you didn't have to do this.

34
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,318
- Should I take my teeth out?
- Yeah!

35
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,158
So, how old are you now, Dad?

36
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,063
Twenty-seven.

37
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,965
You were younger than that.

38
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,628
Well, two weeks, I retire.

39
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,763
You won't know what to do with yourself.

40
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,900
Bob said I should come by
the embassy twice a week

41
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,001
in an advisory capacity.

42
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,842
What is it that you do
at the American Embassy, John?

43
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,442
Pretty much everything
from lost passports to kidnappers.

44
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,352
The American tourists in this country
like to keep us busy.

45
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,913
Dad, tell Stephan the story about
the woman who's having an affair.

46
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:19,980
Go on. Come on.

47
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,959
I love this one.

48
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,896
All right. We had a case a few years ago
where this couple from America...

49
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,365
The husband came for business
twice a year to London,

50
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,765
and his wife always came with him.

51
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,133
- This is great. You're going to love it.
- Let him tell it.

52
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:36,800
Okay. So, the husband noticed
this lubricant in his wife's makeup kit.

53
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,401
And even though they weren't having sex,

54
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,003
the lubricant was still getting
lower and lower and lower.

55
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,346
Seemed a little suspicious,
so he started to snoop around,

56
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,386
and he found that his wife

57
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,616
was banging this English guy.

58
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,853
So, the next day, before he goes
to the business meeting,

59
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,190
he empties the lubricant

60
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,526
and he replaces it with superglue.

61
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,393
It took the surgeons
about eight hours to remove her

62
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,130
from the guy she was
having an affair with.

63
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,237
Get together, you two.

64
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,275
Tradition. After that story.

65
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,474
Yay!

66
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,572
You two. You two.

67
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,572
Come here, you.

68
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,676
- Well...
- Come here.

69
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,487
Beautiful.

70
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,658
God, you're so ugly.

71
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,093
Look at your face.

72
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,096
- Great. Thanks.
- You've got paint all over your face.

73
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,564
At least I have an excuse.
Look at the state of your face.

74
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,067
Look.

75
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,159
He's been working hard.

76
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,227
His first ever exhibition is on
in less than two months.

77
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,865
- Exactly.
- You happy with what you've done?

78
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,806
Yeah.
I think you're going to like it, Dad.

79
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,345
To my family.

80
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,903
Thank you for a lovely evening.

81
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,881
Happy birthday, Dad.

82
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,110
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you.

83
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,583
- Happy birthday.
- Cheers.

84
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,829
Jesus.

85
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,407
Having fun, Stephan?

86
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,038
Oh, yes.

87
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,716
I guess that's seven
years bad luck, then.

88
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,918
I thought it was seven years bad sex.

89
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,483
No, I've already had that.

90
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,256
Oi, I heard that.

91
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,092
Baby, that was before I met you.

92
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,463
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,332
Do you think we can fix it?

94
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,070
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you.

95
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,475
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

96
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,638
Good to see you again, Stephan.

97
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,874
Yeah. Thank you.
You, too, John.

98
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,939
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

99
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,363
You're coming in?

100
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,563
No, I'm going to stay at mine tonight.
I've got some laundry to do.

101
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,369
Are you okay?

102
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,240
Yeah, I'm fine.

103
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:30,510
I'm just running between yours
and mine and work, and, uh...

104
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,248
a girl's got to have clean underwear.

105
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,185
And I've been thinking.

106
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,020
Maybe you have a drawer
or something at mine.

107
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,185
You know, where you could
keep some stuff.

108
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,529
I don't know, Stephan.

109
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:50,092
A whole drawer...
It's... It's a big step.

110
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,603
Okay. Now you're just making fun of me.

111
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,802
Finishing the work in your flat
would be a start, though.

112
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,674
I'll have the builders
back in by next month.

113
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,976
I'll come over tomorrow night after work.

114
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,845
You can make dinner.

115
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,782
Oh, really?

116
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,556
Okay. Drive safe.

117
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,089
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

118
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,027
<i>Bonsoir, madame.</i>

119
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,764
Anthony?

120
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,107
Anthony?

121
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,523
- Forget something?
- What?

122
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,361
I just saw you leaving to go home.

123
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,094
Did you forget something?

124
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,762
No, I was here.

125
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,873
That's funny.

126
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,172
I could've sworn I saw you
leaving the building.

127
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,303
No.

128
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,672
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

129
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,850
Hello. This is Stephan.

130
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,647
Leave a message after the beep.

131
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,891
Coming through.

132
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,487
Hi, Gina. My name's Lucy.

133
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,054
I'm one of the doctors here.

134
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,431
You're in hospital and you're safe, okay?

135
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,232
Gina, you all right?
Can you hear me?

136
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,205
Put out a trauma call.

137
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,434
We're just going to take you down
to the resusc room.

138
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,635
What's the story?

139
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,338
This is Gina McVey, 28-year-old female,

140
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,903
involved in an RTA.

141
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,142
Head-on collision.
She was driving.

142
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,548
Belted, airbag deployed.

143
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,813
Conscious at the scene.

144
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,980
On three. One, two, three.

145
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,546
- Glasgow Coma Scale?
- Thirteen.

146
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,057
- And respiratory rate?
- Twenty-five.

147
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,583
Okay, guys. Let's get the oxygen
connected up properly, Marie.

148
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,392
Can you get her on some monitors, Jess?
Her clothes off?

149
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,593
Lucy, can you start to conduct
a primary survey?

150
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,432
- Ziad, can you get two lines in, please?
- I'm just gonna have a listen to your chest.

151
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,869
Breathe normally for me.

152
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,429
- Pupils 4 and reacting.
- Good.

153
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,668
We're just going to do some tests, okay?

154
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,472
We've got to cut your clothes,
unfortunately, okay?

155
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,479
I just need you to stay nice and still.

156
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,809
Check the pelvis for me.

157
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,349
Yes, please, can you get
a liter of warm saline?

158
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,908
Gina, we're just poppin'
a needle into your arm, okay?

159
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,614
On the left side.
Sharp scratch coming up, okay?

160
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,350
Good air entry bilaterally.

161
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,823
- Okay.
- Pulse 120.

162
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,951
Just gonna have a little feel
of your stomach, okay?

163
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,996
Pass the monitor to engage it.

164
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,894
She has got a seatbelt mark, though.

165
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:51,061
Right. Ziad, you need to go
and get the radiography machine

166
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,764
so that we can do a trauma series
including a chest X-ray.

167
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,034
Just cover you up, Gina,

168
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,905
'cause it's a bit cold in here, okay?

169
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,809
Gina, we're just gonna
take some X-rays now.

170
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,972
We need to get the on-call radiographer,

171
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,108
and then we can logroll
after the pictures have been taken.

172
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,341
She's gonna be fine.

173
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,573
She was pretty dazed
when she first woke up.

174
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,343
Didn't even know her name.

175
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,077
She's a lot less disoriented now.

176
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,676
Her responses are slowly returning,

177
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,417
although she still has no memory
regarding the details of the crash.

178
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,324
She's a very lucky girl.

179
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,161
Telephone call for Dr. Kenric.

180
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,360
- I'll give you a moment alone.
- Thank you.

181
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,075
Hey, sweetheart.

182
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,844
How's my little girl?

183
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,583
I hope it doesn't look
as bad as it feels.

184
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,990
Just a few bruises.

185
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,358
And they'll fade.

186
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,588
It's funny.

187
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,760
The last time I sat
in a hospital room with you

188
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,361
was when you fell off a horse
and broke your arm.

189
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,270
You must have been about 13.

190
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,308
It was just a few months
after your mom died.

191
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,420
You sat there with...
the X-ray of the broken arm,

192
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,751
and announced that you wanted
to be a radiologist.

193
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,090
I left work with Stephan.

194
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,691
Daniel and Kate, they stayed
almost the entire night with you.

195
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,799
You're looking much better.

196
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,203
Apart from a slight concussion,

197
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,801
physically speaking
everything seems to be okay.

198
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,403
A few sprains and bruises,
but they'll soon heal.

199
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,507
We'll have you back
in the X-ray department in no time.

200
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,983
Regarding your memory of the crash...

201
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,687
Gina, I'd like you to meet
with a colleague of mine,

202
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,317
a Dr. Robert Zachman.

203
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,760
He works through the hospital
in a counseling capacity.

204
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,062
- A counselor?
- Yeah.

205
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,068
As I say, physically speaking,
I'm not worried.

206
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,297
It's the psychological scars
of an accident like this

207
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,668
that can cause problems.

208
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,675
Anxiety, panic attacks,
fear of driving, etcetera.

209
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,644
I just think it would be a good idea
to talk to someone about it.

210
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,509
Might help make things clearer for you.

211
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,713
At any rate, I'd like to keep you here
for at least one more day.

212
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,951
Get some rest.
I'll look in on you later.

213
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,699
Hi, Gina.

214
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,803
I'm Robert Zachman.

215
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,212
Dr. Kenric asked me
to stop by and say hello.

216
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,546
Oh, the, uh... the counselor.

217
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,210
Yeah.

218
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,913
I hear you're a lucky girl.

219
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,889
So they keep telling me.

220
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,221
You look all set to leave.

221
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,852
Yeah. Just waiting for my boyfriend.

222
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,954
I see.

223
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,602
Kenric told me that you don't
remember the crash at all.

224
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:31,102
Not really.
Just, um, fragments.

225
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,236
Well, fragments are good.
I can work with that.

226
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,509
Hey.

227
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,483
Hi. I'm Dr. Zachman.

228
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,712
Stephan Martin.

229
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,749
Tell you what. Here's my card.

230
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,192
Why don't you give me a call
when you feel up to it?

231
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,252
We can have a chat
about those fragments.

232
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,991
- Okay.
- Okay.

233
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,532
Nice to meet you.

234
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,004
How are you feeling?

235
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,167
Better.

236
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,843
What happened there?

237
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,450
I broke the mirror.

238
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,959
Well, I think I'll walk the dog.

239
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,660
What's wrong with him?

240
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,434
He can shit in his bed, for all I care.

241
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,433
Stephan?

242
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,240
What are you doing?

243
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,513
Jesus, you scared me.

244
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,385
I think you've got a leak.

245
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,826
I'll fix it tomorrow.

246
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,946
Shit.

247
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,408
So... how are those fragments doing?

248
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,873
Still fuzzy.

249
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,920
Well, fuzzy's not too bad.

250
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,615
Means you know it's there,
you just need to make it clear.

251
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,360
You still don't remember
anything from the accident?

252
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,895
No.

253
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,459
How are you sleeping?

254
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,698
Great, but I think maybe
it's the medication.

255
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,579
Your relationship. Steve, is it?

256
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,115
- Stephan.
- Stephan.

257
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,674
Sorry about that.
What does he do?

258
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,085
He's an architect.

259
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,885
And you live together?

260
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,061
What are you holding back, Gina?

261
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,693
Tell me what's wrong.

262
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,972
I don't think Stephan is my boyfriend.

263
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,407
Well, we all have different relationships
until we find the one.

264
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,416
No, he looks like him, but he's not him.

265
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,588
Right. When did you
first notice this change?

266
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,629
After the accident?

267
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,360
Do you think, then,
that maybe he really is Stephan

268
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:58,932
and that you're just still confused
about the events surrounding the crash?

269
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,136
- Dr. Zachman...
- Robert, please.

270
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,610
Robert.

271
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:08,146
The man in the apartment
is not my boyfriend.

272
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,618
I'll just change that. Sorry.

273
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,838
Gina, have you ever heard
about Capgras Syndrome?

274
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:45,178
It's a rare disorder, in which a person
holds a belief that an acquaintance,

275
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,985
usually a close family
member or a spouse,

276
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,788
has been replaced
by an identical-looking imposter.

277
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,789
The condition in most cases
is a direct result of brain lesion.

278
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,799
With your permission, I would like
to readmit you to hospital

279
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:04,034
and get Dr. Kenric to
do some further tests.

280
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,924
Gina, it's difficult to determine
if what you're feeling

281
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:01,726
is a result of the bruising
found in the CT scan.

282
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,962
Capgras Syndrome is rare.

283
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,129
A hundred confirmed cases since 1923.

284
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,173
Eighty of those in the last 10 years.

285
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,700
The area of bruising is consistent
with those suffering from the disorder,

286
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,303
but it's hard to diagnose,
mainly because its symptoms

287
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,612
are so closely associated
with mental illness.

288
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:24,643
Your limited memory of the accident
is also a factor.

289
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,621
What do you think?

290
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,925
We need to run some more tests.

291
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,861
I don't want any more tests. Sorry.

292
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,639
Gina? Gina, I know how you must feel.

293
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,479
- Do you?
- Yeah.

294
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,850
I have photographs
I don't remember being taken.

295
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:02,187
All I have is my feet slamming
on the brakes of my car, and here I am.

296
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,420
Well, you sustained
a sizable knock to your head.

297
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,656
And what tends to happen
is that the brain will shut down

298
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,595
large chunks of memory.

299
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,690
But gradually, these chunks
of memory will come back

300
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,827
when your brain feels able to cope.

301
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,167
How does that explain
how I feel about Stephan?

302
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,538
Well, Dr. Myers thinks
that your fears towards Stephan

303
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,440
and your loss of memory are linked.

304
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,706
And that fear will go
when you get your memory back.

305
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,374
It's like losing your car keys.

306
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,474
You have to go back
to the last thing you remember.

307
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,712
You remember hitting the brakes, right?

308
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,620
Then go and see your car.

309
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,021
It might help prod those fragments.

310
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,385
Oh, wait.

311
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,264
One bill for you...

312
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,668
one love letter from
a secret admirer for me.

313
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,366
- Punk.
- Last one up fixes dinner.

314
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,748
Come on.

315
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,518
Is that the best you can do?

316
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:51,397
Let me help you with
these men overboard, Harry.

317
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:54,733
- You all right, Harry?
- It's my wife.

318
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,638
What's wrong?

319
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,809
She's...

320
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,055
Yes, darling?

321
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,598
I was told my car was brought here.

322
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,293
And what name is the car registered in?

323
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,857
McVey.

324
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,036
That red Jeep?

325
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,503
You won't be drivin' that
anywhere in a hurry, love.

326
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,638
I, uh... I just wanted to look at it.

327
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:17,184
- Was you in that car?
- Yeah.

328
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,082
Lot 36, love.

329
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,142
Oh, hi, Mary.

330
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:05,279
Here's the last of the ex-pat
documents you requested.

331
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,652
Thank you.

332
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,720
Is everything okay, Mr. McVey?

333
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,058
Yes. Why?

334
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,031
Oh, it's just that I...

335
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,693
I saw you on the street, at lunch time.

336
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,867
And you... you just ignored me.

337
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:32,437
Mary, I've been here all day.

338
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:35,041
I didn't go out for lunch.

339
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,518
I could have sworn I...

340
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,453
Well, I better carry on.

341
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,009
I've got Dr. Kenric on 2.

342
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:01,441
Thank you, Mary.

343
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:05,774
Hello?

344
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,099
Hi, Mr. McVey, sir.

345
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,607
How are you doing, Stan?

346
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,939
Not so horrible.

347
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,774
Hey, Stan, what happened to the mirror?

348
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,013
I came in this morning
and it was all over the floor.

349
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,217
Well, good night, Stan.

350
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,058
Same to you, Mr. McVey, sir.

351
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:41,936
Daniel?

352
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:50,493
Daniel?

353
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:32,757
No, no.

354
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,874
He's one.

355
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,510
Shit.

356
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:57,669
- Why don't you watch where you're going?
- Sorry.

357
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,476
Silly cunt.

358
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,839
Dr. Kenric called me today.

359
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:10,578
He's worried about you.

360
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:14,780
He told me that you believe Stephan

361
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,018
is somehow changed.

362
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,389
Is that true?

363
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,090
You really believe that?

364
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,041
I saw this woman.

365
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,634
Before the crash.

366
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,746
She looked like me.

367
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,617
Where was this?

368
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:46,154
She drove past me on the street.

369
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,955
Turned into a garage.

370
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:55,328
I followed her.

371
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,904
I followed her up to her flat.

372
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,807
It was like having
the longest case of déjà vu,

373
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,369
except there was a photo.

374
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,745
A photo of me and you.

375
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,471
Why would she have a photo of you?

376
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,948
Maybe it's not me.

377
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,146
Hello, this is Stephan.

378
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:22,514
I can't get to the phone right now,
so leave a message...

379
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:11,389
Stephan?

380
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:16,197
Hello?

381
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:22,586
Hello?

382
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,891
Whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down.

383
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:29,028
Slow...

384
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,232
Okay, slow down.

385
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,604
Now what happened?

386
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:37,870
Where are you now?

387
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,381
I don't...

388
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,848
Gina, where are you now?

389
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,077
I'm in Stephan's apartment.

390
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,677
Okay. I'll call the police, okay?

391
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:46,743
Okay.

392
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:49,416
All right, now, Gina,
it's important that you listen to me.

393
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:50,481
Okay.

394
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,528
It's okay. Stay calm.

395
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,655
Gina? Gina.

396
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:58,632
Listen to me very carefully.
I want you to get out of the house now.

397
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,965
Don't wait.
I want you to get out now.

398
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:02,094
And I will meet you...

399
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,201
Dad?

400
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,901
Dad?

401
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:45,422
Hello?

402
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,230
Daniel?

403
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,635
Gina, what's wrong?

404
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:51,969
Daniel, listen to me.
You're in danger.

405
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,633
Stephan, he, uh...

406
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,269
He's after me. He, um...

407
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:00,577
Well, slow down.
You're not making any sense.

408
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:04,085
It looked like him, but it wasn't him.

409
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,246
And now I think something's
happened to Dad.

410
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,819
What's happened to Dad?

411
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:10,881
Gina?

412
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:13,587
She's after me.

413
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,061
Who's after you?

414
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,859
The woman I saw before the crash.

415
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,431
You're really starting to scare me now.
What woman?

416
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,527
Look, I...

417
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:26,836
I saw this woman before the accident,
and she looks like me.

418
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:30,470
I followed her to Pembridge Road.

419
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:32,980
Pembridge Road?

420
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:34,174
Yeah.

421
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:36,843
- Pembridge House.
- Pembridge House?

422
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:40,946
But Gina...

423
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,456
that's where you live.

424
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:54,465
Hello?

425
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,335
Gina?

426
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,961
Kate?

427
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:37,939
Kate?

428
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:45,602
I... I've lost my keys.

429
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:50,877
Don't worry, I'll get the spare set.

430
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:04,231
Will you need an extra
set of keys to be cut?

431
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,130
No, I've got a spare set somewhere.

432
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,668
Thanks.

433
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:45,643
I'm just going to go home
and grab some stuff,

434
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,586
and I'll see you later.

435
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:51,355
No. No.

436
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:08,055
Is that another case
of dextrocardia with situs inversus?

437
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:24,327
Yes.

438
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:10,741
