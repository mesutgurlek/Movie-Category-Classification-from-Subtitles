1
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,141
It's just...

2
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,646
the children are
my responsibility.

3
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,615
We've been through this before.

4
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,652
These children have been
specially selected.

5
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,156
If my work is a success,
thousands of lives can be saved.

6
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,487
It's not about a few children.

7
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,687
It's about the future
of our species.

8
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,566
Anyway, it's too late
for doubt now.

9
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,230
The process
has already started.

10
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,503
Just do what we agreed.

11
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,908
At 10 P.M.,
you call the police...

12
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:02,004
and you tell them
the children have disappeared.

13
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,413
Sir, the subjects
have been transported.

14
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,746
Good.

15
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,410
But, sir, there's a problem.

16
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,455
Head count had twenty of them
before transport.

17
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,581
Now we've only got nineteen.
Someone's missing.

18
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,455
Shit!

19
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,293
Good evening, Sheriff.

20
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,295
What's going on, Adams?

21
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,228
There's twenty kids
live at this orphanage.

22
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,027
All twenty of them
have gone missing.

23
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,591
-And then?
-After the power went out...

24
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,637
I went to check
on the children.

25
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,299
Their beds were empty,
every one of them.

26
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,808
They just...

27
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,776
disappeared.

28
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,117
Did you have a nightmare?

29
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:25,187
My mommy says that there's
nothing to be afraid of...

30
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,096
in the dark.

31
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,000
Your mother's wrong, kid.

32
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,476
Being afraid of the dark
is what keeps most of us alive.

33
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,917
Pinkerton.
Carnby is coming in...

34
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,429
on flight 185
from Buenos Aires.

35
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,329
He's got the artifact.

36
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,334
Intercept him at the airport.

37
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,860
Get the artifact and kill him.

38
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,846
So maybe you're thinking
I'm an asshole...

39
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,677
scaring that kid
for no reason...

40
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,614
but I'm just
trying to protect him.

41
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,448
You see, there's a world
around you...

42
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,579
that you've trained
yourself not to see.

43
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,182
Call it paranormal,
supernatural, occult, whatever.

44
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,193
But inside all of us...

45
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,229
is an uncontrollable fear
of the dark.

46
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:34,323
Kids are told it's irrational,
but it's not.

47
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,992
Fear is what protects you...

48
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,833
from the things
you don't believe in.

49
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,840
I learned the truth
a long time ago-

50
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,172
just because
you can't see something...

51
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,711
doesn't mean
it can't kill you.

52
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,881
When I was ten,
I lost my memory.

53
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,579
Gone, erased.

54
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,919
I know something bad happened
back then at the orphanage.

55
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,083
I've been looking
for answers ever since.

56
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,059
You don't have to believe me.

57
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,359
My name is Edward Carnby,
and I'm here to protect you...

58
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,228
from the things
you don't believe.

59
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,443
You travel light.

60
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,741
I carry enough baggage
for the both of us. Trust me.

61
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,547
That's funny, man.
What do you do?

62
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,209
You don't want to know.

63
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,482
Sure, I do. That's the best part
of the job, you know-

64
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,217
learning about people's lives.

65
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,891
I'm a paranormal investigator.

66
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,864
Are you fucking serious?
Really?

67
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,025
What does that mean exactly?

68
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,899
Let me put it this way.

69
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,735
I hunt and track down
the strange and unusual.

70
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,470
Speaking of strange
and unusual...

71
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,377
that cab's been following us
since we left the airport.

72
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,937
-No shit?
-No shit.

73
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,980
You want me to lose him?

74
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,315
I wouldn't mind.

75
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,252
Let's do it.

76
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,902
They really want
something from you.

77
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:23,942
Shit!

78
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,612
That's my cab, man!

79
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,620
My boss is gonna
fucking kill me!

80
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,524
My insurance is not
gonna cover this, man!

81
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,991
Shit!

82
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,652
Pull into this market up here.

83
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,888
And kill someone?

84
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,579
It's a total dream.

85
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,425
Stay down!

86
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,994
You all right?

87
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,774
Where is he?

88
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,045
Hey! Hey!

89
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:14,193
Miss Cedrac,
we got another delivery.

90
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,265
I don't have anything
scheduled for today.

91
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,270
What museum was it
transferred from?

92
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,932
"For Dr. Hudgens,
from Dr. Hudgens. "

93
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,634
That must be a mistake.

94
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,574
It's probably for
the big Abkani show.

95
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,442
Abkani? What the hell is Abkani?

96
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,448
It's an ancient
Native American civilization.

97
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,450
They were, like,
this super-advanced culture...

98
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:36,921
until, like, 10,000 years ago,
they just disappeared.

99
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,923
It says it's only to be opened
by Dr. Hudgens.

100
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:42,654
This is Aline Cedrac.
She's the assistant curator.

101
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,787
We have artifacts coming in
from all around the world.

102
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,297
Until Hudgens gets back...

103
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,299
I will be doing
all his cataloging for him.

104
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,834
Hey, where is Hudgens anyway?

105
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,164
The show opens
in a couple days.

106
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,137
He's off on another
archaeological goose chase.

107
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,298
He thinks he's finally
found the Arabis.

108
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,842
So he sticks you
with all the work.

109
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,175
At least it takes your mind
off your boyfriend, right?

110
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,681
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

111
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,844
Yeah.

112
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,787
They say a sunken ship
is like a grave.

113
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,483
It should never be disturbed.

114
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,025
I've been searching
for the Arabis...

115
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,529
for over twenty years, Captain,
and now that I've found it...

116
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,291
I'm afraid your
ill-informed superstitions...

117
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,696
aren't enough to stop me.

118
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,413
OK, Hudgens,
let's see what we've got.

119
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,278
Edward, it's John here.

120
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,841
I don't know if you're back from
wherever you were this time...

121
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,286
but if you are, call me.

122
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,880
It's the nightmares.
They've started again.

123
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,949
I need to know if it's just me.

124
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,619
Call me, please.

125
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,650
Well, are you going
to open it up...

126
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,888
make sure it's what
you're looking for?

127
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,328
The conditions must be perfect.

128
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,992
Otherwise,
there may be consequences.

129
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,632
Is this made of solid gold?

130
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,109
You know, the Abkani
was the first civilization...

131
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,669
to use gold
to house their valuables.

132
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:26,684
They believed it held the power
to contain evil spirits.

133
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,515
Nowadays,
we can't even remember...

134
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,680
why we value gold
in the first place.

135
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,656
Let's just load this
on the truck.

136
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,753
If the container
is made of solid gold...

137
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,388
whatever's inside
must be worth a fortune.

138
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,056
Oh, you have no idea.

139
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,567
But I'm looking forward
to finding out.

140
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,863
Listen. Listen!
You'll make a terrible mistake!

141
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,201
The only mistake
I'd be making...

142
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,242
is letting you walk out
with whatever's inside.

143
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,537
Throw him in there!

144
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,203
Please! No!

145
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,371
Open it up, Captain.

146
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,074
Let's see what we've got.

147
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,914
Don't open it!

148
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,642
John?

149
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,726
Oh, God.

150
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,546
What are we looking at,
Krashinski?

151
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,286
Electromagnetics off the scale,
Commander.

152
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,622
I've never seen
anything like it.

153
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,663
Recalibrating
all sensors now, sir.

154
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,802
There's no malfunction, sir.
These are accurate readings.

155
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,499
Jesus Christ.

156
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,174
Hello?

157
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,274
Did a shipment
arrive for me today?

158
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,251
Oh, it's a fascinating piece,
Dr. Hudgens.

159
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,981
I started decoding
the pictograms and-

160
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,218
Who told you to do that?
That crate was not to be opened.

161
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,157
Yeah, but I was only
just gonna catalog it for you.

162
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,320
It's not your place to question
my instructions, miss Cedrac.

163
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,829
Leave the tablet alone.

164
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,660
I'll catalog it myself
when I get back.

165
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,131
But, Dr. Hudgens, I-

166
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,503
Sir, I found them.

167
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,133
Sister Clara,
something's happened.

168
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,178
The others are back.

169
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,700
Yeah.

170
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,364
Edward. Thank God.

171
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,376
Hey, Linda. What's wrong?

172
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,675
It's John.
I woke up, and he's just gone.

173
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,442
All of his clothes are here.

174
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,348
His car's in the garage.
It's like he just got up...

175
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,387
in the middle of the night
and walked out.

176
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,082
I'll be right over.

177
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,725
According to Abkani legend,
when they opened the gate...

178
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,891
between our world
and the world of darkness...

179
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,901
a few people survived
by joining forces...

180
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,267
with the creatures
from the other side.

181
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,898
They gained supernatural power
but lost their humanity.

182
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:59,910
That would explain the man who
tried to kill me this morning.

183
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,570
I have this bad feeling...

184
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,773
that's what's happened
to John and the others.

185
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,082
Edward, you've known each other
since you were kids.

186
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:12,419
Did he tell you
he was leaving me?

187
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,083
Of course not.

188
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,027
Then where is he, Edward?
What's going on?

189
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,989
I'll figure this out.

190
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,298
I'll find John. Don't worry.

191
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,598
OK.

192
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,984
Fischer here.

193
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,114
-Hey, Fisch. It's Carnby.
-Edward.

194
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,455
I know it's been a while.
You gotta do me a favor.

195
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,860
I haven't heard from you
since you left 713. What's up?

196
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,864
A friend of mine
who grew up in my orphanage...

197
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,366
disappeared last night.
His name's John Dillon.

198
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,369
Can you try to dig up
some information?

199
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,565
They'll kill me if they
find out, but let me check.

200
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,574
All right. I have to take a trip
down memory lane.

201
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,803
I'll meet you at 3:00
at our old hangout. OK?

202
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,368
-Please take care, Edward.
-I'll see you then.

203
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,313
One, two, three.

204
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,481
Bluebells, cockle shells...

205
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,492
eevie, ivy, over.

206
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,357
I like coffee, I like...

207
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,172
Welcome home, Edward.

208
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,906
Should I make some tea?

209
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,743
Yes. Thank you, Sophie.

210
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,976
Let me look at you.

211
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,542
You've been getting
enough sleep?

212
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:55,188
Sister, John disappeared
last night, and...

213
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,058
something happened
to me as well.

214
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,891
It's happening again.

215
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,929
I need your help.

216
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,707
I want to find the others.

217
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,742
I'll get their files.

218
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,277
Come on.

219
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,383
It's good to see you, Edward.

220
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,282
You should visit more often.

221
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,586
Yeah, that is very strange, huh?

222
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,920
He just disappeared?

223
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,053
I understand
you must be very concerned.

224
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,895
I'II let you know
as soon as I hear something.

225
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,593
OK, thank you.

226
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,413
I was recruited into Bureau 713
when I was 20.

227
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,575
I learned everything I could
about the paranormal.

228
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,243
I was a good agent...

229
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,753
but it didn't get me
any closer to the truth.

230
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,085
Every time I uncovered
a new Abkani artifact...

231
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,421
it immediately got classified.

232
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,121
I realized I'd never get
the answers I was looking for...

233
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,925
with 713 calling the shots.

234
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,898
Why did I agree to this?

235
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,234
Come on, Fisch.
It's a beautiful day.

236
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,434
I ordered your favorite.
It's pecan, right?

237
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,904
You have a good memory, Carnby.

238
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,610
It's all in the details, right?

239
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:30,280
I tracked down the three
you asked me about.

240
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,017
They all disappeared last night.

241
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:38,119
Same story-
no suitcase, no car...

242
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,688
just up and walked out
into the night.

243
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,336
So that means
all nineteen are missing.

244
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,769
I did a full
cross-reference, too.

245
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,898
Nothing much in common...

246
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,307
except they all grew up
in the same orphanage...

247
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,005
your orphanage.

248
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,777
What's going on, Carnby?

249
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,852
That's what I'm trying
to figure out here.

250
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,386
Thanks, Fisch.
I'll see you around.

251
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,157
It's good to know I've still
got friends at the 713.

252
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:22,540
Miss Cedrac,
there's someone here to see you.

253
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,179
-Edward!
-Oh, God, I missed you.

254
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,145
I thought you were dead,
you asshole.

255
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,518
God.

256
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,284
Just give me five minutes,
all right?

257
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,052
I can explain everything.

258
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,718
In private, Rob.

259
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,695
Oh, I should-
yeah, I'm gonna go.

260
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:50,565
Give me one reason why I should
ever even speak to you again.

261
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,734
Look at this.

262
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,278
I was in the Amazon
for six weeks...

263
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,544
tracking poachers
across their transport lines.

264
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,212
Then I fell in with a group
of ex-Chilean military...

265
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,381
who were selling artifacts
on the black market.

266
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,017
That was found
on the southern tip of Chile...

267
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,527
in a gold mine.

268
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,630
It's Abkani.

269
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,727
You know,
you could have called...

270
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,237
or even written...

271
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,933
just to let me know
that you were alive.

272
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:39,746
Do the inscriptions
make any sense to you?

273
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,753
I'm not sure.
The thing is...

274
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,755
they're all from
different locations-

275
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,155
Venezuela,
Newfoundland, Alaska...

276
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,624
and now this one from Chile.

277
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,854
10,000 years ago,
that would have been...

278
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,420
like burying them
at the ends of the earth.

279
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,797
Yeah. But why? If you want
someone to build a puzzle...

280
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,268
why would you hide the pieces
so far apart?

281
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,141
Now what?

282
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:16,118
Is Rob trying to create a mood
or something?

283
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,984
Give me that.

284
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,335
Hello?

285
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,332
Hello?

286
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,678
Miss Cedrac?

287
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,218
Mr. Carnby?

288
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,005
What the hell's with the lights?

289
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:54,381
How come every time you show up,
my life gets complicated?

290
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,944
I could ask you the same thing.

291
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,981
What is it?

292
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,624
Nothing. The hair on the back
of my neck just stood up.

293
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,283
Hello?

294
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,661
Did you hear that?

295
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,519
Rob!

296
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,653
Come on! Go! Go!

297
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,176
What the hell was that?

298
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,692
Get down! Come on!
Lock the door!

299
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,562
Get the key in there!

300
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:26,660
It's our only way
out of here!

301
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,263
Aline!

302
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,705
-You all right?
-Yeah.

303
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,341
Yeah, I'm OK.

304
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,671
I want a full security
sweep of the area.

305
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,231
-Miles.
-Sir?

306
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,368
Call Fischer and tell him
to get his boys down here now.

307
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,673
Let's go!

308
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,663
Move! Move! Move!

309
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,966
Scanners clear?

310
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,530
Scanners clear.

311
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,114
What the hell
are you doing here, Carnby?

312
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,482
Hey, Burke.
Good to see you, too.

313
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,453
You shouldn't be here.
This is my unit now.

314
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,514
You must be very proud.

315
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,993
You used to be able to take care
of yourself there, Carnby.

316
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,394
Got a little soft
since you left 713?

317
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,956
You should take her to the medic
and check that arm.

318
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,195
This way.

319
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,831
I'll catch up.

320
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,499
Why are you still here?

321
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,805
Why am I still here?
I just got my ass chased...

322
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,937
around this goddamn museum
by something I couldn't see.

323
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,241
I want to know
what the hell they are...

324
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,804
what they're doing
in the goddamn city!

325
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,180
I want to know
what 713 knows about it!

326
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,812
You're not 713 anymore, OK?
That information is classified.

327
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,379
That means it's none of
your fucking business!

328
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,186
We've got this under control.

329
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,658
Thank you.
I don't need your help.

330
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,854
Get him out of here, Marko.

331
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,692
I asked very nicely.

332
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,165
Real tough, huh?

333
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,032
All right!

334
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,163
You're right, Burke.

335
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,436
Maybe I have gotten soft.

336
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,670
You just keep walking.

337
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,407
Come on, Miles.
Fucking prick.

338
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,715
Thank you very much, Burke.

339
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,964
-Hey.
-Hi.

340
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,060
-You OK?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

341
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,628
I need to study
those artifacts.

342
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,231
All right.
I'm gonna go and figure out...

343
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,402
what's going on with John
and the others.

344
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,911
We'll hook up later, OK?

345
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,607
Later.

346
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,764
You shouldn't be here, Carnby.

347
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,868
I'm not.
Commander Burke is.

348
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,498
Your curiosity
have anything to do...

349
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,977
with the fingerprint of yours
I found on this corpse?

350
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,277
Fisch, the list of people
I trust is short.

351
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,580
I'm not making it shorter.

352
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,284
Have you I.D.'d him yet?

353
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,794
We got his dentals.

354
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:48,662
Agent James Pinkerton.

355
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,860
He's ex-713.

356
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,460
What?

357
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,471
You telling me he was an agent?

358
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,631
When?

359
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,608
Went M.I.A. twenty years ago.

360
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:03,807
His records are so classified,
they're practically invisible.

361
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:07,317
Why the hell
was he trying to kill me?

362
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,580
This might have something
to do with it.

363
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,383
Fused to the spinal cord.

364
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,069
There's another piece in here.

365
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,077
It's been severed.

366
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,546
Never seen this kind of
symbiosis before.

367
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,381
This must be why his entire
nervous system was compromised.

368
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,420
Scanner's still
giving a reading.

369
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,237
What?

370
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:11,373
The Abkani never cease
to amaze me.

371
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:15,317
Such a complex society at a time
when most of humanity...

372
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,719
was hunting and gathering
and huddling around fires.

373
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,780
Dr. Hudgens,
when did you get back?

374
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,385
A few hours ago.
I heard you had some excitement.

375
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,895
Are you all right?

376
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:29,922
Yeah, I'm fine.
A little shaken up, but I'm OK.

377
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,094
Look, I must apologize
for snapping at you earlier.

378
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,766
But why are you still here,
after all you've been through?

379
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,305
-Where'd you get that image?
-Edward.

380
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:47,044
That's a major find.
I'll have to analyze that.

381
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,517
Actually, I'll do that myself.

382
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,679
It's not a request.
Where is the artifact?

383
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,882
-Everything OK in here?
-Who are you?

384
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,925
Miss Cedrac's security detail.

385
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,892
My dear,
have you any idea who I am?

386
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,451
Dr. Lionel Hudgens...

387
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:59,928
former agent,
Science-spy division...

388
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,488
currently 713 advisor status.

389
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,966
I know exactly who you are.

390
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:10,496
Well, I'll have to hold off
my curiosity till the morning.

391
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:14,476
Dr. Hudgens.
I meant to ask...

392
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,513
did you finally find the Arabis?

393
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,676
Just an empty shipwreck.

394
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,308
Like you said...

395
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,320
another wild-goose chase.

396
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,686
You've got one inside you, too.

397
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,358
But symbiosis is incomplete.

398
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,335
I was electrocuted
when I was a kid.

399
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,963
That must have killed it.

400
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,473
Can you remove it?

401
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,976
Well, I could try...

402
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,672
but it could paralyze you.

403
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,038
So these organisms
are somehow connected...

404
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,870
to the creatures
from the museum, right?

405
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,432
We call them Zenoes.

406
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,207
Catchy. When did they
first appear?

407
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,645
Two years ago.

408
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,616
They've been 713's
top priority ever since.

409
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,814
But it's been almost exclusively
in rural areas.

410
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,086
This sort of urban infiltration
is unheard of.

411
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,922
Have you isolated
any weaknesses?

412
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:14,260
They're vulnerable
to elements 76 to 79-

413
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,562
osmium, iridium,
platinum, and gold...

414
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:21,036
negates their ability
to disrupt electricity.

415
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,130
If they disrupt electricity...

416
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,573
how come my flashlight
still worked?

417
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:30,239
Well, the closer the current is
to its power source...

418
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,714
the less the disruption.

419
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:38,744
Now, this has been calibrated
to track their disruption field.

420
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,346
It won't help you see them...

421
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,824
but it'll let you know
when they're nearby.

422
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,157
They live almost
exclusively in the dark.

423
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,754
Sunlight is lethal
in large doses.

424
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,232
But only certain
light frequencies can hurt them.

425
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:55,398
These lamps have been set
to an effective frequency.

426
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:03,044
But for maximum damage,
we use bullets...

427
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:07,072
coated in a photon-accelerated
luminescent resin.

428
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,346
Cuts right through them.

429
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:18,123
I'm gonna need a lot of these.

430
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,146
The man who attacked me
yesterday...

431
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:39,148
was after the Abkani artifact
I found in Chile.

432
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:42,811
He was driven by the same force
that controls the creatures.

433
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,946
The Zenoes at the museum
were after the same thing.

434
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,854
It can't be a coincidence...

435
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,826
John and the others
have also gone missing.

436
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:54,159
I'm close to the truth.
I know it.

437
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,495
But whoever
controls these things...

438
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,365
is going to send more after me.

439
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,720
Commander Burke
wants to see you.

440
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:29,621
I heard you met with Carnby.

441
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,092
Why?

442
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:34,790
Well, he has intel we need.
I trust him.

443
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,163
You trust him. Right.

444
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,759
We need to trust
each other, Fischer.

445
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,305
I mean, I need to know
whose side you're on.

446
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,465
Or I can just remove you
from the unit...

447
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,907
and you and Carnby
can hang out anytime you want.

448
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,138
You can grab a pizza,
go to the movies.

449
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,908
What is it you need from me?

450
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:54,280
I need all the intel
you have on Edward Carnby...

451
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,751
and I need you
to keep your mouth shut.

452
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,947
You understand me?

453
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,489
I do.

454
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,099
I'll get it.

455
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,636
Sara?

456
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,813
Sara?

457
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,123
Oh, God. Sara!

458
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:33,233
Yes. Yes.

459
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,653
Now you're with us.

460
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,498
It seems all the pieces
fit together.

461
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:03,630
Now I need your help
to figure out why.

462
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,504
With the pieces
assembled like this...

463
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,509
maybe the computer
can plot a location...

464
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,841
based on the symbols
matching these constellations.

465
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,245
So, what are we
looking for exactly?

466
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,147
The Abkani
used constellations...

467
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,946
to pinpoint
a geographic location...

468
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,509
but I don't think
we could zero in...

469
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,282
more than maybe
a 100-mile radius.

470
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,451
-Edward.
-Yeah?

471
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,051
If this is correct...

472
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,325
I think the computer
can pinpoint the location.

473
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,832
That's right in our area,
isn't it?

474
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:34,063
Shit.

475
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:37,406
Here.

476
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,440
Stay there.

477
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,728
John? John?

478
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,633
Shit. John, it's me.
It's Edward.

479
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,222
Aline, come on! Come on!
This way! This way!

480
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,300
Come on! Come on!

481
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,012
Come on! This way!

482
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,533
We better get out of here.
Come on.

483
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:54,233
-I just killed John.
-What do you mean?

484
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,712
He was one of them.
Something was controlling him.

485
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,547
Then you had no choice.
How many more are there?

486
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,109
There were twenty of us.

487
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,820
Shit.

488
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,384
Krash, Alpha Unit reporting.

489
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,046
Body count at six dead.
Please alert meds.

490
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:15,353
How many casualties we got?

491
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,949
Nine so far, sir.

492
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,359
We're still getting
some sort of readings.

493
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,526
Stand fast.

494
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,760
Carnby, drop your weapon!

495
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,924
On the ground now!

496
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,935
Burke, just in the nick of time,
as usual.

497
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,062
I know you're infected.
I'm taking you in.

498
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,298
Are you kidding me?

499
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,671
What's the first rule
they teach you at 713, huh?

500
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,232
Trust your instincts, right?

501
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,245
You really think
I'm one of these creatures?

502
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:13,180
I said drop your fucking weapon!

503
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,499
Hey, Burke!

504
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,984
Krash, this is Cheung.
We're on the upper level.

505
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:04,932
Cheung, I'm reading
four signatures.

506
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,128
They're moving to surround you.
Possible ambush.

507
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,068
I'm routing backup
from the lower level.

508
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,004
Proceed with extreme caution.

509
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,335
Where the hell is our backup?

510
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:43,463
Cheung, reinforcements have
engaged targets in stairwell.

511
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,201
You're on your own.

512
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,377
Hold your fire!

513
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,042
Any others?

514
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,643
Scanner's clear.

515
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:32,944
Krash?

516
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,991
All heat signatures motionless.

517
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,152
Clear. Repeat-you are clear.

518
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,253
-Let's move out.
-Yes, sir.

519
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,390
I need a body count.

520
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,058
Do not touch any bodies.

521
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:48,070
Meds, cleanup, and Science-spy
will be there momentarily.

522
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,766
Commander Burke,
we have got a new development.

523
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,774
All available agents
are being rerouted...

524
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,072
to an abandoned gold mine
in your sector.

525
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,409
Scan is picking up
multiple Zenoe signatures...

526
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,311
converging on the location.

527
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:02,351
You have been assigned
field command of the operation.

528
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,716
Proceed there immediately.

529
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,812
Will one of you tell me
what the hell's going on here?

530
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,550
We picked up massive readings.

531
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,957
That's not what I asked.
What the hell is going on here?

532
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:16,363
Look, Fischer's missing.
So is Hudgens.

533
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,958
I got a feeling
this is just the beginning.

534
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,595
What does Hudgens
have to do with this?

535
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,332
That's what I want to find out.

536
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,966
I'll brief you both in the air.
Let's go.

537
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,809
Krash, I'm gonna get this place
locked up now.

538
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,814
Science-spy is on the way,
Commander.

539
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,942
Oh, and, Carnby...

540
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,113
I'll need my I.D. back.

541
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,546
Let's move it.

542
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:44,492
Let's keep that access open.

543
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,860
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it! Come on!

544
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,140
So, where are we going, Burke?

545
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,801
To the Britannia gold mine.

546
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,640
The Britannia mine?
I grew up in that area.

547
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:03,974
Why are we going there?

548
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,776
They shut it down
22 years ago...

549
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:08,875
after six miners were killed
in an unexplained accident.

550
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,647
Did 713 investigate?

551
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,985
The report concluded there was
no paranormal activity.

552
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,490
But get this-

553
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,822
the agents in charge
of the investigation...

554
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:21,193
were Dr. Lionel Hudgens
and James Pinkerton.

555
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,403
Let's go!

556
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,936
Krash, what are your readings?

557
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,379
Practically off the scale,
Commander.

558
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:42,111
This is unprecedented.
Initiate 59-Alpha.

559
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,780
No. Hold them off for now.
Wait for my command.

560
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,846
We've got three guerillas
with flashlights set up...

561
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,017
gatling guns with
electromagnetic motion tracking.

562
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,357
And every available agent
in the vicinity is here-

563
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,362
Look, I don't care
what you have to do.

564
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,022
Get more bodies down here now!

565
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,192
Look at this place!
We need more!

566
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,031
Looks like we're going to war.

567
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,536
Yeah? Well, we are.

568
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,765
Highest Zenoe concentration ever
is in this area.

569
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,536
It's our chance to get
rid of them once and for all.

570
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:07,974
Come on!

571
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,742
Turner.

572
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,782
Come on.

573
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,921
Turner, why is that thing
not up and running?

574
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,459
Just arrived here, sir.

575
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:25,960
The generator
will be online shortly.

576
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:28,293
Got to move faster.
This is top priority.

577
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,162
-I need it up.
-Yes, sir.

578
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:57,356
Carnby.

579
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,167
All the readings I'm getting
from outside are huge.

580
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,069
The stuff I'm getting
from down there...

581
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,404
I've never seen
anything like it before.

582
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,182
What's going on?

583
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:30,384
This is where we need to go.

584
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,728
They're all coming here
for a reason.

585
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,696
Until we know what that is...

586
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,494
we're not gonna be able
to stop them.

587
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:40,195
So we go in?

588
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,237
Yeah.

589
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,796
-Miles.
-Sir.

590
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,342
-Defend the perimeter.
-Yes, sir.

591
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,422
Raise it up.
Need to go higher.

592
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,946
Turner,
where's the genny at right now?

593
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,483
Any minute now.
Just back off, Miles.

594
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,042
Come on, Turner.
We need those lights, all right?

595
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,485
We need the power. Let's go.

596
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,715
Yeah, yeah.

597
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,152
Shit!

598
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,419
Move on it! Let's go!

599
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:11,824
We have confirmation.

600
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,124
Perimeter defenses up.

601
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,758
Still waiting for the genny
to come back on line.

602
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,165
Roger that.

603
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,968
All agents, Britannia operation
in code yellow.

604
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,506
All units in place
and standing by...

605
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,168
for genny to come online.

606
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,983
Misfire. Misfire.

607
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,252
No engagement. Hold your fire.

608
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:46,352
Repeat-hold your fire.

609
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,248
Krash, any updates?

610
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:15,950
Perimeter defenses in place,
Commander.

611
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,322
Copy that.

612
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,319
Looks like it's a dead-end.

613
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:56,058
I'll go check it out.

614
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:02,100
Turner, you said five minutes
ten minutes ago.

615
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,604
Come on.
Where the hell are the lights?

616
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,731
I got it. I got it.

617
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,513
About fucking time.

618
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:19,054
Miles.

619
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,966
Readings are stable, sir.

620
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,972
Another dead-end.

621
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:44,604
Maybe we should double back
and try another tunnel.

622
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,278
No, no, no.

623
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,911
There's got to be
something else here.

624
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,229
Look at this.

625
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:07,832
It's Abkani.

626
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,109
There's more over here.

627
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:18,612
I think I found something.

628
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:21,844
-Marko!
-Marko!

629
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,515
We've got to go down there.

630
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,022
Let's move, people.

631
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,500
How long do we have
to hold them?

632
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,001
Only till dawn.

633
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,766
-That's four hours away, sir.
-That's right.

634
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:09,894
Incoming!

635
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:21,302
Electromagnetics around the mine
are off the scale.

636
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,038
Getting too much interference.
Satellite intel is compromised.

637
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,171
Tracking multiple
Zenoe clusters in the area...

638
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,509
mostly centered at...

639
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,247
Fischer, no!

640
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:41,822
Sir, the generator's gone!

641
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:13,557
Hold your fire till they reach
the second perimeter.

642
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,631
Commander,
713 has approved reinforcements.

643
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,103
They're already en route.
What is your status?

644
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,537
Can you read me?

645
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,438
Yeah. We're retrieving Marko.

646
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,841
Tell them to hurry up,
goddamn it.

647
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,536
Hold your fire.

648
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:32,842
Hold your fire.

649
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:34,746
Hold your fire
till they hit the perimeter.

650
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:53,969
-Fire!
-Fire!

651
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,793
Faster. Come on.

652
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:24,424
Oh, God! Help!

653
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,694
Aline!

654
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,328
Hang on! Hang on!

655
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,837
I got you!

656
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:33,341
Grab ahold!
Get your footing!

657
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,272
Go! Go! Go! Go!

658
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,178
Come on! Move faster!
Come on!

659
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,308
Come on!
Get down there! Jump!

660
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:43,817
Burke, I'm stuck!

661
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,327
What? Cheung, lay down.
Lay down.

662
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,061
Barr, get over here.

663
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,865
I'm gonna keep pressure
on the wound.

664
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,802
I need you to wrap this now.

665
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,636
Relax.
Everything's gonna be fine.

666
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,266
-Gunships approaching.
-Richards.

667
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:08,901
Richards, do you copy?

668
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,229
Richards?

669
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,860
All right, Feenstra.
Check on Richards.

670
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:35,528
Copy that.

671
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:47,040
I don't think
we're supposed to be here.

672
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,543
You guys, check this out.

673
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,418
It's a warning.

674
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,393
What's the warning?

675
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,692
It says once you make it
down here alive...

676
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:05,461
you're already dead.

677
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:08,903
That's comforting.

678
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:12,372
Miles! Miles!

679
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:15,638
Burke, go again.

680
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,770
I'm trying to find
a way out of here.

681
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,110
Miles, Krash, anyone.

682
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:22,275
Burke, go again.

683
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,588
Krash!

684
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,647
Are you getting anything?

685
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:30,714
Nothing.

686
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:31,885
I'm getting nothing but static.

687
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,087
Change your frequency.
Try again.

688
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:34,288
Burke, Miles, come in.

689
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:06,354
Fall back! Fall back!

690
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,658
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out.

691
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:23,505
Jesus!

692
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,807
Aline!

693
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,779
I got it!

694
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:38,549
Watch it! Watch her legs!

695
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,326
Watch out!

696
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,004
Shoot it! Shoot it!

697
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:53,901
Right there!

698
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:58,707
More?

699
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,723
Aw, Jesus.

700
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,727
She's gone.

701
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,471
Shit.

702
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:08,915
Burke, come on. She's gone.

703
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:11,578
Come on.
We've got to find a way out.

704
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,143
Come on! Let's move!

705
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:18,751
Miles, Richards is dead.

706
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:21,227
Everyone's dead!

707
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,973
All right,
find some high ground.

708
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,668
I'm gonna stay here. Go.

709
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:37,109
Go!

710
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,079
Watch your back.

711
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,322
Burke.

712
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:58,689
Something tells me we're not
the first ones down here.

713
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:03,835
-Let's blow it, Barr.
-Yes, sir.

714
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:42,340
Let's go.

715
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,431
Feenstra!

716
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,803
God.

717
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:54,895
Carnby.

718
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:29,427
It's 713.

719
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,600
They implanted us
with those things.

720
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,243
This isn't happening.

721
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:42,442
It doesn't make any sense.

722
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:58,761
We've been trying
to stop something...

723
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,995
that they created
the whole time.

724
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:04,561
My guys are dying out there
for nothing!

725
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:06,834
For fucking nothing!

726
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:09,308
Goddamn it!

727
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,772
Sir.

728
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,123
You guys, come here.

729
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:26,490
What's going on?

730
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:43,370
Aline, give me the artifact.

731
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,340
Yeah.

732
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,788
It's a key.

733
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:59,156
This could be
our only way out of here.

734
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,822
The answers I've been
looking for my whole life...

735
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,731
could be on the other side
of this thing.

736
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,826
Some doors are meant
to stay shut.

737
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,633
What do you want to do, Carnby?

738
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,884
I say...

739
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:28,322
we trust the Abkani.

740
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,222
Drop your weapons!
Now move away from the door!

741
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,899
Do it!

742
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:41,099
Put them down!

743
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,727
You son of a bitch.

744
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:44,897
Guns on the floor now!

745
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:47,874
That's good. That's good.

746
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:49,706
Now get in here.

747
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:52,611
Does this place
bring back memories, Carnby?

748
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,139
You were my last failure here.
If you hadn't escaped...

749
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,709
713 would never have
shut down my experiments.

750
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:04,890
I spent twenty years looking
for the key to that door!

751
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,394
Now give it to me!

752
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:10,556
Give it to me!

753
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,896
No? What a pity.

754
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:15,095
You were a fine archaeologist.

755
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,606
Aline, just give it to him.

756
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:22,234
There's been
enough killing today.

757
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:30,110
That's fine. Right.

758
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,444
Now get over there!

759
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,981
You never could have
opened the door, you know...

760
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,287
not without this.

761
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:44,627
Hudgens.

762
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:47,429
Don't be insane.
Don't open that door.

763
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:51,065
Hudgens, please,

764
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,334
think about what you're doing.
Don't open that door!

765
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,626
Shit.

766
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:07,011
All right, let's just...

767
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:10,574
back up nice and easy,
nice and slow.

768
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:16,648
Go. Go.

769
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,821
Go, go, go!

770
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:23,193
Shit.

771
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,731
Come on!

772
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:40,343
Come on! This way! Come on!

773
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:49,754
Commander Burke.

774
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:52,759
Miles. Richards.

775
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:55,022
Yonek.

776
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:58,623
Or any operations. Over.

777
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,725
Can anyone read me?

778
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:07,742
Shit.

779
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:11,078
Come on! Go, go! Run!

780
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,081
Hey! There's a ladder up here!

781
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,583
How's it look?

782
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:18,744
It looks like
it could be a way out.

783
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,378
All right. I'm pulling.

784
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:28,155
-Fuck. Fuck!
-What is it?

785
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,163
Detonator's inactive.
The signals not going through.

786
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:31,960
We'll find another way.
Let's get out of here!

787
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:33,728
I've got to get back there.
I've got to get closer to them.

788
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:36,327
You can hear them!
Let's get the hell out of here!

789
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:39,271
Let's go! Come on!

790
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,798
You guys get out of here.
I'm going back.

791
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,435
Burke, come on!

792
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:48,042
Burke!

793
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:50,846
Come on!

794
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:15,793
They were under us
the whole time.

795
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:29,744
I don't believe it.

796
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:48,094
Sister Clara?

797
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:46,913
The gate was closed again.

798
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:50,917
But, like the Abkani discovered
there's a price to pay...

799
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:54,250
for bringing darkness
into the light.

800
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:58,418
The Abkani people were wiped
off the face of the earth.

801
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:00,051
And now...

802
01:30:00,128 --> 01:30:03,757
it looks like it's happening
all over again.
