Have a seat. Enjoy yourself. OK?

for one reason, and one reason only.

00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,758
Now, the walk-through says
I dump the ammo and the boss dies.

OK. Damn. All right. Uh... I don't know what
else to tell you. You got the hyperblaster?

64
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,882

Yes, I have the hyperblaster.

No, no, no.
I need it to get to the final boss.

69
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,353
Beat her up.
It's the way God intended.

70
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:22,425
You know, Hutch, if you put as much effort
into clerking as you did into gaming,

71
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,866
you could end up like me someday.
You know that, right?

72
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,768
OK.

73
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,306
All right, you can take tomorrow.
How do I do it?

74
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,203
It's easier to kill her
without the blaster.

75
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:37,808
So lose it right before going down the
stairs. She'll die on her own. Game over.

00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,809
All right. OK. Hey, man,
are you hip to this PDA sex thing?

Really? Yeah, so was I.

94
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:28,088
I always thought I'd be taking pictures
on her wedding day, not her funeral.

00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,334
Mom and Dad won't let me play those
video games. They were gonna toss 'em.

101

You know, they're too violent.
Besides, he would want you to have 'em.

I tell you, bro, first your parents, now this.

You know, Phin,
the problem with your mouth

112

is that stupid insensitive shit
comes out of it. You're an idiot.

Be strong - that's all I'm saying. You know

00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,081
So, do they know what happened yet?

117
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,992
He was murdered -
him and two of his friends.

118
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,022
- That's awful.
- What's in the bag?

Yeah.

121
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,469
- No shit! Is this you two?
- Yeah.

122
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,137
Look at that.

123
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,106
Lighter works.

- You must have been adopted.

126
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,954
Thank you, Loomis.

127
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,417
- So he was a real gamer, huh?
- Yeah.

128
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,255
- Any good titles in the bag?
- I'm not sure. Check it out.

Yeah, that was the game
he was playing out the night he died.

132
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,038
He asked me to come over and play.
I totally blew him off.

133
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,246

- I know. It's just...

134
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,944
- How'd he get his hands on it?
- He did some beta-testing.

135
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,548
I beta-tested for a while. It's awesome
at first, then it's goddamn monotonous.

136
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:11,053
- Let's burn a round for Loomis.
- Are you an idiot?

137
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,221
I told you, that'd be weird.
That was the last thing he was doing.

138
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,488
Hey, sack up, bro.

139
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:24,698
If Loomis was indeed testing this game,
that means it is barely legal.

140
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,904
Yeah, this could be nice.

Why, yes, I'd love to come in.
Thank you for asking.

Thanks, man.
Look, it's all good. No worries.

you'd like to tell me?

156
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:35,001
Hey, you made it.
October, fellas, this is Abigail.

157
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,777
She's kind of a friend of Loomis's.
She's gonna hang out for a while.

158
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,470
- What's up, mama?
- What's up? I gotta pee.

159
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,843
- Oh, yeah. It's right down the hallway.
- Oh, sorry.

160
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,509
- All right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

161
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,287
Girl has got body karate going on.

162
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,922
Anyone who says size doesn't matter
never played a third-person shooter.

163
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,624
You're a whore.

164
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,797
- Here.
- No.

165
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,800
- What did you say?
- <i>(Abigail)</i> Hey.

166

God, that thing is gay.
And it smells.

00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:16,571
- Don't worry, I'll get your back.
- Sweet Sebastian Bach, I wanna play.

00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,173
- Bossman hooking up?
- Miller, you signed in? You there?

00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,578
Yeah, I'm here.

170
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,155
Yeah, Loretta called my wife, told her
I got caught up in a partner meeting.

171
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:29,317
All right, guys. Enough chatter.

Maybe you're supposed to read
that prayer right there.

- Just a thought.
- Voice-activated? No way.

- What?
- It's... it's like a séance or...

foreplay? I wanna butter this muffin.

Right. It'll give us a chance

Undead can't cross

That is what you learn when you read

Are you in those tunnels again? There is
no action there. The doors are locked.

- I'm telling you, my controller is vibrating.
- You'd better drop a rose.

Now I'm out of... I'm out of...
I'm out of goddamn roses, man.

253
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:04,355
- Tell us what you see before you book it.
- Some sort of sick torture room or...

254
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:13,300
God, man.
I just saw a flash of dead girls, or...

Goddammit, man.

256
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,001
- She got me.
- <i>(Abigail) One of the girls?</i>

257
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:27,583
Some woman, man. I think it was the dame
from the painting. You know, that countess.

258
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,448
I didn't even
get a chance to fight her, man.

259
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,021
- Where's the torture chamber?
- I went through a secret entrance.

260
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,154
Hey, are you gonna try
and get back in the game?

261
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,656
Well...

262
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,632
Hey, is somebody out there?

263
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,063
- <i>(Hutch) Miller. Who are you talking to?</i>
- I don't know.

264
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:51,843
Probably some goddamn rent-a-cop
trying to scare the shit out of the living.

265
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:54,306
You know what they say. You play
the game too long, you start seeing shit.

266
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,514
- You know, or have seizures.
- <i>(Swink) Games could cause seizures.</i>

267
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:02,582
Perceptive reality, on the other hand,
has yielded some interesting studies.

268
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,446
- <i>(Phin)</i> And you've read them all.
- I have. It seems the longer you play,

269
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:08,151
the more your mind
perceives the game world to be a reality.

270
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:13,965
It's interesting, but it's only a theory.
But then there's retinal memory, which...

271
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,963
That is so fascinating, sweetie,
but I'm feeling like we should call it a night.

272
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,803
Yeah, some of us

<i>Miller. You can rejoin us. Then.</i>

00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,334
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll check my schedule.

- Get off me.
- All right, buddy. Come on. Come on.

301
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,092
Thanks.

302
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:45,639
I know this kind of thing ain't easy, son.
I'm gonna try to be quick about it.

303
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,711
You were here
with Mr. Banks last night?

304
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,613
Uh, no. I was at my house.
We were playing a video game.

305
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,941
Oh.

306
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:57,215
His wife said that he was working late.

307
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:04,788
Yeah, sorry. What I meant was, he was
playing from here and I was at my place.

308
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:08,099
- Just the two of you?
- I was with four friends. We were online.

309
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,496
Uh-huh.

310
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,636
- Make sure we get those names.
- Roger that.

311
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,404
- Do you live close by?
- Yeah, uptown. Off Magazine.

312
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:19,066
Oh, yeah?
That's only ten minutes away.

313
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,737
Those figures could place you
at the scene of the crime.

314
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,715
Charlie, chill.

315
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:31,145
- I just wanna know what happened to him.
- All right, now.

316
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,385
OK, if you ever need to give me a call,

317
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,953
my name is Detective Thibodeaux.

318
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,790
I may need to speak with you again.

319
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:43,501
And I'm sorry about your friend.

320
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,436
Thanks.

321
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,044
All right.

322
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,247
Sweet shit! Get a load of this!

323
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,957
I think I've found bossman's body.

324
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,592
- Oh, God!
- That's off-putting.

325
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,869
- Didn't you just say Miller was stabbed?
- Man, I can't look at this.

326
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,830
I'll have to quit
hanging around with you.

327
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,799
I'm sorry. Phin, if you had any less sense,
you'd be half a penny.

328
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,534
Now shut the goddamn game up.

329
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,977
- Because we found Miller's body in it?
- It is a horror survival game.

330
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,808
I hate to be a dick, but I think
you guys are overreacting a little bit.

331
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,915
- Would you show some respect, man?
- Respect?

332
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,522
You pay respect to gamers by gaming,
so let's boot it up. To Miller.

333
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:45,187
- You're not playing for Miller or Loomis.
- You didn't even know those guys, right?

334
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:50,230
If you wanna curl up in the fetal position
for the day, fine, but don't expect me to.

335
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,895
As for you,
I just met you yesterday, so kiss my ass.

336
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,359
- Phin!
- What?

337
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:01,004
Look, why don't you guys get out of here
and let me play in peace?

338
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,608
Peace.

339
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,256
Hey, take it easy.

340
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,920
I'm sorry.

341
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,865
Are you OK?

342
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:25,437
- I'm just having a hard time, you know?
- Yeah.

343
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,204
Abigail, what's your story?
We don't know much about you,

344
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,700
other than you can't game for shit.

345
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:34,838
Well, I grew up in Georgia.

346
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:40,308
My dad's an architect and my mom's
a kindergarten schoolteacher.

347
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,874
I'm going to Princeton in the fall.

348
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,943
Sounds like you've got
a perfect little family.

349
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,649
I don't know about perfect.

350
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,717
- Uh...
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

351
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,752
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

352
00:28:55,534 --> 00:29:00,528
I've got a thing with fire.
It's a long story. No big deal.

353
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,296
What's up?

354
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:07,211
Finding Miller's body in the game...

355
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:14,545
Look, I'm no gamer, but there are only so
many ways you could die in a video game.

356
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,319
It's all just really bad timing.

357
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:21,522
Not really. In a sense, the timing is bad
because he overresponds to deaths.

358
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:28,064
But the coincidence of finding Miller's
game body and his real body was perfect.

359
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,753
That's why we're freaked out.

360
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,869
It's better in single player anyway.

361
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,635
Dickheads.

362
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,109
All right, Countess, let's go.

363
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,076
There you are.
Oh, you hate mirrors. I forgot.

364
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:50,621
- You can't break this one.
- <i>(horse neighs)</i>

365
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:54,355
Maybe timing had nothing to do with it.
Maybe it was inevitable.

366
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,927
Possible homicidal replication
on a sociopathic level.

367
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,922
Where are you going?

368
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:06,598
Loomis and his friends were playing that
video game the night they died. Now Miller.

369
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,070
What are the chances of all of them being
murdered right after playing that game?

370
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,200
Jesus, if Phineus is playing...

371
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,870
- Come on, honey. You've gotta relax.
- It's just bad timing.

372
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,870
Swink said
maybe timing has nothing to do with it.

373
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:27,017
Did I say that? I have a penchant
for big theories. Don't listen to me.

374
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,092
Phineus!
Phin! Oh, my God!

375
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:39,998
- What are you doing, man?
- I'm pulling this bitch. What's it look like?

376
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,495
- What if Loomis and Miller...
- Was more than a coincidence?

377
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,533
They both played the game
and then they died, so...

378
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,072
obviously the video game
killed them, right?

379
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,442
- Are you serious, man? Listen to yourself.
- Phin.

380
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,684
I was ready to bite it anyway.
Check this mirror I found.

381
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:57,520
I flipped it. The back works like a mirror,
but it won't break like the others.

382
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:05,991
I think it's made out of polished silver.
I don't know. You guys don't have one.

383
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:12,798
You've been through a lot and I love you,
but you're freaking everybody out now.

384
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,572
I know. Yeah.

385
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,341
Nice.

386
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,470
<i>(horse neighs)</i>

387
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,279
<i>(screeching)</i>

388
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,273
<i>(truck horn)</i>

389
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:04,310
"No distinguishing marks."

390
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,398
Had a broken banister.

391
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,320
"Adjoined twin blades."

392
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,664
<i>(rumbling)</i>

393
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,543
This is why I'm missing
my G4techTV weekend wrap-up?

394
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:07,938
Hot sugar.
We had this conversation.

395
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:14,414
Call me crazy, call me paranoid,
I don't give a shit. Just look at this.

396
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,683
- Why isn't Phineus showing?
- He said he'd be here, so he'll be here.

397
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,850
OK. So we all saw
that Miller was stabbed to death.

398
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,183
The cops think he was stabbed
with shears. Loomis's friends too.

399
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,460
Sarah - her body was drained of blood.

400
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,433
The police report said Loomis's neck
was broken, and he was hung in the game.

401
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,570
They all died
the same way they died in the game.

402
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,499
This can't just be some coincidence.

403
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,206
I don't like this at all.

404
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,441
I think you're right.

405
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:50,647
You know I told you I heard
the story of Gerouge from my grandma?

406
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,454
This Elizabeth Bathory chick
was sick and twisted - and very real.

407
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:00,394
Guys, every detail of this game
is based on her real life.

408
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:04,597
The tower,
the cemetery, the torture chamber.

409
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,728
She'd hunt for victims in a black carriage.

410
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:10,799
She'd gut them with silver shears. The
shattered mirrors, why were they broken?

411
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,474
She couldn't stand to see herself get old.
All facts.

412
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,175
All I care about is finding out
what happened to Miller and Loomis,

413
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,273
and you are not helping.

414
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:23,384
As punishment, they walled the bitch up
in her tower alive - and here's the kicker.

415
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:29,521
The last thing she said
was that one day she'd be back.

416
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,129
So what if she's back and killing us
one by one after we die in the game?

417
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,091
This is insane. Listen to yourself.

418
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:39,897
You don't want to listen to me, fine. All
I care about is: Where the hell is Phineus?

419
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:51,514
<i>(sings along to stereo)</i> # Close your eyes,
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams

in my sweet dreams

421
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,027

Phin, are you OK?

425
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,759
- <i>Yeah. I'm awesome.</i>
- Phin, it's Hutch. Where are you?

426
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,730
I was on my way,
but my whip got stuck out on River Road.

427
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,399
- I'm just south of Binky's Adult Store.
- I'll drive.

428
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,139
- Who's that? Abigail?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

- What's up, mama?
- <i>What's up?</i>

430
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:54,610
Swink, when you were talking
about perceptive reality,

431
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,681
were you talking about
hearing or seeing things, or both?

432
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,615
<i>Both. It's bizarre.</i>
<i>Retinally speaking...</i>

433
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:07,686
Shut up. I've not tripped out like this
since I ate that matzo ball at Bible camp.

<i>We're coming to get you.</i>

<i>I'll be right there.</i>

00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,203
Stop, stop, stop. Stop! Wait.

449
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,843
Phin!

450
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,990
Phin. <i>(sobs)</i>

451
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,061
<i>(sirens)</i>

452
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:07,337
Jesus. Phineus died
exactly the same way he died in the game.

453
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,348
Need to tell me something?

454
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,412
This is...

455
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,053
This is gonna sound crazy,

456
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,356
but this game, <i>Stay Alive,</i>

457
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,824
is about the Gerouge Plantation

458
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,922
and a woman, Elizabeth Bathory.

459
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:33,794
- I think I know that ghost story, yeah.
- OK. Phineus was run over in the game.

460
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,035
Miller died the same way
he died in the game too.

461
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:40,537
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, kid.
- I got this game last week from a friend.

462
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:43,510
Him and two of his friends were murdered
the same way they died in the game.

463
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,738
Now, explain that.

464
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,685
Right.

465
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,847
That's the Crowley case,
over in Church Point.

466
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:56,383
You lived with that family, right?
After what happened with your folks?

467
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,284
Yeah.

468
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,929
You talked to that Crowley kid
the night he was murdered?

469
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,699
You know I did, Detective.

470
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:10,837
- Technically, anybody can hack into...
- <i>(Thibodeaux)</i> Shut up.

471
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,767
Let's take a walk.

472
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,836
- Let's see why you're so scared.
- I don't think...

473
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,742
Shut up.

474
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,951
- How do you do this thing?
- You have to read that.

475
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,377
All right.

476
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,515
"Come to me, clouds.
May you rise as..."

477
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,857
There must be a connection.

478
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:32,160
- Oh, yeah, there is, Hutch.
- Look, I already told you...

479
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:35,889
I'm telling you.
Friend or no friend, game or no game,

480
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,335
next time I see you on a crime scene,
I'm gonna take you in.

481
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,405
I wonder how you would feel
if that was your friend.

482
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,770
- Someone you cared about, Detective.
- I would let the cops do their job.

483
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:45,699
Hey!

484
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:48,403
Hey, don't play that game.

485
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:51,079
Hey! Come on! Come on.

486
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,481
I just think
it would be better if no one plays.

487
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,885
I can see, at your tender age,
something like this might scare you.

488
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,681
- Come on. Come on.
- I got it.

489
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,255
All right.

490
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:10,497
I'm gonna look into this,
but you're gonna have to go home, Hutch.

491
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,829
Why don't you lock that kid up?

492
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,262
He rode up on a carriage
and mowed down the girl's brother?

493
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,470
This game business
sounds like bullshit.

494
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,503
<i>(Swink)</i> That's great.
That's just really stupendous.

495
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,842
I know it! We all know it!
Something's happening, something bad!

496
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:27,249
Swink, shut the hell up!

497
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:34,520
You're not helping, man.

498
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:46,662
Why did you have to bring that game
into our lives, Hutch?

499
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,935
Why?

500
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,364
October.

501
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:55,978
My brother was all that I had.

502
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,352
That kid meant everything to me,
and now he's gone.

503
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,890
October...

504
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,496
I didn't know.

505
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,504
I didn't know. I'm so sorry.

506
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,950
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.

507
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,984
Neither do I.

508
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,953
So we have to do something.

509
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:50,164
Hutch, I want you to find out
everything you can about this game.

510
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,702
OK. I can start with Loomis's house.

511
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,901
I need to stay with Swink
and take care of things for Phin.

512
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,399
Are you OK?
Are you sure you're up to this?

513
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:05,845
Hutch, somebody ran my brother down
in a horse-drawn carriage.

514
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:07,606
I'm gonna find whoever did it
and hurt them.

515
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,409
OK.

516
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,284
Abigail, stay with Hutch.
But if anything happens to him...

517
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,322
And we don't play that game,
not for a second.

518
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,356
Hey, a little help here?

519
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,493
Let me guess.
Your wife and kids are driving you nuts.

520
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:29,766
Need something to take the edge off?
Something with a high frag-count.

521
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:33,605
- Do I look 12, man?
- I take it you don't play, then.

522
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:36,577
I retired after I won
the Greater Louisiana <i>Q *bert</i> tournament.

523
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,281
- Oh, <i>Q *bert,</i> huh? Great.
- Yeah, listen.

524
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:42,077
I need information
on a horror game called <i>Stay Alive.</i>

525
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,787
<i>Stay Alive?</i> Never heard of it.

526
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,181
Maybe it's underground.

527
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:50,420
- Do you know who made it?
- Some basehead in his mom's attic.

528
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:56,233
You know, a game is just an extension
of the mind that created it.

529
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:56,800
You wouldn't play a game
by Charlie Manson.

530
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,728
No. Probably not.

531
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,368
Maybe you already have.

532
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,697
<i>(phone rings)</i>

533
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,765
Yeah. Yeah, I got nothing.

534
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:13,144
It's probably some sort of
underground game or something.

535
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,917
Yeah, right.
Hey, so, listen,

536
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,790
I'll talk to you in a little bit,
all right?

537
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,656
<i>(rumbling)</i>

538
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:27,124
<i>(screams)</i>

539
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:31,525
She must have left
at least one of these windows open.

540
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:37,002
- How do you know that?
- I lived with the Crowleys for a while.

541
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:37,798
Oh, yeah.

542
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,079
Yeah, it was like, you know,
Loomis's house just felt like home.

543
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:53,154
Yeah, I used to kinda run here
when things got, you know...

544
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:54,049
- You don't have to talk about it.
- No.

545
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,521
My dad went a little nuts,

546
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,462
thought my mom was sleeping around,
which she wasn't.

547
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:07,694
He figured
if she wasn't gonna be with him,

548
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,967
she wouldn't be with anybody,

549
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:11,603
so he set the place on fire.

550
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,573
Just torched it.

551
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:20,617
The firemen barely got me out alive,
but my mom...

552
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,620
She was still in bed
when they found her.

553
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:31,859
I tell myself if I'd been a little older
or a little braver,

554
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,657
I would've...

555
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:34,263
I would've stopped him.

556
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,925
I didn't move.

557
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:39,600
When he gets out, he'll be 76.

558
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,328
Ain't nothing like family.

559
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,668
This window's open.

560
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,437
So that's why you're scared of fire?

561
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:52,316
That's why I hate fire.

562
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:24,581
- I'll go around to the front door, OK?
- OK.

563
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:26,110
Come on.
Come on, come on.

564
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,616
Let's check out Loomis's room.

565
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:37,625
<i>(Abigail)</i> What could we find in here
that the cops haven't already found?

566
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,128
They didn't know where to look.

567
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:49,067
- Huh.
- What?

568
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,397
What is it?

569
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:55,604
<i>(Hutch)</i> It's the game company
Loomis tested for, where he got the game.

570
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:56,713
Scary.

571
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:05,782
I found the address for the game company.
Tell me where 1420 Cypress Road is.

572
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:04,846
Not a problem.

573
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:12,392
Let's see. Take the Belle Chasse Highway
to Breaux Bridge, near Spanish Lake.

574
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:12,562
Look, we're heading
to the game developer.

575
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,931
I've been reading this book
called <i>The Malleus Demonium.</i>

576
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,068
- <i>(Hutch) What?</i>
- It means "the witches' hammer."

577
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:23,405
It was a handbook for witch hunters
in the Inquisition. It says if we find her,

578
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:28,535
we need to put three nails through
her heart, neck, and then forehead.

579
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:30,080
The nails are gonna put
her human spirit back into her body,

580
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:33,173
and then - this is really,
really important, you guys -

581
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,446
"An undead soul is only cleansed
by burning its blood."

582
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,249
So you think her ghost
could've been brought back?

583
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:49,590
It's like a séance. A strong enough spirit
can be brought back with the proper text.

584
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,990
I just can't believe this.

585
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,864
<i>Detective Charles King</i>
<i>was murdered today at Clearwater Mall.</i>

586
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,365
October?

587
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,701
<i>Sources say</i>
<i>this murder may be linked...</i>

588
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:00,272
Oh, my God!
The cop, King, he's dead.

589
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,206
What?

590
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:06,378
- We've got another problem.
- <i>(siren)</i>

591
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,551
Oh, God. The police are here.

592
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:10,879
OK, OK. Meet us at Loomis's.

593
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,349
- <i>(Swink)</i> Loomis's?
- He's right.

594
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,322
- If you don't wanna go to jail, go now.
- Jail?

595
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,662
Now! Come on!

596
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,867
<i>(October)</i> Give it to me.

597
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:34,167
<i>(loads gun)</i>

598
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,310
Toss the apartment.

599
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:48,784
What have we got?

600
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,419
- You remember her diary?
- <i>(Abigail)</i> Her diary?

601
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:54,258
Yeah, in the game.

602
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,961
- What if that's it?
- What?

603
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:03,339
- The proper text.
- That would mean that...

604
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:02,934
This is not about some ghost.

605
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,943
You expect me to believe we conjured up
her evil spirit with a game séance?

606
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:17,448
- To start, we all had to recite that prayer.
- That just... It's highly unlikely.

607
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:17,653
What is it, Swink?

608
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,154
October and I were talking about this.
I don't know. Maybe she's onto something.

609
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,253
- Why is the game on?
- What?

610
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,286
The game.

611
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:29,164
I didn't turn it on.

612
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:33,135
I told you not to play.

613
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:01,955
- Where's October?
- <i>(Swink)</i> She's out smoking.

614
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:08,230
But you said if we didn't play the game
we'd be fine. I thought those were the rules.

615
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,302
I don't know what the rules are.
Maybe there aren't any.

616
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,303
October!

617
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:13,337
It's not possible.
I didn't play. None of us did.

618
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,060
- If nobody played the game, that means...
- The game's playing by itself.

You're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK.

I can fix this. I can fix this. No, no, no, no.

642
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:23,567
Goddammit!
Please, don't do this to me!

643
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:32,437
- I shouldn't have left her alone.
- This isn't your fault, Swink.

644
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:34,137
This is all my fault.

645
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:38,470
You should've left
when you had the chance.

646
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,846
Your life was perfect before this.

647
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,654
My dad's not an architect.

648
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:47,415
- What?
- My dad's not an architect.

649
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:52,092
My mom doesn't teach first grade.

650
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:59,365
- You mean kindergarten?
- Whatever. I'm not heading to Princeton.

651
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:00,936
Pretty much
everything I said was bullshit.

652
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,236
- So this van is...
- Home sweet home.

653
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:21,282
I hate telling people the truth and
watching them get embarrassed for asking.

654
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,581
We gotta end this.

655
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:22,582
We gotta stop it.

656
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:31,266
- I don't think we have much time.
- You're right. We don't have a lot of time.

657
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,627
We need to find her body.

658
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,092
Which means
we need to find her tower.

659
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:39,436
Whoever made this game
knows everything about Elizabeth Bathory.

660
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:49,610
They're the ones who are gonna know
exactly where her plantation really is.

661
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,349
Hey! Swink, what are you doing?

662
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,951
It's obvious we have to stay alive
in the game until we end this.

663
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,152
- One of us has to play.
- If you die in the game...

664
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,226
Something won't let us stop playing.
Am I right?

665
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:03,726
If it's gonna play with or without us,
at least I can use myself as a decoy.

666
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,224
I can protect us.

667
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,542
Let's go.

668
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:42,802
- All right, buddy, you know what to do.
- Stay alive.

669
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,609
Game time.

670
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:58,881

Tell me you haven't died in the game.

- No, we're fine.
- The place is deserted.

- I'm not really sure where that is.

- <i>Some kind of parlor.</i>

What's going on, Swink?
How do you know all this?

00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:50,853
Just pay attention. All right, go through
the kitchen and out the back door.
