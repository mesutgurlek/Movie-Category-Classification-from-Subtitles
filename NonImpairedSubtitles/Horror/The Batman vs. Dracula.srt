1
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,647
B-7

2
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,403
G-46

3
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,170
Before the cops nabbed me, I stashed cash.

4
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:32,910
Millions.

5
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,808
Hey! Sit down!

6
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:37,142
Did you hear me? Millions!

7
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:39,761
Can't you see I'm on a roll here?

8
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,576
Come on, Penguin. Hear me out!

9
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:44,164
Ahem!

10
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:48,481
Bingo! Hur..

11
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:56,137
N-17

12
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,540
It was thirty years in the slammer and

13
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:59,103
ten here in Arkham.
(Bingo!)

14
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,310
But the fact is,

15
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:04,000
I cannot take one more day in the cuckoo's nest.

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,370
I am willing to split the take 50-50,

17
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,144
if, you can get us out of here.

18
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,000
And where might we retrieve our little nest egg?

19
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:19,047
Gotham Cemetary, north end.

20
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,300
The crypt behind the tombstone with the cross.

21
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:25,600
But I think I'll keep more specific directions

22
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,772
to myself until we get there.

23
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:28,809
Together.

24
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,588
You don't have to worry about trusting me, old pal.

25
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,289
I'm as dependable as the dodo.

26
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:37,162
I knew you were rock solid, Penguin.

27
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,141
Not like that other guy.

28
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:41,900
You told someone else?

29
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,800
Well, first I went to the only one who's escaped

30
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,010
from here more times than you.

31
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,717
Who?

32
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:47,526
Take it easy!

33
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,350
I don't think he got what I was telling him.

34
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,573
Who, who, who??

35
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,700
I mean, talk about having a real screw loose, right?

36
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,523
You told him?

37
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,317
Joker! He's escaped!

38
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,439
Goodbye Arkham,

39
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:14,953
hello, Gotham!

40
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:24,554
That crook loop's got the step on me!

41
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,900
Come on, come on!

42
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,571
That means you!

43
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,756
Ooh, it's Joker!

44
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:32,257
Where?

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,397
Bingo.

46
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,351
Tweet, tweet.

47
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,548
Penguin, you old featherbrain.

48
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,000
What brings you out of Arkham?

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,747
Same as you, clowny.

50
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:45,300
But I think we can save each other a whole lot of

51
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,300
trouble if we agree to split the take.

52
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,432
See your point.

53
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,606
Partners?

54
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,972
My, Pengy. You really know how to shake!

55
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,752
Instant karma, Joker.

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,128
Don't get caught in the rain without your straitjacket.

57
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,963
Batsy, you're such a card.

58
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,402
Gotham Cemetary.

59
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
A casket, a casket

60
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,746
which crypt's got the money casket?

61
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,300
No sign.

62
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,106
Tombstone with a cross,

63
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:33,800
tombstone with a...

64
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,461
Catch!

65
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,710
Give it up.

66
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,428
This time I'm out for bloody, Batsy.

67
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,300
It's behind the cross.

68
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,083
This must be the place.

69
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,111
I'll take what's behind door number 1.

70
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,900
Whoa.

71
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,000
Like that will stop me.

72
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:49,122
Show me the money.

73
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,146
I'm bleeding!

74
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,432
This isn't paydirt, it's just dirt!

75
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,355
Where is that loot?!

76
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,852
What's that?

77
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,208
Show's over.

78
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,363
The show must go on.

79
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,508
You wouldn't leave your pal hanging,
now would you?

80
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,400
Almost had you!

81
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,512
Bye bye, Batsy!

82
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,306
Hey! Cemetary's closed!

83
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:07,581
That will do.

84
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,555
Looks like I'm the main course.

85
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
Dead guys don't do that!

86
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:46,216
Not dead. Undead.

87
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,562
I think I need to unwet my pants.

88
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,800
I will require a human servant.

89
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,606
A sentinel to guard my coffin while I sleep.

90
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,954
You.

91
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,600
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

92
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,024
I'll have you know, Sir,

93
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
I am a Cobblepot.

94
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,173
And Cobblepots do not serve.

95
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,722
I'm Penguin, I'll be your server.

96
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,800
I shall darn that straight away, Sir.

97
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,623
Sir? You are brooding.

98
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,336
More so than usual.

99
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,112
Alfred.

100
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:07,731
Tonight, Joker met his demise.

101
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,100
And our old friend, Cobblepot?

102
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:16,647
Penguin's trail went completely cold.

103
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,235
I have been at rest for quite some time.

104
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,696
Transylvania has changed.

105
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, O Dark One,

106
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,816
you're not in Transylvania anymore.

107
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:33,535
This is Gotham City.

108
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,400
Then if I am no longer in Transylvania,
near my castle,

109
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,000
it must be due to forces outside my control.

110
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,766
Events which occurred, following my death.

111
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,600
It seems, after I was vanquished,

112
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,061
my remains were relocated, far from Transylvania.

113
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,155
Very well.

114
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,723
Now take me on a tour of this Gotham,
native guide.

115
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,539
The night is young, and still I thirst.

116
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Wayne Industries feels an obligation

117
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,100
to remain committed to socially responsible programs.

118
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
A prime example would be

119
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,600
our work in the field of alternative energy sources.

120
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,000
Amazing.

121
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,650
Well, I like to think we're just doing our part.

122
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,110
I mean, you've been here nearly 40 minutes

123
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,913
and haven't bolted for the door.

124
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,800
My work sometimes calls me away.

125
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,700
Well Bruce,

126
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm sure you can imagine

127
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,500
how four false starts at an interview

128
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,200
might make a reporter feel rejected.

129
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,900
Now I have a question for you, Vicki.

130
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,672
Shoot.

131
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,674
Where's your camera man?

132
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,710
I, uh, gave him the day off.

133
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:09,200
Figured that way,

134
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
Gotham TV News might have a better shot

135
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,700
at getting to know the real Bruce Wayne.

136
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,400
Gotham TV News, or

137
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,000
Vicki Vale?

138
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
Well, I'm not the one who

139
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
picked a restaurant with such a beautiful view.

140
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,600
I'm sorry, Vicki.

141
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,850
Would you believe,

142
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,383
I have to wrap this up.

143
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,700
That was professional, Vale.

144
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,160
No it's, it's not that.

145
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:40,800
I still have a ton of things
to prepare for the energy expo

146
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,700
at the mansion tomorrow night.
Why don't you come?

147
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,875
But my story airs tomorrow morning.

148
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:49,419
I meant as my date.

149
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,679
The tally of missing persons

150
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,360
has spiked dramatically in Gotham this past week.

151
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,800
With the Gotham PD no closer
to uncovering who or what

152
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,200
might be behind the mysterious
disappearances of these "Lost Ones",

153
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,000
a cloud of fear hangs over our city.

154
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,943
Gotham PD aren't the only ones who're baffled.

155
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,700
Might the missing Penguin be behind this?

156
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,000
No ransom demands, not his style.

157
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,700
And speaking of news,

158
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,858
how was your dinner with the lovely Vicki Vale?

159
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,800
Short, but sweet.

160
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,411
I invited her to the expo tomorrow night. And,

161
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:32,910
to dinner here, Saturday.

162
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,498
To think I was beginning to fear

163
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:36,624
you prefered the company of archvillains.

164
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,148
On that note,

165
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:41,857
let's see if tonight turns up

166
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:44,500
Penguin or any of these Lost Ones.

167
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,900
I lost Joker,

168
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm not going to lose anyone else on my watch.

169
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,500
My purse!

170
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:42,400
A rent-a-cop?

171
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,182
Whoa!

172
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,878
Oh thank goodness.

173
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,542
Guess I'm not needed.

174
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:09,050
Did you find my bag?

175
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,636
A man who dresses like a bat.

176
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,100
Oh phsaw.

177
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,900
The Batman may look the look,

178
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,523
but he has none of your mojo.

179
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,000
I am nonetheless intrigued.

180
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,928
My legacy has been quite influencial.

181
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,803
Vampires, Master Bruce?

182
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:24,500
Are you certain

183
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,904
you're not suffering from sleep deprivation?

184
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:28,900
I don't want to believe it either, Alfred.

185
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,376
But I know what I saw.

186
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,830
Fangs.

187
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,259
Poppycock.

188
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:35,826
Easily purchased at any halloween superstore.

189
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:38,227
It wasn't just the teeth.

190
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,227
The way they moved, their eyes.

191
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,200
They weren't human.

192
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,700
Yes. Well, might I remind you

193
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,263
before one urban legend

194
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,203
becomes too obsessed with another,

195
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,100
you are hosting the Wayne Industries

196
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,061
energy expo here, tonight.

197
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,800
With the ravishing Vicki Vale on your arm.

198
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,314
Time for my master to rise and shine.

199
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Wakey-wake, it's nighty-night!

200
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,021
You have places to be, people to bite.

201
00:24:33,528 --> 00:24:38,500
Those bloodshakes really work wonders
for your complexion.

202
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,315
Rise, my children of the night.

203
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:44,730
We shall take Gotham, human by human.

204
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:47,500
Until our blood flows through its canals,

205
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:54,085
transfiguring it into the city of the undead.

206
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,672
As you execute my dark purpose,

207
00:24:56,712 --> 00:25:02,017
I shall stake my claim among Gotham's elite.

208
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Well if you're looking to be numero uno

209
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,615
of the rich and famous,

210
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:09,834
there's one bird you'll have to knock off its perch.

211
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,100
You there,

212
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,800
more napkins at the buffet.

213
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,467
You, attend to the spill in the study.

214
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:56,609
And you, Stipes,

215
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:59,100
I realise this assignment may not be

216
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,965
as big a priority to you as catching your next wave,

217
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,878
but would you mind tucking in your shirt?

218
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,443
Dude, come on, chill.

219
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,522
Caviar chills.

220
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:11,400
Alfred Pennyworth, serving captain,

221
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,969
does nothing of the sort.

222
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,589
Truly magnificent.

223
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:31,499
Oh, my necklace?

224
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,199
It's a family heirloom.

225
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,309
And you are?

226
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:39,553
Alucard. Doctor Alucard.

227
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:41,029
Bruce Wayne.

228
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:43,014
I don't believe we've met.

229
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:44,436
I am new to Gotham,

230
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:47,306
a recent transport from Eastern Europe.

231
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:49,280
Really? What line of work are you in?

232
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:51,013
Cultural anthropology.

233
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,813
I am here to study your city's Batman.

234
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:56,700
Our city's?

235
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,368
You mean to tell me Budapest has a Dark Knight too?

236
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:02,106
Rare instances have been documented

237
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:04,977
of a man who assumes the likeness of a bat,

238
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:08,404
in societies ancient as well as modern.

239
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,893
And I believe,

240
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,631
that while instilling fear by night,

241
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:18,679
these beings cloak themselves as
normal members of society.

242
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:20,220
Fascinating theory.

243
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,100
Bats are fascinating creatures.

244
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,459
As are you, Doctor.

245
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:29,104
If you'll excuse us, we've got to circulate.

246
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,377
Hmm, seems you've picked up
that he's my type, huh?

247
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,500
Tall, dark, and weird?

248
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,300
We spoke of my work, what of yours?

249
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,398
Research and development.

250
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,946
For instance, the Wayne Industries' SL5.

251
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:48,095
It's the most efficient technology to date

252
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,500
for collecting solar energy,
and storing it as true sunlight.

253
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,500
It's about time science did something
positive with the sun.

254
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,931
Hors d'oeuvres?

255
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,535
Beef steak tartare, exquisite.

256
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,704
I prefer my meat cooked.

257
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:17,667
Some garlic shrimp?

258
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,103
But you must, it really packs a punch.

259
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,600
Please excuse me,

260
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,384
I must find something with which to wash this down.

261
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:44,160
Bruce? Are you alright?

262
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,703
I'll be right back.

263
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:48,220
There's something I need to attend to.

264
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,600
Master Bruce.

265
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,131
I know the night is terribly alluring to you,

266
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:23,952
but Miss Vale is waiting for you.

267
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:29,400
Sir! Is everything alright?

268
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,225
Alfred?

269
00:29:30,857 --> 00:29:33,758
I don't remember how I got out here.

270
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,789
Alucard.

271
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:41,110
Sir?

272
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,093
Master Bruce?

273
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,392
You freaked me out.

274
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,280
Looking for some munchies?

275
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:23,766
You there. Circulate!

276
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,235
Empty-handed?

277
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,954
This time I am out for blood.

278
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,450
Stipes! Mister Stipes.

279
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,200
Now what is wrong with this picture?

280
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,400
Correct. No cheese platter.

281
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,300
Which means you are headed the wrong way.

282
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,500
And look at yourself.

283
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,509
Was I not clear the first... Oh dear.

284
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,708
Oh, leaving before desert?

285
00:31:00,836 --> 00:31:02,470
I have had my fill.

286
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,104
Though not of you.

287
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:06,591
When might I see you again?

288
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,750
Tomorrow morning.

289
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,854
On Gotham TV News.

290
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,072
Phew. Dodged that bullet.

291
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,456
Sorry Vicki, I'll be right back.

292
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:33,687
Master Bruce!

293
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:36,995
The mirror, he had no reflection!

294
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:39,948
Sir, did you hear me?

295
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:43,511
Pardon me. Thanks.

296
00:31:48,218 --> 00:31:49,417
Whatever are you writing?

297
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:51,032
His name.

298
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,972
Alucard.

299
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:05,099
So it would seem

300
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:08,400
Gotham is not merely being visited by vampires-

301
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:11,234
But the king of all vampires.

302
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,841
Count Dracula.

303
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:16,667
On the bright side,

304
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:19,259
no corpses drained of blood have turned up.

305
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,034
Which means Dracula hasn't slained anyone.

306
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,087
Yet.

307
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,062
And the dark side?

308
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:27,714
If each of the lost ones in turn feeds on others-

309
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,696
Their numbers will grow exponentially.

310
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,631
Into an army of vampires.

311
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:35,906
Stopping Dracula won't be enough.

312
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:38,650
I need to rescue his victims.

313
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,410
All of them.

314
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,478
Before Gotham has a plague in its hands.

315
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:43,820
Rescue vampires, Sir?

316
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,600
Vampirism may be rooted in the supernatural,

317
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,200
but it infects blood.

318
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,950
And if it's transmitted like a disease,

319
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,200
there's a chance it can be treated.

320
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,229
We have the advantage

321
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:59,088
of the largest old-school medical library in Gotham.

322
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:01,759
Right here, under our roof.

323
00:33:02,516 --> 00:33:04,700
Yes. And it's always an honor

324
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,350
to hunt for knowledge.

325
00:33:06,371 --> 00:33:08,459
Especially when it is courtesy

326
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:10,709
of Doctor Thomas Wayne.

327
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:20,054
What is it about you that keeps me coming back?

328
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:24,806
Your boyish charm, hot bod, tons of money?

329
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:27,117
If only I were shallow.

330
00:33:28,742 --> 00:33:32,785
There's something deeper,
bubbling below your surface.

331
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,400
It's not hard to imagine

332
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,600
why you're out to save the world
with science and all your charities.

333
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,448
The question is,

334
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:42,590
when will you let someone rescue you?

335
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:51,344
Vicki Vale.

336
00:33:52,904 --> 00:33:54,353
What?

337
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:56,437
I'm on my way.

338
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:03,884
We just received exclusive
breaking news on the lost ones.

339
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:05,526
Vicki Vale is live on the scene

340
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,699
at downtown Gotham; here's her report.

341
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:08,467
Fancy that.

342
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:10,650
Two night owls on the same case.

343
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,394
You are meant for each other.

344
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:17,740
It seems Gotham PD may have new
information regarding

345
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,595
the mysterious disappearances.

346
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:22,580
Thanks to an eye witness who has this to say.

347
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,252
I saw what got the guy.

348
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:26,024
Saw it with my own two eyes.

349
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:27,800
It was a bat.

350
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,826
I saw a huge shadow of a bat-

351
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:34,846
As such, Gotham PD has concluded that perpetrator

352
00:34:34,846 --> 00:34:38,042
behind these bizarre abductions is none other than

353
00:34:38,664 --> 00:34:39,677
the Batman.

354
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:45,061
Well this could put a kink in the relationship.

355
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:55,582
It's way past your bedtime, Sir.

356
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,002
With more citizens vanishing every night,

357
00:34:58,052 --> 00:35:00,600
all we know is that the shadow of the bat

358
00:35:00,602 --> 00:35:03,600
now strikes fear not only in criminals,

359
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,230
but in the hearts of all Gothamites.

360
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:12,051
Mighty gracious of the Batman
to take all the blame for you.

361
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:13,682
Sucker!

362
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:22,786
You like? It's a plasma screen.

363
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,880
You know, as in blood?

364
00:35:28,036 --> 00:35:29,425
Oh, the girl.

365
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:34,100
You have been in the grave a long time, Master.

366
00:35:34,626 --> 00:35:37,066
Nice jugulars.

367
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:42,756
Even her name possesses a mysterious allure.

368
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:44,622
Vale.

369
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:49,515
I think it's time to seek my bride.

370
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,701
One of the first to vanish was a night watchman.

371
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,606
At Gotham Cemetary.

372
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,491
That seems as good a place as any
to catch a vampire.

373
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:08,800
And do know that the windows and doors
of Wayne Mansion are not

374
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,569
the only objects I enhanced with garlic.

375
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,445
It's him. The Batman.

376
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:33,496
Please, hurry. I don't want to be a lost one.

377
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:35,300
Attention all SWAT units.

378
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,104
We have a Batman sighting in the
vincinity of Gotham Cemetary.

379
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,799
Graveyards may not wash.

380
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:57,362
Not if vampires have an aversion to crosses.

381
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,900
So the folk tales are true.

382
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:10,900
There is another bat in Gotham.

383
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,514
Count Dracula, I presume.

384
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:18,118
A legend, you are apparently intimate with.

385
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:19,813
Don't flatter yourself.

386
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:22,335
We cast kindred shadows,

387
00:39:22,335 --> 00:39:24,101
have you not seen the news?

388
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,510
I don't harm people.

389
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,910
You have no concept of the harm

390
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:32,076
of which I am capable,
if only because I really hate

391
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:37,894
to waste a life when it can be
spent in servitude to me.

392
00:39:37,894 --> 00:39:40,300
Life, or living death?

393
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,003
To become vampire,

394
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:45,000
is to heighten all of one's senses.

395
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,400
To attain speed, strength, and immortality.

396
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,594
Dripping with garlic.

397
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,242
I shall most certainly steer clear of those.

398
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,527
Try as you may, you cannot outbat me.

399
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,224
Join me, Batman.

400
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,589
Join my legion of the undead.

401
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,221
Not interested.

402
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,387
Then I thank you for keeping my legacy alive
in my absence.

403
00:41:42,387 --> 00:41:47,743
But now there is only room
for one Batman in Gotham.

404
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,130
You spurned my offer of eternal life.

405
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,030
The next time, we do not part

406
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:17,218
until maggots feed upon your flesh.

407
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,737
Al-fred...

408
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,641
Oh dear.

409
00:43:39,155 --> 00:43:40,888
You!

410
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,510
Only a dream, Master Bruce.

411
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,982
Wish I could say the same about last night.

412
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,165
Dracula's stronger than the Batman in every way.

413
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,836
Physically, mentally.

414
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm even being swallowed up by his legend.

415
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,732
Sir?

416
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,362
The more the Batman tries to protect Gotham,

417
00:44:14,662 --> 00:44:16,862
the more Gotham fears him.

418
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:20,699
As if he were the son of Dracula.

419
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,800
Mustn't wake Master too early,

420
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,491
doesn't like the sun in his eyes.

421
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:33,218
Mustn't be late, he'll be hungry and cranky.

422
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,500
Hmm. Almost dark.

423
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,300
Huh, what?

424
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,311
You!

425
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,800
Everyone's so shocked to see me these days.

426
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,113
You, the fisherman who found me tangled in his net.

427
00:44:56,113 --> 00:45:00,925
By the way, who knew electroshock therapy
could be so invigorating?

428
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,862
But that's all water under the bridge,

429
00:45:03,062 --> 00:45:06,067
cause Joker's back from the grave.

430
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:08,828
Yeah, a lot of that going around.

431
00:45:09,324 --> 00:45:11,317
Speaking of graves, Penggy,

432
00:45:11,617 --> 00:45:14,137
might you be hiding buried treasure?

433
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:16,533
No! There's nothing in there!

434
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,656
Thought we were partners!

435
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,689
Some hideout you got here, Penggy!

436
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,300
Dripping with atmosphere.

437
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,354
I'm warning you Joker!

438
00:45:33,554 --> 00:45:36,000
There's nothing here for you!

439
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,365
Ooooh, that is one fat looking vault.

440
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,074
No, Joker!

441
00:46:02,474 --> 00:46:05,850
That's one good looking corpse.

442
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,801
Breakfast in bed, fresh squeezed.

443
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,596
You, want to give blood?

444
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,541
A break-in at the bank.

445
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:56,800
As you have more apocalyptic matters to attend to,

446
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,665
might you be leaving this one to the police?

447
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:02,079
It's a blood bank.

448
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,137
A bold finish of wild cherries, with a hint of oak.

449
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,908
Joker?

450
00:48:16,008 --> 00:48:18,410
Undead and kicking!

451
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,300
Funny, you're my second Batman tonight!

452
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,371
And you're both pains in the neck!

453
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,300
Batman, you're one dead duck!

454
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:48,695
Garlic.

455
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:50,500
Eww.

456
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:00,700
Sir?

457
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,741
Your garlic bombs did the trick.

458
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,578
We have our test subject.

459
00:50:30,412 --> 00:50:31,796
Anything, Sir?

460
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,017
Joker's not talking.

461
00:50:33,017 --> 00:50:35,401
He won't reveal Dracula's resting place,

462
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:38,944
not so long as he has vampire blood in his veins.

463
00:50:38,944 --> 00:50:41,300
Batsy!!

464
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,700
Joker has suffered a fate crueler than death.

465
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,736
I intend to bring him back to the land of the living.

466
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:50,947
With a little blood work.

467
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,900
Hey little girl. You shouldn't be out here.

468
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,900
Solar generator prepped and ready, Sir.

469
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,250
Joker's blood didn't withstand the sunlight.

470
00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:29,700
I know you're near, Batsy.

471
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,502
I can smell the precious nectar pumping
through your veins.

472
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,600
Find anything of value?

473
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,900
To be quite honest, so much vampire lore exists,

474
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,253
that it is difficult to separate fact from fiction.

475
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:56,200
Carmilla Karnstein, the bride of Count Dracula.

476
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,052
According to legend,
her bloodthirst rivalled even his own.

477
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,800
It seems they were-

478
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,600
Meant for each other?

479
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,000
If Cupid's arrow could penetrate a heart so black,

480
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,600
there may be hope for you yet, Master Bruce.

481
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,214
Miss Vale.

482
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,170
It's Saturday night.

483
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,376
The dinner!

484
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:21,100
I completely forgot with all of this
blood sucking nastiness about.

485
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:27,773
The horror! The horror!

486
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,106
Tell her I'm running late.

487
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,367
Coming!

488
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:50,337
Miss Vale. Please, do come in.

489
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,839
Why do you torment me, Batsy?

490
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,322
I thought you cared.

491
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,750
Trust me Joker, I'm trying to help you.

492
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,456
Then feed me!

493
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,500
Got ketchup?

494
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,300
The grief must continue to affect Bruce.

495
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,900
I mean, no one ever really gets over
a trauma like that.

496
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,067
Master Bruce has his outlets.

497
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,980
He must fear losing those he cares about.

498
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,172
Which would explain his difficulty
in letting people get close.

499
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,653
You have been most patient, Miss Vale.

500
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,200
Do I smell garlic?

501
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,446
Uh, that would be dinner.

502
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,207
He isn't coming, is he?

503
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,144
Thirsty. Burning up inside.

504
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,900
I can't take it anymore!

505
00:56:28,308 --> 00:56:31,705
Have mercy on a sad clown.

506
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,210
Dracula's resting place, where is it?

507
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,800
Don't you see?

508
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,515
The choice isn't mine to make.

509
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,687
I am his vessel.

510
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,730
Batsy, you complete me.

511
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,402
Stable.

512
00:57:49,388 --> 00:57:50,826
Vicki.

513
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,157
Astonishingly, she still speaks the world of you.

514
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:09,424
Lunch.

515
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,300
It's about time, Batsy.

516
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,985
You're late!

517
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,623
Taste's a little off.

518
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,924
You sure this is fresh?

519
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,700
No games, Joker.

520
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,414
Where's Dracula?

521
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,148
I'm looking at him.

522
00:58:49,243 --> 00:58:51,100
Where's Penguin?
Penguin?

523
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,628
Where's Gotham Cemetary?
Cemetary.

524
00:58:54,628 --> 00:58:56,417
Am I.. am I dreaming?

525
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:59,202
No, just insane.

526
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,654
Which is why you're going back to Arkham.

527
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,639
The cure had an interesting side effect.

528
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:11,500
It seems when vampirism leaves one's system,

529
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,335
so does the victim's memory of it.

530
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,211
Perhaps for the better, Sir.

531
00:59:16,316 --> 00:59:19,698
After all, Gotham can barely
accept the legend of the Batman.

532
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:22,990
However will they deal with the truth about Dracula?

533
00:59:23,075 --> 00:59:26,197
Hopefully that won't be an issue after tonight.

534
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,789
Dracula's holed up in Gotham Cemetary,

535
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,203
where I intend to bury him.

536
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,650
Permanently.

537
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:36,306
Begging pardon, Sir.

538
00:59:36,401 --> 00:59:39,928
You think your magic bullet may actually
destroy Dracula?

539
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,888
Dracula may walk like a man,

540
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,196
but he's a monster.

541
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,755
Wait, wait up! Wait!

542
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,800
Miss Vale.

543
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,000
Doctor Alucard.

544
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,400
Now you of all people should know better, Miss Vale.

545
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,200
Alone at night?

546
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,900
Yeah I know. The lost ones.

547
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,910
I wasn't planning on missing my train.

548
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,300
It may be some time before the next one arrives.

549
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,296
Would you like to join me? For a drink?

550
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,141
Uh, thank you, but I'm running late.

551
01:00:31,237 --> 01:00:33,510
So I'll catch a cab.

552
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,239
Have a good night, Doctor.

553
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,600
Sorry Vicki.

554
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,760
Tonight, I have a date with Dracula.

555
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:06,599
You have reached Wayne Mansion.
Please leave a message at the tone.

556
01:01:18,816 --> 01:01:22,338
Master Bruce, I know you are eager
to put an end to this reign of terror,

557
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,790
but would it not be more prudent
to wait until sunrise?

558
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,800
If you cannot guarantee your victory, Sir-

559
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,022
Gotham loses.

560
01:01:32,057 --> 01:01:33,700
I'll need every advantage.

561
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,600
And for once it is a big morning that
the Batman has ahead of him.

562
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,086
Do get some rest.

563
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,271
After returning Vicki's call.

564
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,688
She's not picking up.

565
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:55,991
Sir?

566
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,981
Vicki.

567
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,200
Hi Bruce. It's Vicki.

568
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,474
You won't believe who I just bumped into.

569
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,400
Tall dark and weird? Oh, well.

570
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,700
I was hoping you might be around to rescue me-

571
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,800
Sir, it is many hours before daybreak.

572
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,615
I think Vicki's been patient enough.

573
01:02:24,252 --> 01:02:25,713
Right then.

574
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,100
My children of the night.
Gather witness.

575
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,582
The blood wedding.

576
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,900
Vicki Vampira Vale.

577
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,700
So what do we call her? Mrs Dracula?

578
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,812
You misunderstand, Penguin.

579
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:27,000
Miss Vale lacks the bite I require in a mate.

580
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,755
Meet my true bride.

581
01:03:39,499 --> 01:03:41,960
But she's-
Ashes?

582
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,707
Carmilla suffered the fate of immolation by sunlight.

583
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,597
An almost permanent death.

584
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:55,033
Mere blood cannot repair her,
as it would have punctured her heart.

585
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,600
To resurrect my bride,

586
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,805
she must feed upon the very essence of life itself.

587
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,425
Master, take my soul.

588
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:26,398
Joker's footprints.

589
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,600
So this is how Dracula bypassed the crosses.

590
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,800
I once tapped into these long forgotten catacombs.

591
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,117
Apparently so did he.

592
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,249
An unwanted guest.

593
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:46,200
The... lost ones?

594
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,450
Where are we?

595
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,484
I don't know,
but let's get everyone out of here.

596
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,873
You dare interrupt the ceremony.

597
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:40,538
You cannot win.
No human can resist my will.

598
01:08:48,406 --> 01:08:49,950
Good boy.

599
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:52,700
Once my bride has had her fill,

600
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,942
I shall offer up your corpse as a wedding gift.

601
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,142
My bride!

602
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,299
Batman?

603
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:16,024
If my bride cannot have your soul, Vicki Vale,
I shall have your blood!

604
01:10:16,115 --> 01:10:17,711
Run!

605
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,812
Go!

606
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,312
Maybe you didn't hear,
Master's not through with you!

607
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,792
It's scarcely midnight, Batman.

608
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,536
Sunrise will not help you this time.

609
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:40,350
No need to see you, Batman, I can smell your blood.

610
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:54,542
Master Bruce is triangulating his location,
from within the catacombs?

611
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:44,941
Come here!

612
01:13:43,698 --> 01:13:46,979
I do hope this is a positive turn.

613
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,947
Count Dracula!

614
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,787
I will drain you dry,
and use your cape as a dinner napkin.

615
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,972
Oh dear.

616
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:23,932
Now where did you disappear to, my pretty?

617
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,880
Knock knock.

618
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,320
Here's Ozzy!

619
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,578
Impressive dwelling.
It shall be your tomb.

620
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,248
Bite this!

621
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:39,100
You may have cured
my human victims of their disease,

622
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:44,883
but no earthly medicine can cure
a supernatural affliction.

623
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,078
Go on, run.

624
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:09,000
I am beyond human, Batman.
I am evil incarnate. I am the prince of-

625
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,526
Darkness?

626
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,700
Rise and shine.

627
01:17:30,538 --> 01:17:34,109
You are... Bruce Wayne.

628
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,509
I'm the Batman.

629
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,323
And you're dust.

630
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:06,264
I shall sweep that into the dustbin, straightaway.

631
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:18,700
Soon Master will... drink your uh, blood and stuff-

632
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,905
What am I talking about? Huh?

633
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:27,320
Treasure!

634
01:18:27,755 --> 01:18:30,324
That's what I'm talking about!

635
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:32,724
Freeze!

636
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,714
Tonight, Gotham breathes a sigh of relief.

637
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,120
The lost ones have been found.

638
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,000
It seems Penguin was behind the bizarre plot

639
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,748
to use the hostages to recover
a missing mob treasure.

640
01:18:52,748 --> 01:18:56,700
Though details remain sketchy due to
amnesia inflicted on the hostages,

641
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,340
apparently via some sort of hypnosis.

642
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,614
But the hostages are safe and sound.

643
01:19:01,614 --> 01:19:06,039
And it now seems that the Batman was
unfairly blamed for Penguin's crimes.

644
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:11,200
So it is safe to say we can swap
his status from villain back to vigilante.

645
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,400
It was vampires I tell you, vampires!

646
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,473
With big honking fangs.

647
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:23,968
Good thing they've kept Penguin's pet
at Nest Warm back at Arkham Asylum.

648
01:19:24,436 --> 01:19:25,967
Now here's a twist.

649
01:19:25,967 --> 01:19:30,230
Instead of covering the news,
reporter Vicki Vale has become it.

650
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,317
See any vampires, Vicki?

651
01:19:34,455 --> 01:19:36,455
Just bats.

652
01:20:04,945 --> 01:20:06,945
Subtitled by Secretss.
