This is my new pet.
My dad gave him to me.

Neat! What's his name?

His name's Gizmo. Hi, Giz.

BlLLY:
Nothing! Just water!

Is it alive?

I don't know.

356
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,908
One, two, three,
four, five new ones.

I don't believe that.

All that from water?
They got wet?

Plain water.
