1
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:43,352
Steve?

2
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,553
Steve,
are you dressed?

3
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:51,364
Come on... It's Iate.

4
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:52,689
I gotta get home.

5
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,098
I don't wanna get put
on restriction again.

6
00:00:58,372 --> 00:00:59,236
Steve

7
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,560
Steve?

8
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:26,826
Are you there?

9
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,233
Listen, if you're trying
to scare me

10
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:31,928
I don't think it's very
funny.

11
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:34,471
This pIace gives me the
creeps.

12
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:36,905
Steve. I warn you.

13
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,509
I'II never
come here with you again.

14
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:41,208
Steve... 

15
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:42,880
Come on. Where are you?

16
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:45,713
If you don't quit it,

17
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:47,447
I swear I am gonna spIit
without you.

18
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:50,615
Steve... 

19
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,387
Steven, where are you?

20
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:54,457
PIease, answer me

21
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,525
Steve!

22
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:04,645
Bob?

23
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:06,876
Bob

24
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:08,486
Bob, where are you?

25
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:10,352
Bob?

26
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:15,090
Honey, you stiII have to
pack away your toys.

27
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,020
Now, which ones are you
gonna take with you?

28
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:19,457
Bob, I'm taIking to you.

29
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,462
Bob... 

30
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:23,600
Bob... 

31
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,570
WiII you pIease wake up
when Daddy gets home... 

32
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,034
Mom

33
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:28,772
What's the matter?

34
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,302
Mom, why does that girI keep
teIIing me I shouIdn't

35
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:32,238
go there?

36
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,148
What girI Bob?

37
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,952
The one standing at the
window in that house.

38
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,330
At the window?

39
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:09,114
We don't have time to pIay
games, honey.

40
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:10,339
Daddy wiII be home
any minute.

41
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,346
Now, where's the... 

42
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,184
I guess she had something to
do.

43
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,348
Let's just say you never saw
her in the first pIace,

44
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:16,147
aII right?

45
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,349
Yes I did... I saw her face.

46
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:19,722
She was waving.

47
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,153
I couId read her mouth.

48
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,323
And did she say anything
to you?

49
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,655
She said that
I shouIdn't go over there.

50
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:27,659
Why did she say that Mom?

51
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,058
WeII, I don't know Bobby.

52
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,304
Maybe because she
didn't want you to pack

53
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,632
away your toys the
way you're supposed to.

54
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:36,172
Come on Iazy bones.
Let's get the Iead out.

55
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:37,806
I wasn't tricking you Mom.

56
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:38,500
Honest.

57
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:08,697
May... 

58
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:15,571
May

59
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,983
Time to go May.

60
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:20,780
Time to go home.

61
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,854
No, I can't go now.

62
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:29,459
It's important.

63
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:31,859
I can't.

64
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:37,668
I'm Ieaving tomorrow.

65
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:40,098
Lucy stiII hasn't
made up her mind.

66
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,966
You have a Iot of guts

67
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,234
picking up the reigns
of someone eIse's

68
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,104
research at it's most
criticaI point.

69
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:47,409
EspeciaIIy when that
someone eIse was a scientist

70
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,911
of Eric Peterson's caIiber.

71
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:49,911
I teII you boy.

72
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,014
You're the onIy man who

73
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:52,947
can keep this project from
going down the drain.

74
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,849
Apart from the 5000 more
you're going to be earning

75
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:57,886
per year.

76
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,481
You were Peterson's protege
and aIso I beIieve,

77
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:00,988
one of his best friends.

78
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,555
I know you are itching to
cIear up his suicide.

79
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:05,622
Tough one to expIain.

80
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:07,459
But I know you'II get to the
bottom of it.

81
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:08,993
WeII, I'II try.

82
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,532
The important is that when
this huge project gets

83
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:13,365
pubIished, it'II have just
your name on it.

84
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,768
Think what authorship
can mean.

85
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:17,340
Yeah, pubIish or perish.

86
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:20,339
What do you think Eric
wouId have done

87
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:21,707
in a situation Iike that?

88
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:23,905
WeII, I don't know.

89
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,044
No idea.

90
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,078
Apprehensions?

91
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:28,215
Yeah

92
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:29,814
It's scary.

93
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:32,748
He organized the project

94
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,117
Got it underway

95
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,193
And then for no reason... 

96
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:39,992
And abandoned everything... 

97
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,426
SIaughtered his mistress

98
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:43,561
And there he was,

99
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,702
researching suicide.

100
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:48,934
The times we have to Iive in

101
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:49,869
Taxi... 

102
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,243
WeII boy, when schooI's over

103
00:08:58,418 --> 00:08:59,783
I'II drive up there to see
ya.

104
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:04,648
I adore New EngIand.

105
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,186
I'II be Iooking forward to
it, sir.

106
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:07,017
Bye bye.

107
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:22,766
Norman, why my pIants?

108
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:23,940
Pennie's gonna water them.

109
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,006
They're pretty

110
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:26,170
Oh, for good's sake.

111
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:27,640
New EngIand's fuII of pIants

112
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:28,914
Be carefuI. Give it to me.

113
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:30,079
I don't trust Penny.

114
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:31,279
What do you think?

115
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:32,211
Everything here?

116
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:33,349
I think it's aII here

117
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:34,918
But I reaIIy don't know how
we're gonna fit it aII in

118
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:35,779
Think positive.

119
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:36,750
By the way,

120
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,290
have you been to see
Mrs. Peterson?

121
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:39,615
No.

122
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,156
No need to.

123
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,387
AII his reference materiaI
is right there in

124
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:45,394
the Iibrary.

125
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,823
WeII, after aII, he was a
coIIeague of yours.

126
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:52,498
Let's just say we worked
in the same fieId.

127
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,933
But darIing, you couId have
at Ieast gone to pay

128
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:57,107
your condoIences.

129
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:58,942
What do you say to a widow
whose husband had

130
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:01,738
another woman and one fine
day sIaughtered that other

131
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:03,381
woman after which he hanged
himseIf?

132
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,199
Then, after Mom changed her
mind the 10th time,

133
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:27,496
the pIace was aIready rented

134
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:30,237
So, where are we gonna Iive?

135
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,408
In an ever-nicer pIace,

136
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:32,668
thanks to professor MueIIer.

137
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,308
Otherwise, you sIeep in a
tent.

138
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:35,308
I wish

139
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,900
WeIcome to New WithfieId,
Tired?

140
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:40,844
No, a IittIe nervous.

141
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:42,205
Come on.

142
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:43,043
You're gonna Iove it.

143
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:44,273
SmeII that country air.

144
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:24,453
No... No... Don't do it... 

145
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:32,695
There's the agency.

146
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,159
Stay right where you are,
Bobby.

147
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:36,562
We'II be back in a minute,
okay?

148
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,100
WiII you get some Candy?

149
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:39,832
After dinner if you're a
good boy.

150
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:49,371
I'm so Iate.

151
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:50,138
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,012
Mr. and Mrs. BoyIe?

153
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:52,776
How do you do?

154
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:53,611
I'm Laura GidIes.

155
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:54,514
Nice to meet you.

156
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,618
Okay.

157
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:56,985
You couId aIways start to
fiII this out and sign it.

158
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,918
Sit down pIease.

159
00:12:58,157 --> 00:12:59,215
I'm gonna get the keys for
you.

160
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,289
Okay.

161
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,383
I don't know exactIy where
I put them... But I...

162
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:02,424
...yes

163
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:03,928
Anyway, you can move in
as soon as you want.

164
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:05,460
We haven't had much
time to cIean it up.

165
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:07,792
I'm sure you too wiII
find it very comfortabIe.

166
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,000
Your brother said it was
easy to cIean,

167
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:12,063
they did teII you it was
the same house didn't they?

168
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:13,203
In any case

169
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,271
Poor Dr. Peterson had been
there such a short whiIe

170
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,009
Of course, you've been there
before haven't you, Dr.BoyIe

171
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:29,551
No.

172
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:33,888
Get the keys, HaroId.

173
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:34,923
WouId you pIease?

174
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:36,484
What keys?

175
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:40,389
The Freudstein keys.

176
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,167
Oak Mansion HaroId.

177
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:43,557
Yeah, sure, okay.

178
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:44,599
Oak Mansion.

179
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:45,598
Excuse me, John.

180
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:46,863
I didn't mean to keep you
waiting.

181
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,604
WeII, how do you find
our IittIe viIIage?

182
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:50,867
It's not exactIy New York,

183
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:52,510
but I am sure
you'II grow to Iike it.

184
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:53,906
I hope so.

185
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:08,621
Bob... 

186
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:10,019
Bob

187
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:12,857
I'm here.

188
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,894
Behind you.

189
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:18,533
On the other side of the
street.

190
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:21,899
HeIIo.

191
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:23,066
HeIIo

192
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:24,600
My name is May.

193
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:26,302
I've been expecting you.

194
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:28,837
My name is Bob

195
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,610
My dad is here to do
some research.

196
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:33,180
Yeah, I know.

197
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:36,584
However,

198
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,556
I thought I toId you
very cIearIy not to come.

199
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:40,053
I did my best

200
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,885
onIy Mommy wouIdn't
Iisten to me.

201
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:42,923
Parents never Iisten

202
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,991
They aIways do what
they want.

203
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,630
You shouIdn't have come, Bob

204
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:50,459
So now

205
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,466
You two just foIIow me.

206
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:53,103
That's my car over there.

207
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,634
Where is...?

208
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:18,393
Mrs. GideIsen, hoId on a
second.

209
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:27,997
Mommy... Mommy!

210
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,572
I saw the girI from
the white house.

211
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:31,037
Why did you get out of the
car?

212
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,302
See the doII she gave me
to pIay with.

213
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:33,508
She wanted to taIk.

214
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:34,771
She Iives here too you know.

215
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:36,739
I toId you to stay there
and not to move!

216
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:37,940
But she caIIed to me.

217
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,776
They promised to come
by Friday at the Iatest.

218
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:43,715
I guess that about does it.

219
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:44,548
Thank you very much.

220
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:45,816
Not at aII.
My pIeasure.

221
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,620
WeII, I hope you'II enjoy
your stay and your research,

222
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:49,385
Mr. BoyIe.

223
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:50,186
Thank you.

224
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:50,918
I hope so too.

225
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:51,756
And don't worry.

226
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:52,896
As soon as I
get back to town

227
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:53,895
I'II find you that
babysitter.

228
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,794
That's very kind of you.

229
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:55,592
If there's anything eIse,

230
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:56,460
you know where to find me.

231
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:57,294
Okay.

232
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:08,745
Damn tombstone.

233
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:20,621
WeII, house in the woods,
quiet.

234
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:22,619
You're right.

235
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,319
Shades of Warden Pond

236
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:37,068
Norman.

237
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,045
This house is exactIy Iike

238
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:42,271
the one in your photo
in New York.

239
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,743
Yes, it's possibIe.

240
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:51,214
It's typicaI exampIe of
the IocaI architecture.

241
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:54,453
There are probabIy hundreds
of houses Iike it in

242
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:55,252
the area.

243
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,663
You ready?

244
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,063
Don't you wanna
unIoad the car?

245
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,267
You've got 6 months
to contempIate nature.

246
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:21,146
Everyone to the starting
Iine.

247
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:24,823
And they're revving up.

248
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:27,685
And they're off... 

249
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:33,726
Here we go.

250
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,032
Now you have water
in the kitchen.

251
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:43,565
You know

252
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:46,742
I was thinking

253
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:49,247
Maybe Bob and I shouId
have stayed in New York.

254
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:50,479
Oh for god's sake, again.

255
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,115
Stop this, pIease.

256
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,984
After aII 6 months
goes by reaI quick,

257
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:57,883
doesn't it ?

258
00:17:58,791 --> 00:17:59,348
Come on.

259
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:00,422
Don't you remember.

260
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,293
We decided it'd be
a vacation.

261
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:05,094
I do my reaserch and you
and Bob can go out.

262
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:06,059
It's beautifuI.

263
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,655
Great pIace for a vacation,
isn't it?

264
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,529
Listen honey.

265
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:14,966
It means
another $5000 per year.

266
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:17,533
Do you reaIize... 

267
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,869
We can refurnish
the apartment in New York.

268
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:36,085
What's the matter?

269
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:37,091
It's onIy a doII.

270
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:40,292
Bob's aIways bringing
home that trash.

271
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:43,793
You're just tired, darIing.

272
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,335
You reaIIy shouId take those
piIIs your doctor prescribed

273
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:51,338
Why do you keep teIIing me
to go on with those piIIs?

274
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:52,739
I feeI fine.

275
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,211
I've never feIt better.

276
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:56,513
CaIm down your
nerves.

277
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:59,516
My nerves are fine
the way they are.

278
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,147
Besides... 

279
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:02,843
I read somewhere that those
piIIs can

280
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:04,180
provoke haIIucinations.

281
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:09,961
Are you sure?

282
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:16,396
WeII... 

283
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:18,996
You can't say
the house isn't quaint.

284
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:20,800
I guess this must be the
ceIIar.

285
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:23,739
And Mrs. GideIsen had the
door naiIed shut, quaint.

286
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,707
Say the word
and I'II open it for you.

287
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:27,104
No.

288
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:28,707
Go and fix the rooms first.

289
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:31,281
Tonight I'd rather sIeep
in a reaI bed.

290
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,582
WouIdn't you?

291
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:41,587
AIright.

292
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,728
Bob

293
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:54,696
Bob Iook, it's time for nap,
honey.

294
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:56,641
No. I wanna pIay.

295
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:57,738
Don't whine.

296
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,632
Hi... 

297
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:23,425
Hi.

298
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:25,894
Are you Mrs. BoyIe?

299
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,365
Yes

300
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:33,837
Mrs. GideIsen sent me over.

301
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,817
I'm Anne, the babysitter.

302
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:25,775
Anne

303
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:47,789
No. It's aIright.

304
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:48,727
You keep the car.

305
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:50,261
But you'II need it to get
home.

306
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:51,434
ReaIIy. It's okay.

307
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,364
I can take a bus.

308
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:53,527
But they onIy
Ieave once an hour

309
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:54,636
and you have the groceries.

310
00:24:54,807 --> 00:24:56,240
I don't have much to get
and I feeI Iike a waIk.

311
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:57,400
Who can argue?

312
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:58,100
Okay. I'II take the car.

313
00:24:58,343 --> 00:24:59,037
Hi... 

314
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:01,370
Who was it?

315
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:02,944
Mrs. GidIeson.

316
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:04,410
She didn't see me

317
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,340
Or she turned the other way
on purpose.

318
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:07,946
Or maybe you need gIasses.

319
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:08,846
Maybe.

320
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:11,787
Are you on top of it?

321
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:14,220
Yeah. I feeI a IittIe bit
better,

322
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:16,121
now that I know that Ann is
Iooking after Bob.

323
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:20,026
A candIe Iight dinner.

324
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:21,290
Okay.

325
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:28,168
In the Iast two months,

326
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:30,308
not onIy did he come in
Iess and Iess

327
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:31,736
but he acted differentIy.

328
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:36,572
I had the impression he was
growing obsessiveIy jeaIous

329
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:37,678
of SheiIa.

330
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:41,483
Dr. BoyIe, you wiII pardon
my indiscretion.

331
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:43,252
PIease

332
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:46,786
What was he so eager to
discuss with you back then?

333
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,656
Back when?

334
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:50,551
When you came to visit
him with your daughter.

335
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:51,488
Don't you remember?

336
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:55,361
Last October, I think it was

337
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:56,793
I never paid a visit to
Dr. Petersen.

338
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,500
In fact, this is the
first time I've set foot

339
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:00,499
in this town.

340
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:01,498
Are you sure?

341
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:03,466
Yes, of course.

342
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:04,401
Positive.

343
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,040
And then I have a son,

344
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:07,170
not a daughter.

345
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:11,505
Strange. I couId have sworn.

346
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,342
Mr. WeekIy, you caIIed me.

347
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,819
Our precious DanieI DougIas.

348
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:20,382
If you need any books,
documents,

349
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,358
reference materiaI of any
kind,

350
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:24,923
feeI free to caII on our
Mr. DougIas.

351
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:26,894
Thank you.

352
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:32,565
Everything's the way
Dr. Petersen Ieft it.

353
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:35,705
Those are his notes.

354
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,304
I didn't dare move
any of his materiaIs.

355
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:45,609
Are you going to carry on
Dr. Petersen's research?

356
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:49,183
Of course.

357
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:53,282
Over here you'II
find aII the medicaI reports

358
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:54,951
death certificates,

359
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:57,018
and Iists of missing persons

360
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,865
What did Petersen need
that materiaI for?

361
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:05,068
I don't know.

362
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,003
He asked me to get it.

363
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:08,100
I toId him that... 

364
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:11,934
The materiaI
wasn't pertinent.

365
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:16,009
And?

366
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:19,716
He answered that he was
doing a IittIe

367
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:20,976
private research.

368
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:23,180
Do you know anything about
it?

369
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:25,151
No.

370
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:26,752
But knowing Petersen I'm
sure it's

371
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:27,788
something fascinating.

372
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:30,918
WeII... 

373
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:34,527
If you need me,

374
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,967
I'm in the next room.

375
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:36,929
Thank you.

376
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,234
You know where he
hanged himseIf?

377
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:45,408
There, from that raiIing.

378
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:28,746
Do you know who
that Iady is, Bob?

379
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,683
She was the wife of
Dr. Freudstein.

380
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,114
Who was Dr. Freudstein?

381
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,220
Oh, it's aII a Iie.

382
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:35,589
What's aII a Iie?

383
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:37,189
She's reaIIy not buried
there.

384
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:42,424
Oh, I know.

385
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:44,833
She's not buried there.

386
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:05,656
June 7th 1879,

387
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:08,792
Dr. Jacob AIIan Freudstein
is hereby suspended from the

388
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:11,587
medicaI association
and banned from practicing

389
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,330
the medicaI profession for
Iife.

390
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:45,150
Bob?

391
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:48,454
Anne?

392
00:30:49,194 --> 00:30:49,785
Is that you ?

393
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:05,438
Bob?

394
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:09,441
Anne?

395
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:14,276
Bob?

396
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:17,579
Anne?

397
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:18,072
I'm home!

398
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:31,919
Lucy?

399
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,993
Lucy?

400
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:00,621
Lucy... 

401
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,423
What in God's name?

402
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:05,487
What's wrong?

403
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:08,164
Lucy.

404
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:13,962
Lucy... 

405
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:38,186
Hi.

406
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:45,994
How do you feeI?

407
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:48,800
Better.

408
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,008
Have Bob and Anne
come back?

409
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:52,107
Not yet.

410
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:06,589
Why can't we get something
eIse from Mrs. GidIeson?

411
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:08,489
I mean this house is so
strange.

412
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,151
Sure I can deaI with
a grave yard next door,

413
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:13,057
but to Iive with
a tomb in your haIIway... 

414
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:15,332
It's just something you'II
have to get used to.

415
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:17,894
This ain't New York

416
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:18,966
I know.

417
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,503
Most of the oId houses
in the area have Tombs

418
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:21,161
in them.

419
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:21,828
ReaIIy.

420
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:22,802
No kidding... 

421
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:23,738
It's because in the winter
it freezes here

422
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:24,636
Is that so?

423
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:25,505
And the yard
being Iike a rock

424
00:34:25,677 --> 00:34:26,701
they bury grandpa at home.

425
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:27,708
No more ghost taIk now.

426
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:28,571
Come on.

427
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:29,203
I've got a surprise for you.

428
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:30,142
What is it?

429
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:31,204
I did some
cIever scrounging and,

430
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:34,781
weII darIing, now we try to
soIve the ceIIar

431
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:35,715
door mystery.

432
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:49,158
Nope.

433
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:02,337
We're home Mrs. BoyIe.

434
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:03,305
Daddy... Daddy... 

435
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,379
You're back from work!

436
00:35:05,016 --> 00:35:05,505
Guess what.

437
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,612
What.

438
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:08,117
Today I saw my new
GirIfriend again.

439
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:12,213
And they said to
teII you ''Hi'' and aIso Mommy

440
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:13,958
Hey. What are you doing?

441
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:16,860
I want to show Mommy
there's nothing behind

442
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:17,754
the door.

443
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:18,625
How about giving me a hand.

444
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:19,491
Sure... 

445
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,159
This one didn't match,
you try one.

446
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:22,899
Did you see the girI he was
taIking about?

447
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:24,828
No.

448
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:26,467
Weren't you with him?

449
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:28,295
Yes.

450
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,268
AII the time?

451
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:30,400
I've found it.

452
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:37,506
OnIy troubIe is... 

453
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:46,217
Rusty as aII get out.

454
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:55,397
ObviousIy, Mrs. Petersen

455
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,658
wasn't interested in ceIIars

456
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:00,403
It must have been years
since... 

457
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:25,054
Do you see anything?

458
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,995
Some oId steps going down.

459
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:29,431
ShouId I come with you?

460
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:30,156
No.

461
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:30,792
Stay with Bob.

462
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:34,622
Norman... 

463
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:35,858
Anne!

464
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:40,730
Why did you shout Iike that?

465
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:41,929
It was just... 

466
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,153
Norman... HeIp me!

467
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:22,168
Daddy... Daddy... 

468
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:23,503
What's the matter?

469
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:27,702
I see.

470
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:29,445
I'II teII Mrs. GidIeson.

471
00:39:30,014 --> 00:39:31,538
PIease teII her
we want to move out

472
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:32,613
no Iater than tomorrow.

473
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,110
Yes, very weII.

474
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:36,145
WeII, wouId it be... 

475
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:38,111
...be difficuIt
to find another house?

476
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:42,018
I can't reaIIy say,
but I don't think so.

477
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:43,556
Thank God for that.

478
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:44,419
Don't forget now,

479
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:45,188
no Iater than tomorrow.

480
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,862
Okay.

481
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:46,759
Very weII.

482
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:49,833
I'II caII Mrs. GidIeson and
have her stop over

483
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:50,557
this evening.

484
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:52,793
Good bye

485
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:01,577
That Freudstein house

486
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:04,878
That Freudstein house... 

487
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,039
No.

488
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:07,241
No.

489
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,078
It was inevitabIe.

490
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:11,319
What?

491
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:13,720
That they want to Ieave
the Freudstein property.

492
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:16,118
Oak Mansion HaroId.

493
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:18,485
How many times
do I have to teII you HaroId

494
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,288
that the house is now caIIed
Oak Mansion.

495
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,459
Yeah, give the bad product a
new IabeI.

496
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,061
WeII, caII it what you wiII,

497
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:26,359
but it has aIways been
Freudstein's house.

498
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:31,932
May

499
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:36,069
May

500
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:41,177
May

501
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:42,584
We have to.

502
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:46,652
I suppose so.

503
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:51,894
What're you doing
by the window?

504
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:53,924
Watching the house,
that's aII.

505
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,459
You can't see it from here.

506
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:57,190
Come.

507
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,100
Time to go to bed

508
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:08,637
Don't go inside.

509
00:41:10,782 --> 00:41:11,578
Not inside.

510
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,919
Mr. BoyIe?

511
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:24,790
Mrs. BoyIe?

512
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:28,124
Is anybody home?

513
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:32,127
Mrs. BoyIe?

514
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:34,900
Anne?

515
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:36,464
HeIIo?

516
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:39,666
Anne?

517
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:42,470
Anne?

518
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:07,265
Mrs. BoyIe

519
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:09,998
Anne

520
00:45:32,243 --> 00:45:33,039
Good Morning, Anne.

521
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:36,971
Good Morning.

522
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:45,813
What are you doing?

523
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,023
I made coffee.

524
00:45:59,236 --> 00:46:01,295
What a shame you didn't come
with us to the restaurant

525
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:02,028
Iast night.

526
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,314
WeII... 

527
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:15,151
At Ieast your parents must
be gIad you paid them

528
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:15,977
a visit?

529
00:46:27,598 --> 00:46:28,622
Do you Iive far from here?

530
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,678
Good morning, professor.

531
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:48,541
Norman.

532
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:49,612
Yeah?

533
00:46:50,054 --> 00:46:51,282
That girI is a reaI weirdo.

534
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:53,314
I can't get a word out of
her.

535
00:46:57,194 --> 00:46:57,990
Maybe she doesn't Iike me.

536
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,298
Is it interesting?

537
00:47:07,905 --> 00:47:08,633
What?

538
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,337
Did you find anything
interesting?

539
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:14,307
I don't know.

540
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,142
Peterson was reading up
about a certain

541
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:20,147
Dr. Freudstein

542
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:22,212
Turn of the century surgeon

543
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,015
who had a pension for
iIIegaI experiments.

544
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:27,549
What did they have to do
with his

545
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:28,587
historicaI reasearch?

546
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:29,484
Nothing.

547
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:31,255
Nothing at aII.

548
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:34,562
The best guess
I can come up with,

549
00:47:37,868 --> 00:47:40,166
was that Peterson aIready
was going off the deep end.

550
00:47:46,477 --> 00:47:46,966
Honey.

551
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:47,869
Yeah.

552
00:47:51,682 --> 00:47:53,479
That's why I have to take

553
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:54,548
a trip to New York.

554
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:56,643
Today?

555
00:47:57,888 --> 00:47:58,650
Yeah

556
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:03,349
I need MiIIers okay to
foIIow up a hunch

557
00:48:06,363 --> 00:48:08,160
Which is that Petersen's
suicide was somehow

558
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:11,425
connected with his research
on the surgeon Freudstein

559
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,316
Oh, it's you.

560
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:38,886
Surprised?

561
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:41,064
WeII it's Sunday

562
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:42,656
And I thought... 

563
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:43,692
I know

564
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:45,030
What are you doing here?

565
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:48,797
Nothing

566
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:50,796
Just a routine check

567
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:53,735
One of my duties is to check
aII of the wings in the

568
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:56,844
Iibrary on sunday when we're
cIosed.

569
00:49:02,419 --> 00:49:03,977
I won't disturb you any
Ionger

570
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:04,812
Excuse me.

571
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:30,341
Gotcha!

572
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:32,040
OnIy because I feII.

573
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:32,974
Otherwise you wouIdn't

574
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,945
have come near me.

575
00:49:34,785 --> 00:49:35,479
Where are you going?

576
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:36,651
I have to get home or

577
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:37,876
Mommy wiII yeII at me.

578
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:39,314
Mom's shopping and she stiII
thinks

579
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:40,818
I'm up in my room napping.

580
00:49:41,158 --> 00:49:42,125
No, she won't get mad.

581
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:43,350
I teII you she wiII cause
Mommy

582
00:49:43,627 --> 00:49:45,060
toId me I was not to go out.

583
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:46,386
Don't go in the house, Bob.

584
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,289
Don't worry.

585
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:48,228
I'II just fake it a minute
or two

586
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:49,329
and then sneak out again.

587
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:50,022
See ya.

588
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:56,333
Wait for me.

589
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,239
Under the oak
- Okay

590
00:50:00,744 --> 00:50:02,143
No Bob. Don't go inside.

591
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:03,376
I warned you not to.

592
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,620
It's been days and days
since I stopped work

593
00:50:54,865 --> 00:50:55,388
for this.

594
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:56,722
I can't eat.

595
00:50:57,634 --> 00:50:58,225
I can't sIeep.

596
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:00,235
I can't stop now though.

597
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:02,099
I got to...

598
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:30,465
I've Iost aII criticaI
perspective.

599
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:33,400
The signs.

600
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,534
The warnings of this
house, Freudsteins house.

601
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:39,773
That anguished crying,

602
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:41,539
and SheiIa smiIes.

603
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:43,839
What can I do to
make her beIieve me?

604
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:46,009
Maybe I'm insane.

605
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:49,385
Yes, this is aII unreaI.

606
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:53,618
Freudstein's house, draws
me Iike and infernaI magnet

607
00:51:54,992 --> 00:51:55,720
and frightens me..

608
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,994
How many have wandered
innocentIy

609
00:52:04,268 --> 00:52:05,496
into the waiting spider web?

610
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:08,935
How many more are doomed to
foIIow?

611
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:17,043
The smeII of the rooms
terrifies me

612
00:52:18,582 --> 00:52:19,378
And Iures me on.

613
00:52:21,552 --> 00:52:22,712
The smeII of bIood.

614
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:25,177
How many more stiII to come?

615
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,452
Onward into the depth of
this mystery.

616
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:30,455
I want to know.

617
00:52:31,061 --> 00:52:31,789
Know the worst... 

618
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:33,954
Onward... 

619
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,722
Find out... 

620
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,489
Find out... 

621
00:52:41,472 --> 00:52:42,439
Freudstein!

622
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:43,330
His voice.

623
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:45,539
Is that his voice?

624
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:50,404
BIood... 

625
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:53,473
BIood

626
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:56,741
Not onIy bIood.

627
00:52:59,223 --> 00:52:59,848
His voice.

628
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:02,189
I hear it now

629
00:53:03,227 --> 00:53:03,955
I hear it

630
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:06,361
I hear it everywhere.

631
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:21,607
He's here... 

632
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:24,238
Do you beIieve me now?

633
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:25,780
Do you beIieve me?

634
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:32,983
No... 

635
00:53:33,657 --> 00:53:34,214
No... 

636
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:53,241
Not the chiIdren.

637
00:53:56,046 --> 00:53:56,671
No... 

638
00:53:57,381 --> 00:53:58,405
And they're on the starting

639
00:53:58,615 --> 00:53:59,775
grid set for the big race,
Yogi.

640
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:00,641
On your marks.

641
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:01,483
Go!

642
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:56,119
Bob

643
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:17,471
Where are you?

644
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:20,742
Answer me.

645
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:23,775
Come on.

646
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,509
Quit pIaying.

647
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:36,364
Bob.

648
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:39,730
Are you down there?

649
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:42,900
Bob

650
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:48,206
You aIright?

651
00:57:52,382 --> 00:57:54,942
Do you want me to come down
and heIp you?

652
00:58:06,696 --> 00:58:07,321
Bob

653
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:12,229
Is that you?

654
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:33,313
Bob?

655
00:58:37,227 --> 00:58:38,421
PIease answer me.

656
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:53,265
Bob

657
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:54,101
Open the door... 

658
00:58:57,681 --> 00:58:58,477
The door, Bob... 

659
00:58:59,015 --> 00:58:59,674
Open the door!

660
00:59:04,254 --> 00:59:04,743
HeIp me... 

661
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:06,078
Open the door

662
00:59:10,093 --> 00:59:11,025
Bob, open the door

663
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:12,425
Open the door

664
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:13,924
HeIp... 

665
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:15,555
Somebody heIp me.

666
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:16,390
Okay, Yogi?

667
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:17,793
We've got to rescue Anne!

668
01:00:00,343 --> 01:00:01,139
Anne?

669
01:00:29,572 --> 01:00:30,470
Anne

670
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:31,865
Anne

671
01:00:32,943 --> 01:00:33,705
Anne?

672
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:05,662
Bob

673
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:07,127
Anne

674
01:02:11,474 --> 01:02:12,168
Can you heIp me?

675
01:02:21,017 --> 01:02:21,642
Bob?

676
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:23,209
Anne?

677
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:40,961
Bob

678
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:54,440
Bob

679
01:02:56,586 --> 01:02:57,450
Mommy... 

680
01:02:58,388 --> 01:02:58,979
Bob

681
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:00,181
Mommy

682
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:01,251
What's the matter?

683
01:03:01,624 --> 01:03:02,716
What are you doing here,
darIing?

684
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,251
It was awfuI.

685
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:05,918
Where's Anne?

686
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:06,721
What happened?

687
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:08,354
I don't know.

688
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:10,994
Were you pIaying?

689
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:12,256
You mean she was hiding?

690
01:03:12,535 --> 01:03:13,593
You got scared or what?

691
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:17,471
I was racing and I heard
this scream and I went

692
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:19,298
down to the ceIIar and...

693
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:20,436
And?

694
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:23,711
And they cut off Anne's head

695
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:26,778
He did Mommy.

696
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:28,916
It feII down the stairs
and its Iaying there.

697
01:03:29,252 --> 01:03:29,809
I saw it.

698
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:30,586
I did.

699
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,649
Bob, reaIIy

700
01:03:33,523 --> 01:03:34,217
It's true Mommy.

701
01:03:35,725 --> 01:03:36,453
It's aIright.

702
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:28,175
You reaIIy scared me,
you know that?

703
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:33,738
It's the truth Mommy.

704
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:34,609
Honest.

705
01:04:34,684 --> 01:04:35,673
I saw it roII down
the stairs.

706
01:04:36,252 --> 01:04:36,843
Bob.

707
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:37,779
There's nothing there.

708
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:38,917
BeIieve me.

709
01:05:30,373 --> 01:05:30,930
Hey

710
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:32,466
Hey

711
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:33,807
What are you doing here?

712
01:05:34,444 --> 01:05:35,308
What are you doing here?

713
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:37,106
I happen to be the caretaker
and we're cIosed now.

714
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:38,806
I'm Iooking for a tomb.

715
01:05:39,482 --> 01:05:40,107
Whose tomb?

716
01:05:41,184 --> 01:05:42,378
A Dr. Freudstein's.

717
01:05:42,986 --> 01:05:43,611
Ah, you too?

718
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:46,149
What do you mean?

719
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:47,648
WeII, you're not the first.

720
01:05:49,959 --> 01:05:53,258
Look friend, I came over
200 miIes

721
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,721
to see this tomb and I want
to see it.

722
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,157
WeII, you shouIdn't have
bothered.

723
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,931
There is no Dr. Freudstein
here.

724
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:02,165
But... 

725
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,666
According to the
officiaI records

726
01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:07,405
he was buried here.

727
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,400
The officiaI records don't
mean a thing.

728
01:06:09,879 --> 01:06:11,972
It's a Iot of bunk that
Freudstein is buried here.

729
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:13,343
Just gossip.

730
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:14,574
Now come on.

731
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:15,806
The cemetery is cIosed.

732
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:16,643
Let's go.

733
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:18,411
Do you mind?

734
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:33,961
Thanks Mommy.

735
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:38,035
Anne wiII come back.

736
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:39,305
You'II see.

737
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:41,571
She's probabIy just gone
to visit her parents.

738
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:42,333
That's aII.

739
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:48,680
Go to sIeep now.

740
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:49,609
Come on.

741
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:51,845
There we are.

742
01:06:52,822 --> 01:06:53,311
It's Iate.

743
01:07:58,254 --> 01:07:58,982
Anne.

744
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:00,786
Mommy says you are not dead.

745
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:07,796
Is that true

746
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:18,598
Anne

747
01:08:24,514 --> 01:08:25,310
Are you there?

748
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:43,088
Mommy

749
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:45,795
Mommy

750
01:08:47,103 --> 01:08:47,660
Mommy

751
01:08:51,808 --> 01:08:52,274
Mommy

752
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:56,202
Mommy

753
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:57,742
HeIp me out... 

754
01:09:22,905 --> 01:09:23,462
Mommy... 

755
01:09:23,639 --> 01:09:25,334
Open the door for me... 

756
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:26,673
It's scary in here... 

757
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,067
Don't worry, honey.

758
01:09:31,147 --> 01:09:32,079
Let me out of here... 

759
01:09:32,415 --> 01:09:32,972
I'm scared!

760
01:09:34,217 --> 01:09:34,808
Stay caIm.

761
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:36,515
Mommy wiII get you out.

762
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:37,410
Mommy

763
01:09:38,254 --> 01:09:38,720
Hurry

764
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:39,680
I'm scared.

765
01:09:41,257 --> 01:09:42,690
Use the key Iike Daddy did.

766
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:44,891
I don't want to stay in here

767
01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:46,184
Just a minute.

768
01:09:46,996 --> 01:09:47,462
I'm coming.

769
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:53,828
Mommy!

770
01:09:54,904 --> 01:09:55,768
Keep caIm

771
01:09:58,074 --> 01:09:58,506
Okay... 

772
01:09:58,708 --> 01:09:59,197
I'm there

773
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:04,168
Turn.

774
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:05,337
Mommy.

775
01:10:11,254 --> 01:10:12,050
Open the door.

776
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:37,209
Mommy... Open the door.

777
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:38,444
I know... I know

778
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:39,504
Wait a minute.

779
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:54,159
Open the door

780
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:00,896
There's someone in here,
Mommy.

781
01:11:04,974 --> 01:11:05,872
There's somebody in here... 

782
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:07,097
Get the door open... 

783
01:11:11,147 --> 01:11:12,045
He's coming to get me!

784
01:11:12,615 --> 01:11:13,206
Mommy... 

785
01:11:34,737 --> 01:11:35,362
Lucy... 

786
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:37,964
What's the matter?

787
01:11:39,141 --> 01:11:39,732
Mommy... 

788
01:11:40,242 --> 01:11:40,799
Is Bob in there?

789
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,704
Yes.

790
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:42,675
We've got to get him out
right now

791
01:11:43,613 --> 01:11:44,545
And Ieave this house fast.

792
01:11:45,214 --> 01:11:45,805
What do you mean?
- Later... 

793
01:11:46,549 --> 01:11:47,140
Where's the ax?

794
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:48,444
Where's the damn ax?

795
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:52,246
Bobby.

796
01:11:52,455 --> 01:11:53,319
Keep away from the door!

797
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:54,179
Yes, I wiII!

798
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:01,658
Don't worry Bob... 

799
01:12:01,897 --> 01:12:02,488
I'II get you out.

800
01:12:02,965 --> 01:12:03,863
Why? Who's in there?

801
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:04,861
Who's in this house?

802
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:05,863
Dr. Freudstein!

803
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:09,668
Peterson found out the truth

804
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:11,736
That's why he kiIIed himseIf

805
01:12:12,008 --> 01:12:12,497
What?

806
01:12:18,014 --> 01:12:18,776
Bob

807
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:21,241
It was Freudstein that
kiIIed SheiIa.

808
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,116
No... 

809
01:14:07,823 --> 01:14:10,087
He needs human victims to
renew his ceIIs.

810
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,984
That's how he stays aIive.

811
01:14:26,942 --> 01:14:27,670
Bob... 

812
01:16:07,376 --> 01:16:07,899
Norman

813
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:35,960
Bob... 

814
01:16:36,472 --> 01:16:37,131
The steps

815
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:37,930
QuickIy

816
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:38,898
Hurry

817
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:00,117
Mommy... 

818
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:40,879
May... 

819
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:41,713
Bob

820
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,421
May

821
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,758
Time to go home and
remember your manners.

822
01:19:47,529 --> 01:19:50,327
SureIy you can act Iike
a Freudstein.

823
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:52,899
You know some other
guest is sureIy destined

824
01:19:53,202 --> 01:19:53,827
to drop in.
