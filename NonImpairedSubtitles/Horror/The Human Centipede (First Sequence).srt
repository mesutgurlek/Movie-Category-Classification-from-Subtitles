00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Hi!

2
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,600
Yes um, I was wondering if
I could get driving directions...

3
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,000
to a nightclub called  Bunker.

4
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
Yes, Bunker.

5
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,600
 How exactly would I get there?

6
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,300
It's Amy!

7
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,300

11
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Yes.

12
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,700
And how far is it?

13
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
No we're in Germany.

14
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,000
Then we travel to Italy in a couple days.

15
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,700
Great.

16
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,800
Thanks.
Alveterzane!

17
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,500
<i>I know.</i>

18
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,600
Tell her we got her a present from Holland.

19
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,800
Yeah we got you a present.

20
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,000
No we can't tell you what it
is, it's a surprise.

21
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Oh yeah, the other thing is that 
we met this cut German waiter.

22
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
<i>Jenny thinks he's pretty cute</i>

23
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,300
<i>Yeah, and he invited us to a party
tonight.</i>

24
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
So we're going to go.

25
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,300
But we should go.

26
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,500
Maybe we can talkto you later.

27
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
OK.

28
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,500
<i>All right.
We miss you!</i>

29
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,100
Bye, Anie!
Kisses!

30
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,900
OK.

31
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,800
Bye, sweetie!

32
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,000
I think we were suppose to turn

33
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Turn!

34
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,000
I thought you know exactly
where we sere going!

35
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,100
Do we go left or right?

36
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,300
I'm sorry, but I just don't know
where we are.

37
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,200
What was that?

38
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,400
I have no idea.

39
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,100
You must have run over a pot whole or something.

40
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
We need to go out
and check it out.

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Shit!

42
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,500
Shit!

43
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,800
Shit!

44
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,700
Why?
Oh God!

45
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, okay ...

46
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Okay.

Okay.

50
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200

51
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,100
200,

52
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,900

54
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
There's no signal.

55
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,700
What?

56
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,400
There's no signal!

57
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,800
There's always a signal.

58
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,500
Not out here in the middle of nowhere.

59
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,100
Oh my God, Shit!

60
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,500
Oh my God,
get back in the car.

61
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,800
OK ... Now what?

62
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,100
I don't know.

63
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,300
You know how to change a tire?

64
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,100
- No, I don't know how to change a tire.
- Neither do I.

65
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,300
What are we suppose to walk
until we find a house or a person or something?

66
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,200
Lindsay! 

67
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,000
Lindsay. I am not getting out and walking.

68
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,900
Okay we're just going to sit here,
until the sun comes up.

69
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,200
I have heels and shorts on!
I'm not going outside!

70
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,200

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

72
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,700
Are you kidding?!
I'm not going to just role down the window.

73
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,000
Role down the window.

74
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
German

75
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,700
Yeah um, we need help.

76
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,000
We have a flat tire.

77
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,100
No, we speak English.

78
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Can you help us?

79
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,000
Do not understand what he says.

80
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,700
Um, can you call someone?

81
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,000
"Ficken".
-Look it up.

82
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,100
Hold on a second.

83
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,300
Fucking!

84
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,800
He said Fucking!

85
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
- Okay. Bye.

86
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,600

87
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,800
- I'm sorry.
- I told you!

88
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,900
Is your door locked?

89
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,400
Yes, my door is locked.

90
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,300
Why's he still staring at us?

91
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,300
- Just don't look at him, okay?
- i'm not looking at him.

92
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,200
I just want to get out of here.

93
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,600
Okay.

94
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,400
We need to j-just go!

95
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Gotta go from here.

96
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,000
We need to walk and find someplace, 
somebody who can help us.

97
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
- Okay, but ...
- We have to!

98
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,800
But if we find apalce in 10 minutes,
we are running back to this car.

99
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,600
We came ...

100
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,900
We came from over here, I swear.

101
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,500
How do you know?
All trees look the same.

102
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,200
Leaving the car
is the stupidest idea.

103
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
We would have been waiting for hours, Jenny.

104
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Yeah we could have been waitng
and it not be freezing cold.

105
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
We need to go fing help, Jenny.

Seriously find help?
How are we going to fing help out here, Lindsay?

107
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,300
You agreed to come along, Jenny.
This not just my fault.

108
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,500
I didn't want to stay in the car by myself.

109
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,200
We just got a little lost, okay?

110
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000

119
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,500

123
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,200
What is it?

124
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,100
My God is that a...

125
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,700
Is it a house?

126
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
Jenny!

127
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,700
Jenny, look!

128
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,500
I think it's a house!
I swear!

129
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,600
- It's a light! Let's go.
- What?

130
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,500
Let's go!

131
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,400
OH! FOR SOME REASON I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

132
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,500
Oh thank God!

Look at the dog!

142
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,300
- What about him?
- I don't like dogs.

143
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,700
I know you don't like dogs.

144
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,600
- Hello?
- Is anybody home?

145
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,000

No.

147
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,700

Can we come in ?

151
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,800
Can we use your phone so we
can call the car company service?

152
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,600
Are you alone?

153
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,200
Yes.

154
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,500
We're alone.

155
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,000

156
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,600
Have a seat.

157
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,400
You're tourists.

158
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,800
- We're on a road trip through Europe...
-It's a vacation.

159
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,700
We're from New York.

160
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Can you call the emergency car service?

161
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,600
For us ...

162
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,100
Are you relatives?

163
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,800
- No.
- No, we're friends.

164
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,500

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Okay, thanks.

167
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Something to drink?

169
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,700
Hello.

170
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
German

171
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,300
Well ...

172
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,600
at least he's calling the car company.

173
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,700
Here you go.

174
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,500
Water ... 

175
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,700
Water ...

176
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,700
They will arrive in half an hour.

177
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,200
Maximum.

178
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,100
You have a a really lovely home.

179
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,300
You live herei with your wife?

180
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,500
No.

181
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,900
I don't like human beings.

182
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,800
German

183
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm sorry.

184
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,500
I'll get you another one.

185
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,700
- No, it's okay, it's okay.
- We can share.

186
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,500
I'll fetch a towel.

187
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,400
What just happened?

188
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,500
I don't know.

189
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,900
We need to get out of here right now.

190
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,600
Yeah.

191
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,400
It's freaking me out.

192
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,800
You want to? just call a taxi
so we can go back to the hotel.

193
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Let's go back to the Hotel, okay.

194
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,200
- We'll get the car in the morning car.
- Okay. Yeah.

195
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,500
I am really tired.

196
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,600
Listen, If you could just call a taxi service,
we're just going to go back to the hotel.

197
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,300
No. I don't do another phone call.

198
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,900
Can I call you then?

199
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,000
No.

200
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
- I'm tired.
- What?

201
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm tired.

202
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,700
What's going on?
Look at me.

203
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,000
It's a rape drug.

204
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,300
What?

205
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,600
Rohypnol.

206
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,100
Oh my God! What!

207
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,600
It causes, droziness, dizziness,
disorientation and memory loss.

208
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,300
Are you kidding?!
What have you done?

209
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,400
Jenny!
God!

210
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
What is it?

211
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,700
Jenny.

212
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,100
Jenny.

213
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,600
Jenny!

214
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,000
Jenny!
Jenny, wake up!

215
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Jenny!

216
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,700
God!

217
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Jenny.

218
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,100
Lindsay!

219
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,000
Jenny!

220
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,300
What's happening?

221
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,000
What are you doing?

222
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,700
What's this?

223
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,900
What the fuck are you doing to us?

224
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,100
What are you doing?

225
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,600
Jenny!

226
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,300
Let us out!

227
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,400
My friend ...

228
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,500
You don't match.

229
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Have to kill you.

230
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Don't take it personally.

231
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,200
What 's this?
What are you doing to us?

232
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,400
What is this?
Stop!

233
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,500
Jenny!

234
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,100
Japanese

235
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,000
Please ...

236
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,200
It's gonig to be okay.

237
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm Dr. Joseph Heiter.

238
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,900
Japanese

239
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:40,000
Retired but still very well known as 
the leading surgeon separating siamese twins.

240
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,500
Japanese

241
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,200
Six months,

242
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,600
I designed a never seen operation,
not separating anymore... 

243
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,000
but creating.

244
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,500
I transformed my three Rottweiler

245
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,300
into a beautiful three hound construction.

246
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
Good news!

247
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Your tissues match.

248
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
So ...

249
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,200
I will explain this spectacular operation
once.

250
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
We start ...

251
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,600
 with cutting the ligament patelar.

252
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,400
 The ligaments of the knee caps.

253
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,300
So knee extension...

254
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
is no longer possible.

255
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,700
Pulling from "B" and "C"

256
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,000
The central incisors,
and lateral incisors and Canines.

257
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,500
from the upper and lower jaws...

258
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,100
The lips from"B" and "C"...

259
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,100
and the anus of "A" and "B"...

260
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:59,500
are cut circular along the boarder
between buttock and rectum.

261
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,500
The mucus retains so.

262
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,500
Two pet acellular grafts
 are prepaired

263
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,000
and lifted from the underlining tissue.

264
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
The shape incisions.

265
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,900
Below the chins, of "B" to "C"

266
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,100
up to their cheeks.

267
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Connecting the circular skin parts...

268
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,500
of anus and mouth.

269
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,600
From "A" to "B"
and  "B" to "C".

270
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Connecting...

271
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,000
the pet acellular grafts
to the chin/cheek incisions  .

272
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Creating ...

273
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,200
a siamese triplet...

274
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,700
connected

275
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,800
by the gastrict system.

276
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,600
Ingestion by "A"

277
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,800
past through "B"

278
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,800
and excretion by "C".

279
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
A human centipede.

280
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,700
First sequence.

281
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,600
Here's your breakfast.

282
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,000
Japanese

283
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,400

general anesthesia.

284
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,000
Lindsay!

285
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,100
Jenny ...

286
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,200
I want my mom!

287
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,100
German

288
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,800
No!

289
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,300
<i>Open up!</i>

290
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,500
Please!

291
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,900
Stop!
Why do this?

292
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,100
Open!

293
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Need help!
You're a sick man!

294
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,700
I am a sick man.

295
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,200
<i>HAHAHAHAHA!</i>

296
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,200
If you do not open immediately I will....

297
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,800
cut your knees

298
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,300
<i>and pull your teeth out
one by one!</i>

299
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,400
<i>without anesthesia.</i>

300
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
<i>It's your choice!</i>

301
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,600
Open the door!

302
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,400
<i>Open the door!</i>

303
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,400
Stop!

304
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,600
No!

305
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,500
Please!
Please!

306
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,800
Why do this?

307
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,200
Let me and Jenny go.

308
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,300
Please.

309
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,900
We'll give you anything.

310
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,100
Anything you want,
just let us go.

311
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,600
Don't worry ...

312
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,100
it's only a tranquilizer 

313
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,400
Keep your head very still.

314
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,300
I don't want to loose one of yout precious eyes.

315
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,300
Just kill me!

316
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,700
Ahhhh.

317
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,000
One of my Rottweilers
tried to flee

318
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,900
just before the operation.

319
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,700
After I caught the dog....

320
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,900
He had to take the middle postion.

321
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
in this postion...

322
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,200
the healing pains...

323
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,100
are twice as intense.

324
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,900
Do you already regret your little escape.

325
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,500
In fact I'm thankful for it.

326
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,800
Because now I know definitely,
you are...

327
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,800
the middle piece!

328
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,000
Just kill me now.
I'd rather be dead.

329
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,600
Game Over.

330
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,300
Damn.

331
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,500
power is cut of again..

332
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,300
Sorry!

333
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Damn!

334
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,900
I'm so sorry.

335
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,800
Help!

336
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,600
my sweet centipede ...

337
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,400
Looks good.

338
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,700
Heal well.

339
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,300
Suffering will be over soon.

340
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,900
Your in alot of pain, I know.

341
