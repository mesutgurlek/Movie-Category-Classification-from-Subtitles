1
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,449
Billy?
Get number three up now.

2
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,213
And don't come in to eat
before you do.

3
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,457
And check the other two!

4
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,358
Make sure they're wired up good!

5
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,456
I don't want 'em blowing over
again at the first big wind.

6
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,638
Lot of good they're doing.

7
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,895
Billy, you been messing
with the post-puncher?

8
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,302
No!

9
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,237
I told you what would happen...

10
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,865
if you screw around
with this thing.

11
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,807
I said I didn't!

12
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,679
"l don't want 'em
blowin' down again."

13
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,880
Big wind, my ass.

14
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,480
You're the only big wind
out here.

15
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,292
Jacky!

16
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,329
You been messing with the damn
post-puncher again, huh?

17
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,558
No.

18
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,337
Billy, you little asshole!

19
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,033
Why don't you rat yourself out
for a change?

20
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,804
-What did I do?
-You little butt sniff!

21
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,675
I ought to come out there
and kick your ass!

22
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,646
You wish!

23
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,993
Yeah, go on, Mac. Go bite him
in the ass for me, Mackie boy.

24
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,626
God, would you shut up?

25
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,305
Jacky!

26
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,836
Jacky!

27
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,434
Jacky!

28
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,479
Jacky!

29
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,925
-What?
-I don't know.

30
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,462
What?

31
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,206
Help!

32
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,750
Billy!

33
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,013
Help! Help!

34
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,921
Where are you? Billy!

35
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,855
Daddy!

36
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,588
Billy!

37
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,293
Let go! Help me, dad!

38
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:49,034
-Billy!
-Help! Help! Help!

39
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,238
-Billy!
-Help! Dad! Help me!

40
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,243
Billy!

41
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,343
Stop it! Let go!

42
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,082
-Billy!
-Daddy!

43
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,181
Billy!

44
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,758
Help!

45
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,334
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!

46
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,668
-Go!
-Louder!

47
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,901
-Go!
-Louder!

48
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,240
Go Bantams! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

49
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,749
Tough as nails, hard as rocks!

50
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,011
We are Bannon's fighting cocks!

51
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,279
Fighting Bantams,
tough as nails!

52
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,378
Bow down now or kiss our tails!

53
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,685
Out for blood,
we're lean and mean!

54
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,885
Bannon County's death machine!

55
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,962
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!

56
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,293
Go Bantams!

57
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,832
Bannon Bantams, power and might!

58
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:22,992
Bannon Bantams,
fight, fight, fight!

59
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,160
Incoming!

60
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,931
Bannon Bantams, we're the word!

61
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,233
You don't mess
with a mighty bird!

62
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,309
Down the court
we'll clean your clock!

63
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,673
Better not mess
with the fighting cock!

64
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,712
Bannon Bantams, Bannon Bantams!

65
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,543
Go Bantams!

66
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,844
Bannon Bantams, wings of steel!

67
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,942
Bannon Bantams,
kill, kill, kill!

68
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,021
Who was that? Don't even ask!

69
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,317
Big bad Bantams kick your ass!

70
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,597
Bannon Bantams, Bannon Bantams!

71
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,665
Go Bantams!

72
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,257
Go!

73
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,964
Go Bantams!

74
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,064
We are the champs!
We are the champs!

75
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,109
Tough as nails, hard as rocks!
We are Bannon's fighting cocks!

76
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,242
How long can they keep this up?

77
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,719
Forever. They have a fight song
with the word "cock" in it.

78
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,347
Why aren't you sitting
with your honey?

79
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,392
Bannon County's death machine!

80
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,664
Someone should tell him he just
won the state championship.

81
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,098
I have a feeling
he didn't get to play enough.

82
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,068
Well, shouldn't you be
sitting with him?

83
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,436
After a game, he says
he needs to be with the guys.

84
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,805
You'd kill
his post-game bus high.

85
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,006
Basically. If they lose,
it's a totally different thing.

86
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,604
Can't pry him off me.

87
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,460
Shit.

88
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,871
OK, everybody sit down.
Sit tight.

89
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,367
Son of a bitch!

90
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,987
What in the hell
would you call that?

91
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,529
I don't know,
but whatever it is...

92
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,366
it's sharp as a son of a bitch.

93
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,078
What in the hell
are we looking at?

94
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,674
Sharp enough to flatten a tire,
whatever it is.

95
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,253
You know how thick
that rubber is?

96
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,879
Have to be shot into it
like a bullet.

97
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,550
Jesus Christ! The damn thing
has got teeth in it!

98
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,493
They can't just whip the jack
out and pump this mother up?

99
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,757
The driver can't change a flat
on a bus.

100
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,833
-They need a mechanic.
-So?

101
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,892
So, do you see
any mechanics around here?

102
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,437
You sucked so bad today,
Deaundre...

103
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,007
they're probably saying
you gotta change the flat.

104
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,670
...where she'll
give us the latest update...

105
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,680
-lzzy!
-on a continuing story...

106
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,649
we call
"The Horror in Poho County."

107
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,616
Hey, Poho update!

108
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,244
Well, Peter,
the fire which gutted...

109
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,846
an old church south
of Pertwilla four days ago...

110
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,551
continues to offer up
a gruesome bounty.

111
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,094
County sheriffs
excavating the charred ruins...

112
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,597
say the body count is now up
well past three hundred.

113
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,191
County coroners
say the bodies were found...

114
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,496
stitched to each other...

115
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,231
covering the basement's
walls and ceiling.

116
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,398
One on-the-scene witness
called it...

117
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,705
"a human tapestry
of torture and sadism"...

118
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,508
and "a sight
he will never forget."

119
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,309
Sheila,
the details keep getting...

120
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,816
stranger and stranger
every day this week, it seems.

121
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,977
Any new information?

122
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,782
Some of the corpses
they have found...

123
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,083
had false teeth
made out of wood.

124
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,523
That means some of the bodies
they're finding down there...

125
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,787
are over two hundred years old.

126
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,193
But, Peter, it's
the condition of the cadavers...

127
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,391
that's
the strangest fact of all.

128
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,900
The county coroner's office
reported yesterday...

129
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,062
that they have yet to find
any one complete body.

130
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,572
-Believe that, man?
-No, they're making it up.

131
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,700
...missing an external limb
or an internal organ.

132
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,209
What connection this has--

133
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,613
This is 226, out on east 9.

134
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,514
We are down and disabled.
Home base, do you read me?

135
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,144
You get a good look
at the points on this thing?

136
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,191
It's either ivory
or some kind of bone.

137
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,819
Throw that damn thing away
before you need a tetanus shot.

138
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,365
This is Betty Gorman out on 226.

139
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,831
We are down and disabled
out on east 9.

140
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,119
Pop!

141
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,558
Pop, it dropped something!

142
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,930
Pop?

143
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,561
It was out in the corn, papa.

144
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,141
Here, look at it.

145
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,589
We are out on east 9. We are
down and disabled. Come back.

146
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,585
-What about Kimball, man?
-Say again.

147
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,324
This is 226. Anyone read me?

148
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,924
We are down and disabled
out on east 9. Come back.

149
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,801
We gotta be in some kind of
sun spot or something.

150
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,400
There's no signal getting out.

151
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,844
It's going to be dark
in about an hour.

152
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,246
Well, we still got five tires
on the ground which means...

153
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,251
we can probably limp home
if we keep the going slow.

154
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,591
Say again, this is 226.
Anyone read me?

155
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,059
All of you at the same time?

156
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,891
Lady cheerleaders!

157
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,162
That's not smoke I smell,
is it?

158
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,197
Minxie...

159
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,364
there's not a girl
in the world these days...

160
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,374
stupid enough
to kill themselves...

161
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,741
by sucking on cancer sticks,
am I right?

162
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,785
Back on the bus, ladies.

163
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,629
You saw me, right?

164
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,793
Run that fast break? Huh?
You see that?

165
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,632
-Yeah, I saw it.
-Anybody gonna read about it?

166
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,302
Why do you give ol' Dante
back there so much ink, huh?

167
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,277
I'm serious.

168
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,975
People are starting to think
that you're sweet on him.

169
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,983
Really? I heard that was you.

170
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,712
Hey, it's OK if you are, man.

171
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,913
I mean,
live and let love, right?

172
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,423
Why don't you piss
on somebody else's shoes, Jake?

173
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,152
Shouldn't you be
folding towels somewhere...

174
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,318
or sniffing jockstraps?

175
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,760
You think you can manage
the team, super genius?

176
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,196
Was I even talking to you,
jockstrap boy?

177
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,995
Hey, eat shit, Jake! God!

178
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,866
So this is all because, what,
I don't write enough about you?

179
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,637
You know what the story is
on your scars there, right?

180
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,800
No, tell me.

181
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,378
Got into a fight
when you snuck into a bar.

182
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,470
So?

183
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,014
A gay bar, bro.

184
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,746
You do know what they call you,
don't you, lzzy?

185
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,447
That's my name.

186
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,390
"Or isn't he?"

187
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,489
Hey, let's not make this...

188
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,192
a social event out there,
everybody.

189
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,464
Back on the bus, gentlemen.
We're moving!

190
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,698
Big K,
does that come in a man size?

191
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,298
That means you, too, Kimball!
Let's go!

192
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,442
Smooth move, Big K! Nice, man!

193
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,953
Tippi Hedren, man!

194
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,184
Kimball!
Stop clowning around...

195
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,884
and get your ass
back on the bus!

196
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,295
Off the top, gentlemen.

197
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,798
Assholes and elbows. Let's go.

198
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,200
Damn!

199
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,420
You know,
you could talk about it.

200
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,250
It might help a little bit.

201
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,952
What did I play today,
twelve minutes?

202
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,257
Well, it was
a great twelve minutes.

203
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,162
Hanna's got it in for me--

204
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,134
him and his little
token white boy Barnes.

205
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,498
I don't know...

206
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,701
maybe I got the wrong skin color
to get equal play on this team.

207
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,970
I know you don't mean that.

208
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,206
Maybe they just wanted
to make sure...

209
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,808
everyone got a chance to play
in the championship.

210
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,888
Everyone's not the reason why
we made it to the championship.

211
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,650
Half the losers on this bus
had nothing to do with...

212
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,487
us making it to state--I did.

213
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,353
What the fuck
are you looking at?

214
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,922
Oh, Jesus Christ!

215
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,549
Aw, don'ttell me.

216
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,176
-We blew the other one.
-How?

217
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,653
Back down, everybody. Sit tight.

218
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,122
Shit. We better
break out the flares...

219
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,955
and get these kids off the bus.

220
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,995
Hey, hey, hey!

221
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,961
You want to sit in here
and hope somebody doesn't...

222
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,592
come along, plowing into us
doing ninety, huh?

223
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,034
All right, Duane...

224
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,333
you clear the bus,
I'll set the flares.

225
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,803
What is that, a flare gun?

226
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,846
You plan on being lost at sea
in this thing?

227
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,415
You making fun of my lockbox?

228
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,574
'Cause everything
in this thing...

229
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,879
has saved my sweet ass
at least once.

230
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,749
Oh, I don't believe it.

231
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,086
All right, bring your coats
and stay in a group.

232
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,433
This is Betty Borman,
out on 226.

233
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,732
We're broke down on east 9...

234
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,329
middle of Kissel County.
Anyone read me?

235
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,739
Want me to help you push it
off the road before I go?

236
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,244
I don't think we can move it.
It's on a bare rim in the back.

237
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,339
If you'd let the highway patrol
know, we'd appreciate it.

238
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,781
Sure.

239
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,296
Come on, guys.

240
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,368
Come on, let's go. Off the road.

241
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,865
Come on, guys.

242
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,109
Everyone on the shoulder.
Everyone stays in a group.

243
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,239
Over by the side of the fence.

244
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,619
Scott, come on!

245
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:05,585
Everyone stays back
and off the road! Now!

246
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,493
Stuck in the side
of the tire again.

247
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,472
Oh, God. Don't tell me...

248
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,841
that's a belly button
in the middle of that thing.

249
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,774
Minxie, stay off the road.

250
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,580
Everybody, off the road!

251
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,212
Get everyone back on the bus.

252
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,382
-You just said they shouldn't--
-I know what I just said...

253
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:37,552
but there's something going on
out here, and I don't like it.

254
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,527
I think if we just st--

255
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,751
Coach?

256
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,296
What the f...

257
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,430
Where the hell's the coach?

258
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,666
Charlie?

259
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,476
Charlie!

260
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,888
Get everyone back inside
and close the doors.

261
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,590
OK, champions,
getting back on the Betty Boop.

262
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,099
Bucky, get on the two-way,
see if you can raise anyone.

263
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,135
-I'm talking to you, Scotty!
-What happened to the coach?

264
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,604
Get everyone back onboard
and close those doors.

265
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,174
Do it, Scotty.

266
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,743
All right, you heard him.

267
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,014
Assholes and elbows.
Everybody back on the bus.

268
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,320
Charlie?

269
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,194
Charlie?

270
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,796
Hurry up!
On the bus! Now, now, now!

271
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,802
I repeat, bus number 226...

272
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,496
Charlie!

273
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,470
We have an emergency situation
out here.

274
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:30,768
Does anybody read me?

275
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,544
This is bus number 226.
We are broke down on east 9.

276
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:17,680
Jake...

277
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,522
What happened?

278
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,056
-What did you see?
-What did you see?

279
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,398
Come on!
Did you see something or not?

280
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,969
She flew away.

281
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,107
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

282
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,181
-What I just said!
-People don't fly away!

283
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,408
Sit down, Scott!

284
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,745
What the hell's going on
out there?

285
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,979
I said sit the fuck down
and shut up, god damn it! Now!

286
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:57,183
You, too, Jake. Everybody.

287
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,072
Go sit down, Scott.

288
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,643
-You got a problem with me?
-No. You got one with me?

289
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,871
-Do I what?
-You heard me.

290
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,415
We don't have time for bullshit,
Scotty. Go sit down!

291
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,416
Oh, God!

292
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:24,814
What the hell?

293
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,690
Scotty!

294
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,036
What the fuck?

295
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,205
Get the fucking doors!
Get the fucking doors!

296
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,374
Get the fucking doors!

297
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,315
What was it?

298
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,586
Scotty, what the fuck was it?

299
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,896
-Scotty, come on!
-Scotty, we just want to know.

300
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,989
I don't know what it was,
all right?

301
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,839
It had wings--

302
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,477
big fucking wings.

303
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,335
Central, this is unit 17.

304
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,505
We did a drive-by
in the general area.

305
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,415
Also found no evidence
of forced entry. Over.

306
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,885
0-3-2,
we're 10-7 at Opper's Diner...

307
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,515
for a little coffee and pie.
Copy that, central?

308
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,719
This is central.
Copy that, 0-3-6.

309
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,931
All units,
anybody else getting...

310
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,558
some weird stuff
out Kissel County way?

311
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,398
I just got two calls,
ten miles apart...

312
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,472
both reporting abductions.

313
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,871
All units,
be informed this should be...

314
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,275
strictly 10-36 information.

315
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,075
Someone burning a marijuana
field out there tonight?

316
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,912
'Cause these two stories
are way, way out.

317
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,815
Roger that, 3-6. Come back.

318
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,979
Jacky! Kissel County!

319
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,681
If you ask me,
this is Poho related.

320
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,189
Repeat--Poho related.

321
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,021
You all know
what I'm talking about.

322
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,788
This is Andy Buck.
Can anybody hear me?

323
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,264
Nobody's phone works.
Nobody's fucking phone works.

324
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,166
We are stuck
in a broken-down school bus...

325
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,433
out on east 9,
and we are in serious trouble.

326
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,508
Do you read me?

327
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:37,844
Fuck! Come on!
Is anybody even out there?

328
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,007
This is Andy Buck!

329
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:44,384
We're stuck in a broken-down
school bus out on east 9!

330
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,615
Javelins?

331
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,853
We've got spears on this bus?

332
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,359
Sticks.

333
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,894
You want to wait around...

334
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,657
so you can poke at that thing
with sticks?

335
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,891
That thing
shows up here again...

336
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,331
I'd rather have a sharp stick
in my hand than nothing at all.

337
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,802
Hey, guys! Betty's flare gun.

338
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,600
Abunch offlaresforit,too!

339
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,835
Who says we wait around?
I'm serious.

340
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:09,504
Scotty, you're not talking
about getting off this bus.

341
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,514
You see that?

342
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,410
That means
that there's a farm...

343
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,817
down at the end of this road
somewhere...

344
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,185
and that's as far as
anybody'd have to get to.

345
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,888
With that thing out there?

346
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,665
Scotty,
with that thing out there?

347
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,628
Scotty!

348
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,364
That thing hasn't been
back here in almost an hour.

349
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,633
That doesn't mean it's not
still up there somewhere.

350
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,901
And that doesn't mean
that it is.

351
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,170
Hey, this isn't about
who can run the fastest, OK?

352
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,508
-Or being a pussy.
-What is your problem?

353
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,547
-You tell me, lzzy or isn't he?
-Check yourselves, both of you!

354
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,707
Do I make you nervous?

355
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,943
Thinking you're going
to come onto me...

356
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,144
and every other swinging dick
on this bus makes me nervous.

357
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,084
Yeah, it makes you
fucking stupid, too!

358
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,522
Scotty, stop it!

359
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,991
Stop it!

360
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,494
Scotty, come on.

361
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,996
You get that hand off of me...

362
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,661
or we're gonna have one more
missing person out here.

363
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,602
There's nothing about
any of us on this bus...

364
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,435
that's more important
than sticking together.

365
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,032
It's the only way
we're going to get through this.

366
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,840
You want to play
cock of the walk now, huh?

367
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,314
Now's not the time
for this shit, Scotty.

368
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,782
-Big K, sit.
-I'm serious.

369
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,979
You want to play
cock of the walk, bro?

370
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,824
Why do I think you want
to call me something else?

371
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,493
You want to call me
something else, Scotty?

372
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,794
'Cause I don't think you get...

373
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,631
I can see you thinking it
whether you say it or not.

374
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,432
Just stop it right now.
Both of you, stop it!

375
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:47,773
You guys all worked together
today to win a ball game.

376
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,006
Now that something
really serious happens...

377
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:53,015
you can't even be civil
to each other?

378
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,345
You tell him, not me.

379
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,421
Whatever your trip is,
we ain't got time for this shit.

380
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:58,580
We should all be
looking for ways...

381
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,021
we can defend ourselves
until help gets here.

382
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,284
We have got to move
this piece of shit!

383
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,452
On what, the rim?

384
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,620
Can you drive this thing or not?

385
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,221
We wouldn't get two feet, man!
What do you want me to do?

386
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,344
What the hell does it want?

387
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:39,583
What the fuck?
Is it looking at me?

388
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:50,434
Whatever it is,
it's a smell freak, man.

389
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,080
Get that light off him.

390
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,016
Hey, don't shoot
that thing in here, man!

391
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,644
He's right. It'll fill this
place up like a smokebomb.

392
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,790
Holy shit!

393
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,325
Did that just come off the door?

394
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,590
Bucky, get on those front doors
and get ready to open them.

395
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,392
What, you think
we're gonna run outside?

396
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,330
If he fucking comes inside.

397
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,931
Oh, shit!

398
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,300
Oh, my God!

399
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,152
Minxie?

400
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,325
Minxie?

401
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,263
Is she OK?

402
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,634
Minxie. Minxie.

403
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,967
Minxie?

404
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,311
Minxie?

405
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,833
He eats everything.

406
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,463
-He knows no mercy.
-No one is safe.

407
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:33,751
Every 23rd spring,
for 23 days, it gets to eat.

408
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,652
Eat what?

409
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,166
Eat what?

410
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,366
Eat us.

411
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,447
Minx?

412
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,685
Are you OK?

413
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,920
Look at me.

414
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,863
I thought you were gone, girl.
You passed out. Look at me.

415
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,729
Are you OK?

416
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,233
Your eyes went all the way
in the back of your head.

417
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:24,466
I think he's gone, man.
I'm willing to bet money on it.

418
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,008
You willing to bet
stepping off this bus?

419
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,238
Because that's the real bet.

420
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,610
How long's it been?

421
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,911
It's gone. It came,
it did its thing, it went away.

422
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,646
It went away,
but what the hell was it doing?

423
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,551
What do you think it was doing?

424
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,092
It was picking people out.

425
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,563
What?

426
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:58,074
It can smell something
in people, in their fear--

427
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,666
something that helps it
pick people out.

428
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,074
Pick people out for what?

429
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,945
I don't understand how
you would know that, sweetie.

430
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,914
A dead boy told me.

431
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,495
I think
he was trying to warn me.

432
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,963
He was trying to warn
all of us...

433
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:25,729
that this thing has been around
for thousands of years...

434
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,394
and that nothing
has been able to kill it.

435
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,096
This is a dream you had?

436
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,264
Well, the boy was dead,
so, yes...

437
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,864
I am assuming
that it was a dream, Scotty.

438
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,841
You were waving pom-poms
at people this morning.

439
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,104
Now all of a sudden
you're a psychic hotline?

440
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:36,270
I don't know!

441
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,474
You want to explain it to me?
Because I can't.

442
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,184
The boy was trying to warn us...

443
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,386
that by morning it has
to go back into the earth.

444
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,224
Oh, come on.

445
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,493
Into the ground
for twenty-three more years.

446
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:02,769
And then what?
Lives happily ever after? Huh?

447
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,898
Why don't you clean out
your bong, all right?

448
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,442
Scotty, just listen to her.

449
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:07,635
It is coming back.

450
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,145
This is a dream she had, Rhonda.
Are you going to believe it?

451
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,340
And it doesn't matter
if we're hiding on this bus...

452
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,940
or if we're hiding
under our beds.

453
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,952
It'll find us--

454
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,449
the ones that it picked out.

455
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,468
Minx, take it easy, OK?

456
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,674
The boy told me that...

457
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:51,483
it can smell in our fear
who it wants...

458
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,320
and what from them...

459
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,553
it wants to eat.

460
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,010
Hello. Is anyone out there?

461
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,837
Hello. We have
a serious problem out here.

462
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,542
We need help right away.
Can anybody hear me?

463
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,348
Is anybody out there, please?

464
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,685
We have a--
This is Andy Buck.

465
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,280
We have a serious situation
out here.

466
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,326
Is anybody out there?

467
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,040
Does anybody hear me?

468
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,964
Dad!

469
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,099
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

470
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:50,696
-226, are you still there?
-I'm so fucking still here.

471
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,333
OK, OK. Just say again
what you just told me.

472
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:54,910
We're not playing games here,
right?

473
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,206
Just say it, man.

474
00:46:56,313 --> 00:47:01,580
We are trapped in a broken-down
school bus out on east 9...

475
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,448
and something
is going to kill us...

476
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,419
if we don't get help
out here right away.

477
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,683
Where on 9 east?

478
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,656
In Kissel County.
Are you the cops?

479
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,729
What's trying to kill you?
What are you talking about?

480
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,060
Just tell me,
are you the fucking cops?

481
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,931
Look, now listen to me.
I'm already on the 9...

482
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,163
but it's a big highway
and so is Kissel County.

483
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,364
Are there any landmarks
near you?

484
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:24,770
Are you close to anything?

485
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,241
Yeah, I'm close to peeing
in my fucking pants, man.

486
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,505
Can you just please tell me
that you're on the way?

487
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,282
I can't really judge
the strength of your signal...

488
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:35,578
but it doesn't sound close.

489
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,153
What does that mean, man?

490
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,654
It means it's going to take me
a while to get to you.

491
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,919
Look, we kind of have
a time-critical situation here.

492
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,153
Roger that.

493
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,196
And please tell me that
you're coming with backup...

494
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,958
because
if you're not the cops...

495
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,057
you got to promise me
that you'll call them...

496
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,194
and you'll tell them
that we're stuck out here.

497
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:57,865
I'll call them.
I'll call them right now...

498
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,738
but what you've got to do
is hang on.

499
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:02,903
Can you do that? Hang on.

500
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,417
Keep headed east.

501
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:21,892
Dad?

502
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,933
Just get us out there.

503
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,432
Do it.

504
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,983
Yes!

505
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,430
It's fucking happening, man!
It's fucking happening!

506
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,973
We're being fucking rescued!

507
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,875
Help me! Get this thing off me!

508
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,448
Help! Help! Get this thing off!

509
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,253
Help me! Get this thing off me!

510
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,760
Look out!

511
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,304
Half its fuckin' head's gone.

512
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:41,790
Fuck.

513
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,820
-You gotta be...
-Fucking kiddin' me.

514
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,274
Get that door open.
Now's our chance.

515
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,673
It's dead, right?

516
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,474
Don't know. Don't care.

517
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,071
It won't open!

518
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,658
Stop pushin' on 'em!
They open in!

519
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,190
Something got screwed up!

520
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:28,959
The door opens.

521
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,399
Maybe it only opens
from the outside.

522
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,769
It's an emergency exit, idiot.

523
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,036
Then you fuckin' open it, man!

524
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:43,009
Get that door open.

525
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:57,056
How can both fuckin' exits
not fuckin' work?

526
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,890
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

527
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,122
He jammed it.

528
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,295
We thought
it was trying to come in...

529
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,994
but this frickin' thing
was making sure...

530
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,900
we couldn't get out.

531
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,641
Break the fuckin' doors!

532
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,352
Holy shit, man.

533
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:09,592
Hey, we can
pry this thing open.

534
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:15,660
Give me a pole or a bar or
something metal--something big.

535
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,468
Yeah, yeah. That'll work.

536
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,816
Come on, D.
You need to get to this side.

537
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,583
Come on, everybody. Come on.

538
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:40,926
This thing's like
a fuckin' shower curtain, man.

539
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,258
It's crazy.

540
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,867
Oh, man,
show like you got a pair.

541
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,372
Man, fuck you.

542
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,271
Come on.

543
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,371
Everybody, let's go.

544
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,157
Shower curtain?

545
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,124
This thing's like
a fucking piece of toilet paper.

546
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,543
What's it doing, Minx?

547
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,273
What's it doing, Minx?

548
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:41,111
What's it doing up there?

549
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,873
It just tore its head off.

550
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:39,824
It's time to go.

551
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,106
What are you talking about,
man? Help is coming.

552
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:48,609
The 9 is big. Remember?

553
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:53,114
What if he's an hour away?

554
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,150
What's if he's going
in the wrong direction?

555
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,048
There are fucking cops
on the way, man.

556
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,313
And you want the rest of us...

557
01:00:58,421 --> 01:00:59,888
to sit underneath
that big hole in the roof...

558
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,651
and hope that thing
doesn't come crashing in here?

559
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:05,988
What do you mean,
the rest of us?

560
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,222
I mean...

561
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,391
it's time to stop being polite.

562
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:15,164
There are two classes
of people on this bus now.

563
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:18,263
It had its pick
of twenty of us back there...

564
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:19,568
and it picked who?

565
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:23,043
Dante was one.

566
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:25,880
Another one was you, Jake.

567
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,643
Oh, god damn it, Scott.
Don't--

568
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,548
And we all saw him
go for you, Bucky.

569
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:33,713
What the hell
is that supposed to mean, huh?

570
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,791
Two classes of people?

571
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,725
What, the "will be eaten"
and the "won't be eaten"?

572
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:40,261
Fuck you, Scotty.

573
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,030
Minxie says this thing...

574
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:44,929
gets anybody it picks out,
no matter what.

575
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,763
Don't put me in this.

576
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,632
She also said
that after tonight...

577
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,298
it goes away,
and for a long time, Scott.

578
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:54,137
You tell us, Minxie.

579
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,905
Are we safe if we can hide out
till morning...

580
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:59,106
or is this thing
gonna come after these guys...

581
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,651
with everything it's got
'cause it only has till morning?

582
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:07,884
Huh?

583
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,128
We're screwed, right?

584
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,093
Yeah.

585
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,035
Scotty, you're not talkin'...

586
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,766
about throwing people
off this bus?

587
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,501
It's funny
you should say that, D...

588
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:27,667
'cause the only other one...

589
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,142
we know it picked out
for sure was you.

590
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,712
Whoa! Hold on a second!

591
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,678
We all saw the way
it sniffed you out back there.

592
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,909
You were the only one
it gave tongue action, man...

593
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:37,178
-and we all saw it.
-Scotty!

594
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:40,050
I don't understand
what you're trying to do.

595
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,384
I'm trying to stay alive.

596
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:42,890
You're trying to split us up!

597
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:48,658
We have just dropped a notch
on the fucking food chain, man.

598
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:57,468
This is about
living or dying now, OK?

599
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,672
And if this bus
is the only thing...

600
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,176
keeping that fucker
away for us...

601
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,644
how safe are we, you guys...

602
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:08,513
with everybody it's hungry for
sittin' inside it?

603
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:14,149
I want to see hands.

604
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:19,154
I want to see hands...

605
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,992
'cause as shitty a deal
as it is...

606
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:29,027
I gotta say I'd like you, Bucky,
and Jake off this bus, man.

607
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,298
You listen to me,
you piece of shit!

608
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,870
He looked at you, too, bro.

609
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,109
I saw him, and you did, too.

610
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:46,587
He looked right at you
and smiled.

611
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,249
And when you made Jake
take the lights off it...

612
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,156
he could've looked at you twice
and licked his fucking lips...

613
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,456
but we don't know that.

614
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,795
So you keep
your little blacklist.

615
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,597
'Cause when he takes you out--
and I hope he does--

616
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,437
I'm gonna be the one
gettin' as far away...

617
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:08,169
from your sorry ass as I can.

618
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,179
"Time to go" is right.

619
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,486
-I'm gonna go find that farm.
-Then I'm going with you.

620
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,182
You know I'm coming.

621
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,922
You want to keep this bus?

622
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,725
Then you sit in it.

623
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,926
Right under that big hole.

624
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,003
See how long you last.

625
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,074
Look, I'm sorry, D.

626
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,167
You are so right about that.

627
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:48,014
Come on, guys.

628
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,917
Come on, help is on the way.

629
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,715
Why are we splitting up?

630
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,153
He said he was coming.

631
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,350
We're gonna leave,
and he's gonna pull up.

632
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:59,553
That bus is a deathtrap, Bucky.
Use your head.

633
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,459
You're really gonna
let them go alone?

634
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,895
What, do you want
to go with them?

635
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,489
We don't know who it picked out.

636
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,659
Jesus Christ,
it looked at everyone.

637
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,006
Scotty, let go of me.

638
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:15,077
-Let go of you?
-Let go of me!

639
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,247
Fuck.

640
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,588
Rho...

641
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,428
tell me you're really
walking away from me.

642
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,468
You used me. You used all of us!

643
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,469
All you care about is yourself.

644
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:43,629
Rho...

645
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,970
You want to know, Scotty,
what I found out today?

646
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,566
When people get really scared...

647
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,475
it's just like
when they get drunk.

648
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:52,479
The real person
comes to the surface.

649
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,913
We could've protected
D and Jake and all of us...

650
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:56,314
if we'd stuck together!

651
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,319
You know, like in a team.

652
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,480
Hey. Hey!

653
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:10,692
Jonny!

654
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,631
-Open the door!
-Open the door!

655
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:17,228
Open the door!

656
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,776
You little cocksucker!
I will fucking fry you!

657
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,936
You open these goddamn doors!
You open them right now!

658
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:27,504
Jonny, open the fucking doors,
man! Open the--

659
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,917
Open the--
This is my bus, too, man!

660
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:40,225
Run!

661
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,431
Run! He's right behind you, D!

662
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,592
Run! Run!

663
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:29,442
Get back! Get off! Break off!

664
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,220
Oh, God!

665
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,643
-Shit!
-Hold on, hold on!

666
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,679
Hold still!

667
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:07,645
Stop moving! Stop!

668
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,082
Come on, Scotty!

669
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:12,746
You're hurting him!
You're hurting him!

670
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,413
Get me--

671
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:17,583
-Hold still! Pull it out!
-Hold on!

672
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,724
Stop it! Keep back! Stop moving!

673
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,129
It's in there like it's welded!

674
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:27,327
Pull that out!
You're hurting him!

675
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,835
Stop it, Scotty!

676
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,304
-Hold still!
-Stop it, Scotty!

677
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,965
Izzy, hold him! Hold him!

678
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,975
Scotty, hold still!

679
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:37,375
Scotty, hold still!

680
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:43,312
Get it!

681
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:45,148
Please fuckin' hurry!

682
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,118
Oh, God!

683
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,792
Oh, shit! Please hurry!

684
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,122
Oh, God! Please hurry!

685
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,629
Oh, D, I'm sorry, man!
I'm so sorry!

686
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,562
Please fuckin' help!

687
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,769
Scotty! Scotty!

688
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:11,210
Scotty! Scotty!

689
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,838
Scotty! Scotty!

690
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:18,545
Damn it! Scotty! Scotty!

691
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,114
What is it, boy? What is it?

692
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,815
Papa!

693
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,336
Go. Go!

694
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,781
Where did you come from?

695
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,614
From that bus?

696
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:33,092
How far up ahead?

697
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,389
Huh?

698
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:37,530
Come on, answer me.

699
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,393
It doesn't matter.

700
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:45,936
There's no one on the bus,
and you can't kill it.

701
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:52,871
Jacky, get the dog inside.

702
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,415
Look, you can't stop it!

703
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,677
You get in the cabin
with Jack Jr.

704
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,650
You stay down till this is over.

705
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,722
This'll never be over!

706
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,283
It doesn't matter what you do.

707
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,155
It'll be back...

708
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,733
twenty-three years from now...

709
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,359
and twenty-three years
from then.

710
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,840
Get us to that bus.

711
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,090
Jonny?

712
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:39,687
Jonny?

713
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:50,702
What was that?

714
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:58,004
Jonny?

715
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,017
Bucky!

716
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:04,983
What are you doin' here?

717
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,055
What are you doin' here?

718
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,257
You let her in, huh, Jonny?

719
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,327
Have you seen anybody else?

720
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,527
What are you doing?

721
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:24,037
That thing is after you, Bucky.

722
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,505
Hey, there's no farm
out there, man.

723
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:29,406
I must--I must've run ten miles
all over this fuckin' valley.

724
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,342
Bucky...

725
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:35,110
come on, just please go away.

726
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:38,050
Don't make me
go back out there again, man.

727
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,280
It's fuckin' freaky
out there, man. Please.

728
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:09,935
Get around the bus!

729
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,550
Jacky!

730
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,211
Get us around this bus now!

731
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,448
Now! Get around the bus!

732
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:12,798
Jacky, get out!
Get out of there now!

733
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,006
Jacky!

734
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,742
You all right?

735
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:33,782
Jacky, answer me!

736
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:38,292
Jacky, answer me!

737
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:39,758
Are you OK?

738
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,829
I think so.

739
01:16:56,078 --> 01:17:00,310
Jacky, get us away
from the bus!

740
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:03,976
Come on, let's go!
Get us away from the bus!

741
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,955
Come on, Jacky, go on!
Get us away!

742
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:10,217
Move it!

743
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:20,634
Dad?

744
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,997
-Dad?
-Yeah!

745
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,306
Dad!

746
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,261
All you kids, get down!

747
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,767
Jacky!

748
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,573
Jacky!

749
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,410
You gotta get us
away from the bus now!

750
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:21,349
Come on!

751
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:41,468
Dad!

752
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,180
Dad, get out of there.

753
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,750
The spool's jammed
in the cradle!

754
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:51,250
Dad, just get out!

755
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,753
The cradle's welded
to the truck's frame.

756
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,913
Get out, dad!

757
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:57,514
He'll rip my gun
right out of the truck!

758
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,287
Dad, just get the fuck
out of there!

759
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:31,851
Dad, dad...

760
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,190
are you OK?

761
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:37,563
Dad!

762
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:45,065
Dad?

763
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,603
Dad!

764
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:04,452
You're not going
to believe this...

765
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:06,026
but I think
I found a way out of here.

766
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:12,230
What?

767
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,165
Minxie said it doesn't matter.

768
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,100
It doesn't matter
what Minxie said.

769
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:19,265
Right?

770
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,678
The others might've gotten away.

771
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:27,247
We don't know that.

772
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:28,748
Kimball, too.

773
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:35,647
Hey, nobody gets to decide
we die.

774
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:38,555
No dream, nobody--
nobody gets to decide that!

775
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,957
That is bullshit!

776
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,133
I hope so.

777
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:53,665
Come on, I want to go show you
a big ugly bug.

778
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:00,739
That's the truck
that passed us this morning--

779
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,373
you remember,
with the big bug on top of it?

780
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:03,781
You think we can just
drive away in it?

781
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:05,716
No, but I think I know
how to hot-wire a truck.

782
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,878
That's how I got
in my bar fight.

783
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:08,546
I was trying to steal
somebody's truck.

784
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,625
A gay bar?

785
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:12,625
Jesus Christ.

786
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:20,593
Wherever he was going,
I don't think he made it.

787
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:29,037
Oh, my God.
The keys are in it.

788
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:31,112
Come on, man,
the keys are in it.

789
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,111
It's not birds.

790
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,948
-Come on.
-Fuck!

791
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,181
Shit!

792
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:44,350
D!

793
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:46,951
Go! Go, go!

794
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:51,158
Go, go, go! Go, go!

795
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:52,392
Go, man, go!

796
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,836
I'm a sitting duck
back here, lzzy! Step on it!

797
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:06,675
I've got it floored!

798
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:07,873
Go! Come on, go!

799
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:10,213
-Go faster! Make it go faster!
-I can't!

800
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,282
Go, go!

801
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:17,688
Go, man! Go, go!

802
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,953
Izzy, go!

803
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:23,861
Go! Izzy!
Move this piece of shit!

804
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:27,457
Come on! Come on! Move it!

805
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:30,595
Izzy! Go, go!

806
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:43,110
Izzy, do something!

807
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,152
Izzy!

808
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:49,689
Get down!

809
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:54,390
Izzy!

810
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:57,090
Come on! Come on!

811
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,496
Izzy!

812
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:02,069
Izzy, fucking do something!

813
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,332
-Get out!
-What?

814
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,568
Come on! Come on! Come on!

815
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:11,406
-Get out!
-Are you fucking crazy?

816
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,344
Izzy! Izzy!

817
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:17,282
-Come on! Izzy!
-Stay down!

818
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:20,648
Stay down!

819
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:34,142
It isn't dead.

820
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:42,048
Its time ran out.

821
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:02,069
It looks dead to me.

822
01:34:27,094 --> 01:34:28,425
You Taggart?

823
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:29,587
That's right.

824
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:33,297
Can we see it?

825
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:34,766
Can you read?

826
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,271
This something real?

827
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:47,476
Because I heard
it was a bunch of bullshit.

828
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:49,344
It's still five bucks.

829
01:34:52,386 --> 01:34:53,876
Where'd it come from?

830
01:34:56,223 --> 01:34:57,850
My dad killed it.

831
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:59,687
Yeah, but where'd it come from?

832
01:35:01,662 --> 01:35:03,459
It's five bucks from you, too.

833
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,459
How'd he kill it?

834
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,039
Ask him.

835
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:50,735
Come on, man.

836
01:35:50,845 --> 01:35:53,643
We ought to go get
our money back.

837
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:57,446
What the hell is it?

838
01:35:57,551 --> 01:35:59,075
What do you think it is?

839
01:36:09,029 --> 01:36:11,827
We don't touch it.

840
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:24,336
What's the story on this thing?

841
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:28,508
Whatever you've heard, probably.

842
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:31,949
You expect us to think
that that thing's real?

843
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:33,519
Don't really care.

844
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,452
How'd you kill it?

845
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:42,391
Stabbed it
right through the heart...

846
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:45,932
with a big homemade harpoon.

847
01:36:54,108 --> 01:36:55,632
When?

848
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:59,539
About twenty-three years ago.

849
01:37:02,416 --> 01:37:04,850
You waiting for something?

850
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:11,057
About three more days...

851
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:17,055
give or take a day or two.
