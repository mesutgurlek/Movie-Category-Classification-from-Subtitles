1
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Life... upon my life.

2
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ohh. So beautiful.

3
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I know.

4
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They're coming.

5
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't worry. Don't Worry.

6
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll take care of you.

7
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Did you understand everything?

8
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's very important.

9
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
All right?

10
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's go then.

11
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm coming.

12
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We know. We saw them coming.

13
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Now, don't be frightened.

14
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.

15
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm going to hide you...

16
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
... in a nice, safe place.

17
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What a shame we did not have more time.

18
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Andre Toulon?

19
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Mr. Toulon.

20
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You can't save her, Alex.

21
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Do you see something, ma'am?
Oh, yes.

22
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I see many great things for you.

23
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah?

24
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You have a wonderful life 
ahead of you, young lady.

25
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you see marriage, maybe?

26
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Most definitely.

27
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
In a very short period of time, 
you two are gonna be happily married.

28
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And you are gonna to have...

29
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
...a little boy.

30
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No...
Yes, you are...

31
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He's a rambunctious little buddy,
but he's gonna be a good little boy.

32
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And then you're gonna have a little girl.

33
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You know, ma'am, that's really 
great. I like that, but, umm...

34
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
...do you think Buddy here's ever gonna get...

35
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
...a real job?

36
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I see retail sales.

37
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What?

38
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Retail sales?
No, ma'am. I'm sorry.

39
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You better look again, because...

40
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Buddy here, he flunked out of the tenth grade...

41
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
... I don't see how he can be in retail sales.

42
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But you see here I see construction.

43
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I see you working as a foreman...

44
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
... of a construction company...

45
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
... in a retail store.

46
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Kind of like an enormous shopping mall.

47
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You are gonna to be a rich man.

48
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You are gonna to build a shopping mall.

49
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes, sir, you are gonna to be a rich man.

50
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, maybe I will marry him, then.

51
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I sit next to a very rich man.

52
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm a gold mine.

53
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What else do you see, ma'am?

54
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
All I think I see is your grandmother.

55
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
She isn't going to be around very long.

56
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
My grandmother's already dead, ma'am.

57
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, it's...

58
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
... it's really your grandmother.

59
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, Buddy.
I'm sorry.

60
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Ma'am?

61
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think something's wrong with her.

62
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
- Ready, Carlissa?
- Yes.
- Ok

63
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Now commencing real-time thought 
transmission experiment...

64
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
... RT 638.

65
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Passive subject: Andrea Clark.

66
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Active subject: Carlissa Stamford.

67
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
All right, Andrea.

68
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I want you to recreate in your mind...

69
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
... your wildest sexual fantasy...

70
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
... paying particular attention to the details.

71
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
All right?

72
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Good.

73
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
All right, Carlissa?

74
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes.

75
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Begin sequence...

76
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
... now.

77
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Are you getting anything about a man...

78
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
... on a horse, in the rain?

79
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No.

80
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Now she's running down the beach...

81
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
... and she's naked.

82
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
He's getting very close to her.

83
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're not getting any of this?

84
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No.
Why am I getting this...

85
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
... and you're not?

86
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This little girl has a very vivid imagination.

87
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Alex.

88
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Hello, Alex.
We were expecting your call.

89
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You've had contact too, then?

90
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, last night while we were experimenting.

91
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It was very, very strong.

92
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What... what does it mean?

93
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Why all of us at once?

94
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It means Gallagher located...

95
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
... the old puppet master's hiding place.

96
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
...and he's calling for some kind of a meeting.

97
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We also received a call from the white witch.

98
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, you mean Dana?

99
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes...
... the lovely Dana.

100
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
She knows the location.

101
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's an old hotel on the Californian coast...

102
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
... called the Bodega Bay Inn.

103
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I want you to come along, Alex.

104
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We'll need all our collected powers.

105
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Dana feels that this is not 
going to be a friendly meeting.

106
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well, I don't know who they think they are.

107
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
... just barging in here out of the blue.

108
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
They're probably the friends Neil said would come.

109
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
They don't look like friends to me.

110
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
They look more like trouble.

111
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Shhh. Theresa, don't be rude.

112
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Hello.
I'm Megan Gallagher.

113
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Somebody married Neil?

114
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Hi, I'm Alex Whitaker.

115
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm Frank Forrester.

116
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This is Dana Hadley and...

117
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
... Carlissa Stamford.

118
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Hello.

119
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I hope this visit wasn't entirely unexpected.

120
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No, no. Neil told me you'd be coming.

121
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And where might old Neil be?

122
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I thought you knew.

123
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Knew what?

124
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He shot himself.

125
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But why?

126
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's the hard part.
I don't know why.

127
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He left a note...

128
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
... but all he said was 
he didn't want to be buried...

129
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
... until you all arrived.

130
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So now that you're here, we'll bury him tomorrow.

131
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You can stay.

132
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Of course.

133
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
No problem.

134
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, I'll show you to your rooms,
and then we'll see about some dinner.

135
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Excuse me, Mrs. Gallagher.

136
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Would you mind if...

137
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
... we stayed behind a while...

138
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
... to pay our respects?

139
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No, not at all.

140
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I think Neil would appreciate that.

141
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Thank you.

142
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Thank you.

143
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't touch the body.

144
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Frank, what the hell is
going on around here?

145
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And how is it that we didn't pick up...

146
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
... on the fact that he was dead?

147
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't know.

148
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Somehow he was able to block the image...

149
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
... when he...

150
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
... send that signal to us.

151
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What are you doing?

152
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Just making sure he is what he appears to be.

153
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Charming.

154
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Dead as a doornail.

155
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
How did you know Neil?

156
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, he and I worked together on a project.

157
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm a professor of anthropology 
at Yale University.

158
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You're staring at me.

159
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Sorry.

160
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's just that Neil was...

161
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
... so obsessed with his work...

162
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
... it's hard to imagine him...

163
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
... taking time-out to get married.

164
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
These rooms, they haven't been used...

165
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
... for quite a while.

166
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You know people used to come here...

167
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
...just to see this place from all over?

168
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The Queen of England came here once.

169
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I took care of her myself.

170
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That's an interesting aroma.

171
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What is it?

172
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
A Korean dragon's blood.

173
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What are you doing?

174
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm cleaning your etheric body.

175
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What?

176
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's for protecting.

177
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Listen to me.
You are in great danger.

178
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Do not go near the fireplace,
whatever you do.

179
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Why?

180
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Don't go near the fireplace.

181
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I have to go.
I have work to do.

182
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This isn't gonna to be easy.

183
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
There's my little darling.

184
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Hello, sweetheart.

185
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I bet you are starving to death.

186
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Got you a ??? dog.

187
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You can't save her, Alex.

188
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Right this way.

189
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Pity about dear Neil.

190
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Were you friendly with him?

191
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Not very.

192
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Sorry to hear that.

193
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What's wrong?

194
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Something happened in this elevator.

195
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Something...

196
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
What?

197
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
A man forcing a woman to have sex.

198
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What man?

199
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What man?

200
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It was Gallagher.

201
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That woman wasn't his wife.

202
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What is she talking about?

203
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Please, don't interfere.

204
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What is it?
She's experiencing the past.

205
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Tell me.

206
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It was horrible...

207
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
... what he did to her...

208
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Oh, god.

209
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Please don't bring up any of this...

210
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
... around Mrs. Gallagher.

211
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
She's upset enough...

212
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
... as it is.

213
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Wouldn't want to have disturbed Mrs. Gallagher.

214
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Don't worry.

215
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Oh my god, Frankie!
What?

216
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This is a movie star bed.

217
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Not now, Carlissa.

218
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
No, really.

219
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Two famous movie stars...

220
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
... had a wild night in this bed.

221
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Come feel it.

222
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Stop it!

223
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
This is business.
We're focusing on Gallagher...

224
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
... remember?

225
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You know I can't help it, Frankie.

226
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I know, baby.
It's just that...

227
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
... I don't want you becoming distracted.

228
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
We have to use your gifts...

229
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
... to find out what Gallagher was doing here.

230
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Oh my god!

231
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
They did it right in this bed.

232
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Who?

233
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Clark Gable and Carole Lombard.

234
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Clark Gable and...

235
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
... Carol Lombard.

236
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Hello.

237
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Did everybody get settled in all right?

238
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yes, thank you.

239
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
This hotel seems to have quite 
a history, Mrs. Gallagher.

240
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes, it does.

241
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's been in my family 
since the turn of the century.

242
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
My parents operated it till they died...

243
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
... a few years ago.
Thank you, Theresa.

244
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Miss Megan...

245
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
We are just so curious to hear...

246
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
... about you and your...

247
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
... dear Gallagher.

248
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Well.

249
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I've met Neil when he was staying here...

250
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
... working on a project.

251
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We became friends...

252
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
... and when my parents died...

253
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
... he helped me through some rough times.

254
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Now, that doesn't sound like 
the Gallagher we all know.

255
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Anyway, it was something of a surprise to me...

256
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
... when he asked me to marry him.
I mean... I liked him a lot.

257
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
He said he loved me...

258
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
... and he offered to help me run this hotel

259
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Now, that sounds...

260
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
... like Gallagher.
He wanted something.

261
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So we got married.

262
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Two years ago next Friday.

263
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
He had so many ideas for the hotel.

264
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
He wanted to renovate it completely.

265
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So we shut it down.

266
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What about his work?

267
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
He didn't really tell me much about it.

268
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I knew it was important to him.

269
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I didn't want him to stop.

270
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Seems like the first year 
of our marriage he spent...

271
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
... most of his time supervising 
construction all over the place.

272
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
They really tore it apart.

273
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Then...

274
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
One day he just stopped everything...

275
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
... and from the next year 
he spent almost every day...

276
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
... locked up with his work.

277
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I really didn't know what to do.

278
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I would've kicked that bastard out on his ass.

279
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Dana...

280
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
If you have something to say...

281
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
... I wish you would say it to me.

282
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
She likes to stir things up.

283
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Don't let her bother you.

284
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Now, Alex...

285
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
The lady has invited me to speak.

286
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I have a wealth of information about her...

287
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
...dear beloved Neil that 
I would love to share with her

288
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Sit down and shut up.

289
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Well, aren't we the excitable one this evening?

290
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Miss Megan.

291
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
There's a question that's 
been burning inside of me.

292
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Did it ever...

293
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
... pass through your sweet...

294
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
... innocent, little mind...

295
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
... that your husband possibly...

296
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
... married you for your money?

297
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Little bit of sauce and Dana becomes

298
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
... quite the cynic, doesn't she?

299
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm not a cynic, Frank.

300
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I prefer to think of myself as a...

301
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
... nasty bitch.

302
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That's enough, Dana.

303
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Fuck you, you Ivy League tard-ass.

304
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And who's kidding who.
We all know why we're here.

305
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So why continue the pitiful charade...

306
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
... of the grave widow?

307
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The truth is, honey...

308
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
... your husband was...

309
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
... a despicable...

310
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
... greedy bastard.

311
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
He screwed us...

312
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
... now we mean to even the score.

313
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Do I make myself clear?

314
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Perfectly.

315
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You're some piece of work.

316
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Did I say something?

317
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She usually isn't like this.

319
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm so confused.

320
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Who are you people?

321
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Well...
Some would call us...

322
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
... magicians.

323
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
To some degree, we all have 
unusual psychic powers.

324
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Your husband brought us together 
several years ago...

325
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
... to try to help in his research.

326
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
He and Frank began to study in the ancient...

327
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
... Egyptian methods of the old.

328
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And they found evidence...

329
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
... that the Egyptians have 
developed a secret method...

330
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
... of giving life to inanimate figurines.

331
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Then the secrets were passed on to...

332
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
... select few who knew and practiced magic.

333
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Dana there makes a living telling fortunes.

334
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
She used her powers to help your husband...

335
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
... locate the last true alchemist...

336
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
... of the modern times...

337
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
... a famous puppet master in the twenties.

338
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And what about Carlissa?

339
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Well, your husband brought her in because of...

340
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
... her skills in psychometry.
- Which means?

341
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I mean... she can reconstruct...

342
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
... the emotional history of an object...

343
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
... by touch or feel.

344
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Like what?

345
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
She could sit in a car...

346
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
...tell you who owns it...

347
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
... sit on a bed and tell you 
its entire history.

348
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, I see.

349
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
- What about you?
- What do you do?

350
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
- I dream.
- Everybody dreams.

351
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Sure, but not about things to come.

352
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It wouldn't kill you to
act like normal people.

353
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I may need a day off.

354
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Somebody there?

355
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
What happened?

356
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
She feinted.

357
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Look.

358
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Is he alive?

359
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
No, he's dead.

360
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Believe me.
He's dead.

361
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Starting tomorrow...

362
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
... we're going to tear this place apart.

363
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I think Andre Toulon's secret is right here.

364
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Doesn't make sense.

365
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
If he found it...

366
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
... why kill himself?

367
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And who's fooling around with the body?

368
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I never did trust this son of a bitch.

369
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
What's he up to?

370
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Maybe it's Mrs. Gallagher 
who's up to something?

371
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That wasn't a dream I had, was it?

372
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I don't understand.

373
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Who would do that?

374
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Well, we think it was Theresa.

375
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Theresa?

376
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Where is Teresa?

377
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
We can't find her.
We looked all over.

378
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Take it easy.

379
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Why did you come here?

380
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I had to.

381
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Why?

382
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I had this dream and I came here...

383
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
... to make sure it didn't come true.

384
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Oh my god!

385
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
What's wrong?

386
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Two women.

387
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Maybe.

388
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The Second World War.

389
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And?
Details.

390
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
They spent their entire leave...

391
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
... in this tub.

392
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Listen, darling, as long you're going...

393
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
... to be fooling around in there...

394
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
... see if you can pick up on Neil Gallagher...

395
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
... and that young wife of his, of course.

396
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Shut up.

397
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Sweet dreams...

398
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
What are you doing, Frank?

399
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Preparing for tonight's experiment.

400
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Suppose we found it, Frank...

401
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
... What Andre Toulon's discovered, I mean...

402
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
... What would you do with the power?

403
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
If you had it, I mean.

404
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Well, that's easy.

405
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I'd rule the world.

406
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Do you think she's pretty?

407
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Gallagher's wife, I mean.

408
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Frank.

409
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Frank!

410
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Frank!

411
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Frank...

412
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Frank.

413
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Frank...

414
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah?

415
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You scared the heart of me, you jerk.

416
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Come on, darling.

417
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I just wanted to get you into that
haunted house mood for tonight's work.

418
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What're you doing?

419
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We're all in danger.

420
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
He means to kill us all.

421
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Who does?

422
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Gallagher.

423
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Honey, even the dead have their ways.

424
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Protection.

425
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Thanks.

426
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
December eighth.

427
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
1:46 AM.

428
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Researcher and principle psychometric subject...

429
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
... are about to embark on sexual 
experiment number 517A.

430
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Hopefully, we'll be opening up 
a channel to Neil Gallagher.

431
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The experiment will utilize...

432
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
... various sexual aids and...

433
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
... certain assorted apparatus.

434
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Descriptions to follow.

435
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Sidebar note to transcriber...

436
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
... file under personal documentation...

437
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
... and be sure to annotate the location.

438
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Are you ready?

439
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Ready and willing.

440
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Promise you'll be gentle.

441
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I love it when you do that.

442
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
God, I like this.

443
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
No, no.
Not this time.

444
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You don't get to do anything
but what I want you to do.

445
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Oh, great. That's just great.

446
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Yeah...

447
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I think I'm gonna like this.

448
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Perfect.

449
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
A little life insurance from the white witch.

450
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Leroy, there's gonna be a lot of changes...

451
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
... in the next 24 hours.

452
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
... and it's not going to be promising for you-know-who.

453
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
This is going to be a long night and lonely night, sugar.

454
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I never did get used to those two.

455
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
What are you... what are you doing?
Don't stop.

456
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
My god.
What is it?

457
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The door is open.
I think someone's in the room, Frank.

458
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Untie me, Carlissa.

459
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Come on, untie me.

460
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
What the hell was that?

461
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Frank!
What?

462
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Carlissa, what are you doing?

463
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
God. Don't do this to me, Carlissa.

464
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Shhh. Quiet, Frank..

465
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Carlissa...

466
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's a joke, right?

467
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Carlissa, where are you?

468
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Carlissa, what's happened?

469
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Carlissa, what're you doing?

470
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Carlissa, you know I have no sense of humour.

471
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
You little minx.

472
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
You connected with Gallagher, didn't you?

473
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm ready for...

474
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
What are you going to do to me?

475
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Must be one of those undisclosed 
sexual aids, huh, is it?

476
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Good...

477
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Carlissa, stop that!

478
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Carlissa... you're hurting me!

479
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Carlissa, stop it!

480
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh, Man...

481
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Come on, wear it out...

482
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Give it a rest...

483
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Please, no...

484
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Hmmm? What's that?

485
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Oh, I'm real happy you decided to come
on a trip with me.

486
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yes I am.

487
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Well, it would be an awful lonely trip
if you hadn't come along.

488
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
What are you doing...

489
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
... sneaking around this time of night?

490
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Well, Frank and Carlissa are trying
to rearrange the walls in their room...

491
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
...makes it hard to sleep.

492
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I know what you mean.

493
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Would you like to come in for a little nightcap?

494
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Thanks, but I'd rather do a little wandering.

495
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I was hoping we could do a little...

496
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
... rearranging of the walls ourselves.

497
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I don't think that would be a good idea, Dana.

498
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
No?

499
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
No.

500
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I tried.

501
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Goodnight.

502
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Sweet dreams.

503
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's just me and you, Leroy.

504
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Well, I guess we'll just have 
to entertain each other...

505
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
... like we always do, Leroy.

506
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I know you don't like Alex very much,
but he's all right.

507
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Now, you just sit down...

508
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
... and you stay like a good boy.

509
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Well, look who's here...

510
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
... if it isn't my dear old friend, Gallagher.

511
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Come to make a call?

512
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Now, you can fool the others...

513
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
... but you don't fool me.

514
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I know what you're about.

515
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
We put the dead to rest.

516
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
He won't be bothering us anymore, Leroy.

517
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Motherfucker!

518
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Shit...

519
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Alex!

520
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Wake up.

521
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Alex!

522
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Yeah?

523
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Just a second.

524
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Alex...

525
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I want you to come with me.

526
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I have something I want to show you.

527
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Just...
Let me get my shoes.

528
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Hurry.

529
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I couldn't sleep.

530
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Something about Neil's death kept on bothering me.

531
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It never occurred to me before
that there was a connection between...

532
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
... the old puppet master's death and my husband...

533
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
... but after dinner, it began to make sense.

534
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Neil used to spend hours up here.

535
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I don't know what he was doing exactly, but...

536
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
... he never let me come up.

537
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I thought it was strange.

538
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Didn't really mind it.

539
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I came up here earlier...

540
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
...and I found something in here.
Would you hold that, please?

541
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I told you I wanna show you something.

542
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
You can't save her, Alex.

543
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Stop!

544
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
What's happening, Alex?

545
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Alex!

546
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Wake up!

547
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I want you to come with me.

548
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
What for?

549
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I have something to show you.

550
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Yeah...

551
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Let me get my shoes.

552
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Hurry.

553
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I couldn't sleep.

554
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Something about Neil's death was really bothering me.

555
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It never occurred to me that 
there was a connection between...

556
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
... the old puppet master's death and my husband's...

557
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
...but after dinner, it started to make sense.

558
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Neil used to spend hours up here.

559
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I don't know what he was doing exactly...

560
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
... but he never let me...
... never let you come up.

561
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
You thought it was strange, but
you didn't really mind.

562
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
How did you know?

563
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Well, I'm kind of a magician, remember?

564
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I came up here earlier tonight...

565
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
... and I... I found something in here.

566
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I was looking through Neil's books up here...

567
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
... and I started reading this one.

568
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
This is Andre Toulon's diary.

569
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Listen to this.

570
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Today, I gave them life...

571
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
... using the ancient Egyptian rites of afterlife.

572
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I know that like all my other children,
like my other puppets...

573
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
... they mirror the soul of their master.

574
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
With me, they are harmless, but...

575
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
... I fear what they are capable of...

576
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
... if placed in the wrong hands.

577
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Alex.

578
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Alex, what is it? What's wrong?

579
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Alex.

580
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Alex, what is it?

581
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Hello, Alex.

582
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Bye, Alex.

583
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Are you ok?

584
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Alex.

585
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Come on. Let's go.

586
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
What is it?

587
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Alex.

588
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
They're in the dining-room.

589
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Oh my god.

590
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
We have to get out of here.

591
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
You're not leaving on my account, are you?

592
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
You're dead.

593
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Yes.
I am.

594
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I put a gun in my mouth 
and blew away my vast knowledge.

595
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
And here I am.

596
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Dead.

597
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Megan doesn't understand the metaphysics of it, Alex.

598
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Will you explain it to her, please?

599
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
What's the matter, Alex?

600
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
You're not getting slow on me, are you?

601
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Let me explain.

602
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Metaphysically speaking...

603
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
... I killed myself...

604
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
... and, using the techniques of the old puppet master...

605
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
... I brought myself back to life.

606
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Why?

607
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
That's easy.

608
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I wanna live forever.

609
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
All life eventually ends in death...

610
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
... but, for me, there is no end now.

611
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
You mean... no natural end.

612
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Alex...

613
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
... don't even entertain the thought.

614
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It would take the total destruction of this body...

615
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
... something that you're not capable of.

616
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I'm much stronger now...

617
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
... than I ever was in life.

618
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Why did you kill them?

619
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Why?

620
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Because we are all joined by our thoughts...

621
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
... and sooner or later one of you would have learned...

622
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
... that I have discovered Toulon's secrets.

623
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I had to bring you here.

624
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Besides...

625
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I'm tired of experimenting with silly, little...

626
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
... wooden puppets.

627
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Actually, I wasn't...

628
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
... the first human experiment.

629
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
The first experiment was on her parents.

630
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It was a stroke of luck, actually.

631
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I followed the trail of the old puppet master...

632
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
... to this hotel.

633
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I was always quick with the women.

634
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Right, Alex?

635
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And Megan, ah...
She was so young.

636
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
So east to win over.
No...

637
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Parents...

638
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
... that's another story.

639
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I had no choice...

640
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
... but to kill them.
It was a small price to pay...

641
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
... to live forever.

642
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Bastard!

643
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
What the hell are you looking at?

644
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Don't touch the body.

645
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
It's time to die, Alex...

646
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Stop it!
... so you can live forever.

647
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Stop!

648
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Stop it!

649
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
What the hell do you think you're doing?

650
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Open that door you fucking...

651
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
... little cretin...

652
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
...or I'll chop you into firewood.

653
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You brainless little pinhead.
Get out of my way.

654
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Open this fucking door!

655
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
What the hell do you think you're doing?

656
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Oh, no, you don't.

657
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I'm the master...

658
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
... and you're the puppet.

659
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I'll get you, Alex.

660
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Why...

661
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
No...

662
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
No, no, stop!

663
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
No!

664
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
No!
Stop!

665
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Stop!

666
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Stop!

667
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Well, my cab's waiting...

668
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
You take care of yourself.

669
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Yeah, I will... You too.

670
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
If you ever get to the East, give me a call.

671
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
You have a good trip.

672
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Good dog, Leroy.
