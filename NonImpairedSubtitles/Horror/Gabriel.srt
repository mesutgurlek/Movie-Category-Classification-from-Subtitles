1
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:35,555
<i>Falling is the first thing I feel.</i>

2
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,391
<i>Distant voices echo inside my head.</i>

3
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:45,495
<i>Their orders are clear,
and yet all I can think about is the others.</i>

4
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,837
<i>Remiel.</i>

5
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,406
<i>Uriel.</i>

6
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,344
<i>Amitiel.</i>

7
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,413
<i>Ithuriel.</i>

8
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,314
<i>Raphael.</i>

9
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,015
<i>Michael.</i>

10
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,357
<i>Each one traveled the same path.</i>

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,357
<i>What was their fate?</i>

12
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,687
<i>What awaits me on the other side?</i>

13
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:20,462
<i>They have gone to a place where the light
is cursed and darkness blinds the soul.</i>

14
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,374
<i>This is a place
where even angels fear to tread.</i>

15
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,212
Forgive me.

16
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,566
Freedom

17
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,701
is the potential to challenge yourself

18
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,712
far beyond the constraints
of traditional rule.

19
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,242
We draw strength from our passions.

20
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,652
We're driven by desire.

21
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,692
Even hatred can be a worthy ally
when used against an enemy.

22
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:14,336
And yet, we are told to turn our backs
on these things,

23
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,404
the very feelings, emotions,

24
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,244
that make us all human.

25
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,390
Sounds like you've been listening
to the wrong source.

26
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,392
It would appear so, now, wouldn't it?

27
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,928
You don't like me very much,
do you, Baliel?

28
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:52,535
Strange, because I hear no complaints
from the others.

29
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,445
Is it something I've done?

30
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,455
More like something you haven't.

31
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,988
Then let me put your mind to rest.

32
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,163
You did a good thing to bring him here.

33
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,003
- I'm not sure the others will agree.
- Oh, they will.

34
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:58,567
And as a sign of my appreciation,
I have a gift for you.

35
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:04,546
Do you remember the Arc, Amitiel?

36
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,401
I know you were here.

37
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:29,255
<i>Gabriel.
If you are reading this, then I have failed.</i>

38
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,729
<i>We are far from grace,</i>

39
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,424
<i>further than I could ever imagine.</i>

40
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,901
<i>You will feel things
that will cloud your judgment.</i>

41
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,066
<i>This enemy within is strong
and unpredictable.</i>

42
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,908
<i>Control these emotions,
or the fight cannot be won.</i>

43
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,741
<i>The others have failed.
Learn from them, but do not follow.</i>

44
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,248
<i>You are the last. Michael.</i>

45
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,674
Molloch.

46
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,516
<i>- Be silent.
- Gabriel!</i>

47
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:39,646
<i>Close your mind.</i>

48
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,283
<i>- Silence yourself.
- You can hear me.</i>

49
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,860
<i>Silence your mind.</i>

50
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,395
<i>- They're coming for you.
- Gabriel...</i>

51
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,465
<i>You can hear me.</i>

52
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,797
<i>- Silence your mind. Now!
- Silence your mind. Now!</i>

53
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,874
You looking for someone?

54
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,409
Interesting.

55
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,732
What do you want?

56
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,602
I'm looking for an old friend of mine.

57
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,835
<i>Goes by the name of Uriel.</i>

58
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,546
Not here.

59
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,122
It's very important that I speak with her.

60
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,223
She may be in danger.

61
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,583
The only danger here is
what you've brought with you.

62
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,235
Can you at least just tell me
if she's still alive?

63
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,701
The answer's yes.

64
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,234
- Now I've told you all I know.
- Then tell me where she is.

65
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,248
I've told you all I know.
Now it's time for you to leave.

66
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,453
Where is she?

67
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,198
This time, no lies.

68
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,601
You can't pull that trigger.
You're not allowed.

69
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,164
And why's that?

70
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,806
Your orders are to destroy the Fallen
and bring light back to this place.

71
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,341
You can't kill innocents.

72
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,285
It's against your code.

73
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,621
So get this fucking thing out of my face.

74
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:46,195
Firstly, Uriel is a he, not a she.

75
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:52,666
Secondly, there's not a fucking chance
in hell he's ever coming back.

76
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,235
Where has he gone?

77
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,171
In here,

78
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,170
where no goddamn voices or feelings
or anything else can get at him.

79
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,546
Why would he do that?

80
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,175
You felt it the second you arrived.

81
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,652
It's the burden of being real,

82
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,219
mortal.

83
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,859
<i>They didn't tell us, Gabe,
what it would be like.</i>

84
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,496
They didn't tell us
how fucking hard it would be.

85
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,501
If you're Uriel, then why can't I feel you?

86
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,870
Because I've learned ways to

87
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,708
silence myself.

88
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,908
Then you've turned your back on the order.
You've betrayed your oath.

89
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,216
Well, I am only human, after all.

90
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,257
You are an Arc and a servant of the light...

91
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,419
Put into human form
to walk amongst the living, I know.

92
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,732
<i>Have you ever felt fear, Gabriel?</i>

93
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,758
Because I do.

94
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,802
I feel it all the fucking time.

95
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,470
I hate this place.

96
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,636
I hate myself.

97
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,448
And before I arrived,
I didn't even know what that feeling was.

98
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,479
You can't succumb to it.

99
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,320
You have felt the love and contentment
of a pure existence.

100
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,553
That is where you draw your strength.

101
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,927
And where's that? Can you see it?

102
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,261
All I see is a dead worid,
run by the Fallen.

103
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:36,240
And you know what?
These people seem to like it here.

104
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:43,111
They actually seem to enjoy this existence.
So, why should I fight it?

105
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,073
- Why should I die for them?
- Because they don't know any better.

106
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,747
It is up to us to show them
that there is another way.

107
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,650
That it is worth fighting for.

108
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,784
I give you two weeks,

109
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,158
then we'll see what you say.

110
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,667
Now, how about you
get the fuck out of my face,

111
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:10,867
because, whilst you may be bound
by rules, I am not.

112
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,344
You know the other great thing
they forget to tell you on the way down?

113
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:22,044
If you die here as an Arc or a Fallen,
then you're dead forever.

114
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,384
Even the soul dies.
And I ain't risking that.

115
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,457
Neither should you.

116
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,363
This place is surrounded by darkness.

117
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,564
The light has no way of knowing
what goes on down here.

118
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,540
You can't blame them.

119
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,085
There's one thing I forgot.

120
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,760
I'm sorry, Uriel. I had to do this.

121
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,531
I need you to show yourself.
Heal this wound.

122
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,405
Fuck you.

123
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,610
Please, Uriel. Heal this wound.

124
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,443
You can't let this body die.

125
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,781
You swore an oath. Now, do it!

126
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,123
Uriel?

127
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,830
Watch the door.

128
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,469
They may be coming.

129
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:45,021
Pumps like blood through the veins
of this entire city.

130
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,888
You must be very proud.

131
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,702
If only we could sleep.

132
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,239
You be here about the obeah.
I be thinking Molloch is dead.

133
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,475
It seems they've sent another.

134
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,406
<i>The presence we heard earlier
belonged to the Arc, Gabriel.</i>

135
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,711
Thee be knowing all about these things.

136
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:11,252
With Michael gone, all their hopes
will now lay with our new friend.

137
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:17,324
Unfortunately for them,
Michael was always the stronger of the two.

138
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,592
Well, we all know what happened to him.

139
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:25,863
I still sense the new ángel spirit
is strong in this place.

140
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,166
Which is why we will wait.

141
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,341
Let him fall prey
to the good nature of this city.

142
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,046
And if, in time,
he still has the will for a battle,

143
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,242
then that's exactly what we will give him.

144
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,851
Fuck waiting!

145
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,682
The city is ours.

146
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,553
We kill this Arc and go home!

147
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,155
Patience, Ahriman.

148
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,893
Try to think of it as a game.

149
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,893
They move, we move.

150
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,165
Until all the pieces fall into place.

151
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,933
I don't play fucking games.

152
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:06,334
You have to trust that
this is the safest option for all of us.

153
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,370
This is safe.

154
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,016
And this is safe.

155
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:22,683
Well, you know what would be
the safest thing for you to do right now?

156
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,554
It would be to sit down

157
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,066
and shut the fuck up.

158
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,604
You be in a funny mood tonight, boss.

159
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,143
I just look forward to this being over.

160
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,776
No more conflict.

161
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:00,087
- Pass me one of those.
- You sure you want one?

162
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:04,134
Just because I'm a fucking ángel
doesn't mean I can't smoke.

163
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,998
When I was back in the city,
you spoke to me.

164
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,972
How did you know I was there?

165
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,514
The same way you knew I was here.

166
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,444
It's your connection to the source.

167
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,755
You drew power from the light
in order to listen.

168
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,917
Problem is, that also
exposes your presence.

169
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,359
And you know a way to hide it.

170
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,932
The Fallen can only sense us
if we're in close proximity,

171
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,502
that's why I live so far out here.

172
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,473
If you go using your powers,
drawing from the source,

173
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,168
you're gonna be like a beacon for them.

174
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,644
And chances are the whole fucking lot
will come down on you at once.

175
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:54,608
So you have to conceal your true self,
far enough so they can't see you,

176
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,381
but not so far as you can't come back.

177
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,786
Is that what happened to you?

178
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,360
Not exactly.

179
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,830
But it did contribute.

180
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,301
I want you to close your eyes.

181
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,973
Now, open again.

182
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,581
Right now, you're an ángel
inside of a human form.

183
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,687
What we're trying to do is hide that fact.

184
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,723
So, to everyone out there,
you're completely human.

185
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,560
I want you to search inside,
focus on your spiritual self,

186
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,064
connect and feel it as a whole.

187
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,697
Now, close your eyes.

188
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,749
There you go.

189
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,221
- Yeah?
- Because it's like, I get them in,

190
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,120
it's up to you to keep them in.

191
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,284
I say, take pride in
every part of your life.

192
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:20,203
Hey, Jadey, what's the matter?
You don't say good-bye no more.

193
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,541
Well, how about
smoking my pole, sweetheart?

194
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,071
Fucking deaf bitch.

195
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,126
It's a strange sensation.

196
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,167
I feel slow,

197
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,239
more heavy.

198
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:03,641
In this form you'll still be able to listen,
but that's about it.

199
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,482
If we can hide ourselves,
can the Fallen do the same?

200
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,781
Yeah.

201
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,259
What happened to the others?

202
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,463
Remiel was killed before I arrived.

203
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,033
Besides Amitiel, it's hard to know.

204
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,676
I've heard nothing of Michael.

205
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:42,816
I think Raphael is still around, but
he's in hiding somewhere on the East Side.

206
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,718
What happened to Amitiel?

207
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,723
She lost her wings. Became mortal.

208
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,688
Sammael is here.

209
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,994
He leads the Fallen.

210
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,170
She went after him but he was too strong.

211
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,572
Instead of killing her,
he gave her a choice.

212
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,335
Fall from grace or eternal death.

213
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,935
So she fell, and now he owns her.

214
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,544
Why would he spare one of us?

215
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,448
He wanted her body.

216
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:20,957
Sammael used her till he was tired of her,
then forced her to work as a hooker.

217
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,624
I know what you're thinking,
and you shouldn't.

218
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,093
Essentially, Amitiel's dead.

219
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,796
She calls herself Jade now.

220
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,138
Where does she work?

221
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,773
<i>No way, Gabe.
She's not your concern, not anymore.</i>

222
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,075
Uriel, just tell me.

223
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,151
There's no turning back for her.
It's a waste of your time.

224
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:51,085
Don't question my resolve, Uriel.
Where is she?

225
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,561
I ran into her at a place
called the Funhouse.

226
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:02,258
It's in the hub of the city,
near the furnaces.

227
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,130
Asmodeus runs it.

228
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,730
I can't let this happen to her.

229
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,606
Who? Amitiel?
She doesn't even fucking exist anymore!

230
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,441
Even in the state you were in,
you still helped me.

231
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,241
I have to try.

232
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,586
I thank you for your words
and I promise I'll return soon.

233
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,524
<i>Gabe, you're chasing a ghost.</i>

234
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,260
Remember what you were sent here to do.
It's not about us!

235
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,131
You haven't even...

236
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,536
Well, at least remember to eat!

237
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,477
You'll get hungry.
And if you don't eat, you'll die!

238
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,211
<i>Same old Gabe.</i>

239
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,271
There's nothing wrong
with looking nice, man.

240
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:54,504
I mean, it's a fucking service industry.
These people come here just to fuck, right?

241
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:58,412
It doesn't matter.
It's all in the presentation, right?

242
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,113
Hi! How are you, sir? Enjoy your stay.

243
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,221
See? Treat them nice.
They tell their friends.

244
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,753
It's fucking like talking to a car park.
You got a light?

245
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,732
Hi.

246
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:28,134
- I'm looking for a girl named Jade.
- She's out on a private call.

247
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,112
- But I can get one of our other giris to...
- Can you tell me where she is?

248
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,614
I just said she's out on a private...

249
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,650
Yeah, I know, I heard that,
but it's important.

250
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,778
Bitches, they come,

251
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,489
they go.

252
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,627
Room eight?

253
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,576
You been here before?

254
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,440
No.

255
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,791
Nice to see you've dressed up
for the occasión.

256
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,701
Here you go.

257
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,871
<i>Give this gentleman half-price.</i>

258
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:37,172
I've got a feeling we'll
be seeing him again.

259
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,018
So, do you want to see another girl?

260
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,385
Actually, I'll come back.

261
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,297
Thank you.

262
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:03,473
<i>Oh, Jade, remember you're booked tonight.
Scampi's Motel, room 36.</i>

263
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,201
<i>It's two guys, one at a time. You got that?</i>

264
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,850
That was quick.

265
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,667
What's the quickest way to Scampi's Motel?

266
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,201
About four blocks down, turn right,
across the street.

267
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,076
You're welcome. Come again.
Nice to have you here.

268
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,909
What a friendly fellow. Fuck.

269
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,299
Hi.

270
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,717
So, this is the lovely Jade.

271
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,958
In the flesh.

272
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,331
So, how do you guys want to do this?

273
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,780
Take off your clothes.

274
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:12,129
Candy told you guys
about the rule of one at a time, yeah?

275
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,362
Yeah.

276
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,373
But unfortunately, that's not what we want.

277
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,404
Really?

278
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,305
Then maybe you've got the wrong girl.

279
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,683
I don't think so.

280
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,983
Your name's Jade, right?

281
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,265
Well, is it?

282
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:44,927
Yeah.

283
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:50,431
You do work at the Funhouse,
which means you are a whore?

284
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,904
You do fuck for money, yeah?

285
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:01,383
Then that means your real name is Amitiel,

286
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,851
and you used to be an ángel.

287
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:11,222
Oh, sorry.
Arc, as you like to call yourselves.

288
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:17,393
So, you see, Jade, we are both going to
enjoy the pleasure of your divine company,

289
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,262
whether you like it or not.

290
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,400
I prefer it rough, so I hope you do, too.

291
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,991
This meat's a little tough.

292
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,625
What do you say, Marcus?

293
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,604
Fuck you!

294
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,110
See what happens
when you make all this fucking noise?

295
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,754
Who is it?

296
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,790
You got a tongue in your fucking head?
Who is it?

297
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,424
Help!

298
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,702
- Where am I?
- In a safe place here.

299
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,944
You've been unconscious for a while.

300
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,586
I've got to get back to work.

301
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,049
No.

302
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,921
You have to stay and rest.

303
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,292
I've spoken to Asmodeus.

304
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:44,100
He says he wants you to stay here
until you get better.

305
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,234
You're so full of shit.

306
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,815
What did you say your name was?

307
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,582
<i>Gabriel.</i>

308
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,023
Did we fuck?

309
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,086
No.

310
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,461
Were we supposed to?

311
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,092
No.

312
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,498
<i>Good.</i>

313
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,679
I sense the darkness inside you.

314
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:29,816
It clouds your soul
but I know it takes away your pain.

315
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,559
I'm not supposed to interfere.

316
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,058
You have a right to choose,

317
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,166
but I'm not sure you ever did.

318
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,836
So, if I am wrong,

319
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,475
please forgive me.

320
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,317
This will hurt

321
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,322
a lot.

322
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,401
You had no right to do that!

323
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,102
I won't believe you are what they say.

324
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,576
Did they tell you I lost my wings?

325
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,138
Did they tell you I'm a smackie?
That I fuck for money?

326
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,308
They said you had the courage
to fight Sammael.

327
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,478
You fought well but you lost.
There is no disgrace in that.

328
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,647
If only they could see me now, huh?

329
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,123
Where the fuck are my clothes?

330
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,656
I won't let anything else happen to you.

331
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,390
You don't even know Sammael's power!

332
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,095
He's grown stronger
than all of us combined.

333
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:28,569
If Michael couldn't defeat him,
what chance do you have?

334
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,966
I have seen and done things here that...

335
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,644
I can't even believe this place exists.

336
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,041
I mean, I knew it was
going to be hard but...

337
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,175
And I can't ever go back.

338
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,482
I can never go back.
I will never see the light again.

339
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,113
You're wrong.

340
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:51,056
Just because you're not an Arc,
it doesn't mean you can't return as a soul.

341
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,628
What does that mean?

342
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,826
What? I wait my days out here?
I grow old, I fucking die?

343
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:01,195
I can't even kill myself
because it's against the rules.

344
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,738
<i>I could be here for another 50 years, Gabe!</i>

345
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:07,310
That is nothing
compared to an eternity of darkness.

346
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,739
How long you been here for?
A few days? A week?

347
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:17,384
I've been here for two and a half years,
and that feels longer than eternity.

348
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:23,651
I feel like they've just betrayed us,
they've just left us here to die.

349
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:28,060
And once you've been killed, that is it.
What then?

350
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,567
You will see the light return
before this week is through.

351
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,408
I'm sure Michael said the exact same thing.

352
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:45,674
<i>You are troubled.</i>

353
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,049
Why does this not surprise me?

354
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,779
Did you feel him just now?

355
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:58,293
Yes, he lives in the North.
Somewhere in the slums.

356
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,863
Then tell me why we wait.

357
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,364
You lust for his blood.

358
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,595
So, right now,
he still possesses much strength.

359
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:12,141
And I can't possibly risk losing anyone else
from our little family.

360
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,640
You could take him on your own.

361
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,213
I grow weary of your hesitation.

362
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:24,719
There are others just like him,
but they are broken,

363
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,120
some beyond repair.

364
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,990
The only resolve will be
once they are all dead.

365
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,299
I need him to bring them out,

366
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:41,770
show them they can shine
just bright enough for all of us to see.

367
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,170
Then I am mistaken.

368
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,767
Yes, you are.

369
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:14,136
And, if you ever question such things again,

370
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:20,266
I will rip your tongue out and paint my name
in blood across your back.

371
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,044
I see you have some friends here.

372
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,689
Would you mind introducing me?

373
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:04,819
- I missed you.
- You've missed Amitiel, not me.

374
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,888
They're not as different as you think.

375
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,853
You don't get it, do you?

376
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,260
<i>Everything here works against us, Gabe.</i>

377
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:20,062
We fall prey to the things
we never even knew.

378
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,430
Fear, hate,

379
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:29,241
the very things that make him,
make all of them, stronger.

380
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,378
Do we not have the compassión
to overcome this?

381
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,682
I honestly don't think so.

382
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,187
The city itself is the best
defense they have.

383
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,699
What are you thinking about?

384
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,102
I think I'm hungry.

385
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,144
What is this place?

386
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,984
Soup kitchen. They help the homeless.

387
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,357
We can't eat here.

388
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:23,598
These people need food more than us.

389
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,296
In case you hadn't noticed, we're
kind of desperate ourselves. Come on.

390
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,369
- Want bread?
- Yeah.

391
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:39,940
Here you go.

392
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,680
Thanks.

393
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,300
Do you know the guy who served us?

394
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,577
Does he seem familiar?

395
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:17,847
- No.
- Well, he's been here a long time.

396
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,324
That's lthuriel.

397
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,834
Another who surrendered to the fear.

398
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:45,210
And after he'd heard of my fate,
he chose exile over confrontation.

399
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,179
I can't...

400
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,259
<i>Don't be so ardent to judge others, Gabriel.</i>

401
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:00,794
You haven't been here long enough
to earn that right.

402
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,024
I don't intend to either.

403
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:13,198
How can you turn your back on us like this?
You swore an oath.

404
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,769
Am I the bad guy here?

405
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:21,077
You want to point this fucking thing at me?
After all we've done for you people!

406
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:26,588
<i>Gabriel, stop! Give him back the gun.
He's just doing his job.</i>

407
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:42,236
What a shame you can't do yours.

408
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:46,803
Am I the only one who still believes
in this cause? Am I?

409
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,637
I'm doing the best I can.

410
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:59,348
Well, what else was I supposed to do?

411
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,624
I would've been killed.

412
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:06,429
It's the risk we take. All of us.

413
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,156
<i>I don't have your strength, Gabriel.</i>

414
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,702
I thought I did, but I was wrong.

415
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:18,497
I'm doing the absolute best I can, here.
I'm still trying to help these people.

416
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,439
With a soup kitchen?

417
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:25,474
That is this big, compared to
what you're supposed to do.

418
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:30,350
Kill the Fallen. Bring back the light.

419
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,216
<i>Go home.</i>

420
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,985
It's not that fucking hard, lthuriel.

421
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,223
Well, if it was so easy,
then why are you here?

422
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,667
Why have the six of us before you failed?

423
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,836
I'm doing the best that I can.

424
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,016
I'm sorry.

425
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,219
It's good to see you.

426
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,329
Raphael is here.

427
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,213
Take me to him.

428
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:41,557
These passages lead under the entire city.

429
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,689
We found them
when we were setting up the soup kitchen.

430
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:22,788
- This is Maggie.
- Hi.

431
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,401
She's been looking after Raphael.

432
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,469
How long has he been like this?

433
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,573
A few months.

434
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,442
Leave us.

435
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,817
Maggie will be just outside here.

436
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,810
Shame you had to be here.

437
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,546
Yeah.

438
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,655
What happened to you?

439
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,497
Sammael shot me.

440
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,491
And why can't you heal?

441
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,003
Nothing left.

442
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,667
Can't do it. No. No.

443
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,472
Save your power.

444
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,479
Every time you do something,

445
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,509
you lose more.

446
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,086
You'll die if I don't.

447
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,514
You'll need your strength

448
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,717
to face them.

449
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,561
I had my chance.

450
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,332
Then forgive me.

451
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,933
No!

452
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,729
What have you done?

453
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,366
I saved your life.

454
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,397
You never listened to me, did you?

455
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,769
By doing that, you've probably
just exhausted half your strength,

456
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:55,374
not to mention the fact you've now exposed
our presence to the Fallen.

457
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:59,718
- My strength will come back.
- No, it won't.

458
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:03,824
The longer you're down here, the weaker
your connection to the source becomes.

459
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,455
Every time you do something like what you
just did, you close that hole up faster.

460
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,657
You should've waited.

461
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,394
I could have stayed alive long enough
for you to fight Sammael,

462
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:16,631
and if you'd won, if you'd returned
the light back as the governing ruler,

463
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,570
then we could have all gone home.

464
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,166
Even those who turned their backs.

465
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,113
You talk as if I've already lost.

466
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,953
As it stands,
you have no chance of beating Sammael.

467
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,996
His power has no equal.

468
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:45,161
This is the lesson
that both Amitiel and I had to learn.

469
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:47,659
Michael, too.

470
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,536
Sammael has found a way
of harnessing the collective energies

471
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,701
from each of the Fallen.

472
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,473
He's become stronger, faster.

473
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,783
Worse still,
his presence is now always cloaked,

474
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,547
so you'll never be able to find him.

475
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:09,522
Then I will take the Fallen, one by one.

476
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,694
Deplete his strength through them.

477
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:17,823
You are but one.
They are five, possibly six.

478
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,529
Less two. Molloch and Balan.

479
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,306
That still leaves Asmodeus, Ahriman, Lilith.

480
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,910
I know where Asmodeus hides.

481
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,721
Tell me of the others.

482
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,530
It's fucking hideous.

483
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:36,375
She's not finished yet!

484
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,385
You know Jade's gone missing?

485
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,060
And Balan is dead as well.

486
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,059
I thought as much.

487
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:04,263
I've organized a gathering with the others.

488
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:09,106
<i>It appears that Gabriel
has done exactly as we'd hoped.</i>

489
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,254
Let me just freshen up.

490
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,853
What happened to Michael?

491
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:34,467
Though none of us actually saw him,
we felt him the night that he arrived,

492
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,937
a force of consummate strength.

493
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:44,275
And just, over time, his signal grew weaker
and just eventually faded away.

494
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:49,178
I'm sure I felt a small surge
the night that he fought Sammael,

495
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:52,550
but then, since, nothing.

496
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:02,187
<i>I know what he meant to you, Gabe.</i>

497
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:07,669
These thoughts of Michael
will only cause you more confusión.

498
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,706
He's gone. You have to stay focused.

499
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,311
Michael was our greatest warrior.

500
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,471
Rivaled only by yourself.

501
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:28,581
If Sammael is truly all-powerful,
then why does he wait?

502
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,361
He's had many a chance to take me
and yet...

503
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,522
I've told you all I know.

504
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:43,501
lf, after all of this, you still
think there's a chance you can win,

505
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:47,099
I will follow you to whatever fate,

506
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,674
as will the others.

507
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:56,445
Then believe in me. That's all I ask.

508
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:43,924
Hey!

509
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:49,634
You be moving things along,
I'll be seeing the boss man soon.

510
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:07,768
Come.

511
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:19,245
Whenever you're ready, Ahriman.

512
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:42,100
He is stronger than you think.

513
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:55,273
Uriel lives on the outskirts,
somewhere near the old drive-in.

514
01:05:55,985 --> 01:06:00,479
The other is near the docks,
hiding amongst the homeless trash.

515
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:05,489
<i>Once they are deceased, I will take Gabriel.</i>

516
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,895
Then let's just hope we're not too late.

517
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:14,059
This is a war.

518
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,669
Sacrifice is what victory is measured upon.

519
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:22,406
And if you don't like it,
you could always return home.

520
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:26,311
I'm sure your master would love to hear
how you defied me.

521
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,361
I'm sure he would, too.

522
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:46,761
By the end of this day,
the balance will forever reside with us.

523
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:54,433
Now, I fight for a voice of freedom,
and you fight to preserve control,

524
01:06:56,045 --> 01:07:01,073
but rest assured,
we are all on the same side.

525
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:07,183
Light will never return to this place.

526
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,123
These souls are ours.

527
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:05,966
Hi.

528
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:08,402
Hi.

529
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,711
You disappeared on me.

530
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:16,173
I just needed some time to think.

531
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,882
Did you draw this?

532
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:22,984
Yeah.

533
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:26,088
It's a first try.

534
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,656
Do you like it?

535
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,892
It's beautiful.

536
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:36,336
But I don't look like that.

537
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,543
You do to me.

538
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:52,479
Watch where you're fucking going!

539
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,995
Careful, old man. Come on.

540
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:17,502
You okay?

541
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,441
Bread with your soup?

542
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:07,077
Raph, what do we do?

543
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:15,881
Well done.

544
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:18,892
Frankly, more like medium-rare.

545
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,610
Where to now?

546
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,350
We go left.

547
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:47,285
- Another?
- Raphael!

548
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,323
Leave him to me.

549
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:08,039
We're almost there. Come on.
Let's move, let's go. Come on.

550
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:12,605
This shouldn't be here.

551
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,202
Don't make a sound. Just wait a moment.

552
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,064
Raphael.

553
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,597
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- They're dead. Dead.

554
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,432
- Who?
- They're dead.

555
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:45,802
- Who?
- I killed them.

556
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:49,308
<i>- Gabe!
- It's my fault.</i>

557
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:55,372
<i>Gabe, you got to talk to me.
Listen, you got to talk to me.</i>

558
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,146
<i>- Gabe, listen.
- No!</i>

559
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,949
- Look at you!
- You don't understand!

560
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:36,144
Tinkerbell, Captain Hook, watch the rain.
Hey, you're back again.

561
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:45,226
Asmodeus! Where is he?

562
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:48,219
Top floor. I don't know which room.

563
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:44,875
Well, look at you,

564
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:48,656
all big and macho,

565
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,988
carrying that huge fucking gun around.

566
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:57,959
How does that make you feel? Powerful?

567
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:01,927
Actually, don't answer that.

568
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,098
I can see it in your eyes.

569
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:16,247
<i>Are you angry with me, Gabriel?</i>

570
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,414
Have I done something to offend you?

571
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:26,684
I hope this isn't about your friends, is it?

572
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,321
Because, I mean,
if you didn't want them dead,

573
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,365
why did you lead us to them?

574
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,343
So, it's going to be like that, is it?

575
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,176
Such a shame. You and me,

576
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,811
we could've had something.

577
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,691
Now, you're just playing hard to get.

578
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:07,143
After tonight, I'll never see you again.

579
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:15,623
I don't want that to happen.

580
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:27,097
When you go back,
don't tell them what went on down here.

581
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:34,338
I won't remember, anyway.

582
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:39,118
We never do.

583
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:46,293
<i>Good-bye, Jade.</i>

584
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:20,950
How many you want? One, two, three?

585
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:25,862
I'll take all of it.

586
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:29,628
Now.

587
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,002
All that.

588
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:41,341
You wouldn't have enough money,
let alone enough friends, to use all that.

589
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:48,150
Then let's make a deal.

590
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:14,743
How can you just sit there
and let this happen?

591
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:19,376
- Asmodeus is dead because of you!
- Asmodeus is dead because he was weak.

592
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:22,615
- Just like the others.
- Because they believed you could end this.

593
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:27,694
I always knew we could never trust you.
Your presence makes me fucking sick!

594
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,548
Nice to see you again.

595
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:03,600
Sammael!

596
01:33:15,656 --> 01:33:17,624
You are growing weaker.

597
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:21,094
I can sense this in you.

598
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:23,960
I'm not the only one.

599
01:33:34,141 --> 01:33:36,871
<i>I have no desire to fight you, Gabriel.</i>

600
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,045
Shoot me if you must,

601
01:33:43,718 --> 01:33:46,949
but I ask that you listen to
what I have to say first.

602
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:52,020
You lie!

603
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:56,455
I'd never trust your kind.

604
01:33:57,999 --> 01:33:59,990
If only that were true.

605
01:34:03,437 --> 01:34:09,467
See, we are the same, you and I.

606
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:15,679
A city full of Fallen that should've
killed you, and they didn't. Why?

607
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:18,574
Because of me.

608
01:34:20,755 --> 01:34:24,213
<i>I'm the only reason
you're still alive, Gabriel.</i>

609
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:28,852
I know you can sense me.

610
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:35,525
Your heart denies it,
but your soul knows the truth.

611
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:40,029
All you have to do is say my name.

612
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:52,079
We were born in a worid
controlled by fear and rules.

613
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:56,181
We were slaves to a higher purpose.

614
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:58,785
Tell me.

615
01:34:58,926 --> 01:35:05,058
What is the point of being created just
so we can serve someone else's wishes?

616
01:35:10,571 --> 01:35:15,270
All I've done is set myself free.

617
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:20,911
Now I beg you to do the same.

618
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:33,625
- This can't be true.
- But you know it is.

619
01:35:34,195 --> 01:35:36,891
Your instincts have always served you well.

620
01:35:36,997 --> 01:35:42,060
Don't deny them now, just say my name.

621
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:50,168
I love you like a brother.

622
01:35:52,613 --> 01:35:55,081
I taught you everything you know.

623
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:01,015
I can hear it in your thoughts. Say it.

624
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:06,659
Say it!

625
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:10,791
Michael.

626
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:20,166
Why?

627
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,633
You've seen the things I've seen.

628
01:36:25,012 --> 01:36:27,446
You've felt the things I've felt.

629
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:32,515
Well, I, too, came here
with a heart full of love.

630
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:39,121
By the time I fought Sammael,
I consumed him with hatred.

631
01:36:42,196 --> 01:36:45,461
I was powerful beyond any
who had come before me.

632
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:50,125
You killed the others. Raphael, Uriel...

633
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:52,398
- They were weak!
- They were your brothers!

634
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:55,008
They would never have understood!

635
01:36:57,678 --> 01:37:00,806
They only wanted a war
that could never be won.

636
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:03,710
Not by their kind.

637
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:09,583
I knew only you had the strength
to be a leader.

638
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:13,889
Now think about it.

639
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:20,328
You and I can rule this place together
and the light will never know.

640
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:26,529
In time we could grow powerful enough
to crush it completely.

641
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:30,876
These people are free.

642
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:36,778
And now, so are you.

643
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:45,448
I thought you were dead.

644
01:37:50,898 --> 01:37:52,297
I was right.

645
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:31,498
<i>You break my heart, Gabriel.</i>

646
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:41,904
You know it doesn't have to be this way!

647
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:48,881
You've sealed your fate, Michael!

648
01:39:52,853 --> 01:39:54,582
I did all of this,

649
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:57,755
everything,

650
01:39:59,093 --> 01:40:00,321
for you!

651
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:10,868
You forced Amitiel to give up her wings!

652
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:20,944
Sammael did that, not me!

653
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:32,716
You slaughtered your kin!

654
01:40:35,796 --> 01:40:37,730
Open your fucking eyes.

655
01:40:43,737 --> 01:40:45,705
There was no other way.

656
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:51,544
Don't follow their path.

657
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:02,184
<i>The war is over, Gabriel.</i>

658
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:07,252
No! No!

659
01:41:10,264 --> 01:41:12,596
We can still go back, Michael!

660
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:18,235
Don't let this be for nothing!

661
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:21,267
Never.

662
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:01,940
Look at your eyes, Michael.
Look what you have become.

663
01:42:11,992 --> 01:42:13,960
<i>Trying to heal, Gabriel?</i>

664
01:42:16,363 --> 01:42:19,423
But you can't. Can you?

665
01:42:21,235 --> 01:42:27,299
Because you wasted all your energy
on the others.

666
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:48,689
Of all the things you could have been,

667
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:55,493
you chose this.

668
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,227
<i>Why, Gabriel?</i>

669
01:43:56,797 --> 01:43:58,594
I give you everything

670
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:02,868
and you still deny me.

671
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:05,735
Free will.

672
01:44:07,808 --> 01:44:11,608
The light's not about control.
It's about choice.

673
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:16,139
We came here to guide these people.

674
01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:20,418
Nothing more.

675
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,717
<i>But they don't know the truth, Gabriel.</i>

676
01:44:24,291 --> 01:44:25,588
They do.

677
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,485
They know more so than us.

678
01:44:29,596 --> 01:44:31,086
Being human.

679
01:44:34,801 --> 01:44:37,599
I've felt the things you felt, Michael.

680
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:44,772
But there is so much more you haven't.

681
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:50,348
You think you're free, but you're not.

682
01:44:59,526 --> 01:45:01,357
I love you, Michael,

683
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,962
but I hate what you've become.

684
01:45:14,174 --> 01:45:15,766
Accept the dawn

685
01:45:18,045 --> 01:45:20,206
and bleed with me, brother.

686
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,840
I forgive you, Michael.

687
01:46:54,107 --> 01:46:57,599
My gift to you.

688
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:19,324
Is this what you want?

689
01:48:20,594 --> 01:48:22,562
Is this what you wanted?

690
01:48:30,036 --> 01:48:32,800
<i>You have shown me everything but this.</i>

691
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:38,902
<i>How can I return
with all that has happened?</i>

692
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:41,678
Michael.

693
01:48:43,884 --> 01:48:45,181
Amitiel.

694
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:48,184
<i>I need to feel this.</i>

695
01:48:50,624 --> 01:48:53,388
<i>I need to understand how this happened.</i>

696
01:48:56,963 --> 01:49:02,731
<i>In time, you will form new Arcs
and all this will be forgotten.</i>

697
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:08,697
<i>I can't let that happen.</i>

698
01:49:13,246 --> 01:49:15,180
<i>I won't let it happen.</i>

699
01:49:29,162 --> 01:49:31,426
<i>You threw me far from grace</i>

700
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,768
<i>and now I fall unto it.</i>

701
01:49:40,607 --> 01:49:42,541
I hope I see you again.

702
01:49:47,647 --> 01:49:52,607
<i>Falling is the last thing an ángel feels.</i>

703
01:49:56,523 --> 01:49:59,981
<i>A distant voice still echoes inside my head.</i>

704
01:50:01,828 --> 01:50:05,389
<i>But for the first time, it is my own.</i>

705
01:50:09,135 --> 01:50:10,500
<i>Forgive me.</i>

706
01:50:20,000 --> 01:51:20,000
