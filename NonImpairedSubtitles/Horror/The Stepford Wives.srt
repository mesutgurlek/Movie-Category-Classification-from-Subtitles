897
01:09:02,154 --> 01:09:06,090
            I USED TO ASK HIM   
            WHY HE DIDN'T TALK  
            LIKE HE WROTE.      

898
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,394
    HE WASN'T A BIT HARD-BOILED,
    AND HE HATED ANY SORT       
    OF VIOLENCE.                

899
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:13,831
        BUT I KEPT IT GOING.    
        SOME NIGHTS I WOULDN'T  
        LET HIM TOUCH ME...     

900
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:17,001
    UNTIL HE TOLD ME            
    THE PLOT OF HIS NEXT NOVEL. 

901
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:20,838
WHICH WAS, OF COURSE,           
<i>THE BIG SLEEP.</i>                  
[ Chuckles ]                    

902
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:24,208
    SOMETIMES,                  
    IT NEARLY DROVE HIM CRAZY.  

903
01:09:24,275 --> 01:09:27,678
        ISN'T IT FUNNY          
        THE THINGS YOU DO       
        WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE ?   

904
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:32,817
    WE WERE BOTH SENIORS AT NYU.
    AND IT WASN'T JUST PASSION. 
    IT WAS LOVE.                

905
01:09:32,884 --> 01:09:35,285
WHY DIDN'T YOU MARRY HIM ?      

906
01:09:35,353 --> 01:09:38,288
                I DON'T KNOW.   
                [ Sighs ]       

907
01:09:38,356 --> 01:09:42,860
MAYBE WE TOOK THE JOKE TOO FAR. 
 MAYBE THE FUN WENT OUT OF IT.  

908
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:48,398
    I THOUGHT WALTER WAS GOING  
    TO BECOME PERRY MASON.      

909
01:09:48,466 --> 01:09:52,737
SO IT WAS<i> FAREWELL, MY LOVELY.</i>  
DID YOU EVER SEE THAT ?         

910
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:58,275
ANYWAY, I THINK                 
IF I LOOK IN THE PHONE BOOK...  

911
01:09:58,343 --> 01:10:01,946
AND THIS GUY'S                  
STILL IN NEW YORK,              
THEN HE'S OUR MAN.              

912
01:10:02,013 --> 01:10:04,749
    ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ?  
NO.                             

913
01:10:04,816 --> 01:10:08,518
    I CAN'T JUST                
    CALL HIM UP AND SAY, "HI.   
    I USED TO BE JOANNA INGALLS.

914
01:10:08,586 --> 01:10:12,456

WOULD YOU CHECK MY WATER ?"     

915
