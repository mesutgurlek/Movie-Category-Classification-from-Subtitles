00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,070
Oh, shit.

469
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,308
(POTS BANGING)

470
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,911
Shut the fuck up!

471
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,978
I know. My bad.

472
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,357
Why would she lock her fridge?

473
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,358
HECTOR: Fuck, what is this?
I don't know.

474
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,592
For old people peeing?

475
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,861
Hector, stop touching everything.
Hmm. It's garlic.

476
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,837
(IMITATING PIG)
Stop touching everything.

477
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,421
What is this thing?
Okay, don't listen.

478
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,572
Hey, look.

479
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,540
There's Chavo with a grenade
in his mouth.

480
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,140
It's corn.

481
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:45,983
Yo.

482
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,321
I think that shit just moved.

483
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,455
Go check it out.
No, man. You go.

484
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,125
Just go check it out.
Dude, just fuck...

485
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,281
What is it?

486
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,318
What is it?

487
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,823
Dude!
(GROANING)

488
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,391
Stop being such a dick, dawg.

489
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,593
(LAUGHING)
Fuck.

490
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,594
She never took
a shower either, fuck.

491
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,656
Oh, there's a spider right there.

492
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,931
(BABY CRYING)

493
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,512
Baby, it's all right.

494
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,067
What the fuck?

495
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,002
You hear that shit?

496
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,938
Yeah, be quiet.

497
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,444
(CRYING CONTINUES)

498
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,089
Oh, shit.

499
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:02,894
HECTOR: Did she have
a baby?

500
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,561
No.

501
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,463
I don't think so.

502
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,567
Here, Hector.
Get your phone.

503
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,111
Oh, fuck!

504
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,594
Scared the shit out of me.

505
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,117
What the fuck?

506
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,420
All that shit?

507
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,994
Don't touch it, fool.
JESSE: Why?

508
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:39,175
HECTOR: Just don't touch it, man.
You don't know the shit she...

509
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,668
JESSE:
A bunch of old-school tapes.

510
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,870
See this? Dude.

511
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:48,505
HECTOR:
"Katie and Kristi, 1988."

512
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,177
JESSE: Let's just go
check out that last room.

513
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,814
(SNIFFING)

514
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,547
Dude, it fucking stinks.

515
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,686
HECTOR: Oh, fuck!

516
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,056
JESSE: Oh, shit, dude.

517
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,390
What is that?
Is that blood?

518
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,758
Yes, <i>"vive."</i>

519
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,026
Check this shit...
Don't get close to that shit.

520
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,626
Holy fuck!

521
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,096
There's blood everywhere.

522
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,797
JESSE: Hold on.

523
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,699
HECTOR: What is it?

524
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,939
JESSE: Some type of
journal or something.

525
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,641
HECTOR: Come on, dude,
let's just fucking go already.

526
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,463
JESSE: All right,
let's go.

527
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,470
JESSE: Holy shit!
HECTOR: Oh, fuck! (GASPING)

528
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,648
What you guys doing here?

529
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,666
You heard that he did this shit.
That wasn't my little brother.

530
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:36,621
What about that bitch that used to
stay right here? You know about her?

531
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:37,756
HECTOR: Honestly,
we don't know shit, man.

532
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,057
JESSE: We don't
know anything.

533
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,091
Get the fuck out of here.

534
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,194
JESSE: Oh, fuck.
HECTOR: Come on.

535
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,999
MARISOL: I can't believe you
guys stole this from her house.

536
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,340
Look, she has
a whole bunch of pictures.

537
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,202
MARISOL: What's that?

538
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,105
This looks dope.

539
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,638
HECTOR: What language is that?

540
00:22:56,664 --> 00:23:00,602
They're basically saying
that if you build this door,

541
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,682
it's like, you could
travel through time.

542
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,206
HECTOR: Man, if she could
travel through time,

543
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,085
why the hell is she staying
in this shitty-ass apartment?

544
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,154
I'd timeportal my ass to
the Bahamas or something.

545
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,089
No, it says <i>destinos profanos.</i>

546
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,792
Like, you could only go to
unholy places through this door.

547
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,527
HECTOR: Unholy places.
Oh, shit.

548
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:18,135
What's an unholy place?
How am I supposed to know?

549
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:21,400
I'm trying to get up into Marisol's
friend Espi's unholy place.

550
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,435
Oh, you're so nasty, man.
Dude, that's her cousin.

551
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,569
Look at this.
Can I see it?

552
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,442
MARISOL: Looks like some
medieval looking type of shit.

553
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:31,843
What is that?

554
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:35,647
It's a map.
Scavenger hunt.

555
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,382
HECTOR: This is like what Ana was
painting on that naked chick.

556
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,685
JESSE: That is.

557
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,621
MARISOL: Oh, shit.

558
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,022
Maybe this is the ritual
she was doing to her.

559
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:47,257

00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,432
(SCOFFS)
HECTOR: What's the<i>incubo?</i>

562
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,132
It's like a demon.

563
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,600
A demon?
(GROWLS)

564
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,683
HECTOR: Why couldn't we
just buy a black mirror?

565
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,675
Where the hell can you
buy a black mirror at?

566
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,444
That doesn't even make any sense.

567
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,145
JESSE: That's my boy.
Man, shut up.

568
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,580
It's supposed to be
like a doorway.

569
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:09,714
Like a portal.

570
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:10,849
Like a port?

571
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,751
Yeah, to the spirit world.

572
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,854
I better not fall off this shit.
The spirit world, what...

573
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,822
Yeah.
How do you even know this shit?

574
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,491
I looked it up, fool.

575
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,092
Grandma said we shouldn't
be fucking with that shit.

576
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,461
Don't even worry about that.
Oh, my gosh!

577
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,862
Just let it go.

578
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,764
We're just gonna fuck around
and then, you know...

579
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,425
Nothing's gonna happen.

580
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:35,841
Don't trip.
You tie your shoes?

581
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,777
Why can't we just do this
at your apartment?

582

If my<i>abuelita</i> saw this shit...

583
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,815
She would flip out. You know
how superstitious she is.

584
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,756
Here, go in fast, but be quiet.

585
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,988

gonna catch us in here?

586
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,530
Yeah, I'm sure. Go through
this door right here.

587
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,126
Fuck!

588
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,928
See the chandelier?

589
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,329
That is dope. It looks
crazy in the dark.

590
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,534
MARISOL: It's so quiet.
Let's do it right here.

591
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,435
Okay, I'm gonna put this down.

592
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,937
Did you hear that?

593
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,604
No.

594
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,273
I swear to God.

595
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,877
You're tripping.

596
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,413
So what are we supposed to do?

597
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:16,648
Make a triangle. I'm gonna
make it right here.

598
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,716
And then put a circle in the
middle and put the mirror...

599
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,225
Damn, that looks good.

600
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,406
Yeah?
It looks just like the drawing.

After we say the spell,

supposed to open up.

(LAUGHING)
I don't know.

605
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:39,903
Is something supposed
to come through?

606
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,806
I don't know.

607
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,309
Is it gonna be floating around and shit?
Yo, that's gonna be dope.

00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,986
So, I walked over and then he was
staring right out the front door.

789
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:36,621
And it was wide open.

790
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:37,700
The front door to the apartment?

791
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:39,790
Yeah. And everybody was asleep.
And my dad was at work, too.

792
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,159
Maybe it was Oscar.
Would you stop saying that?

793
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,218
Yeah, he's still out there.
No, don't say that, man.

794
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:46,464
What if he saw you guys tape him
and he's coming back for it?

795
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:49,031
Or trying to look for it
or something?

796
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,405
But it didn't feel like
it could have been Oscar.

797
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:58,642
It feels like something's around me.
Like something's in my house.

798
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,511
Like <i>el cucuy?</i>

799
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:01,879
<i>El cucuy?</i>

800
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,014
No, I'm serious.
(MARISOL AND HECTOR LAUGHING)

801
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:04,882
Is <i>el cucuy</i> there?
(LAUGHS)

802
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,317
Like, have you ever felt like
something was watching you?

803
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:07,652
(HECTOR FARTS)
Yeah.

804
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:09,387
(LAUGHING)
Oh, shit.

805
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,449
Please tell me that was not real.

806
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,758
That is so...
Oh, my God. Oh, fuck.

807
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,426
What?
Oh, shit.

808
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,994
Oh! Are you serious?
Are you serious?

809
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,596
I think I sharted. I swear
to God. I think I just sharted.

810
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:19,797
MARISOL: No!
Oh, my God.

811
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,798
Go, <i>cochino!
Get away from me.</i>

812
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,966
Wait, did it go through?

813
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,000
Oh, I think I can see it.
Fuck.

814
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,835
Mirasol, come.
Help me.

815
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,469
No! What do you want me to do?
I have to clean laundry.

816
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,004
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

817
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,010
What?

818
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,546
Is this all over the house?

819
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,715
JESSE: Yeah.

820
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:39,083
Oh, man.

821
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,684
She's trying to
protect the house.

822
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,587
It smells really bad, though.
Dad!

823
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,324
What?
She's getting it all over my room, too.

824
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,757

There is no bad spirit.

827
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,599
What did she do in your room?

828
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,435
She put all the vinegar
all over the bureau.

829
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:58,769
And you're encouraging her.

830
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,438
JESSE: I'm not
encouraging anything.

831
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,650
You're following her, filming
her doing everything.

832
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:02,907
JESSE: Just let her do her thing.
Just let her do it.

833
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,740
Ooh.

834

(JESSE VOCALIZING)

835

Right here, about to play
some basketball.

836
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,792
I'm gonna show you
how I ball 'em up.

HECTOR: See how my knee
locked up?

839
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,564
Stop making excuses.

840
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,632
I'm not. This shit
locks up, man.

841
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,434
It affects my jump shot
'cause there's a whole flow.

842
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,837
How you like losing, again?
HECTOR: Man, shut up!

843
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:35,506
I'm just tired 'cause I haven't
eaten since, like, lunchtime.

844
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:36,807
And it's not even fair, dawg.

845
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,442
You know I have scoliosis.
(BLOWING RASPBERRIES)

846
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:39,910
Scoliosis?

847

HECTOR: You got change?
Oh, I think I left it.

848
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,748
Yo. You have money on you?

849
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,583
No, fool. I'm not gonna
give you shit, either.

850
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:48,686
You still owe me 6 bucks from
when I bought you tacos.

851
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:51,021
JESSE: Just, like, give me $2.

Let's go. Hurry up, dude.

HECTOR: Let's just go.
Oh, fuck.

854
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,157
Careful. Don't point
the camera at them.

855
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,735
What's up?
JESSE: What's up, man?

Uh...

No, we were just leaving.

Can you just leave us alone?

1107
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,612

She had pictures of you.

1110

My dad's been looking
all over the place for this.

00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,541
This is my mom.
MARISOL: What?

1112
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:39,831
This is when she was
pregnant with me.

No, it's not.

Yes, that is. That's Ana!

tall, just a white lady.

Stayed in his room all night.

Then he started even
acting crazy with my mom,

01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,690
started breaking
shit in the house.

to build an army or some shit.

Who's this girl?

1219
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:18,841
All these are boys,
and then there's this...

1220
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,243
Isn't Carlsbad near here?

1221
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:22,010

Yes, it's pretty close.

1222

HECTOR: What is?

1224
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,216
That's her. It's Ali Rey.

1225
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:29,550
It says "Ali Rey" in the article.

1226
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,154
Was he talking to her?

1227
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:32,922
Do you know her?

Nothing, man.

1237
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:03,919
What do you mean, nothing?
Why'd you take off like that?

1238
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,123
I said, nothing, man.
I'm fine.

1239
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:09,104
Was it the thing about the mom?

1240
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,930
Dude, Jesse, all that shit's exactly
what's been happening to you.

1241
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:14,897
All that stuff that
Oscar was saying.

1242
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,199
No, it's not.

1243
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,867
Then how do you explain
all the crazy shit

1244
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:19,067
that's been happening?
Just back up, Hector.

1245
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,903
Please.

1246
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,972
No shit, man. You're the one
who told us to go to Arturo's.

1247
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:25,073
You don't want to
talk about it now?

1248
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,443
