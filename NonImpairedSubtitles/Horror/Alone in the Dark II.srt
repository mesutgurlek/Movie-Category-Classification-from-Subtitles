Okay. Come on.

Hey, listen.

13
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:33,909
We got about a half hour
till daylight.
We can make it.

00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,994
Come on. Let's go.
Get up.

15
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,553
You've got to focus.

16
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:47,389
You don't stand a chance
against it,

17
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,873
not out here.

18
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,542
Not out here,
but maybe in there.

Yeah.

00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,317

Maybe you could shoot me.

54
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:53,551
She might leave you alone.
Wouldn't do any good.

55

She's got it, too.

Edward Carnby?

00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,901
Maybe.

80
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:26,070
How'd you get the number?

81
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:28,740
Shep gave it to me.

82
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,375
He says you
can help me out.

83
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,127
You know stuff
about the occult-
ghosts and shit.

84
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,363
That's delicate stuff,

85
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:37,465
and it don't come cheap.

86
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,016
Yeah.

87
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:42,620
Yeah, I know.

88
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,728
He said you'd get us
into the coroner's office.

89
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,797
So I can see the bodies.
He tell you this?

90
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,833
Shep says a lot of things,

91
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,236
and most of them
don't make any sense.

92
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:01,505
But he did mention something
to me about a dagger.

93
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:06,593
A little black dagger
about this big.

94
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:09,096
I might be
interested in that.

[groaning]

96
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,903

with you, man?

[groans]

98
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,042
You were there when
those three people
got butchered,

99
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,794
and now you wanna see
their dead bodies?

100
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,713
The dagger, Xavier.
You want my help?
I need to see it.

101
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:40,060
Carnby, come on.

102
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,682
Make sure nobody's coming.

103
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:57,444
Xavier, come on.
What, are you scared?

104
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,337
How'd you know
how to get in here?

105
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,075
It's not about how.

106
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:29,694
It's about how much.

107
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,590
Keep your mouth shut.

108
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:13,381
It looks like
it exploded.

109
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,105
She's got it, too.

110
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:24,925
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

111
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:30,031
Aah, fuck.

112
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,233
Geez, she touched the dagger.

113
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,119
These lines-

114
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,387
they work their way
through your body.

115
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,389
Then they try
to control you.

116
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,994
It reacts to light.
Yeah.

117
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,846
It re- It-
[coughing]

118
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,967
[coughing continues]

119
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,972
Hey.

120
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,091
What's wrong with you?

121
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:59,510
I can't control it anymore!

122
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:01,411
[groaning]

123
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:05,849
How long have you
had this for?

124
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,519
Since I touched
the dagger.

125
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,754
It started in my hand,
and it's-

126
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,257
it's all through my body.

127
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:14,992
[panting]

128
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:17,211
The dagger's real.

129
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,982
Take it.

130
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:24,202
Just be careful.

131
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,654
Don't cut yourself.

132
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:38,382
Yeah.

133
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:41,518
I thought that
was cool at first, too.

134
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,838
It's the lines.

135
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,773
A witch's mark.

136
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,277
When you first
touch the dagger,

137
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,180
there's a burning feeling.

138
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:55,215
It's light at first,

139
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,619
but it builds.

140
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,020
She gets-

141
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,790
I've had these dreams

142
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,960
in my head,

143
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,713
and I can hear
her voice all the time.

144
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,730
If you don't do
what she says,

145
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:15,302
she comes
and does it for you,

146
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,754
like she did with them.

147
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:18,722
Who?

148
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,760
The witch.

149
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,595
The witch that dagger
belongs to.

150
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:27,981
[thunderclap]

151
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,238
You said something
about a map

152
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,957
that one of them
carved into himself.

153
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,396
That one.

154
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,723
[thunderclap continues]

155
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,178
"K, E," and some lines.

156
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:01,382
We have to find the right map
so we'll know the location.

157
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:03,100
She's coming.

158
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,519
[guttural breathing]

159
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,393
Is there another way
to get out of here?

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,751
[thunder rumbling]

161

[thunderclap]

162
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:22,729
You know how much power
that dagger has?

163
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,865
How it works?

164
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,300
So it was hidden in here?

165
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,406
[guttural breathing]

166
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,076
[beeping]

167
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,344
I can feel her.

168
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:01,669
Hey, are you sure
that they didn't take

169
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,656
what was placed in the dagger
and place it somewhere else?

170
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,375
Do you want power?

171
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:11,011
More power than
you've ever imagined?

172
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:15,398
[grunts]

173
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:18,319
What price
you want to pay, Carnby?

174
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,670
What are you willing
to pay?

175
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,960
You belong to her now.

176
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:28,795
I did it!

177
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:31,331
I did what you wanted!

178
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,068
I did what you wanted!

179
00:17:59,227 --> 00:18:01,979
Where is the dagger?

180
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,248
Hey! Where's the dagger?

181
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,117
It's here.
He stabbed him with it.

182
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:08,986
The signal's getting closer.
We have to go.
[beeping]

183
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,188
[guttural breathing continues]

184
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:13,624
[groaning]

185
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,543
We're gonna have to
take him with us.

186
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,227
It's too late.
The signal's already in range.

187
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:20,297
She's coming
for our friend here.

188
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,633
He's lit up
like a Christmas tree.

189
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,285
[beeping intensifies]
10 yards.

190
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,303
[Man]
It's the only chance we have.

191
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,841
5 yards.

192
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:33,377
This is the best
I can do for you, pal.

193
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,684
No change.
[beeping continues]

194
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,853
And this one?

195
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,822
His wound is too fresh.
She can't see him yet.

196
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,991
No change.
[buzzing]

197
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,944
Wait! No more signal.
[buzzing stops]

198
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,428
[groaning]

199
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,531
The knife has started
to dissolve.

200
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,283
Pack up.
We're taking him with us.

201
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:59,703
No...
[yelling]

202
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:02,005
[groaning]

203
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:09,012
If he puts us in any danger,
I'll shoot him.

204
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,923
[groaning]

205
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:22,025
I think it's starting.

206
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:26,513
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

207
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,083
[Man]
Ask him what he sees.

208
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:34,455
[groaning continues]

209
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:37,441
It's that piece of blade.
It's killing him.

210
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,493
He won't make it.

211
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,595
Pull over.

212
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,797
Pull over!

213
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:48,168
Got him?

214
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,471
[Man]
Faster!

215
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:58,012
Here. I'll do it, Dad.

216
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,897
Who are you?

217
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,982
[groaning continues]
Hold him down!

218
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,119
Damn it!

219
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,921
[yelling]

220
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:12,743
Where is the dagger?

221
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,728
You think you can
get it out?

222
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:19,750
[Man]
Okay, let's get him
from the street.

223
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,268
Come on!

224
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:27,707
Is it over?

225
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,110
It's just starting.

226
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:39,670
[grunting]

227
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,997
I can't get
this damn thing to work.

228
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:29,002
Dad, he's awake.

229
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:30,604
Ah, okay.

230
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:33,957
Well, keep trying.
All right. All right.

231
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:37,978
Keep trying.

232
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:50,708
How's he doing?

233
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,593
How do you feel?

234
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:55,462
Where am I?
With friends.

235
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,967
Now listen up, Carnby.

236
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,885
That's your name,
right?

237
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:03,887
Now,
you've been stabbed.

238
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:06,222
As a result,
you're gonna see things-

239
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:08,625
visions, dreams.

240
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:10,694
Now, we need to know
exactly what you see,

241
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:13,364
and in particular,
we need to know the location.

242
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,783
Now, you can either
work with us,

243
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:18,351
or you'll end up
a dead man.

244
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:21,071
I need a phone.
Whatever happens,

245
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:24,490
don't ever look into
the mirror in your dreams.

246
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:25,992
If you
look into the mirror,

247
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,294
the enemy will know
where we are.

248
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:29,362
If this happens,

249
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:32,416
Boyle here will shoot you.

250
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,651
Welcome to my house.

251
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:41,225
Let me go.

252
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,177
We're doing this
to save your life.

253
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:46,380
I promise.

254
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,395
The blade has deteriorated.

255
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,097
It was in his body too long.

256
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,800
What worries me even more
is that the reliquiaes

257
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,300
that were inside it
are missing.

258
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:27,037
He needs somebody
who knows how to deal
with that kind of wound.

259
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,989
We can't take him
to a hospital.

260
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,441
It's not a normal wound.

261
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,875
No, I'm not talking
about a hospital.

262
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,043
I'm talking about someone

263
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,478
who knows
what's involved here.

264
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:38,398
If anybody can help him,
Abner can.

265
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:41,869
[slams hand down]
I told you never to mention
his name again!

266
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,720
Now, let me
tell you something.

267
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,756
Carnby will be dead
and gone

268
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,659
long before I ever
invite Abner Lundberg

269
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,294
to set foot
in this house again.

270
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,613
Now, your grandfather
made his biggest mistake

271
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:53,880
in getting involved
with him.

272
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:56,617
I will not make
that same mistake.

273
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,365
What about
the vision of yours?

274
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,484
Do you really feel
them coming?

275
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,892
[groaning]

276
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:48,412
[Witch, whispering]
Who are you?

277
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,916
Come to me.

278
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:55,986
Carnby!

279
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,988
Where is he?
He's gone.

280
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,772
He got my weapon.

281
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,501
Carnby!
Carnby.

282
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,644
He's over here.

283
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,915
[groaning]

284
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,989
We're losing him.

285
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:40,664
Is he looking
into a mirror?

286
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,085
[Witch, whispering]
I know who you are.

287
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,987
[groaning continues]

288
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:50,623
[grunting]

289
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,648
You're not gonna shoot him.

290
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:00,767
You shoot him
when I tell you to shoot him.

291
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:04,020
What about us?
Go get the syringe.

292
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,510
[Witch]
Look at me. Look at me.

293
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,423
Right in the heart?
I have to find
the right ventricle.

294
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,892
She's looking
through his eyes!
Now!

295
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:30,597
[grunting]

296
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:39,905
[groaning]

297
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:52,785
[Witch]
I can see you.

298
00:27:52,786 --> 00:27:54,920
I know who you are.

299
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,692
I know who you are.

300
00:27:59,693 --> 00:28:00,860
Huh?

301
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:07,017
Are we on time?

302
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,252
Looks like.

303
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,318
Go see Abner.

304
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:45,088
He'll come.

305
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:18,832
You looked
in the mirror.

306
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,167
I know you did.

307
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,603
You saw her.

308
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,605
You're putting us
all in danger.

309
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:29,241
No matter what you do,
the witch will come for you.

310
00:30:29,242 --> 00:30:31,228
Yeah, I know.

311
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,513
[breathing heavily]

312
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:37,350
She's after the dagger.

313
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,605
What did you see?

314
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,808
I saw a woman in a lab.

315
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:51,131
A man was there
torturing her.

316
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:52,548
Where is the dagger?

317
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,269
He dug a grave for her
in the middle of the room.

318
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:01,491
She was supposed to be killed,
wasn't she?

319
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:04,660
But something went wrong.

320
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:09,899
What you're seeing
happened many years ago.

321
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,410
That man was my father.

322
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:26,283
Look for hints
to the location of the lab.

323
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,467
Why?

324
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,953
Because that's the only place
it will stop.

325
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,705
[groaning]

326
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,773
We're fetching someone
who can help you.

327
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,913
Why are you
doing all this?

328
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,383
She isn't after you yet.

329
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,954
Some things
are worse than death.

330
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:51,591
She wants my daughter.

331
00:31:51,592 --> 00:31:54,293
That's why the witch
has returned.

332
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:06,472
If you're looking
for the clinic,
it's closed today.

333
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:10,160
Mr. Lundberg.
Mr. Abner Lundberg?

334
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:13,947
Uh-huh.

335
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,307
I'm Natalie Dexter.
Do you remember me?

336
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:31,797
Please sit.

337
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:42,525
I hear you never
wanted anything to do

338
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:44,194
with your father's
hocus-pocus.

339
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,062
She's back.

340
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:49,399
She is, huh?

341
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,267
And it's worse
than ever.

342
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,172
[sighs]
Well, it's none of my business.

343
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:58,107
I did what I could.

344
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,109
I have
a different life now.

345
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:04,980
We need your help.

346
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:07,700
Do you really think
you could resist her?

347
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:10,169
She destroyed
your grandfather.

348
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,505
She will destroy
your whole family

349
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:14,257
and everyone
you've ever known.

350
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:22,282
I have the mark.
She wants me.

351
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:23,733
Just like my mother.

352
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:26,269
There's something about
the Dexters that attracts her.

353
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,620
Oh, yeah.

354
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,441
How long
have you had this?

355
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,126
For three weeks.

356
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:33,993
I went to the doctor
at first,

357
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,861
but then the dreams started.

358
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:38,662
[sighing]

359
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,698
Why didn't you
go to your father?

360
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:43,266
You just expect me
to sit around

361
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:45,435
and wait for her
to come get me?

362
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:52,009
Listen to me.

363
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,612
She was after your grandfather,
the Dexters.

364
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,314
It was revenge.

365
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,316
He was the one
that hunted her down.

366
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:02,285
Wow.

367
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:04,271
I felt that vibe.

368
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:06,273
No. Don't touch it.

369
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:10,477
After all these years,
I'm immune to witchcraft crap.

370
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:16,116
It's real.

371
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:24,541
There's a piece of the heart
missing from the inside.

372
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,459
[sniffs]

373
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:31,248
Looks like this blade
has been used.

374
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:33,084
We have someone
who was injured by it.

375
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:34,885
And they're still alive?

376
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,220
He is.

377
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,872
Did they find
the hag's grave?

378
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:40,824
No. And he doesn't have
much time.

379
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:43,511
We need your help.

380
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:45,612
Well,

381
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:48,349
if we'd only had this
in the day.

382
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,351
My grandfather told you things

383
00:34:50,352 --> 00:34:52,353
that he never told my father.

384
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,487
You were his friend.

385
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,075
What?

386
00:34:58,076 --> 00:34:59,860
Hank Willis is on the phone.

387
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:02,713
His cow died after she took
the medicine you gave her.

388
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:04,815
He wants his money back.
He does, huh?

389
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:06,917
You tell him
I gave him a remedy.

390
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:09,286
I told him no food,
just water.

391
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:10,654
Tell him to go to hell.

392
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:45,022
Leave us.

393
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:55,082
You stay.

394
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:07,043
It's gonna be all right.
I'm gonna take care of you.

395
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:31,151
He's got slivers
in his wounds.
This dries them.

396
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:33,687
Hold it right on there
and press it.

397
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:35,088
Harder. Harder.

398
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,875
There you go. Okay.

399
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:40,694
This is making you visible
to the other side.

400
00:36:40,695 --> 00:36:43,214
You're glowing like
a thousand-watt bulb.

401
00:36:43,215 --> 00:36:45,182
What's that?

402
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:46,717
It's for you.

403
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,652
You got yourself
involved in something

404
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:50,587
that's way beyond
your abilities,

405
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:52,455
I'll tell you that much.

406
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:56,643
[sighs]

407
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:01,715
This dagger-

408
00:37:01,716 --> 00:37:03,717
a very amazing weapon.

409
00:37:03,718 --> 00:37:07,071
It's made of amostite.
Very valuable.

410
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:10,491
Did you want it
for the blade
or what it could do?

411
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:12,876
Rumors and myths.

412
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:14,544
You want to buy
eternal life

413
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:16,330
with the deaths
of others?

414
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:18,666
You're
fighting a witch

415
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,483
that's hundreds of years old.

416
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:21,885
She has the knowledge
and the ability

417
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:24,438
far beyond anything
we've ever known.

418
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:28,259
She can slip- insert her soul
into another body.

419
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,145
She solved the riddle
of immortality.

420
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:34,298
You can't move
while I'm doing this.

421
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:36,700
This is
a radioactive solution.

422
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:40,187
Hold on.
[groaning]

423
00:37:40,188 --> 00:37:43,423
Right there. Right...

424
00:37:43,424 --> 00:37:46,510
Yeah. There.
[groans]

425
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:53,767
It makes you invisible
to the other side.

426
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:56,704
It cancels out the aura.

427
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:58,805
If your hair
falls out tomorrow,

428
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:00,740
then it was too strong.

429
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:04,945
He'll sleep.
He'll sleep now.

430
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:18,892
Your boyfriend is gonna
get us in a lot of trouble.

431
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:21,729
He's not my boyfriend.
Really?

432
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,164
I suggest
you keep it that way.

433
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:26,066
He's an idealist.

434
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:27,868
They're the worst.

435
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:30,404
I know.
I was one once myself.

436
00:38:47,555 --> 00:38:49,439
[sighs]

437
00:38:52,344 --> 00:38:55,679
That dagger shouldn't
cause any serious injury.

438
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,098
It kills the soul,
not the body.

439
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:00,400
We're on the verge of finding
the witch's lair.

440
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:02,335
Thought you might
be interested.

441
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:04,488
After all, you spent
a lot of time looking for it.

442
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:06,289
Whatever you find

443
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,425
will have been dead
long ago.

444
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:18,585
Do you still have those things
my father gave you?

445
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:20,704
They wouldn't be
of any use to you.

446
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,039
Do you still have them?

447
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,607
I burned them years ago.

448
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:27,511
I've made my peace
with the occult.

449
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:29,846
I don't bother it,
it doesn't bother me.

450
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,616
They're all dead,
you know.

451
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:35,519
Everyone that worked
with your father,

452
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,387
they're all dead.

453
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:40,123
They tried to do good,
and they end up doing evil.

454
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:44,812
You're gonna mess
this thing up, baby.

455
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:49,165
The great Abner Lundberg
is afraid.

456
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:52,536
You know, a lot of people
died around you back then,

457
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:54,387
and it didn't seem
to bother you.

458
00:39:54,388 --> 00:39:55,989
Oh, no?

459
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,674
You were
my father's favorite.

460
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:00,411
If your father
could see you now,
he'd laugh.

461
00:40:00,412 --> 00:40:03,614
You nauseated me then,
and you nauseate me now.

462
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:08,151
He's got two days,
maybe three.

463
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:10,086
Or, just maybe,

464
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:12,989
the hag will come
and take him tonight.

465
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,829
I'd rather not be here
if she does.

466
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:17,654
Don't touch.

467
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:23,126
You're reading
the EM frequencies?

468
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:26,446
We're looking
for specific patterns.

469
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:30,083
Our witch broadcast
a bunch of them.

470
00:41:30,084 --> 00:41:32,169
Any readings?

471
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,387
Should there be?

472
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:44,064
Don't worry. We've got
a few surprises for her.

473
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:45,882
[groaning]

474
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:50,487
[thunderclap]

475
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:52,289
She's already here!

476
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:57,160
Oh, shit!

477
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:59,045
[alarm blaring]

478
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:03,784
Okay, everybody, upstairs.

479
00:42:04,953 --> 00:42:06,620
Carnby, come on!

480
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:07,754
[alarm continues]

481
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:21,218
A whole panic room?

482
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:23,487
Carnby, get in here!
Come on!

483
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:27,557
Okay, everybody,
stay away from the wires.

484
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:30,093
Put in the UV.

485
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:34,348
Can you turn off
that alarm, please?

486
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:37,568
[alarm stops]
The lights won't
hold her forever.

487
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:39,552
This isn't the first time
we've had company here.

488
00:42:39,553 --> 00:42:41,238
[thunderclap]
[thud]

489
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:43,123
What the hell was that?

490
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:46,910
Is she already
in the house?

491
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,328
She's on the roof.

492
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:51,080
Carnby, is she already
in the house?
No.

493
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:53,700
She's not here because of me.
She wants the dagger.

494
00:42:55,503 --> 00:42:57,120
But you can't
go down there now.

495
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:00,791

You know what's missing.

566
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:53,626
What's driving the dagger
is weak-

too weak to have any effect.

Everything you need
you'll find in the witch's lab.

I've washed my hand of her.

If he found anything out,

573
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:10,627
he must've
told you about it.

574
00:54:10,628 --> 00:54:13,313
What do you know about
your grandfather, Natalie?

575
00:54:13,314 --> 00:54:15,431
He fought against the witch,
just like you.
[chuckles]

576
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:17,766
He didn't fight
against the witch.

577
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:20,470
Your grandfather
fought for her,

578
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:22,472
and ultimately ended up
killing for her.

579
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:24,807
Why don't you cut
the crap, Lundberg?
No, no.

Please,
I'm telling the truth.

581
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:30,079
He was obsessed
with the occult.

582
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,498
You know, she needed
another vessel,

583
00:54:32,499 --> 00:54:34,983
and at that same moment,

584
00:54:34,984 --> 00:54:38,171
your mother was becoming
less and less tolerant

585
00:54:38,172 --> 00:54:40,590
with your grandfather's
insane ideas.

586
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:44,927
A daughter-in-law
was now becoming bothersome.

587
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:47,497
Your mother became the bait.
Just the bait.

588
00:54:48,882 --> 00:54:51,751
Just another sacrifice
he had to make

589
00:54:51,752 --> 00:54:54,737
to find out
about more secrets,

590
00:54:54,738 --> 00:54:59,108
and her body
was the witch's asking price.

591
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:00,959
You didn't know
your grandfather.

592
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,312
You don't remember him.

593
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:05,514
Your grandfather gave up
fighting for good

594
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:08,017
a long time ago.

595
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:11,654
All he wanted was these
secrets of eternal life
at all costs.

596
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:15,307
His reward for a piece
of your mother's heart...

597
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:21,563
was a few seductive secrets.

598
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:24,667
And then she demanded more.

599
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:27,686
She demanded another body.

600
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:34,259
You were 3 years old,
Natalie.

601
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,029
He told her that...

602
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,731
when you reached
the right age,

603
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:41,366
he would give you
to the witch.

604
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:43,803
Your grandfather sold you,

605
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:47,940
and now she intends

606
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,942
to come and collect.

607
00:56:24,244 --> 00:56:26,545
This is all I have
from the good old days.

608
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:30,583
There has to be another box-

609
00:56:30,584 --> 00:56:33,403
a green Army crate
with a red cross on it.

610
00:56:33,404 --> 00:56:35,621
This is everything.

611
00:56:56,576 --> 00:56:59,645
How much of your soul
have you already sold, Carnby?

612
00:56:59,646 --> 00:57:00,763
Hmm?

613
00:57:02,782 --> 00:57:05,568
I would never kill anyone
just to learn a few secrets.

614
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:07,353
Sure you would.

615
00:57:07,354 --> 00:57:09,538
And I know who I am.

616
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:11,907
But this isn't about
just me anymore.

617

You know, you're an idealist.

618

People have to be careful

619
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,476
that they don't get damaged
from your mistakes.

This is hopeless,
by the way.

only vague references

to where
this place might be.

It was in the north
of the park.

It could be in the park.
It could be near the park.

01:02:18,848 --> 01:02:20,833
You feeling better?

663
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:22,752
I'll be fine.

664
01:02:22,753 --> 01:02:25,520
You might need this.

665
01:02:25,521 --> 01:02:27,823
If you find that witch's lab,
be careful.

666
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:30,159
She'll have all kinds of traps
and other measures.

667
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,660
You know, really.

668
01:02:31,661 --> 01:02:33,062
If her remains
are buried there,

669
01:02:33,063 --> 01:02:34,163
we'll find them.

670
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:37,225
Are you sure it's here?

671
01:03:37,226 --> 01:03:40,011
It's right here.
Okay.

672
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:18,901
We shouldn't be here
when it gets dark.

673
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:23,122
The lab has to be
in direct contact
with the ground.

674
01:04:23,123 --> 01:04:24,123
[thunderclap]

[guttural breathing]

676
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:27,776
Are you okay?

677
01:04:30,263 --> 01:04:33,265
[Edward]
It has to be here.

678
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,200
The others
couldn't sense it.

679
01:04:36,636 --> 01:04:39,021
That's why they weren't
able to find it.

680
01:04:58,575 --> 01:05:00,825
What is this?

681
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:05,414
We're below
the foundation.

682
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:07,716
[Edward]
It's here.

683
01:05:10,136 --> 01:05:12,254
There's no way in.

684
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:14,473
Maybe we can pry it open.

685
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:42,917
[grunting]

686
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:54,612
I'm going in.
Wait a minute.

687
01:05:54,613 --> 01:05:56,848
I'm the only one
who can fit.

688
01:06:13,867 --> 01:06:15,367
Well?

689
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:23,709
There's some kind
of mechanism in here.

690
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:31,349
[Edward]
Watch your step.

691
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:34,902
We have to get out of here
before it gets dark outside.

692
01:07:08,335 --> 01:07:10,902
[straining]

[panting]

694
01:07:12,455 --> 01:07:14,723
Let me get something.

695
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:26,851
Where's the dagger?

696
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:39,981
Come on.
Show me the way.

697
01:07:53,513 --> 01:07:55,647

[Witch]
Give it to me, Natalie.

700
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,323
Bring me the dagger.

701
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:32,900
[beating intensifies]

702
01:08:34,838 --> 01:08:36,305
Come on.

703
01:08:36,306 --> 01:08:38,674
Be a good girl.
Give me the dagger.

704
01:08:38,675 --> 01:08:39,657
No!

705
01:08:44,848 --> 01:08:45,897
[Natalie screams]

[gasping]

01:09:16,912 --> 01:09:18,347
Wait.

711
01:09:26,873 --> 01:09:29,525
I'm getting a jack
from the car.

[grunts]

713
01:09:50,547 --> 01:09:53,381
It's getting dark.
Shit!

01:09:56,085 --> 01:09:58,787
[guttural breathing]

715
01:10:00,156 --> 01:10:02,057
She's coming!

716
01:10:12,986 --> 01:10:14,986
[Boyle]
Are you okay?

717
01:10:25,448 --> 01:10:27,632
[thunderclap]

718
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:38,577
She can't get in here,
can she?

719
01:10:38,578 --> 01:10:40,612
It's her lab.

720
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,290
Let's do it.

721
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,735
[Boyle screaming]

722
01:11:28,778 --> 01:11:31,463
Buried alive.

723
01:11:31,464 --> 01:11:34,416
Witches' ultimate revenge.

724
01:11:39,572 --> 01:11:42,140
It's a message
for Abner.

725
01:11:42,141 --> 01:11:43,859
It's in code.

726
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,093
He used a straightforward
encryption.

727
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:48,429
It's not difficult.

[guttural breathing]

729
01:11:52,084 --> 01:11:54,653
She's trying to get in.

730
01:11:54,654 --> 01:11:57,155
Wait here.

731
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:58,590
Sorry.

732
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:30,839
[guttural breathing continues]

733
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:55,630
My grandfather wanted to bury
the witch here in her lab,

734
01:12:55,631 --> 01:12:57,565
but I don't see
a grave anywhere.

735
01:12:57,566 --> 01:12:59,567
Because there isn't one.

736
01:12:59,568 --> 01:13:01,502
It was never here.

737
01:13:12,448 --> 01:13:14,382
The foundation shift
did it.

738
01:13:14,383 --> 01:13:16,918
Roll up your sleeve.
Save that for later.

739
01:13:16,919 --> 01:13:19,771
It's getting worse.
You might not have a later.

740
01:13:19,772 --> 01:13:22,440
We have to get out
of here first.

741
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:24,476
The sewers are back there.

742
01:13:24,477 --> 01:13:26,478
The lab isn't
sealed off anymore.

743
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:29,747
She can get in.
Where's the dagger?

744
01:13:39,475 --> 01:13:40,809
[thunderclap]

745
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:42,761

Edward, she's coming!

749
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,825
The torch is acting up.

750
01:14:18,898 --> 01:14:20,514

[grunts]
Hurry.
We have to keep moving.

753
01:15:05,378 --> 01:15:07,979
I don't think
she wanted us here.

754

[grunts]

755
01:15:32,371 --> 01:15:34,205
It was here.

756
01:15:41,764 --> 01:15:44,883
You need the dagger
to open the wall.

757
01:15:44,884 --> 01:15:48,169
That's why
she couldn't escape.

You belong to her now.

She has a claim on you,

766
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:44,492
and you're here to collect.

767

This isn't you, Edward.

Without the witch,
that thing's useless.

I told her my code
was too easy to crack.

I'll kill him first,
and then I'll take care
of your little girlfriend.

She's still in here
somewhere.

How long can you stay
in the body for?

One minute? Two?

You know the heart
must be pierced.

This is what you want.

I can sense you're dying
to see how the ritual works.

Forget about the girl.

I can give you knowledge
beyond your wildest dreams.

We can do things together
she'd never do.

Do it!

804

Do it.

Wait.

Natalie had to die
to destroy the witch.

01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:31,145
Her old son of a bitch
grandfather knew that.

815
01:21:31,146 --> 01:21:34,532
He knew it.
What are you doing?

816
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:36,751
She's already dead,
isn't she?
No, no. Listen to me.

817
01:21:36,752 --> 01:21:38,837
Wait, wait. Wait.
Use the blade.

818
01:21:38,838 --> 01:21:41,122
Use the dagger.

01:21:41,123 --> 01:21:42,874
Come on!

820
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:46,294
Use the dagger. Yeah.

Use the dagger.

Trust me. Come on.

Please.

I swear to God
it won't hurt her.

825
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,973
Use it.

826
01:21:58,974 --> 01:22:01,742
It kills the soul,
not the body.

827
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,314
Trust me.

828
