1
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:42,524
Mother!

2
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:43,823
Gotcha!

3
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:46,084
All right,

4
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,091
... you're asking for it!
- One more step and...

5
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,803
... you're gonna get it!

6
00:06:57,855 --> 00:06:58,974
Parental abuse!

7
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,735
- I'll quit if you quit.
- Truce?

8
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,084
Truce.

9
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:15,135
Help your old mother up.

10
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:22,585
I had my fingers crossed!

11
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:26,086
You're gonna be very sorry...
Don't do that!

12
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:27,828
Not as sorry as you!

13
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:29,931
Jerry's home!

14
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,485
Come on.

15
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:33,525
Come on, honey...

16
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:36,655
"Jerry's home"

17
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:38,445
Yeah!

18
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:47,871
Excuse me, lady,

19
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:49,885
is this the Blake residence?
- It is.

20
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:04,651
Stephanie home?

21
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:06,536
She's in the backyard.

22
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:12,091
- I've got a surprise for her.
- What?

23
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:15,072
- Something no family should
be without. - What is it?

24
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:19,052
Stephanie!

25
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:20,895
There's somebody I'd like you
to meet.

26
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:31,570
I can't tell you what his name is,
because he doesn't have one yet.

27
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:33,589
Names don't seem to matter much.

28
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:36,015
I had a dog when I was a kid.

29
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:39,727
He was just a mutt, but to
me, he was Rin Tin Tin.

30
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,085
Rin Tin Tin?

31
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:43,112
Well, that was a little before
your time, I guess.

32
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,551
So, what do you think? Can we
give this little guy a home?

33
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:49,316
- Sure.
- That's my girl...

34
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:54,372
I'll go inside and call Karen
to tell her about the puppy.

35
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:58,548
- Honey... What do you say?
- Thanks, Jerry!

36
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:08,527
I gotta fix that screendoor
one of these days...

37
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,648
I hope she doesn't think I was
trying to buy her love.

38
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:16,815
- Maybe the puppy was a mistake.
- The puppy was perfect.

39
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:18,591
You're perfect!

40
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:23,054
Give her some time.
It'll be fine.

41
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:25,547
I know... All takes time!

42
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:29,375
And time is one thing I got
plenty of.

43
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:39,268
I feel like I'm watching a
tennis match.

44
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,096
Stephanie, why don't you ease in
for a landing?

45
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,814
I'll stop pacing if you stop
doodling.

46
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:48,856
All right, you pace, I'll doodle,
and we'll both be happy.

47
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:51,893
We were... talking about your
father.

48
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:54,291
My father died a year ago.

49
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,575
Sorry, I meant your stepfather.

50
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,091
If my father hadn't died,

51
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:00,868
there wouldn't be a stepfather.

52
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:03,367
You're mad at him for dying.

53
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:05,855
I'm mad at somebody!

54
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,255
Being unable to accept your
father's death...

55
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:11,171
... is part of the reason you've
been getting into trouble.

56
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,497
I'm not in that much trouble.

57
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:18,811
Suspended three times last year...

58
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:22,255
Twice this year, and school's
barely been in session two months.

59
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,072
I know what my problem is.

60
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,328
Him.

61
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:30,734
If he wasn't here,

62
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,591
my Mom and I would be alright.

63
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,115
Steph,

64
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,157
you're going to have to
face the fact...

65
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,394
... that your mother loves
the guy.

66
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,553
She doesn't see!

67
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,178
Doesn't see what, Stephanie?

68
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,691
I think my time is up.

69
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,815
Isn't it?

70
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,857
So, how was your session?

71
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,815
OK.

72
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,217
Sweetheart, it seems like you
and I are always budding heads.

73
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,375
How about we try to get along
a little better?

74
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,055
Sure.

75
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,373
One more thing and then I'll
shut up.

76
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,435
It's very important to your
mother and to me...

77
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:26,111
... that you try to get along
better in school this year.

78
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:31,580
What do you say?

79
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:40,094
Stephanie, knock it off!

80
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,133
Girls, come on, stop it!

81
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,535
Enough!

82
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:54,656
It's the last time you cause
an outburst in my classroom.

83
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:56,158
Mr. Conroy! Stephie didn't
start it!

84
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:57,958
When I want your opinion, Baker,
I'll ask for it.

85
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:02,858
You couldn't have got yourself
in deeper trouble if you tried.

86
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:18,474
Well, Norah, what do you think?

87
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:20,360
- I love it!
- I knew you would.

88
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:22,673
And this is the south. You'll
have sun all day long.

89
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,079
- What do you think, pumpkin?
- I don't know...

90
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:27,597
Oh! One thing I forgot to
mention.

91
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:29,840
It comes with a swing set.

92
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:37,795
I have a daughter, too.

93
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:40,870
She's a few years older than you.
Her name is Stephanie.

94
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,479
She goes to Oakridge High,

95
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:45,752
which is where you'll be going
one of these days...

96
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,394
... after your parents buy
the house.

97
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,072
- What grade are you in, Cindy?
- Third.

98
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:53,630
Third grade... !

99
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:56,918
I remember when Jill was in
third grade.

100
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:00,138
I used to walk her home from
school every day.

101
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,671
- Who's Jill?
- That's my daughter.

102
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,541
You said her name was Stephanie.

103
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:07,216
Right, Stephanie.

104
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,122
She goes to Oakridge High.

105
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:12,680
She's on the student council.

106
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:15,002
She's a straight A's student.

107
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:17,061
I'm very proud of her.

108
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:25,079
- Suspended again?
- Expelled.

109
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:27,837
No! What're you gonna do?

110
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:30,041
Maybe boarding school.

111
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:32,878
- Really?
- I'm sure gonna try for it.

112
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,712
What's your stepfather gonna
do when he finds out?

113
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:38,836
He's gonna kill me.

114
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:43,099
Expelled? You're kidding.

115
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,118
Principal said it wasn't
working out.

116
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:47,882
I'm sorry, Mom.

117
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:49,761
Girls don't get expelled.

118
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,916
All right, it's over...
The damage is done...

119
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,199
Now...

120
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:56,920
What are we gonna do about
the future?

121
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:00,721
I wanna go to a boarding
school.

122
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:03,438
You wanna leave home?

123
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:06,754
It's not a family without
children.

124
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:08,477
I think it'd be best for
everybody.

125
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,600
Best for everybody?

126
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:13,074
Running away would be best for
everybody?

127
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,677
It's not running away!

128
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:19,193
Well,

129
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:21,112
Jerry, what do you think?

130
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:26,322
I don't think we have to break up
the family, do we, pumpkin?

131
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:33,297
Father knows best.

132
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:58,013
Karen, it's freaky, the way he
looks at me...

133
00:14:58,085 --> 00:15:00,802
... like he wanted to erase me
off the face of the earth.

134
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,360
I'm sure.

135
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,637
Ok, don't believe me.

136
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,563
Ok, so, what's the verdict?

137
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:09,859
Is Scary Jerry gonna let you
go to a boarding school?

138
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:15,123
I don't know. He has his own fantasy
we should be like families on TV.

139
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:18,141
Grin and laugh, and have fewer
cavities all the time...

140
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:21,880
It's like having Ward Cleaver
for a Dad.

141
00:15:22,645 --> 00:15:26,443
I gotta hang. Firing squad has
arrived. Bye.

142
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:29,123
Come in.

143
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:32,678
So, where's my blindfold?

144
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:34,055
What blindfold?

145
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:37,499
I thought the condemned person
always got a blindfold.

146
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:53,242
You don't really wanna leave
home... do you, honey?

147
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:56,881
Yes, I do.

148
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:02,481
It isn't our house anymore...

149
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,360
... it's his!

150
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:06,541
Of course it's our house.

151
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,522
It's always been our house.

152
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:13,601
I loved your father,

153
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:16,520
and when he died I thought:

154
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:21,005
"Well, maybe that's it.

155
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:26,185
Maybe you only get one chance
to be happy. "

156
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,961
I never thought I'd love anybody
that much again.

157
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:33,416
I know, Mom.

158
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:36,059
I miss him so bad...

159
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,339
I know you do, honey.

160
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:46,600
We have a second chance with
Jerry.

161
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,766
He's a wonderful man.
And he wants to care for us.

162
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,445
Can't you just...

163
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,645
... give him a chance?

164
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,165
I'm trying.

165
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:06,004
I'm really trying hard!

166
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:08,825
There's just something
about him.

167
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:12,420
- Well, what is it?
- I don't know! I just...

168
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:16,103
I hope you're not still upset...

169
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,028
... over this school business.

170
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:21,327
We were just talking about that.

171
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:24,484
Everything will look clearer
in the morning, uh?

172
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:27,197
We'll work it out.

173
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,081
Good night, sweetheart.

174
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:33,101
Good night, Mom.

175
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:37,267
Sweet dreams, Steph.

176
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,223
G' night, Jerry.

177
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:48,062
<i>Wilbur, will you turn the page
for me?</i>

178
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:50,599
<i>Turn it yourself. You've
got a tongue.</i>

179
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:52,041
<i>No, I'd better not.</i>

180
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,820
<i>I tried it yesterday and swallow
the comic section.</i>

181
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,561
<i>OK, I'll be quiet as a
church mouse.</i>

182
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,243
I used to love this show
when I was a kid.

183
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:23,262
It wasn't till I got in high school
I realized horses couldn't talk.

184
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,579
- I bet you were cute back then.
- Yeah...

185
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:27,880
I'd like to see a picture of you.

186
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,177
You would, wouldn't you?

187
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,400
You never talk about your past.

188
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:36,159
I didn't even exist until
I met you.

189
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,763
Past is important.

190
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,641
Don't try to touch the past.

191
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:49,508
It isn't real.

192
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:51,088
It's just a dream.

193
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,167
The only reality is...

194
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,843
... this moment.

195
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,704
You and me.

196
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,798
Here and now.

197
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:32,573
What are we doing here?

198
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:36,524
This is the house where Henry
Morrison murdered his family.

199
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:39,153
Do you think I don't remember
that?

200
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,903
I was here that night.

201
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:46,037
I never wanna see anything
like that again.

202
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,473
Yeah, I know. A friend of mine
sent me your article.

203
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:54,100
I was in Europe at that time.
It took 9 months for me to get it.

204
00:20:57,978 --> 00:20:59,996
Cops did never really catch
the guy.

205
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,936
File's inactive. I think it
should be reopened.

206
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:05,572
Yeah, well... Talk to the cops.
I'm just a reporter.

207
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:07,865
Well, I talked to the cops.
They can give a shit.

208
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,186
Listen to me a minute, alright?

209
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:13,838
Three weeks before Morrison
killed them...

210
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,261
... he quit his job, didn't
tell anybody.

211
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,309
Got up every morning, pretending
he'd go to work,

212
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,309
and came home at the
same time every night.

213
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:22,023
So how far could he go every day...

214
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:25,883
... and still get back at the same
time every night? Look at this.

215
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:27,689
It has to be...

216
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,571
... somewhere within this radius.

217
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:33,963
See, what I think...

218
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:37,724
... is that during that time he was
setting himself up a new life,

219
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:39,421
somewhere close by.

220
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:42,748
- What do you want from me?
- Just this:

221
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,690
do a follow up story, right?

222
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:47,585
You run a picture of Morrison.
Your paper circulates in this area.

223
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:51,537
Someone might recognize him and if
they do, Brennan, you're a hero.

224
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:54,968
Why are you chasing this?

225
00:22:00,627 --> 00:22:02,845
Vicky Morrison's maden name
was Ogilvie.

226
00:22:06,652 --> 00:22:08,212
She was my sister.

227
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:11,061
Oh... Jesus!

228
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,506
I'm sorry, Ogilvie, uh?

229
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,519
Ok, I'll do what I can, right?

230
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,056
OK.

231
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,002
This place is mine now.

232
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:32,997
You wanna go inside?

233
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:34,930
Fuck no!

234
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:48,418
I'll take him.

235
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,458
Everybody! Everybody!
Jerry is gonna make a speech!

236
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,826
I guess you all know why I
asked you here.

237
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,032
'Cause when I first started with
American Eagle Realty, a year ago,

238
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:04,704
you were the first five families
I sold houses to.

239
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,762
Yeah, Jerry, I've been meaning to
ask you about my garage door.

240
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:10,156
It would still work if you wouldn't 
have gotten your car into it.

241
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:14,401
We met doing business and we
stayed to become friends.

242
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,898
And although I may be arguing
against the comission here,

243
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:20,267
don't sell your houses 'cause
I like being your neighbor.

244
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:24,415
I wanna get a picture with my
family. Steph! Susan!

245
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,984
Come here! Come on down.

246
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:28,703
Yeah! Come here.

247
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:31,545
Yeah, come on!

248
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:34,749
- Come on, Steph.
- Oh, I don't know...

249
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:37,477
There we are... OK.

250
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:41,097
This is as good as it gets!

251
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,297
I hope you don't think what
I'm gonna say is pretencious.

252
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:49,114
I sell houses, that's my job,

253
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:52,092
but sometimes I think it's more
than that... I truly believe

254
00:23:53,338 --> 00:23:56,086
... that what I sell is the
American Dream.

255
00:23:56,486 --> 00:23:57,589


256
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:59,784
You can call me sentimental,
I don't care.

257
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:02,290
When I came here I was
a stranger,

258
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,841
but I never felt more at home
anywhere in my life.

259
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:10,458
I have beautiful friends,
I have a wonderful new family...

260
00:24:15,085 --> 00:24:17,446
Have a good time. Thanks
for coming.

261
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:37,189
Look at this. They'd print
anything to make a buck.

262
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:41,931
- It's just simple sensation.
- What's that, Herb?

263
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:44,520
That guy in Bellvue who killed
his whole family.

264
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:46,992
Cut'em up with knives.

265
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:49,548
I don't think I know about that.

266
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:53,212
It happened last year, that's
what I was talking about.

267
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:57,084
This thing is a year old and they
go waking it up again.

268
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,613
This is terrible.

269
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:02,455
Jerry...

270
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:04,436
Jerry?

271
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,962
You're alright?

272
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:11,638
This kind of thing really gets
to me, you know?

273
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:15,519
That a man could be driven to do
something like that to his family?

274
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:17,250
to his children?

275
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:21,916
I don't even wanna know
about it.

276
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:25,932
Makes you wonder though...
What's it take to make a guy...

277
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:27,507
... do such a thing?

278
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,399
Maybe they disappointed him.

279
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:40,745
Hey, I thought this was
supposed to be a party.

280
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:44,070
Hey, Tommy! Tommy, come here!

281
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:50,716
- You're Black Beard, the Pirate.
- Thank you, Mr. Blake.

282
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,169
Aye aye, Captain.

283
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:59,819
Steph, honey, would you go down
and get the ice cream, please?

284
00:26:30,446 --> 00:26:32,582
All we need is a little order
around here!

285
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:34,149
Order!!

286
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,246
You're a good boy. You're
Daddy's little angels.

287
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,063


288
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,938
Why don't they just leave
me alone?!

289
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,961
Let me out! Let me out!

290
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,214
We're gonna keep this family
together.

291
00:26:51,162 --> 00:26:53,158
You had better believe it!!

292
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,264
Hi, honey.

293
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:09,041
Oh, the ice cream.

294
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:12,556
Honey,

295
00:27:13,204 --> 00:27:14,618
you know how it is.

296
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:19,940
Being a salesman, smiling all
the time, you know-Sometimes I,

297
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:23,698
have to let off some steam,
you know?

298
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,843
You know how it is.

299
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:33,522
Sure. I gotta get back or Mom
is gonna wonder where I'm at.

300
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:33,209
Steph,

301
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:36,967
things like these don't happen.

302
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:38,496
It happened to them.

303
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:41,425
Let me see if I follow your
thinking.

304
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,510
A man murdered his family.
You hate Jerry.

305
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:49,758
Therefore, Jerry is the man
who murdered his family.

306
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,618
Yeah... that all adds up.

307
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:54,920
Karen, maybe Jerry isn't the guy...

308
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:58,303
but you don't know him like I do,
or see him down in the basement.

309
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:02,230
And guess when Jerry showed up
in town and met my Mom?

310
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:03,958
Right after this!

311
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:07,160
So, what are you going to do,
Nancy Drew?

312
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:09,362
I'm writing this letter to
the "Seattle Examiner",

313
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:11,883
and ask them to send me a picture
of Henry Morrison.

314
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:15,471
I told them I'm in a project
about mass murders.

315
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,303
Off the deep end...

316
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:21,078
Give me a break.

317
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,895
You didn't run his fucking
picture!

318
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,807
- How is anyone gonna identify him?
- Get your hands off of me!

319
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,494
My editor didn't want the picture
not me, huh!

320
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:42,260
I almost didn't get the article
on the paper at all!

321
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:46,179
What do you want from me? I just
work here, I don't make policy.

322
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:49,394
I'm sorry.

323
00:29:50,142 --> 00:29:53,129
Yeah, I don't want this to happen
again. Almost gave me a coronary.

324
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,476
Here.

325
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:01,265
And this is a job for
professionals, Ogilvie.

326
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:03,210
You're just one man.

327
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,671
Why don't you get on with the rest
of your life? Forget about it!

328
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:12,488
You saw what he did to 'em.

329
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:15,636
Can you forget about it?

330
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:30,960
Mom says you only charge half
of your regular fees to see me.

331
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,940
How come you do that?

332
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:37,696
My 3 o'clock pacient is
schizophrenic. I charge him double.

333
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:39,342
All works out.

334
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,864
Besides, I like seeing you.

335
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:44,542
You were gonna tell me your idea.

336
00:30:46,364 --> 00:30:49,862
I wanna go to a boarding school.
Don't say it's running away.

337
00:30:50,037 --> 00:30:51,810
- What's the matter with running
away? - It's just that...

338
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,916
- What?
- Sometimes running away is the best.

339
00:30:57,465 --> 00:30:59,812
It gives everybody some breathing
room, right?

340
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:01,828
Right.

341
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:03,319
What do your folks say?

342
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,371
I think I can talk my Mom into it.

343
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:08,970
And what about... <i>him</i>?

344
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:12,768
He has this crazy thing about
breaking up the family.

345
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:16,441
If you saw this man, you would
say: "Commit him".

346
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:19,459
You probably are driving
him crazy

347
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,562
to a certain extent.
- Yeah...

348
00:31:22,184 --> 00:31:23,627
Why don't I have a talk with him?

349
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:26,997
If you could be on my side...

350
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:29,643
I <i>am</i> on your side.

351
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:31,341
I'll give your father...

352
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:33,398
Sorry.

353
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:36,130
I'll give... <i>him</i> a call.

354
00:32:38,898 --> 00:32:40,588
You're home awfully early.

355
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:44,188
Hi, honey, I run out of
appointments.

356
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:46,585
Anything for me?

357
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:49,100
As a matter of fact, something
did come for you.

358
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,026
Well, can I have it?

359
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:53,925
I don't know...

360
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,634
What do you mean?

361
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:59,010
I don't know if it's the kind of
thing you should be looking at.

362
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:06,095
I'm just kidding. Here you go.

363
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:38,709
Ohh... My sweet little thing.

364
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,814
My sweet little bitch.

365
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:43,993
That's my good girl.

366
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:46,678
Yes, you are daddy...

367
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:24,817
Jerry, honey!

368
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:28,036
Yes?

369
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,473
Dinner in 15 minutes.

370
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:47,886
Okay...

371
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,269
Where did you go?

372
00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:57,091
Oh, yeah...

373
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:01,092
Ahhh... That's my baby.

374
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:03,643
I'm sorry.

375
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:06,368
Hello?

376
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:07,941
Hi, Dr. Bondurant.

377
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:12,269
Jerry?

378
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:14,870
Dr. Bondurant is on the phone
for you.

379
00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:18,304
What does he want?

380
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:20,572
He wants you to come in for
a talk.

381
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:23,999
Tell him I'm not here.

382
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,302
- Why don't you just come up and
talk to him? <i>- Tell him...</i>

383
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:27,544
I'm not here!

384
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,927
And if he calls back, tell him
I'm <i>still</i> not here.

385
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:36,005
Er... Jerry can't come to the
phone right now. <i>- I see</i>

386
00:35:37,743 --> 00:35:39,714
Could I have him call you back?

387
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,189
- <i>Yes, that would be fine.</i>
- Thank you.

388
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,015
I take it you're the guy
that called me... Ogilvie?

389
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,532
I'm Lieutenant Wall.

390
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:19,419
You're in my parking space.

391
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:23,055
I figured this way you'd have to
talk to me about Henry Morrison.

392
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,590
For starters, Morrison isn't his
real name.

393
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:32,838
- Well, what is it?
- God only knows, we don't.

394
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:36,305
His personal history was falsified
and his prints were untraceable.

395
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:39,366
We talked to a criminal
psychologist

396
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:41,880
who proposed a possibility

397
00:36:41,954 --> 00:36:43,649
you might be interested in.

398
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:46,787
He said it was possible that
Morrison had done it before.

399
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:51,196
Married into an existing family,
something upsets him and wipes 'em out.

400
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:52,771
You knew him,

401
00:36:52,942 --> 00:36:54,173
What do you think?

402
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:57,522
I think it's better than a
possibility.

403
00:36:57,687 --> 00:36:59,166
What do you plan to do about it?

404
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:01,601
For the moment, nothing.

405
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:03,498
We don't have a single lead.

406
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,197
The guy is smart!

407
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,075
We won't have anything to go on
unless he does it again.

408
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:11,460
You're gonna wait until he gets to
another family and butchers them?

409
00:37:11,635 --> 00:37:14,182
You're not hearing me!
We've got nothing!

410
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,885
Zilch!

411
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,321
Lieutenant,

412
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:21,283
if you were me, what would you do?

413
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:24,090
Just between the two of us?

414
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:28,760
I'd get a gun and blow the son
of a bitch away.

415
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:50,171
How do you do, Mrs. Leitner?

416
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:52,280
- I'm Jerry Blake.
- How do you do? Please sit down.

417
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:55,699
I've come to talk about the
situation with Stephanie.

418
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,091
I'm afraid, Mr. Blake,
it's a lost cause.

419
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:02,083
Well... I'm sort of a believer
in lost causes.

420
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:04,344
OK.

421
00:38:04,922 --> 00:38:06,564
I guess I have to face it.

422
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:10,037
Jerry Blake is the most wonderful
man in the world.

423
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,341
He got you back into school,
didn't he?

424
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:15,316
You know why, don't you?
To get out of seeing you.

425
00:38:16,023 --> 00:38:17,567
Did it ever ocurred
to you that maybe...

426
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:19,997
it isn't the rest of
the world that's wrong?

427
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,980
I told you how phony he is, and
how he acted in the basement

428
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:27,033
... making faces at himself.
- Oh, come on! We all do that.

429
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,070
Why did he freak out and...

430
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:32,719
absolutely refused
to come and see you?

431
00:38:33,555 --> 00:38:35,409
Because he's afraid
of my eagle eye?

432
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,259
It's more than that.

433
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:45,447
He scares me, Dr. Bondurant.

434
00:38:47,604 --> 00:38:49,064
I'm afraid of him!

435
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:04,747
Jerry Blake here.

436
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:08,288
Which house was that?

437
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,500
Yes, sir, I'd be happy
to show you that house, Mr...

438
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,740
Martin?

439
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,299
<i>What about 4:30 tomorrow?</i>

440
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:19,447
Fine! I'll see you then.

441
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:36,988
So, are you gonna be
coming back to art class?

442
00:39:37,236 --> 00:39:39,583
No. They put me
in typing instead.

443
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:43,134
What a waste! You've got
a lot of artistic talent.

444
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,526
- Get out of here!
- No, really, I mean it.

445
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:48,044
You'd have a great future
as a big shirt designer.

446
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,886
I really liked the one
you made for Mr. Conroy.

447
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:53,946
The green hand print was great!

448
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:58,974
If I buy my own paints, would you
make one like that for me too?

449
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,286
No, but I might
do it to your face.

450
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:04,881
All right... Give it to me,
give me that shot. Come on!

451
00:40:05,174 --> 00:40:06,735
Maine she takes a jab!

452
00:40:08,558 --> 00:40:10,576
Baker shots her jaws!

453
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:14,834
Maine pounds at his
middle section!

454
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,733
Baker gets her to the corner!

455
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,480
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
- Sure, great.

456
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:31,646
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

457
00:41:32,878 --> 00:41:36,129
- Hi, sorry I'm a little late.
- No problem, no problem.

458
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:38,769
- Ray Martin.
- Hi, Ray. Jerry Blake.

459
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:42,525
- It's a great house.
- Wait till you see inside. Come.

460
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:49,212
- Come on in.
- Big mirror in the hall.

461
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:51,653
And lot of closets in here.

462
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,291
It's great. Kitchen back here?

463
00:41:54,873 --> 00:41:56,269
Yes, it's back here, yeah.

464
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,359
I forgot to tell you,
lovely hardwood floors.

465
00:41:59,795 --> 00:42:01,813
Look at the inlaid.
It's terrific.

466
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:05,169
- Right, very nice.
- I'll show you the bedroom.

467
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:08,490
Lot of space here.

468
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:11,877
Lot of room for kids.
You a family man, Ray?

469
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:14,475
Confirmed bachelor.
How about you, Jerry?

470
00:42:14,934 --> 00:42:17,153
Happily married. I wouldn't
trade it for the world.

471
00:42:18,154 --> 00:42:20,930
I don't know... I think
it just works for some guys.

472
00:42:21,266 --> 00:42:22,416
What's that?

473
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:26,954
You know, the family, <i>home
sweet home</i>, all that crap.

474
00:42:39,052 --> 00:42:41,617
What line of work are you in, Ray?
If you don't mind my asking.

475
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,951
Oh! Not at all!
I'm in stress management.

476
00:42:45,018 --> 00:42:48,798
Sounds complicated.
The kitchen has been remodeled.

477
00:42:49,427 --> 00:42:50,906
Built-ins. I like this.

478
00:42:51,491 --> 00:42:55,939
I try to find ways for employers
and employees to get along better.

479
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:59,048
I ask questions,
they give me answers.

480
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,998
For instance: <i>How do you sleep
at night?</i>

481
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:05,042
How do you sleep at night, Jerry?

482
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:08,505
- I sleep like a baby.
- See, that's interesting.

483
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:12,259
Because I think there'd be a lot
of stress in your line of work.

484
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:17,160
I suppose there's a certain degree
of stress in every job, Ray.

485
00:43:17,336 --> 00:43:18,943
It depends on how you handle it.

486
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:22,433
Which way am I facing?

487
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:24,192
North.

488
00:43:27,786 --> 00:43:31,694
Come on in here, Ray. Great big
room for kids to tumble around in.

489
00:43:32,892 --> 00:43:35,333
You know, a house like this should
really have a family in it.

490
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,087
You mean you won't sell it to me
because I don't have one?

491
00:43:38,676 --> 00:43:42,055
Oh, no! I didn't say that.
This is all being remodeled here.

492
00:43:42,637 --> 00:43:45,342
You really are a fan of traditional
values, aren't you, Jerry?

493
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:47,216
Tradition is important.

494
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,556
Sounds like you had
a strict up-bringing?

495
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,861
You might say that.

496
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:57,943
- Let me ask you a question, Ray.
- Sure.

497
00:43:59,786 --> 00:44:02,216
Are you interested in
buying a house or in me?

498
00:44:03,572 --> 00:44:04,675
Sorry.

499
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,059
Force of habit.

500
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:08,256
My wife gets on me
for that all the time.

501
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:14,752
I thought you said
you were a bachelor...

502
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,345
- Er... Recently divorced.
- I see.

503
00:44:17,837 --> 00:44:19,973
Sometimes I forget
I'm not married anymore.

504
00:44:20,272 --> 00:44:21,833
Probably it's just stress.

505
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,203
What are you-- ?

506
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,843
Who are you?
How did you get on to me?

507
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:42,238
I'm looking for--a house--

508
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:43,394
Oh, oh, oh...

509
00:44:43,464 --> 00:44:45,618
I don't think this house
is right for you.

510
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:47,641
I think you'd be more comfortable
somewhere else.

511
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:49,441
This house is for a family!

512
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:51,396
You know what I mean?
A family...!?

513
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:52,721
... Home, sweet home?!

514
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:54,112
All that crap!!

515
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:22,419
OK.

516
00:45:23,091 --> 00:45:24,159
It's alright.

517
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:27,842
A little order around here...

518
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,311
Just a little order, that's all.

519
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:33,678
A little order around here!!

520
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:41,533
Bondurant.

521
00:45:44,598 --> 00:45:45,912
Dr. Bondurant?

522
00:45:52,398 --> 00:45:53,383
Well,

523
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:55,938
Dr. Bondurant.

524
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:07,623
Rest in peace, doctor.

525
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,217
Come on, come on, Doctor.
Let's go.

526
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:27,890
All right, doctor.

527
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:29,502
We got to go...

528
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:31,069
... a little ride.

529
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:32,650
We'll take a little ride.

530
00:46:33,116 --> 00:46:37,096
You seem disappointed he didn't
turn out to be Jack the Ripper.

531
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,047
I was wrong, Karen.

532
00:46:42,212 --> 00:46:43,902
I was totally wrong.

533
00:46:54,032 --> 00:46:55,100
Doctor.

534
00:47:20,715 --> 00:47:22,376
Buckle up for safety.

535
00:49:12,152 --> 00:49:13,172
Steph?

536
00:49:18,177 --> 00:49:21,017
I'm sorry, honey. I have some
bad news about Dr. Bondurant.

537
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:24,442
His office just called.

538
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:29,064
What? I shouldn't go
to my hour tomorrow?

539
00:49:29,278 --> 00:49:31,542
No, no. It's more
serious than that.

540
00:49:33,569 --> 00:49:36,410
There was an accident sometime
last night up by the highway.

541
00:49:37,325 --> 00:49:40,412
He-- lost control or something,
his car went off the road.

542
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:43,126
His car?

543
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,227
He's dead, Steph.

544
00:49:53,136 --> 00:49:54,286
Sorry.

545
00:49:57,439 --> 00:49:58,606
What happened?

546
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:01,434
Nobody knows.

547
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:04,468
Police say he lost
control of his car.

548
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:07,604
Just one of those stupid
unnecessary accidents.

549
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:12,657
He was my friend!

550
00:50:13,952 --> 00:50:15,155
I know, baby.

551
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,114
He was a very special man.

552
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,034
In his own way, he helped
bring us together.

553
00:50:28,795 --> 00:50:30,978
And nothing is ever
gonna split us apart.

554
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:32,931
Can I help?

555
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:35,512
Yeah, would you honey?
Thanks.

556
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,427
What do you think?

557
00:52:43,477 --> 00:52:44,638
I like it!

558
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:45,942
Is it straight?

559
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:49,015
A little bit towards me.

560
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,125
Perfect!

561
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:56,074
- Jerry...
- Yeah?

562
00:52:59,673 --> 00:53:01,280
I just wanna say that...

563
00:53:02,314 --> 00:53:04,086
I know I've been a
lot of trouble.

564
00:53:05,037 --> 00:53:06,223
And I'm sorry...

565
00:53:09,495 --> 00:53:12,910
Well, let's say we owe each other
an apology and bury the hatchets.

566
00:53:14,447 --> 00:53:15,515
Deal.

567
00:53:21,704 --> 00:53:24,762
When I was a kid I went through
some pretty rough times myself.

568
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,110
So, what happened?

569
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,744
I outgrew my problems
and so will you.

570
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,769
Besides, you'll be too busy
checking boyfriends.

571
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:36,983
Boyfriends?

572
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,268
Yeah, you know...
Boys, girls, dating.

573
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:46,190
He's so old fashioned.
Aren't you?

574
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:49,196
Guilty as charged, Your Honor.

575
00:53:50,813 --> 00:53:52,749
There's plenty of time
for that, sweetheart.

576
00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:54,931
Don't try to grow up
too fast, huh?

577
00:53:55,105 --> 00:53:56,255
OK.

578
00:53:57,003 --> 00:53:59,434
It'll be nice with a family of
birds leaving in there.

579
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:42,840
Dear Lord,

580
00:54:43,429 --> 00:54:45,730
we thank you for the meal
we're about to enjoy,

581
00:54:46,854 --> 00:54:48,663
for our dear friends,

582
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:51,178
our wonderful home,

583
00:54:51,925 --> 00:54:53,286
but most of all, Father,

584
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:57,079
we thank you for bringing us
together as a family.

585
00:54:58,988 --> 00:55:01,024
- Amen.
- Amen.

586
00:55:07,447 --> 00:55:09,091
Oh... sweetheart,

587
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:12,327
everything looks absolutely
perfect.

588
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:15,826
What do you think of this
turkey, Steph, huh?

589
00:55:16,301 --> 00:55:17,797
Looks almost good enough to eat.

590
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:18,972
Yeah.

591
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:21,971
What do you say if we cut up
this bird? Steph?

592
00:55:22,037 --> 00:55:23,222
Light or dark?

593
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:26,728
Wait, wait, wait, let me guess.
You're the...

594
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,176
... drumstick-type.

595
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,961
Two drumstick-type.

596
00:55:35,796 --> 00:55:36,999
You know?

597
00:55:38,097 --> 00:55:39,875
Until this moment,

598
00:55:41,622 --> 00:55:44,527
I never realized what
Thanksgiving was all about.

599
00:56:23,689 --> 00:56:25,543
Well, if it isn't
the Road Warrior!

600
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:28,389
- Come on, hop on.
- Looks dangerous...

601
00:56:28,766 --> 00:56:32,070
- No, this bike is totally safe.
- I meant <i>you</i>.

602
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:36,440
Me? You are the dangerous one,
you and that mean right hook.

603
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:38,543
Come on... Chicken.

604
00:56:42,082 --> 00:56:43,825
Only if I get to drive.

605
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:49,364
So how come you're not with ever
popular Kathy Lombardo tonight?

606
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,082
Kathy Lombardo is a
stuck up bitch.

607
00:56:52,258 --> 00:56:53,654
She dumped you!

608
00:56:53,908 --> 00:56:55,551
No, no! I dumped her.

609
00:56:56,137 --> 00:56:57,698
Alright, alright,
she dumped me.

610
00:56:58,076 --> 00:57:00,834
Come on! Watch where
you're going. Easy.

611
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:05,047
We're OK now. You can stop
holding on so tight.

612
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,648
Do I have to?

613
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:09,094
Not if you don't want to.

614
00:57:22,218 --> 00:57:24,272
- I walk you up.
- OK.

615
00:57:36,506 --> 00:57:38,231
Well, thanks for the ride.

616
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:41,389
- It's your bike.
- Right.

617
00:57:43,923 --> 00:57:45,596
Well...

618
00:57:46,228 --> 00:57:48,135
- Good night.
- Good night.

619
00:57:50,702 --> 00:57:52,838
I-I- guess I'll see you
in school, huh?

620
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:55,199
I guess so.

621
00:57:58,873 --> 00:58:00,316
That's the Miller's dog.

622
00:58:00,482 --> 00:58:01,633
Yeah.

623
00:58:04,444 --> 00:58:06,955
Anyway-- er-- bye.

624
00:58:07,704 --> 00:58:08,890
Bye...

625
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:24,207
You!

626
00:58:25,862 --> 00:58:28,668
You could go to jail!
This girl is 16 years old!

627
00:58:28,834 --> 00:58:31,427
- And so am I.
- Jerry. What's wrong?

628
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,734
This punk was trying
to rape our daughter!

629
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:35,305
I just kissed her good night!

630
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,038
Stephanie? What's going on?

631
00:58:37,211 --> 00:58:40,158
- Go home, Paul!
- Steph, are you sure?

632
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:42,044
Go home and I'll talk to you
tomorrow...Go!

633
00:58:42,115 --> 00:58:44,016
Would somebody please tell me
what this is all about?

634
00:58:44,226 --> 00:58:45,412
He kissed me good night.

635
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:48,465
I wanted him to.
I like Paul, Mom!

636
00:58:48,642 --> 00:58:52,515
- Of course you do, honey...
- She's still a child!

637
00:58:52,686 --> 00:58:53,918
I'm not a child!

638
00:58:54,502 --> 00:58:57,916
Just 'cause you're a crazy
demented about sex!

639
00:58:58,092 --> 00:59:01,344
- Don't you talk to your father
that way!
- He's not my father.

640
00:59:02,137 --> 00:59:05,142
He's just some crazy creep!
How can you even bare to... 

641
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,375
... let him touch you?
- Stop it!

642
00:59:06,553 --> 00:59:09,064
He's your father now and
you'll respect him!

643
00:59:12,206 --> 00:59:14,847
Stephanie!
Stephanie, come back!

644
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:18,186
Let her go, Susan. She'll come
back when she calms down.

645
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,590
What were you thinking of...

646
00:59:19,758 --> 00:59:22,563
... making such a stupid scene?
- That punk was undressing her!

647
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:25,370
That's Paul Baker. I've known him
longer than I've known you!

648
00:59:26,278 --> 00:59:29,708
- Meaning what?
- All the progress we've made

649
00:59:29,878 --> 00:59:34,155
with Stephanie thrown away,
just thrown away! by you!

650
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:42,907
I...

651
01:00:17,577 --> 01:00:19,631
- Bye, Ron.
- Good luck. Take care.

652
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,103
- Good bye, Audrey, don't work
too hard, uh? - Good luck!

653
01:00:23,726 --> 01:00:25,368
Bye Sylvia, thanks for everything.

654
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:37,506
- Bye everybody!
- Bye, Jerry!

655
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:43,742
- We'll miss you, Jerry.
- Thanks, Mr. Grace.

656
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:45,216
- Good luck.
- Thanks for everything. Good bye.

657
01:00:59,886 --> 01:01:03,595
Just listen to me. All I'm saying
is that the guy just married again,

658
01:01:03,848 --> 01:01:05,859
to a divorcee with kids or
a widow. I know him!

659
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,337
This guy can not live
without a family.

660
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:11,314
- Now, you gotta help me!
- I don't have time.

661
01:01:11,482 --> 01:01:13,718
Come on! All I'm asking for are
copies of marriage certificates

662
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,331
for the last year. How much
time is that gonna take?

663
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,684
More time than I've got
or care to spare.

664
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:21,584
Come back in a couple of weeks.

665
01:01:21,757 --> 01:01:23,858
- I need them now!
- Good bye...

666
01:01:24,941 --> 01:01:27,642
- Asshole.
- You're not qualified.

667
01:01:27,782 --> 01:01:30,384
- What?
- To call him asshole.

668
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:32,900
It's an earned privilege. You have
to know him for half an hour.

669
01:01:33,554 --> 01:01:36,360
Well, perhaps you can help me
here, Miss... Barnes.

670
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,024
I could. The question is:
why should I?

671
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:42,551
Because the asshole wouldn't
like it, and I would.

672
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:45,568
What do you say, Miss Barnes?

673
01:01:47,891 --> 01:01:49,106
I say...

674
01:01:50,061 --> 01:01:52,408
... you're qualified to call
me Annie.

675
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:54,235
Ok.

676
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,124
Honey... honey!

677
01:01:59,222 --> 01:02:03,278
They say this Dr. is one of the
best. Have a good session, huh?

678
01:02:24,731 --> 01:02:25,998
Miss Maine?

679
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,784
Miss Stephanie Maine?

680
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:30,233
Sorry, wrong office.

681
01:04:03,553 --> 01:04:05,142
- Mr. Meredith?
- Yeah, that's me.

682
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:08,262
Sorry to have bothered you.
Thanks.

683
01:04:28,348 --> 01:04:30,531
Over here.

684
01:06:46,557 --> 01:06:49,279
This house was supposed to be
empty. I'm sorry about that.

685
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:52,656


686
01:07:04,389 --> 01:07:08,078
- Hi, I'm Bill Hodgkins.
- The man who phoned about the job?

687
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:09,521
- That's right.
- Roy Chesterton.

688
01:07:09,588 --> 01:07:10,774
How'd you do?

689
01:07:10,991 --> 01:07:14,078
- You ever sold insurance before?
- Back east in Pennsylvania.

690
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:16,922
If there's a policy I haven't sold
I'd like to know what it is.

691
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:18,906
Especialized in any one area?

692
01:07:19,162 --> 01:07:21,686
Well, I'm pretty comfortable
in all of them but if I have a

693
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,310
personal crusade, it's family
related policies, life insurance.

694
01:07:25,477 --> 01:07:28,728
That's a toughy. People don't
wanna think they're gonna die

695
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,781
- I know I don't.
- Death is always something

696
01:07:31,956 --> 01:07:33,399
that happens to someone else.

697
01:07:33,813 --> 01:07:36,454
That's why I really believe that
I'm protecting the family.

698
01:07:36,702 --> 01:07:40,035
I'm glad to hear you say that.
That's our main objective here.

699
01:08:27,058 --> 01:08:28,043
Jerry?

700
01:08:29,327 --> 01:08:30,853
We have to talk, honey.

701
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:32,666
About what?

702
01:08:32,906 --> 01:08:33,992
About what?

703
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,978
About what is happening
to our family.

704
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,111
I'm taking care of it.

705
01:08:42,615 --> 01:08:44,066
By yourself?

706
01:09:12,947 --> 01:09:14,801
Daddy is home!
Daddy is home!

707
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,627
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Look who's here!

708
01:10:23,483 --> 01:10:25,537
- Yes?
- Hi! Is Gerald Blake home?

709
01:10:25,711 --> 01:10:28,012
No. Was he supposed to show
you a house?

710
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,703
He sells houses?

711
01:10:29,879 --> 01:10:31,405
Yes, he does.

712
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,045
Can I help you?

713
01:10:33,222 --> 01:10:34,912
No, I'll just drop by later.

714
01:10:35,615 --> 01:10:37,340
See, I'm not even sure it's
the same Gerald Blake.

715
01:10:37,514 --> 01:10:38,745
Well, I can give him a
message for you.

716
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:40,150
No, that's okay.

717
01:10:41,476 --> 01:10:43,858
If it's the guy I know, I'd
rather just surprise him.

718
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:45,926
- All right.
- Ok, thanks.

719
01:10:46,181 --> 01:10:47,366
You're welcome.

720
01:11:20,272 --> 01:11:21,292
Hi.

721
01:11:22,046 --> 01:11:23,149
Hello.

722
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:26,213
I'm Bill Hodgkins. I've just
rented the house next door.

723
01:11:27,446 --> 01:11:28,549
So, we're neighbors.

724
01:11:30,187 --> 01:11:31,549
I'm Dorothy Reinhard.

725
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:33,558
Welcome to Madison St.

726
01:11:33,824 --> 01:11:34,620
Thank you.

727
01:11:36,643 --> 01:11:37,693
Hard work.

728
01:11:37,864 --> 01:11:41,719
Oh, the kids were supposed to do
it, but... you know how kids are.

729
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,250
It's just you and the kids, then?

730
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:47,055
Yeah.

731
01:11:50,691 --> 01:11:51,877
Jerry Blake, please?

732
01:11:52,253 --> 01:11:55,469
I'm sorry but Mr. Blake is no
longer connected with this agency.

733
01:11:56,321 --> 01:11:58,063
There must be some mistake.

734
01:11:58,249 --> 01:12:00,767
<i>No, there isn't. I can give you
his home number though. It's...</i>

735
01:12:00,802 --> 01:12:04,035
I know that number! I'm calling
from that number.

736
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:06,833
I'm sorry, Madam, but Mr. Blake
left several days ago.

737
01:12:09,874 --> 01:12:11,235
Well, thank you very much.

738
01:12:23,823 --> 01:12:25,596
- It's about time!
- Mrs. Fairfax?

739
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:31,122
Not for long. Put this in the
trunk. I'm leaving now!

740
01:12:32,954 --> 01:12:34,808
Is this him? Is this the guy?

741
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:37,077
Sure, I'm having an affair
with the cab driver.

742
01:12:37,246 --> 01:12:39,887
You let her in your cab and I'll
break every bone in your body!

743
01:12:40,052 --> 01:12:43,350
- I'm not a cab driver, okay?
- OK.

744
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:45,616
I just wanna ask you a question.

745
01:12:46,201 --> 01:12:48,055
You ever seen this guy before?

746
01:12:49,502 --> 01:12:52,143
The beard's new, but he looks like
the guy who sold us this house.

747
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:54,023
- Muriel?
- Could be him.

748
01:12:54,437 --> 01:12:55,751
He sells houses?

749
01:12:56,394 --> 01:12:57,708
Yeah... that's right.

750
01:13:10,218 --> 01:13:12,156
Hey, what the hell are you
doing, buddy?

751
01:13:32,278 --> 01:13:33,656
Hi, honey.

752
01:13:35,538 --> 01:13:36,805
Where've you been?

753
01:13:37,024 --> 01:13:39,259
Showing the Morton house to
some folks from California.

754
01:13:39,535 --> 01:13:42,076
- Don't lie to me, Jerry.
- What?

755
01:13:42,595 --> 01:13:44,073
I called your office today.

756
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:45,706
I didn't get the message.

757
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,467
Of course you didn't. They said
you stopped working there...

758
01:13:48,537 --> 01:13:51,020
... several days ago.
- What?

759
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:53,762
The recepcionist said
that you left!

760
01:13:54,037 --> 01:13:55,262
That idiot!

761
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:58,059
That new girl can't...
Susan... I've never

762
01:13:58,376 --> 01:14:00,118
got anyone fired in my life,

763
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:02,786
but that girl... I don't know...
- You mean you still work there?

764
01:14:03,123 --> 01:14:05,030
Of course. Where else
would I be?

765
01:14:05,146 --> 01:14:07,847
I don't know! I just-I don't

766
01:14:08,016 --> 01:14:10,163
know what I thought. Sorry.

767
01:14:10,233 --> 01:14:12,315
This is very upsetting. I hope
Grace is still there...

768
01:14:12,492 --> 01:14:15,781
No, forget it, honey.
Forget it! She probably just--

769
01:14:16,355 --> 01:14:18,178
got the name wrong or
something.

770
01:14:18,244 --> 01:14:20,334
Hodgkins! What's to get wrong?

771
01:14:21,144 --> 01:14:22,294
What did you say?

772
01:14:22,577 --> 01:14:23,645
What?

773
01:14:25,596 --> 01:14:27,138
Wait a minute...

774
01:14:28,513 --> 01:14:29,745
Who am I here?

775
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:32,174
Jerry... !

776
01:14:32,516 --> 01:14:34,083
Jerry?

777
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:38,574
Jerry Blake. Thank you, honey.

778
01:14:47,854 --> 01:14:49,621
You're alright, sweetheart?

779
01:14:51,252 --> 01:14:52,320
Jerry?

780
01:14:56,287 --> 01:14:59,209
Where are you going?
Susan! Susan, come here!

781
01:14:59,464 --> 01:15:00,696
Come here!

782
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:33,027
A little order around here, huh!

783
01:15:38,212 --> 01:15:39,373
Come on, Rinnie.

784
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,031
Come on, Rinnie. Come on, fella.

785
01:15:42,599 --> 01:15:44,013
Come on, come on...

786
01:15:44,297 --> 01:15:45,593
Come on, fella, come on...

787
01:15:46,565 --> 01:15:48,619
Come see me, come on...

788
01:15:49,012 --> 01:15:51,148
Here boy, here boy.

789
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:55,755
Yeah! That's my little fella.

790
01:15:55,932 --> 01:15:58,151
That's a good Rinnie,
that's a good Rinnie, yeah.

791
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:05,756
Oh, yes! Yeah, you're a good dog.

792
01:16:06,219 --> 01:16:07,426
You're a good dog!

793
01:16:07,882 --> 01:16:09,085
