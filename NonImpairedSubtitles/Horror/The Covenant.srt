1
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,372
What's up, fellas?

2
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:46,474
Where were you?
I stopped by to give you a lift.

3
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,028
Had things to do. How's the party?

4
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,923
Don't know. Just got here.

5
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:53,008
Well, hell, boys...

6
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:56,400
...let's drop in.

7
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:59,727
Oh, shit, yeah.

8
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:01,741
Tyler!

9
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:05,297
Come on, Caleb.
It's not like it's gonna kill us...

10
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:06,797
...yet.

11
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:41,976
So give me the scoop. Who's here?

12
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:44,930
The first thing you have to know
is that Aaron Abbot is a prick.

13
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,165
- Treats girls like dirt.
- Okay.

14
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:49,089
- Who's that?
- The new guy.

15
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:50,564
He's looking over here.

16
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:52,930
Don't know much about him,
but I intend to find out.

17
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:54,754
He's cute.

18
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:58,694
- Hey, who's that chick with Kate?
- Sarah something.

19
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:00,898
She transferred in
from a Boston public.

20
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,425
She's kind of hot.

21
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:12,904
- Yo, Caleb.
- They're here.

22
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:17,804
- Who are they?
- The Sons of Ipswich.

23
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,200
- Hey, Kate.
- Caleb.

24
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:25,867
- Hi. You're late.
- I had a thing with the family.

25
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,588
- Who's this?
- My new roommate.

26
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:31,212
Sarah, this is Pogue Parry,
Tyler Simms...

27
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:34,961
...Reid...
- Garwin. Reid Garwin.

28
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,239
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

29
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:38,131
You know,
Sarah's my grandmother's name.

30
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,947
- You kind of remind me of her.
- Caleb Danvers.

31
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:43,961
And you don't bring
my grandmother to mind in any way.

32
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:46,454
Good. Sarah.

33
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:49,745
- Hey, Caleb.
- Kira.

34
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:52,052
How was your summer?

35
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:58,553
- I'm Kira.
- Sarah.

36
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:01,206
Oh, right. From the Boston public.

37
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:05,403
Tell me, how does one go about
getting into Spenser from a public?

38
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:08,669
- Why don't you give it a rest, Kira?
- Why don't you give it a rest?

39
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:11,618
- I don't want any trouble, Aaron.
- I'm sure you don't.

40
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:13,757
You posers make me wanna puke.

41
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:15,680
- Is that right?
- Hey, let it go.

42
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,974
I think you owe Kira an apology.

43
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:24,578
Actually, I think
Kira owes Sarah the apology.

44
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:31,689
You were being kind of bitchy.

45
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:36,616
Disgusting! You idiot!

46
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:40,934
Guys, Dylan just called.

47
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:43,852
He said he saw three cop cars
headed this way on Old Dell Road.

48
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:45,542
- Hey, let's roll!
- Let's go.

49
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,206
- Let's go, boys.
- Let's go!

50
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:56,296
- You need a ride?
- No, Sarah drove us out here.

51
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:59,949
- Will I see you back at the dorms?
- It's getting late. I'm just gonna crash.

52
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:01,808
Call me in the morning?

53
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:05,588
- I could use a lift.
- No problem.

54
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,687
- Hey, nice going back there. Caleb.
- Chase.

55
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:10,897
Thought that guy and I
were about to go at it.

56
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,487
His friend's puking
sure came at an opportune time.

57
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:14,869
Didn't it, though?

58
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:21,458
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hop in my truck.

59
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:25,310
- Good night.
- I got room. Who needs a ride?

60
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:28,569
Hey, guys, let's go.
We gotta go before the cops come.

61
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:31,994
Sarah wants you, man.

62
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,715
- That's bullshit.
- Oh, now. Don't be jealous, Reid.

63
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:38,978
- My car won't start!
- Hop in with us.

64
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,660
- I can't just leave it here!
- I could fix it for you.

65
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:44,795
- Reid, don't.
- It's not over yet, boys.

66
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,671
Let it go. It's his life, man.

67
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:01,476
Try it again.

68
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:06,598
Thank you!

69
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:11,820
- Gotta bolt. Move over.
- It's my car.

70
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:13,773
Move over, baby boy. Now!

71
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:22,602
No sweat.

72
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:34,734
We gotta pull over.

73
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,627
You wanna stop?
That'll impress Harvard.

74
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,958
All right, what the hell?
Let's lose them.

75
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:42,457
Cut across Marblehead.
We might as well have some fun.

76
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,683
Lose them!

77
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:06,137
- Step on it. Go!
- Stupid kids.

78
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:34,024
All right, guys, you ready?

79
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:36,611
Come on, Caleb.
It's gonna take all of us.

80
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:41,318
Hey, they don't know.
Hit the horn. Hit the horn!

81
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:51,882
- Holy shit, they're going over.
- Harry Potter can kiss my ass!

82
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,330
Stop the car! Stop the car!

83
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,466
Son of a bitch.

84
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:52,161
We must be the last ones in.

85
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:58,433
Well, this is us.

86
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:04,998
- Just a sec.
- Oh, my God!

87
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,483
- Hate those things.
- And they're all over the place here.

88
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:09,899
Thank you.

89
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:12,203
See? Chivalry's not dead after all.

90
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:14,028
No, it just transferred in.

91
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,716
We're gonna go into town
tomorrow for some things.

92
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,088
- Do you need to pick up any stuff?
- Sure.

93
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,391
I'm in 311. Call me.

94
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:23,953
Okay.

95
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,728
- He's hot, huh?
- Listen to you.

96
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:35,031
- Thanks for the ride.
- All right. Take it easy.

97
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:38,096
- I'll see you later, man.
- Call me in the morning.

98
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,047
You're home early.

99
00:11:08,678 --> 00:11:11,646
It's after midnight, Mother.
What are you still doing up?

100
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:18,246
Thinking about my baby
turning 18 this week.

101
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:25,057
God. You look so much
like him in this light.

102
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:30,764
You know, he was a year younger
than you when we met.

103
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:33,065
Did I ever tell you that?

104
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:36,265
Yeah. You've told me.

105
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,158
Now, let's get you up to bed.

106
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:41,286
So handsome.

107
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:46,603
He was the most beautiful man
I'd ever seen.

108
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:53,105
I'm so afraid I'll lose you
like I did him.

109
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,892
How many times do I need to tell you
that I'm not him?

110
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:59,372
That's the same thing
he said about his father.

111
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,758
You know, these powers...

112
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,641
...that you and your friends developed
when you were 13...

113
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:12,474
...are nothing compared with
what you'll get when you ascend.

114
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:15,355
They are 1000 times stronger.

115
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,883
Caleb.

116
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:22,393
They are so seductive.

117
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,927
You'll suddenly think...

118
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,055
...the world is yours for the taking.

119
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,397
And then you really start to use...

120
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:40,606
...and use...

121
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:42,270
...aging each time.

122
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:45,637
Taking bits of your life...

123
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:50,856
...until there is nothing left.
- I won't.

124
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,082
That's what he said.

125
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:58,757
I can't lose you both.

126
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,687
I won't survive it this time.

127
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,648
I won't.

128
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:28,591
So why do you call them
"the Sons of Ipswich"?

129
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,964
What are they? Like, a boy band?

130
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,985
You know what? I like you.
You're funny.

131
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,286
Not like all the other
stuck-up bitches.

132
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:38,105
No. They're supposedly descendants
of five families...

133
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,657
...that settled the Ipswich Colony
in the 1600s.

134
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,040
Old money.

135
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:47,483
Caleb and Reid were both
checking you out tonight.

136
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,141
If it were me, I'd go for Caleb.

137
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:50,847
Why?

138
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:52,951
He's just one of those
majorly good guys.

139
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:54,910
Well, how do you mean?

140
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,410
He could stay here
and party with the rest of us...

141
00:13:57,891 --> 00:13:59,997
...but he stays at home
to take care of his mom.

142
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:01,691
What's wrong with her?

143
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:04,284
After Caleb's dad died,
she became a bit of an alcoholic.

144
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:06,687
So is he seeing anyone?

145
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:08,324
So we are interested.

146
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,567
- So who's the fifth?
- Fifth what?

147
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,901
Well, you said five families.

148
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,496
They say the fifth was killed
during the witch-hunt.

149
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,212
- What?
- Cool, huh?

150
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:24,295
Or creepy.

151
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:34,152
Couldn't see nothing but their taillights
in the damn fog.

152
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,433
But I swear to God...

153
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:38,318
...it sure seemed like
they went right off the damn cliffs.

154
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:42,124
What you were
probably looking at...

155
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,609
...were the aircraft warning lights
on the Marblehead lighthouse.

156
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:49,078
<i>Captain, we have a suspect vehicle
with occupant back near the Dells.</i>

157
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,246
<i>Respond and advise.</i>

158
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:07,188
We tried to wake him,
but he's passed out cold.

159
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:08,437
Doors are all locked.

160
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:11,028
Go ahead and call it in.
We're gonna need a tow.

161
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,359
Hey, kid!

162
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:16,503
Open up!

163
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,462
Give me your flashlight.

164
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:24,985
Break out the rear window.

165
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:35,046
Son.

166
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,064
Somebody there?

167
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:40,569
Hello?

168
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:50,812
Hello?

169
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,490
- Oh, my God.
- Didn't mean to scare you.

170
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:41,183
- Oh, my God.
- Just got back.

171
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:44,582
Sorry. I'm just a little freaked out.

172
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,952
It felt like someone was watching me
in the showers.

173
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:53,347
Let's take a look, shall we?

174
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:55,912
It's okay.

175
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,529
Don't see anyone.

176
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,214
- I'll catch you later, then.
- Yeah, see you.

177
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,689
<i>- What makes you think it was Reid?
- It's always him.</i>

178
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:57,343
I've never felt it when one of us
used The Power. Have you?

179
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,675
No. I don't know, maybe it's because
you're so close to ascending.

180
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,688
I don't know. Maybe.

181
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:07,590
I'm telling you, it was strong enough
to wake me out of a dead sleep.

182
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,793
He's only using his powers
to piss you off...

183
00:20:09,962 --> 00:20:12,451
...because he's jealous
you're ascending first, man.

184
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,363
I'm telling you, just... Jesus!

185
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:17,382
<i>Caleb?</i>

186
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:34,961
<i>What's going on, Caleb? Pick up.</i>

187
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:37,742
<i>Caleb, pick up the phone, man.</i>

188
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:39,669
Caleb, what's going on?

189
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:42,867
I just saw a darkling.

190
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:45,584
It was in the form of that dead kid
they found at the Dells.

191
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:47,793
I saw his picture this morning
in the newspaper.

192
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:50,830
<i>- But who'd send you a darkling?
- I have no idea.</i>

193
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,978
<i>Something's wrong. I can feel it.</i>

194
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:54,641
We gotta talk to Reid tonight.

195
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:56,056
<i>He'll probably be at Nicky's.</i>

196
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,627
<i>- We'll see him then.
- Definitely.</i>

197
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:24,479
- Here you go, Caleb.
- Thanks.

198
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:26,207
Hey, Caleb.

199
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:29,638
- Oh, hey, Kate. What are you up to?
- I'm just stocking up our room.

200
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,630
- Did you hear about the dead kid?
- Yeah, I did.

201
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:35,523
Did you know him?

202
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:38,886
No. No, he just transferred in.

203
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:41,157
Yeah, I heard he lived on
Reid and Tyler's floor.

204
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:45,387
- Hi.
- Hi there.

205
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,024
You scared me.

206
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:52,014
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

207
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:55,784
I'm gonna see if Pogue wants to catch
that new Brad Pitt flick this afternoon.

208
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:58,125
- Who else wants to go?
- I will.

209
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:01,420
I gotta run some errands
for my mother.

210
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:02,698
I already saw it.

211
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:06,763
- Do you feel like running errands?
- Sure.

212
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:32,698
I wish I'd brought my camera.
This place is so beautiful.

213
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:42,647
That's the old Putnam barn.
What's left of it.

214
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,819
This whole place, for miles around,
was the original Ipswich Colony.

215
00:22:50,405 --> 00:22:52,773
- So, what brought you to Spenser?
- A scholarship.

216
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,717
- But why Spenser?
- I want to go to Harvard.

217
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:58,880
- My father was class of '81.
- That's so cool.

218
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,479
- Kate told me he passed away.
- You and Kate talk about me?

219
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,714
Well, you know, just girl stuff.

220
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:34,672
It's our family's first colony house.

221
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:41,102
- Wait. Somebody lives here?
- Just our caretaker, Gorman.

222
00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:44,854
Gorman! It's me! It's okay!

223
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:47,672
- He doesn't see that well anymore.
- You think?

224
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:51,897
- Who's with you?
- Just a friend.

225
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:54,613
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

226
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,211
Caleb.

227
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:36,197
- You should be more careful.
- I know, Gorman.

228
00:24:38,347 --> 00:24:41,383
- Is there anything else he needs?
- No.

229
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:44,483
I'll see you next week, then.

230
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:04,370
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

231
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:07,221
So you wanna shower
or change first?

232
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:10,647
- For what?
- We're going to Nicky's.

233
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,658
What's Nicky's?

234
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,126
Hey. How are you?

235
00:25:36,352 --> 00:25:38,940
Oh, hey, baby!
You missed a great movie.

236
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:40,601
Yeah, I had to get my bike fixed.

237
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:42,975
That's cool. Chase hung out
and kept me company.

238
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:45,570
I'll just bet he did.

239
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,983
- What's up, man?
- It's all good.

240
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,730
You want something to eat?

241
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:56,263
I'll just pick at
whatever you're having.

242
00:26:04,844 --> 00:26:07,146
Can I get a burger, fries and a Coke?

243
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:09,730
- Corner pocket.
- Great shot.

244
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:17,416
Well, well, well...

245
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:19,495
- How long you guys been here?
- A bit.

246
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:24,074
Just been playing Aaron and Bordy,
and... Would you look at that?

247
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,636
- Blue, cotton.
- Pink, lace.

248
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:34,035
Boys, that girl hasn't worn panties
since she was 12.

249
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:43,600
Yeah. Thanks, boys.

250
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,015
Keep the change.

251
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,385
Next time.

252
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:04,925
You guys are real tight, huh?

253
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:07,646
Families are real close.
We kind of grew up together.

254
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:11,806
- We're kind of like brothers.
- That must have been nice.

255
00:27:14,853 --> 00:27:16,828
- The best two out of three.
- Okay.

256
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:19,900
Hey, Chase.
Mind if I get in a game?

257
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,177
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

258
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:26,210
Reid and Tyler are here.

259
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:29,188
- Where?
- Pool tables. With Aaron and the boys.

260
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,385
Great. That's trouble.

261
00:27:33,547 --> 00:27:35,786
So Caleb tells me
you guys are swimmers.

262
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:38,345
Spenser's best. State finals twice.

263
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,176
I swam for Hastings.
I was their freestyle man.

264
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:46,347
You won't be here.
That's Caleb's swim.

265
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:52,972
- Okay, what just happened?
- What?

266
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,994
We were sitting here together,
having fun...

267
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:56,814
...and now we're
watching them have fun.

268
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,790
That's what girls do.
You know boys and their toys.

269
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:02,997
- Give me a quarter.
- Why?

270
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:05,461
Just give me a quarter.
I'll show you what girls do.

271
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:07,831
Thank you.

272
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,672
Gentlemen, it was a pleasure.

273
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,878
What?

274
00:29:15,313 --> 00:29:17,932
- Blow me!
- Let's take it outside. Come on.

275
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:21,165
Hey, it's Reid and Tyler.
Grab my jacket.

276
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,363
- You guys need help?
- Just stay with the girls.

277
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:26,094
Get him, Reid!

278
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:28,460
Let's go. Bring it on, man.

279
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:32,077
He made the shot, dickhead.
You bet him he couldn't and he did.

280
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:34,582
We ain't paying you shit,
so if you don't like it...

281
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:35,857
What's the problem?

282
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,703
He bet me I couldn't
make a combo shot, and I did.

283
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:44,185
- Everyone just forget about it, okay?
- Hey! Take it someplace else, ladies.

284
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:50,392
- Now.
- Whatever you say, Nicky.

285
00:29:58,336 --> 00:30:00,826
- What were you thinking?
- We were just playing them.

286
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:03,329
Yeah, come on, Caleb.
They were suckers for it.

287
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,913
Why don't you quit
being such a pussy?

288
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,545
I'm not finished with you yet.

289
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,286
Reid, stop.

290
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,544
What will it take for you to get it?

291
00:30:24,713 --> 00:30:26,275
It's addictive, you moron!

292
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:29,354
You've seen what it can do
if you abuse it.

293
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:31,404
You want that? That's your business.

294
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:36,487
But if you use in the open, like you
did tonight, you risk exposing us all.

295
00:30:36,654 --> 00:30:38,565
And that I won't let happen.

296
00:30:41,136 --> 00:30:44,039
- My power's greater than yours.
- Not until you ascend.

297
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,639
All right, go for it, tough guy.

298
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,478
- Stop it! This is crazy.
- It's for his own good!

299
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:02,062
Keep using like you did tonight
and last night...

300
00:31:02,232 --> 00:31:03,726
...you'll be as good as dead.

301
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:05,785
So I fixed her car. Big deal!

302
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:08,435
Don't play me, Reid!
I'm talking later and you know it.

303
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,643
The hell I do!

304
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,233
I didn't use later.

305
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,966
It's not right
using on each other, Caleb.

306
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:21,588
Tell it to Reid.

307
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,087
Reid's lying.
It had to have been him.

308
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:34,941
How do you know?

309
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:39,780
Because it wasn't you. Tyler doesn't
have the balls to lie to me.

310
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:42,943
- Hey.
- Hey.

311
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:46,180
- You okay?
- Yeah.

312
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,718
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's go.

313
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:55,080
Yeah, let's get out of here.

314
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:09,966
Thanks again for a great day.
I had fun.

315
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:12,752
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

316
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:15,405
Listen, I'm sorry about Gorman.

317
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,938
He's just not used
to seeing me with anyone.

318
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,336
I think I'll survive.

319
00:32:24,597 --> 00:32:29,388
Fact is, you're the only girl
I've ever taken out there.

320
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:32,819
- Really?
- Yeah.

321
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:38,166
- And why is that?
- I'm not sure just yet.

322
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:43,925
- Good night.
- Good night.

323
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:52,292
Kate, wake up! Kate, wake up!

324
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,157
Yeah.

325
00:35:26,328 --> 00:35:29,777
<i>I just saw the same darkling you saw
last night. That dead kid at the Dells.</i>

326
00:35:30,265 --> 00:35:31,410
What the hell is it?

327
00:35:31,578 --> 00:35:34,480
<i>I don't know.
It's starting to freak me out.</i>

328
00:35:35,419 --> 00:35:37,460
I'm telling you,
someone's using powers...

329
00:35:37,628 --> 00:35:39,319
...and I mean bigtime.

330
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:42,105
<i>And I intend to find out who.</i>

331
00:36:21,355 --> 00:36:23,560
- Hey.
- Hi.

332
00:36:32,048 --> 00:36:33,455
Good morning.

333
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,267
Mr. Danvers...

334
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:39,566
...Provost Higgins requests the
pleasure of your company after class.

335
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:45,166
We're going to study four American
contemporary writers of fiction.

336
00:36:47,445 --> 00:36:50,763
First is Cormac McCarthy,
then Tim O'Brien...

337
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:55,409
...Kent Haruf,
and last but not least...

338
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,145
<i>...Stephen King.
- Yeah! Dreamcatcher was the shit!</i>

339
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:08,537
<i>Thank you, Mr. Garwin, but no.
My choice is The Shining.</i>

340
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:14,903
This is not the kind of publicity
this institution is interested in.

341
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:17,979
You wouldn't know anything about it,
would you, Mr. Danvers?

342
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:19,323
No, sir.

343
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,392
But you would know about a fight
at a local bar last night.

344
00:37:23,715 --> 00:37:25,439
- Sir, if I could...
- And if I'm correct...

345
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,159
...Chase Collins was with you?

346
00:37:30,404 --> 00:37:32,096
Yes, sir.

347
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,653
Chase Collins comes to us
with a brilliant academic record...

348
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:43,079
...and his family trust has made
a generous endowment...

349
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:45,315
...to this institution.

350
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:48,299
I want to make sure he has
a positive experience at Spenser.

351
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:51,812
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

352
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:53,667
Good.

353
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,598
I understand you and Chase
have already bonded...

354
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:02,248
...and I would appreciate it
if you would continue...

355
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:06,248
...to take him under your wing, make
sure his stay here is a pleasant one.

356
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:10,255
- And, Caleb.
- Sir?

357
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:13,744
No more fights.

358
00:38:15,381 --> 00:38:16,810
Yes, sir.

359
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:41,905
What is that?

360
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:46,355
Caleb's family history.

361
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:49,331
Did you know that the witchcraft thing
started here in Ipswich?

362
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,133
Every time I ask Pogue about it,
he just tells me it's all nonsense.

363
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:19,934
So, what did the provost want?

364
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:25,278
Someone told him about
the fight at Nicky's.

365
00:40:27,013 --> 00:40:29,218
Feel like elaborating on that?

366
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,662
You got a piece of glass in your face.
Hold on.

367
00:40:45,132 --> 00:40:47,075
- Say my name!
- Grow up, dude.

368
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:53,134
What are you looking at, fag?

369
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:55,622
That thing between your legs.

370
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:59,055
It's like a penis, only smaller.

371
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:05,707
Hey, let him go, Aaron!

372
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:13,840
Don't be so sensitive, Aaron.

373
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:16,080
Size isn't everything.

374
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:19,058
My man.

375
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,518
Up for some foosball?

376
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:25,498
I have dinner with Sarah,
but I think I can hang out for a while.

377
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:29,621
- What about you?
- No, man. I'm cool.

378
00:41:45,698 --> 00:41:47,673
You're being ridiculous!
What is your problem?

379
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:49,753
- Chase is my problem.
- What, are you jealous?

380
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,772
- I don't want you hanging around him.
- Look, he is just a friend.

381
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:56,162
Yeah, right. I'm sure he's interested
in just being friends.

382
00:41:56,326 --> 00:41:58,661
This is beyond idiotic.

383
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,969
Thanks for dinner.

384
00:42:13,613 --> 00:42:15,947
- How about Saturday?
- What about Saturday?

385
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,046
- It's the Fall Fest.
- Oh, Fall Fest.

386
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,346
Just wondering if
you wanted to go with me.

387
00:42:23,471 --> 00:42:26,637
And, also,
it happens to be my birthday.

388
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:30,506
I don't know.

389
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,642
I'd love to go with you.

390
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,432
- I should go.
- Yeah. Yeah, you should.

391
00:42:51,962 --> 00:42:56,786
- No. I mean, back to the dorms.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

392
00:43:02,686 --> 00:43:04,542
I'm really gonna go.

393
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:07,606
This is me leaving.

394
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,656
- Good night.
- Good night.

395
00:43:16,738 --> 00:43:17,917
Sleep tight.

396
00:43:30,376 --> 00:43:31,784
<i>I hate him when he's like this.</i>

397
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,852
He's been jealous since the day
we met. It drives me crazy.

398
00:43:35,018 --> 00:43:38,118
You don't hate Pogue.
You guys are perfect for each other.

399
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:41,061
Maybe not.

400
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:43,018
Maybe it's time
to check out something new.

401
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:46,981
And maybe that's what
Pogue's picking up on.

402
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:55,020
- This is the eighth time he's called.
- So talk to him.

403
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:58,061
No. Not until he stops
being an idiot.

404
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,216
I'll bet Caleb's not the jealous type.

405
00:44:51,045 --> 00:44:52,256
Go for it!

406
00:44:53,478 --> 00:44:54,689
Come on, man!

407
00:45:07,212 --> 00:45:08,903
Come on, Pogue!

408
00:45:14,575 --> 00:45:16,811
- He really is good.
- He's the best.

409
00:45:19,407 --> 00:45:20,837
I hear you swim a mean freestyle.

410
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:25,263
- That's what they tell me.
- Let's see what you got.

411
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:33,961
Let's go!

412
00:45:37,815 --> 00:45:38,895
Push off! Let's go!

413
00:46:12,259 --> 00:46:13,339
You okay, man?

414
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:17,562
There you are.
Had us going there for a second.

415
00:46:21,255 --> 00:46:22,629
Whacked your head pretty good.

416
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:25,504
Lucky for you, Chase was there
to get you out...

417
00:46:25,672 --> 00:46:27,495
...before you sucked up the pool.

418
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:29,992
<i>He also whipped your ass.</i>

419
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,033
It became apparent
that the view of civil liberties...

420
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,294
...needing no special protection
was not widely shared.

421
00:46:37,644 --> 00:46:40,776
Come in. Thank you.

422
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:43,430
Twelve amendments were suggested,
10 eventually ratified.

423
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:45,736
Called the what, Ms. Snider?

424
00:46:46,576 --> 00:46:49,195
- The Bill of Rights.
- Right you are.

425
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:54,893
Arguably, the first being the most
important. Read it for us, Mr. Simms.

426
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:01,615
Mr. Collins, you're wanted
in the provost's office.

427
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:08,428
Mr. Simms.

428
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,876
"Congress shall make no law...

429
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,081
...respecting an establishment
of religion...

430
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,322
...or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof...

431
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:18,101
...or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press...

432
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,789
...or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble..."

433
00:47:23,485 --> 00:47:26,802
- Provost Higgins. You wanted to...?
- Chase, come in.

434
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:35,702
You know one of our students
lost his life...

435
00:47:35,873 --> 00:47:37,466
...a few nights back at the Dells.

436
00:47:38,657 --> 00:47:39,837
Yes, I heard.

437
00:47:41,764 --> 00:47:45,343
- Did you know him?
- No, sir. Why?

438
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,990
His car was returned to his parents.

439
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:52,419
His mother was kind enough
to send this back to us.

440
00:47:56,841 --> 00:48:01,349
- My student ID. I lost it that night.
- It was in the back seat.

441
00:48:02,732 --> 00:48:05,067
That's odd. I wonder how he got it.

442
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:08,171
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

443
00:48:09,198 --> 00:48:12,167
I understand you've become close
with Caleb and his friends.

444
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:14,343
Yeah. They're great guys, sir.

445
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:17,354
I agree. You couldn't have
picked a better bunch.

446
00:48:19,185 --> 00:48:21,007
I think so too.

447
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:28,748
<i>- Am I gonna see you tonight?
- I hope so.</i>

448
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:32,082
Listen, I have something to do first.
I'll give you a call later, okay?

449
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:34,636
- I'll be in my room.
- Okay.

450
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,781
What'd she say about Kate?
Why won't she call me back?

451
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:39,733
She's still pissed at you.

452
00:48:40,056 --> 00:48:42,479
- Why are we doing this?
- I saw the darkling again.

453
00:48:42,649 --> 00:48:44,625
Yeah, but why break into
the admissions office?

454
00:48:44,795 --> 00:48:47,513
Because I wanna know more
about Chase Collins.

455
00:48:49,181 --> 00:48:53,339
Look, I don't even like the guy.

456
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:55,357
Are you sure you're not
just imagining this?

457
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,519
I'm telling you, his eyes were
as black as night in the pool today.

458
00:48:58,944 --> 00:49:00,407
All right.

459
00:49:32,908 --> 00:49:34,469
Well, how sick is she?

460
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:37,126
She came in complaining
of chills and a headache.

461
00:49:37,294 --> 00:49:40,164
<i>Within an hour, she had
a 101-degree temperature.</i>

462
00:49:40,335 --> 00:49:43,435
- What could it be?
- The doctor's checking her now.

463
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,179
<i>- We'll call you when we know more.
- It's okay. I'm coming over there.</i>

464
00:49:59,574 --> 00:50:01,068
They died in a car accident.

465
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:04,110
It says Chase's father
just lost control.

466
00:50:07,096 --> 00:50:08,438
His real name was Pope.

467
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:12,792
Chase Goodwin Pope.
Born July 14th, 1988.

468
00:50:12,954 --> 00:50:15,191
The Collins adopted him
after his mother died...

469
00:50:15,355 --> 00:50:17,527
...when he was 2 years old.

470
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,455
- When did you say his birthday was?
- July 14th.

471
00:50:25,247 --> 00:50:27,451
That's the same day
his adoptive parents died.

472
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:31,672
- What year was he born?
- 1988.

473
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:37,562
They died on his 18th birthday.

474
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:36,879
Why are you taking her to the hospital
at Gloucester?

475
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,025
Her temperature's jumped to 105...

476
00:51:39,194 --> 00:51:41,878
...and she's showing symptoms
of anaphylactic shock.

477
00:51:42,043 --> 00:51:46,452
- What does that mean?
- It's a severe allergic reaction.

478
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:49,687
- To what?
- We're not sure.

479
00:51:50,238 --> 00:51:52,628
It's as if she'd been bitten
by hundreds of insects.

480
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,517
Like spiders.

481
00:52:07,587 --> 00:52:10,240
Goodwin Pope. Goodwin Pope.

482
00:52:10,406 --> 00:52:12,195
Goodwin, Goodwin. Goodwin Pope.

483
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:13,885
Agnes Goodwin Pope.

484
00:52:14,055 --> 00:52:16,772
- That's where I've heard it before.
- What are you talking about?

485
00:52:16,936 --> 00:52:19,304
<i>The Book of Damnation.
They used to call her Goody Pope.</i>

486
00:52:19,466 --> 00:52:20,545
Do you remember her?

487
00:52:20,714 --> 00:52:23,616
I haven't read the Book
since we were kids.

488
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:26,500
Just call Reid and Tyler.

489
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,333
I told them everything.

490
00:53:00,504 --> 00:53:03,407
About the darkling,
what we found in his file...

491
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:27,772
It's a list of names...

492
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:30,492
...who brought charges against
John Putnam and his family...

493
00:53:30,658 --> 00:53:33,376
...during the Salem hunt.
Pope was one of them.

494
00:53:33,764 --> 00:53:35,520
Goody Pope.

495
00:53:36,644 --> 00:53:38,337
Widow of Jacob, mother to Hagen.

496
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:39,811
So what?

497
00:53:39,974 --> 00:53:44,351
So she claims that John Putnam came
to her as an incubus in her dreams...

498
00:53:45,352 --> 00:53:47,327
...after she was widowed.

499
00:53:47,496 --> 00:53:50,847
The Book also records births
and deaths during the damnation.

500
00:53:51,305 --> 00:53:56,042
Goody Pope's husband, Jacob,
died June fourth, 1692.

501
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,870
Her son, Hagen,
was born April 11th, 1693.

502
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,253
That's 10 months and 24 days later.

503
00:54:13,362 --> 00:54:14,737
If what you're saying is true...

504
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:17,834
...and Hagen Pope is the bastard son
of John Putnam...

505
00:54:18,003 --> 00:54:21,233
...then the fifth bloodline
in the Covenant didn't end in Salem.

506
00:54:24,373 --> 00:54:27,888
- And Chase is one of us.
- That's crazy.

507
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:29,973
He can't be.

508
00:54:30,136 --> 00:54:32,341
The night after the party
at the Dells...

509
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:34,480
...someone was using.

510
00:54:34,777 --> 00:54:36,687
The Power was strong enough
to wake me.

511
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:38,582
The next night, it happened again.

512
00:54:38,748 --> 00:54:40,504
- I felt it then.
- See? I told you.

513
00:54:40,668 --> 00:54:41,846
I felt it too.

514
00:54:42,749 --> 00:54:45,303
When you said it wasn't you,
were you lying?

515
00:54:46,046 --> 00:54:47,737
No.

516
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:52,061
- You swear?
- I swear.

517
00:54:57,762 --> 00:54:59,072
Then it was him.

518
00:55:06,757 --> 00:55:10,304
<i>- Hey, could I call you...?
- Caleb, Kate's been attacked.</i>

519
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,583
Wait, wait. What?

520
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,436
They say it's like
she's been bitten by spiders...

521
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:17,669
...and I had this terrible nightmare
about spiders.

522
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:22,090
I'm scared, Caleb.
Something weird is happening.

523
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:24,772
Okay, listen.
I want you to go back to your dorm...

524
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,763
...and wait for me there.

525
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:29,675
- I'll see you soon, okay?
- Okay.

526
00:55:35,569 --> 00:55:37,838
He's put a spell on Kate.

527
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:40,104
What are you talking about?
What kind of spell?

528
00:55:40,466 --> 00:55:41,808
Creation.

529
00:55:43,348 --> 00:55:44,777
Spiders.

530
00:55:44,947 --> 00:55:47,217
They're taking her to a hospital
in Gloucester.

531
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,684
Don't do anything
until we know what he wants.

532
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:50,991
We're talking about Kate!

533
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:26,779
Come to save Little Miss Muffet,
have we?

534
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:29,666
Well, you're too late.

535
00:56:31,524 --> 00:56:33,184
A spider came
and sat down beside her...

536
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:35,107
...and frightened Miss Muffet away.

537
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,621
You hurt Kate, and I'll kill you.

538
00:57:04,112 --> 00:57:05,804
Hurt her?

539
00:57:06,897 --> 00:57:08,458
I only used her to get to you.

540
00:57:10,066 --> 00:57:13,450
It's you that I'm gonna hurt.

541
00:57:16,276 --> 00:57:19,093
And you're just my bait
to get to Caleb.

542
00:57:28,217 --> 00:57:30,290
These are her things.

543
00:57:31,387 --> 00:57:33,973
Why don't you go back to the dorm
and get some sleep?

544
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,108
If I hear anything, I'll call you.

545
00:58:29,903 --> 00:58:31,431
Hey.

546
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:37,357
What's wrong?

547
00:58:40,371 --> 00:58:41,964
Have you seen Pogue?

548
00:58:42,132 --> 00:58:45,396
No, but I called him
and told him about Kate.

549
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,554
Well, how is she?

550
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,583
Not so good. But they said they'd call
if there are any changes.

551
00:59:03,452 --> 00:59:05,362
Maybe this is him.

552
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:09,048
Pogue's been in an accident.

553
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:21,209
Stop right there.

554
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:25,377
Close the door.

555
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:38,047
Let's just keep this between
the Sons of Ipswich.

556
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:46,057
Don't hurt her.
She has nothing to do with this.

557
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,635
Whether she lives or dies
is entirely up to you, my friend.

558
00:59:54,062 --> 00:59:57,926
You can't imagine what it was like
growing up not knowing what this was.

559
01:00:01,137 --> 01:00:06,191
When I finally found my real father,
he filled in all the missing pieces.

560
01:00:09,587 --> 01:00:13,134
But it was too late. I was hooked.

561
01:00:14,517 --> 01:00:17,933
By then, he was
such a bitter old man...

562
01:00:18,102 --> 01:00:23,855
Or I should say,
bitter, old, young man.

563
01:00:24,312 --> 01:00:28,210
- that all he wanted to do
was end the suffering.

564
01:00:28,538 --> 01:00:30,032
Like all our bloodline before us...

565
01:00:30,204 --> 01:00:32,593
...he was more than willing
to break the laws...

566
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:36,596
...of your sacred little club.

567
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:43,254
So I got him to give me
his share of The Power.

568
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:55,257
And he died knowing that his son
was going to get revenge...

569
01:00:55,428 --> 01:00:56,890
...on your Covenant.

570
01:00:57,062 --> 01:00:59,648
You keep her in that spell,
and she'll die.

571
01:01:00,454 --> 01:01:01,949
I know.

572
01:01:02,856 --> 01:01:05,823
What is this all about?
I mean, what do you want?

573
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:08,768
Want?

574
01:01:18,253 --> 01:01:19,530
I'm Chase Collins.

575
01:01:21,966 --> 01:01:25,229
I have everything
I could possibly want.

576
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:31,789
It's what I need.

577
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:36,237
More power.

578
01:01:43,191 --> 01:01:45,712
Tomorrow night, birthday boy...

579
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:50,478
...at the exact moment
when you ascend...

580
01:01:52,794 --> 01:01:55,250
...be at Putnam Barn...

581
01:01:55,418 --> 01:01:58,070
...where you will
will me your power.

582
01:01:59,739 --> 01:02:03,897
Do that, and I'll let her live.

583
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:11,189
And Pogue, Kate, Reid and Tyler
and your mom...

584
01:02:11,872 --> 01:02:14,458
...and what's left of the families.

585
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:19,032
And don't think I won't kill them.

586
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,617
It comes natural to me.

587
01:02:24,518 --> 01:02:28,828
Just ask my adoptive parents.

588
01:02:29,414 --> 01:02:31,555
You killed that kid at the Dells.

589
01:02:34,857 --> 01:02:37,508
Well, he caught me
doing a little magic.

590
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:43,298
At first, he wasn't sure,
but then, well...

591
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,738
...he just wouldn't leave it alone.

592
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:49,673
So I caught a ride with him
over to the bonfire.

593
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:57,000
What are you doing?

594
01:02:57,169 --> 01:02:59,057
Just making sure
I'm making my point.

595
01:03:27,996 --> 01:03:30,681
Do you see my problem here?

596
01:03:34,943 --> 01:03:38,555
I like to use. A lot.

597
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,434
Only...

598
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,377
...no one ever told me about...

599
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:49,791
...the effects and the damage.

600
01:03:49,956 --> 01:03:51,779
The addiction.

601
01:03:53,189 --> 01:03:55,492
And we both know
what happens, now, don't we?

602
01:03:56,614 --> 01:03:58,175
So...

603
01:03:59,912 --> 01:04:01,636
...the way I see it...

604
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:04,930
...I add your power
to what I already have.

605
01:04:05,193 --> 01:04:07,049
It won't stop the aging.

606
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:10,953
Your father obviously found out
the hard way.

607
01:04:13,581 --> 01:04:15,851
My father never had
this kind of power.

608
01:04:16,014 --> 01:04:18,284
It doesn't work like that.

609
01:04:18,447 --> 01:04:21,350
It's the body that wears down,
not the power.

610
01:04:25,233 --> 01:04:29,163
Just think of yourself
as a sacrificial lamb.

611
01:04:32,691 --> 01:04:34,285
Hell...

612
01:04:35,348 --> 01:04:38,032
...you're already their golden boy.

613
01:04:38,934 --> 01:04:41,618
Why not go out a real hero?

614
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:46,578
So tomorrow night, the barn.

615
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:48,719
Where it all started.

616
01:04:49,818 --> 01:04:53,201
A birthday party. Just you and me.

617
01:04:54,076 --> 01:04:56,181
It's either you...

618
01:04:57,181 --> 01:04:58,872
...or them...

619
01:05:01,854 --> 01:05:03,512
...brother.

620
01:05:13,379 --> 01:05:17,308
Don't leave her like that. She'll die.

621
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:40,742
What happened?

622
01:05:43,501 --> 01:05:46,536
- You passed out when I told you...
- What?

623
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,663
- Pogue's been in an accident.
- Is he okay?

624
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,268
Hey, hey, take it easy.

625
01:06:17,497 --> 01:06:20,979
- What?
- Stay away.

626
01:06:21,146 --> 01:06:23,700
He's more powerful...

627
01:06:24,283 --> 01:06:25,877
...than you can imagine.

628
01:06:26,781 --> 01:06:29,270
Hey, don't worry.
Don't worry about that.

629
01:06:30,014 --> 01:06:32,121
We can't stop him.

630
01:06:42,051 --> 01:06:44,223
- How is he?
- He's hurt pretty bad.

631
01:06:44,387 --> 01:06:46,493
- Where's Sarah?
- Waiting room.

632
01:06:46,662 --> 01:06:50,045
I say we all go after Chase.
Right now.

633
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,481
Listen, it may not be that easy.

634
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,754
You guys stay here with Pogue.
Call me if there's a change.

635
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:09,035
How's Pogue?

636
01:07:11,884 --> 01:07:13,226
He's not good.

637
01:07:14,766 --> 01:07:16,655
What about Kate?
Have you heard anything?

638
01:07:16,815 --> 01:07:20,045
They stabilized her,
but she's still really sick.

639
01:07:30,901 --> 01:07:35,790
Caleb, look me in the eye
and tell me the truth.

640
01:07:37,143 --> 01:07:38,671
The spiders.

641
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:42,769
I read about them. They're one
of the charges against John Putnam.

642
01:07:45,114 --> 01:07:49,556
They're some kind of spell,
aren't they?

643
01:07:57,277 --> 01:07:59,450
I wanna show you something...

644
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:02,616
...and then I'll explain everything.

645
01:08:26,664 --> 01:08:27,810
Don't be afraid.

646
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:57,710
What about your caretaker?

647
01:09:01,173 --> 01:09:02,995
It'll be okay.

648
01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:39,768
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

649
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:43,554
- Caleb...
- This is important to me, Gorman.

650
01:10:03,756 --> 01:10:05,218
It's okay.

651
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:25,485
This is William Danvers III,
my father.

652
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:31,436
He's 44 years old.

653
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:52,407
Every generation,
the bloodlines produce only one:

654
01:10:52,574 --> 01:10:54,549
The eldest male.

655
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,534
And you've always had this power?

656
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:01,210
At 13, you get a taste of it.
It's a test, in a way.

657
01:11:01,954 --> 01:11:06,145
At 18, we ascend,
and our powers fully mature...

658
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:08,675
...and it's seductive.

659
01:11:09,925 --> 01:11:14,596
And some can handle it,
and others, like my father, couldn't.

660
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:22,499
Tonight, at 12 minutes past 11,
I'll ascend.

661
01:11:23,464 --> 01:11:25,833
And what if you don't
will him your share?

662
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:28,450
He's already got his father's.
It makes him very powerful.

663
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,375
And what if someone wills you
their share?

664
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:33,409
It's against the Covenant laws.
If it weren't, I wouldn't let them.

665
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,556
- Why not?
- When one ascends...

666
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:38,247
...The Power becomes your life.

667
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:40,747
That's why it ages you.

668
01:11:41,488 --> 01:11:44,620
Will it away, and you die.

669
01:11:51,954 --> 01:11:54,542
Caleb, you cannot do this alone.
We have to go to the others.

670
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:57,874
We can't do that.
He'll kill us all, including you.

671
01:11:58,357 --> 01:11:59,733
Pogue was the final warning.

672
01:11:59,894 --> 01:12:01,488
- We have to go to your father.
- No.

673
01:12:02,071 --> 01:12:05,333
I know what you're thinking, Mother,
and you know what'll happen.

674
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:08,087
But he loves you.

675
01:12:10,778 --> 01:12:13,331
Well, then, he'll die with that secret.

676
01:12:19,677 --> 01:12:22,461
- Where's Sarah?
- Upstairs, changing.

677
01:12:22,623 --> 01:12:25,820
- You should never have involved her.
- You're right.

678
01:12:27,008 --> 01:12:29,180
But I can't change the past...

679
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,517
...and he's using her against me,
all of you...

680
01:12:32,387 --> 01:12:34,394
...and it's going to stop.

681
01:12:39,845 --> 01:12:41,667
I want you to take Sarah
to the dance.

682
01:12:42,182 --> 01:12:44,998
I'll meet you there. I don't think
he'll try anything in the open.

683
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,259
Would you just let us help you?
You know we've got your back.

684
01:12:48,424 --> 01:12:50,148
I know you do.

685
01:12:50,953 --> 01:12:54,849
But please, just once, do what I ask.

686
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:10,533
You look beautiful, my dear.

687
01:13:15,346 --> 01:13:17,867
- Ready?
- Yeah.

688
01:13:25,365 --> 01:13:26,740
<i>Why can't I go with you?</i>

689
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:30,286
- I won't risk you.
- I'm scared.

690
01:13:31,512 --> 01:13:33,106
Don't be.

691
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:37,561
- I'll see you soon.
- You better.

692
01:13:42,941 --> 01:13:44,763
I promise.

693
01:14:07,428 --> 01:14:10,877
Be careful. I'll call you.

694
01:14:48,468 --> 01:14:51,054
- Hey, any sign of him?
- No.

695
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:54,036
<i>Good. Listen, I'm on my way.
If he does show...</i>

696
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,304
...please promise me you won't
do anything stupid.

697
01:14:57,814 --> 01:15:00,849
<i>- How's Sarah doing? Can I talk to her?
- Yeah, she's fine. Hang on.</i>

698
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:06,771
- She was just here.
- Guys, what's going on?

699
01:15:12,861 --> 01:15:14,290
Caleb? Caleb?

700
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,989
What's your plan?
You can't beat me, you know.

701
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:31,804
Something's happened.

702
01:16:19,477 --> 01:16:21,104
You know...

703
01:16:21,525 --> 01:16:23,184
...I'm just getting the feeling that...

704
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,772
...you're not gonna keep up
your end of the bargain...

705
01:16:25,943 --> 01:16:28,464
...so I took out
a little insurance policy.

706
01:16:34,297 --> 01:16:36,337
She does look quite stunning.

707
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:40,241
You touch her, and she dies.

708
01:16:41,468 --> 01:16:43,891
In fact, time's running out for Sarah.

709
01:16:44,285 --> 01:16:45,879
So why don't we
get down to business?

710
01:16:58,915 --> 01:17:00,094
Witchy.

711
01:17:01,892 --> 01:17:03,802
Oops, wait.

712
01:17:03,973 --> 01:17:06,559
Did I just say, "witch"?

713
01:17:07,463 --> 01:17:11,774
All right. Tell you what.
I'll make this easy for you.

714
01:17:12,776 --> 01:17:14,817
How about an accident?

715
01:17:15,593 --> 01:17:20,067
You lose control of your car
on the way to the pathetic little dance.

716
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:23,652
Trust me. I'm good at car accidents.

717
01:17:23,821 --> 01:17:25,730
Everyone'll miss you.

718
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,268
They'll say great things about you.

719
01:17:29,294 --> 01:17:31,367
Only the Covenant
will know the real truth.

720
01:17:31,535 --> 01:17:36,140
But, to them,
you'll become a legend.

721
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:42,826
The one who gave his life for them.

722
01:17:43,379 --> 01:17:46,730
How about you let her go,
and I let you live out your life?

723
01:17:48,117 --> 01:17:51,632
How about I make you
my "weyotch"?

724
01:17:52,087 --> 01:17:53,363
I'll never will you my power.

725
01:17:54,968 --> 01:17:56,756
Then it looks like trouble for Sarah.

726
01:17:57,752 --> 01:17:59,247
I'll never let that happen.

727
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:01,687
Fine. Let's do it your way.

728
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:21,178
Like taking candy from a baby.

729
01:19:06,193 --> 01:19:07,720
Easy as pie.

730
01:19:19,478 --> 01:19:21,071
- You find her?
- No.

731
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,281
Twelve minutes past 11.

732
01:19:27,865 --> 01:19:29,327
Happy birthday, Caleb.

733
01:19:40,606 --> 01:19:42,549
Are we ascending?

734
01:19:44,191 --> 01:19:45,718
Finally!

735
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:54,555
Scary, huh, Caleb...

736
01:19:55,844 --> 01:19:58,877
...this new power you get
when you ascend?

737
01:20:00,036 --> 01:20:03,421
Frankly, I don't think
you're cut out for it.

738
01:20:05,511 --> 01:20:07,104
So why don't we just call it a night?

739
01:20:08,648 --> 01:20:10,144
Just say the words.

740
01:20:33,138 --> 01:20:36,652
Okay, I'm a little impressed.

741
01:20:36,819 --> 01:20:38,990
- Not bad.
- Thanks.

742
01:20:51,352 --> 01:20:53,239
Trying to impress your date, huh?

743
01:22:21,976 --> 01:22:23,570
You ready to say uncle?

744
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:25,781
I'm ready for you to go to hell.

745
01:23:11,723 --> 01:23:13,578
Leave us, Gorman.

746
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:22,728
Just say the words.

747
01:23:25,551 --> 01:23:28,848
Say the words, and it's all over.

748
01:23:30,289 --> 01:23:31,598
<i>Listen to me, William.</i>

749
01:23:32,242 --> 01:23:36,019
I need you to understand me.

750
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:46,220
Come on! Say it! Say the words!

751
01:23:47,415 --> 01:23:49,173
"I..."

752
01:23:49,977 --> 01:23:52,695
- I...
- "...will you..."

753
01:23:53,402 --> 01:23:55,508
...will you...

754
01:23:58,013 --> 01:23:59,507
...nothing.

755
01:24:02,077 --> 01:24:03,987
<i>He is your son.</i>

756
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:08,958
For once in your life,
think of someone other than yourself.

757
01:24:15,105 --> 01:24:16,536
I...

758
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:18,908
...will...

759
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:21,850
<i>...you...</i>

760
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:26,171
<i>...my power.</i>

761
01:27:23,046 --> 01:27:25,414
We searched the entire area.
We didn't find anybody.

762
01:27:29,768 --> 01:27:31,143
How can that be?

763
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:50,989
Where is he?

764
01:27:53,425 --> 01:27:55,051
I don't know.
