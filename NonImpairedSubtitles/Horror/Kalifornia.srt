1
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:57,820
Thanks.

2
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:23,419
Is it okay if I smoke?

3
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:24,851
Sure.

4
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:29,157
My matches are all wet.

5
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:32,627
- You got a lighter?
- Yeah, it's here somewhere.

6
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,425
It's my wife's car.

7
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,101
There we are.

8
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:20,978
I remember once...

9
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:24,981
...going on a school trip to the
top of the Empire State Building.

10
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:28,379
When I looked down
at the people on the street...

11
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:30,579
...they looked like ants.

12
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,851
I pulled out a penny and some of us
talked about what would happen...

13
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:38,724
...if I dropped it from up there
and it landed on somebody's head.

14
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:43,835
Of course, I never crossed that line
and actually dropped the penny.

15
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:48,640
I don't think Early Grayce even knew
there was a line to cross.

16
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:52,409
It's about the mind of a serial killer
and culpability.

17
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:56,104
Whoever can't distinguish
right from wrong is like a child.

18
00:03:56,316 --> 00:04:00,753
By law, he should be treated like a
child. Not imprisoned or executed.

19
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:02,285
There you go again.

20
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,323
Next you'll lay it all
at the altar of misfiring synapses...

21
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,324
...amok biochemicals
and horrendous childhoods.

22
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:13,727
It's true. Most of these poor people
suffer from chemical brain imbalances.

23
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,492
- Is that enough tequila?
- No.

24
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:19,536
The answer is research and treatment
under hospital conditions.

25
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,036
Not the electric chair.

26
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:25,371
Great, Brian. Unless it's your
mother they find in the refrigerator.

27
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,742
But executing the killer
wouldn't bring my mother back.

28
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:31,315
- Thank God.
- Oh, everybody's a joker.

29
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:33,577
It would sure make you feel better.

30
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:36,381
No, actually, it wouldn't.

31
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,788
The bottom line is, these people
are evil, plain and simple.

32
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:03,038
How about a bowl of chili? A hot one.

33
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,746
Be right there!

34
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,853
"Antichrist will be a woman...

35
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:12,820
...in a man's body...

36
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:16,325
...with seven heads and seven tails."

37
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,588
Make that to go.

38
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,358
"The Antichrist...

39
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,432
...will be a woman...

40
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,628
...in a man's body.

41
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,208
Seven heads and seven tails."

42
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:35,414
"Antichrist will be a woman...

43
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:38,911
...in a man's body.

44
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:43,781
Seven heads and seven tails."

45
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,254
I always knew I'd be a writer.

46
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:55,298
But there's a difference between
an article and a book.

47
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,870
I know. I wrote an article.

48
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:05,807
Everything I wanted to know about
serial killers fit on four pages.

49
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:10,543
Brian, what are we doing here?

50
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,012
Research.

51
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:15,517
Come on, look at this.
You'll get some great photos in here.

52
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:22,152
This is where her nightmares began.

53
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:25,654
Her father worked
the night shift here.

54
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:27,992
Most nights he'd take her with him.

55
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,932
She was 1 1 years old.

56
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:41,641
Of course, the bastard knew...

57
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:45,978
...nobody could hear her screams
over the noise of the machines.

58
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:53,386
The article got me a book deal,
a little cash up front.

59
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:57,723
But between the rent and the
convertible, the advance was gone.

60
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:00,456
I owed a book, and I was stuck.

61
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:05,036
All I knew about serial killers
I learned at a university library.

62
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:07,433
And the only thing
I knew for certain...

63
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,871
...was that people didn't
kill each other in libraries.

64
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,007
She murdered her first victim here.

65
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,546
They found him stuffed in the corner.

66
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,715
They found her second victim...

67
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:24,612
...over there.

68
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:30,520
Can you imagine the rage and pain
she felt returning here?

69
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,863
The victim returns
to the scene of the crime.

70
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:39,830
And becomes the criminal.

71
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:44,867
Where did everybody go?

72
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,777
I didn't take that long.

73
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:13,432
Size seven.

74
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:17,903
That's right, ain't it?
Super size seven.

75
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:21,569
Oh, Early, you're a specialist.

76
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,008
Happy birthday, Adele.

77
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,311
Oh, thank you, honey.
These are beautiful.

78
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:35,153
This reminds me of Cinderella when
the prince gave her his glass slipper.

79
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:39,229
Except these ones are red
and they ain't see-through.

80
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,923
And there's two of them.
That my chili?

81
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,962
Oh, honey.

82
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,766
Happy birthday to me. Thank you.

83
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:57,446
Tonight turned out to be interesting.

84
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,246
Oh, those fascinating friends of yours
and their stimulating conversation.

85
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,649
No, the warehouse.
I'm not that stoned.

86
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:09,022
Oh, the warehouse.
Actually, yeah, it was interesting.

87
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:12,198
It was definitely the highlight
of the evening.

88
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:18,495
Just being there
where it all happened...

89
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,002
...I could almost...

90
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,001
Take your shirt off.

91
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,207
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:34,650
Come here.

93
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,029
Early!

94
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,232
What?

95
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:59,710
I'll be waiting for you
when you get back.

96
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,477
Put your titty back up.

97
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,545
Wait, I forgot!
Mr. Diebold stopped by yesterday.

98
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:11,749
If we don't give him his money
by the end of the month...

99
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,018
...he'll kick us the F-U-C-K
out of here.

100
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:16,718
He cussed at you?

101
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,928
- You gonna talk to him?
- Well...

102
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,725
Shut up!

103
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:25,465
He comes back here,
don't you open that door.

104
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:31,906
Well, suppose he hears me inside?

105
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,011
I picked up some Chinese.

106
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:43,779
Did you hear from the gallery?

107
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,485
You got your slides back?

108
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:51,491
What did they say?

109
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:55,290
You know, same story, different day.

110
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:58,126
They're idiots.

111
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:00,572
"Too graphic."

112
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,735
"Too overt."

113
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:06,239
"Not suitable for mass consumption."
I forget which.

114
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:09,506
You don't want to be
suitable for mass consumption.

115
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:11,047
I know.

116
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:15,777
It's just...

117
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,549
Who cares anyway, right?

118
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,317
Not me.

119
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:26,163
Christ, I'm dying here.

120
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:30,268
Why can't we just
get the hell out of here?

121
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,371
Why can't we just go to California?
Why not?

122
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:35,467
Just like that?

123
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,143
Yeah, just like that.

124
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:40,540
Yeah.

125
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:49,415
What the hell did I know
about California?

126
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:53,422
For some people, it was still a place
of hopes and dreams.

127
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,924
A chance to start over.

128
00:11:56,362 --> 00:12:00,196
The idea was if you could just get
there, everything would be okay.

129
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,493
And if it wasn't okay there...

130
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:05,694
...then it probably wasn't
gonna be okay anywhere.

131
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,417
Adele, whose car is that out front?

132
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,554
She's not here.

133
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,586
Shit.

134
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,049
Well, look who stopped by.

135
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,026
I ain't supposed to be at the parole
office till tomorrow, 2:00.

136
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:35,829
You're supposed to notify me
when you lose your job.

137
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:37,366
Yeah.

138
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:41,440
I stopped by the mirror factory today.

139
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,203
You left quite a mess behind.

140
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,609
Well, that wasn't my fault.

141
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:54,082
It's a dangerous area
and they treat me like shit.

142
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:58,919
Nobody ever has treated you right,
have they?

143
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:03,458
Your daddy was picking on you
when he threw you out of the house...

144
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:07,099
...for stealing the tires
off his truck.

145
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,892
The police. Way out of line...

146
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,433
...when they kept you from beating
that bartender half to death.

147
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:17,275
You know...

148
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:20,935
...I bet the Lord will be
picking on you come Judgment Day.

149
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:24,605
Now hold on there!
I ain't got nothing against God, see?

150
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,285
It's just people he let...
Get out of there!

151
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:29,982
What are you looking for?

152
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,987
That girlfriend of yours...

153
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:38,653
...not much for housekeeping, is she?

154
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:42,299
Well, I was thinking
about moving anyhows.

155
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:44,060
Maybe down to Texas.

156
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:48,563
- Get a job on one of them rigs.
- What are you talking about?

157
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:50,264
Well...

158
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,402
You know you can't leave the state.

159
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:54,875
Just a thought.

160
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,948
What you can do is get a job.

161
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:01,411
You be at this address...

162
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:03,111
...3:00 sharp.

163
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,615
What is it?

164
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:09,919
Janitor's job.

165
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:15,293
Well, don't want to be no janitor.

166
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:19,802
I don't give two shits what you want
and what you don't want.

167
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:21,940
I'm telling you to be there.

168
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,568
Or you'll be having dinner
with the sheriff.

169
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:30,141
You understand me, boy?

170
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:33,910
You ought to try putting a bag
over your head for that cough.

171
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:36,287
Works every time.

172
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,824
You peg-armed piece of shit.

173
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:50,231
She came back to the warehouse
that her father molested her in.

174
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,001
Why?

175
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,332
Because this place is the catalyst.

176
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:59,778
She needed to relive her nightmares
before she could kill those men.

177
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,539
The victim...

178
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,715
Oh, hey, sleeping beauty.

179
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:07,577
- I didn't have the heart to wake you.
- Thanks.

180
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,414
Oh, my head.

181
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:11,956
What are you doing?

182
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:14,786
I sat down with your photos...
which are wonderful.

183
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:15,983
Thank you.

184
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:18,220
...and my tapes and I started writing.

185
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,489
How's it going?

186
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,964
It's the best stuff I've ever done.
And I think I know why.

187
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:24,693
Why?

188
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:29,364
Because for the first time
I understood her as a human being.

189
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,339
I was walking where she walked,
where she killed.

190
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,979
I was in her skin.
Looking through her eyes.

191
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:36,671
I think we got a book here.

192
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:40,181
With your pictures and my writing,
it's a book.

193
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:42,210
On the warehouse murders?

194
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:45,413
No, on the most infamous murders
in American history.

195
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,458
We'll go where they lived
and where they killed.

196
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,925
You take the pictures,
I'll write the text.

197
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,826
- What are you talking about?
- About this!

198
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:58,969
We can go through Tennessee.

199
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,731
We can drop through Arkansas...

200
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,637
...wherever the hell Arkansas is.
There it is.

201
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:07,108
Then we can drop down into Texas...

202
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:09,941
...and from there,
it's a straight shot into...

203
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:11,707
- California!
- California.

204
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,750
And we don't stop
till we hit the fucking ocean.

205
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:16,147
Thank you.

206
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:18,823
We don't have the money
but we'll figure it out.

207
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:21,118
We'll figure it out.

208
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:39,802
Hold it a minute, boy!

209
00:16:40,012 --> 00:16:41,445
Shit!

210
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:44,241
You'll settle that rent here and now!

211
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,831
I'm tired of your bullshit!
I want my money!

212
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,149
Dipshit.

213
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,117
Son of a bitch! Come back!

214
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:36,031
You tell him I want you both
out of here by Sunday...

215
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:38,203
...or I'll call the police.

216
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:42,269
Elvis, get the fuck off of him!

217
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:49,840
The rideshare was my idea.

218
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:53,450
I thought if a student
wanted to go to California...

219
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:55,779
...they'd help pay for the gas.

220
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:58,581
Carrie wasn't crazy about the idea...

221
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,783
...but the Lincoln only got
eight miles a gallon.

222
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:17,400
- They say the whole thing...
- Will slide into the ocean. I heard.

223
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,346
"Looking for somebody to take turns
driving and share expenses...

224
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:26,177
...on a week-long, cross-country tour
of historic murder sites"?

225
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:28,817
You've got to be kidding.

226
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,854
Brian, who in their right mind
would want to do that?

227
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:34,287
- I would.
- Like I said...

228
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:37,291
Hey, good luck on that thesis.

229
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:42,129
Don't know where
the personal office is at, do you?

230
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:45,929
The personnel office
is first door on the left.

231
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:47,435
What, down there?

232
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,365
Stinking bitch.

233
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:52,075
Shit.

234
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,077
Early?

235
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,761
How you doing, mama?

236
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:14,296
Fine.

237
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,331
Boy, I'm tired.

238
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:19,527
- Dinner ready yet?
- Almost.

239
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:21,967
Well, let me know.

240
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:26,967
Early?

241
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,845
Yeah?

242
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:32,915
Will you tell me more
about California?

243
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:36,044
Yeah, I guess so.

244
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,179
Let's see.

245
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,054
For one thing...

246
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,161
...people think faster out there
on account of all that warm weather.

247
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:47,230
Cold weather makes people stupid.
That's a fact.

248
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:51,301
I guess that explains why there are
so many stupid people around here.

249
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:52,732
It sure does.

250
00:19:52,938 --> 00:19:54,405
- You know what else?
- What?

251
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:58,941
You never have to buy no fruit.
It's on the trees everywhere you turn.

252
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,009
And they ain't got speed limits.

253
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:05,741
I hear your first month's rent
is free. State law.

254
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:09,853
I'm thinking till we get settled,
we'll move from month to month.

255
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:11,920
How would that be with you, mama?

256
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,627
What will we do out there?

257
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:20,827
By God, the first thing we'll do
is get a six-pack of Lucky Lager...

258
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:24,025
...and we'll climb up to that
famous Hollywood sign...

259
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:26,067
...and we'll howl at the moon.

260
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,835
Yeah. Just like that.

261
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,770
I heard there ain't nothing
on that moon...

262
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,576
...except some little golf balls
that the astronauts left behind.

263
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,514
No, that ain't right.

264
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,381
That's bullshit.

265
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:48,049
The government's sending people there.
Just don't want us to know.

266
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:50,194
Now, get!

267
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:53,859
Well, let me know
when you're finished.

268
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,497
Shit.

269
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:28,464
- What was he like over the phone?
- He was real polite.

270
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,560
He kept calling me "sir."

271
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:34,064
- I like that.
- I bet you do.

272
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:36,298
You should try it once in a while.

273
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,703
I don't know. This is really weird.

274
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:40,572
We should have met them first.

275
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:45,443
Beggars can't be choosers. They were
the only ones to answer the note.

276
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:49,747
Oh, God. Please don't let them
be as boring as Brian's friends.

277
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:51,946
Anything but that.

278
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,324
Early, we shouldn't be doing this.

279
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:07,494
Now, you know you ain't even allowed
to be leaving the state.

280
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:09,874
And these people are strangers...

281
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:12,908
...and what kind of people
stop at places...

282
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,580
...where other people got murdered?

283
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:18,375
What if these people are dangerous?

284
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,245
They ain't. They're writers.

285
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:21,441
Honey.

286
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:23,178
Early Grayce.

287
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:28,418
- You settle things with Mr. Diebold?
- Yeah, I did.

288
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:30,458
Left him with the car.

289
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:32,955
We're all straight now.

290
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:38,160
- What is that?
- That's Lucy.

291
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:40,065
That's mine!

292
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:43,435
What kind of cuckoo brain
carries a cactus in her purse?

293
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:45,543
I don't know.

294
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:49,808
Straighten up.

295
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:57,512
You've got to be kidding.
They look like Okies.

296
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,123
Jesus, they look kind of weird.

297
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:01,849
They don't have five bucks.

298
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:03,756
You let me do the talking.

299
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:05,793
- Let's keep going.
- Lighten up.

300
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:08,990
- How many times you gonna say that?
- As many as it takes.

301
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:10,668
Lighten up.

302
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:22,745
- Early?
- Mr. Kessler?

303
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:25,241
Hi, I'm Brian Kessler.

304
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,748
Nice to meet you.

305
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:27,986
You must be Adele.

306
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:29,987
Uh-huh, that's Adele.

307
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:32,248
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

308
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,792
- Can I help you with your luggage?
- Oh, yeah.

309
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:39,829
I'll get these.

310
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:49,907
Hi, I'm Adele.

311
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:51,836
Hi, I'm Carrie.

312
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:53,943
I like your hair.

313
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:56,246
Oh, thanks.

314
00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:59,307
Because it's short.

315
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:01,349
Oh, yeah. Well...

316
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:03,081
...thanks.

317
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:16,491
Carrie was right.

318
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:19,694
If you looked up "poor white trash"
in the dictionary...

319
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:22,373
...a picture of Early and Adele
would be there.

320
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:27,102
But if I was gonna be a good writer,
I'd have to ignore the clichés...

321
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:29,974
...and look at life
through my own eyes.

322
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:32,377
So, Early.

323
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:34,777
What do you do?

324
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,948
Well, I do some work at the...

325
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:41,024
Well, I did some work
at the mirror factory.

326
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:45,128
Know what, Brian? One night
when we was staying up late...

327
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,561
...we was talking about how much
bad luck he must have...

328
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,792
...from all those mirrors he broke.

329
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:54,803
And I swear we came to 449 years...

330
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:57,976
...that it would take
for him to work it all off.

331
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:00,202
And he'd have to, after he died...

332
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:02,505
...he'll have to keep
coming back to Earth...

333
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:06,081
...over and over and over again.

334
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:08,515
- Karma.
- Yeah, karma.

335
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:11,683
- What?
- Karma.

336
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:12,948
You know...

337
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:17,151
...when you do something bad to
someone and fate pays you back by...

338
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:19,159
...something bad happening to you.

339
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,429
Is that French?

340
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:26,765
We can stop if you and Adele
haven't had breakfast.

341
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:28,667
Well, it's like this.

342
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:30,535
I don't eat breakfast.

343
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:33,905
It's because of what he read
in this book once.

344
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:38,014
That folks needing breakfast
is a myth or something.

345
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:41,050
And it was put out
by the cereal people.

346
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:57,357
Jesus Christ!

347
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:00,197
- Who are you?
- I'm his parole officer.

348
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,532
Right. Talked to you on the phone.

349
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,374
What the hell happened?

350
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,475
They say it's a torch job.

351
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,410
- That sound like your boy?
- Could be.

352
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:13,744
- Where do I find him?
- I don't know.

353
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:17,388
Crazy son of a bitch
was talking about moving to Texas.

354
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:19,181
Without his car?

355
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:22,249
What about the owner of the house...

356
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:25,191
...Mr. John Diebold?
Know where he is?

357
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:26,921
I don't know.

358
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,892
I tell you, he won't be happy
when he sees this.

359
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:33,833
Jesus Christ!

360
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:40,844
Early seemed harmless.

361
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:43,241
Primitive but harmless.

362
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:45,478
Of course, the fact was...

363
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:49,347
...he'd killed his landlord
less than an hour before we met him.

364
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,682
He was even wearing the guy's ring.

365
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:55,826
Who knows what he did with the finger.

366
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,702
Here you go, mama.

367
00:27:11,343 --> 00:27:13,709
Oh, thank you, honey.

368
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:15,903
Look what I got. I got a camera.

369
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:18,105
Who gets...

370
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,145
...the water?

371
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:22,316
- Here you go, Bri.
- Thanks.

372
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:25,422
I got bags of chips
and some jerky if you want.

373
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:35,893
Just in case.

374
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:40,297
From the moment I began
working on the book...

375
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:44,100
...I found myself asking
one question over and over. :

376
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,210
What's the difference between a killer
and one of us?

377
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:53,245
What is it they had or didn't have
that separated them from us?

378
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:57,555
The Novaks are long gone...

379
00:27:57,756 --> 00:28:01,192
...but the fence they hired
Michael Zeruba to put up...

380
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:03,122
...is still here.

381
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:33,314
- The Novaks...
- Hey, you two.

382
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:36,391
Come on, show your love.

383
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:48,503
The Novaks embraced the young drifter
as one of their own.

384
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:52,844
The neighbors said...

385
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:57,982
...he was a quiet young man, often seen
pushing the children on the swing set.

386
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:02,847
Everything was fine until the Novaks
ran out of work for Michael to do...

387
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:05,046
...and had to ask him to leave.

388
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:07,355
How does a man get to the point...

389
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,892
...where he can kill another
human being in cold blood?

390
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:13,530
Early, could you move
out of the way, please?

391
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:22,535
The first to die...

392
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:25,209
...was the 9-year-old daughter.

393
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:31,608
Hi, I'm Brian Kessler.

394
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:34,178
What's your name?

395
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:40,716
Pa?

396
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:46,193
Pa, where are you?

397
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:51,662
Pa, there's somebody at the door
who wants to see you.

398
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,862
- What? Who is it?
- I don't know.

399
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:56,631
Good afternoon, sir.

400
00:29:56,842 --> 00:29:58,469
I'm sorry to wake you.

401
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,975
My name is Brian Kessler.

402
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,045
I'm a writer.

403
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:07,908
I'm working on a book on the most
famous murders in American history.

404
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:12,150
I'm sure you're aware
that this is the Novak farm.

405
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:15,021
I was wondering
if my girlfriend, Carrie...

406
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:17,354
...could come in
and take a few pictures...

407
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:19,427
...and I'll just tape some notes...

408
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:21,861
...and we'll be out in five minutes.

409
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:25,434
Just a few minutes. I could
walk around, get a feel for it.

410
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,502
Goddamn ghouls.

411
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:29,571
We drove all day to get here.

412
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:32,072
I'd be out in five minutes.

413
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:33,266
Five minutes!

414
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:39,610
Brian, come on.

415
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:45,647
Just forget about it. Come on.

416
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:52,395
At the time I was angry Mr. Baxter
slammed the door in my face.

417
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:54,792
But it was just his way
of forgetting...

418
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,436
...of pretending that nothing
terrible had ever happened there.

419
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:03,100
I guess it's only natural to try
and forget the bad things that happen.

420
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,733
You never really do, though.

421
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:29,062
Well, we've come 480 miles so far.

422
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,500
Not bad for a day's haul, huh?

423
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:34,262
Pretty good, bud.

424
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:37,606
You got any family or friends
in California, Early?

425
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:38,901
No.

426
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:41,339
- You do?
- No, I don't.

427
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:47,276
Do you have any friends
or family in California, Carrie?

428
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,679
What?

429
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:50,245
No.

430
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:56,027
Well, that's okay.
At least we all got each other, right?

431
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:58,055
I mean...

432
00:31:58,263 --> 00:31:59,958
...that's something.

433
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:07,394
Mama used to say that
when you have people around you...

434
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:10,336
...it's better that you're not alone.
- Check.

435
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:14,638
Because when you're alone,
it's hard to develop your personality.

436
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:17,337
And with more people
around you, it helps...

437
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,575
...because friends
are really important and...

438
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,508
Thank you.

439
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:23,813
- Thanks, bud.
- That's...

440
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:25,717
We'll get the next one.

441
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:28,552
We gotta hit the sack.
Let's go, mama.

442
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:34,857
- Have sweet dreams.
- Good night, Adele.

443
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:38,501
Good night, Early.

444
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:45,937
That's funny. I didn't know
you were so prejudiced.

445
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:49,477
Because I object to having
somebody take off their shoe...

446
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:52,115
...and scratch their foot
while I'm eating...

447
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:55,551
...l'm prejudiced?
- He can't help the way he was raised.

448
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:57,416
I feel sorry for him.

449
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:00,413
You feel sorry for him.

450
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,286
That's so sweet.

451
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:05,820
Obviously, you didn't get
a whiff of that sock.

452
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:08,292
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

453
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:15,737
Thirty bucks for a motel.

454
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,372
For what?

455
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:21,041
Lumpy mattress, crummy TV
and a crapper?

456
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:22,235
Don't think so!

457
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,007
- Honey, sing me a song.
- Not now. I'm busy, mama.

458
00:33:26,217 --> 00:33:28,447
- Just stay put.
- Please.

459
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:34,516
Okay. If you don't sing it,
I'm gonna sing it myself.

460
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:54,875
Honey?

461
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,914
When we get to California, will you
take me to that Chinese restaurant...

462
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:02,177
...where all them footprints
are out in front?

463
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:05,183
Only if they let me put mine down too.

464
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,556
Pretty smooth,
how they stiffed us on dinner.

465
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,095
He didn't stiff us.

466
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,532
He paid for the gas. Remember?

467
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:23,539
Brian, I am telling you,
I am telling you.

468
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:27,838
They're almost broke and we are gonna
end up paying for the two of them.

469
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,678
And don't change the subject.

470
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,984
It's my favorite subject, though.

471
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:18,128
Oh, my God.

472
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:15,446
Good morning.

473
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,153
Morning, Early.

474
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:24,857
Breakfast?

475
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:28,897
- No, I don't eat breakfast. Never do.
- Sir.

476
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:32,992
We don't have a liquor license,
so I'm afraid you'll have to...

477
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:36,640
That's okay. I got plenty more
where this one come from.

478
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:58,858
- Morning.
- Morning, Adele.

479
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,630
You cut your hair.

480
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:06,094
Early cut it.

481
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:09,068
He said it makes me look more pretty.

482
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:12,243
And I think he's right because...

483
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:14,802
...he's right.

484
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:17,105
Nice job, Early.

485
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:20,143
You like to order some breakfast?

486
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:26,551
No, I won't be having breakfast
this morning, thank you.

487
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:32,119
Want some of this?

488
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,289
- Finish.
- Thanks.

489
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,831
What you reading?

490
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:40,334
Sex Art in the American Culture.

491
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:42,096
No, I never read that one.

492
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:45,970
I can't wait to get on the road.
I love that convertible.

493
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:48,540
Yeah, it's great.

494
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:50,008
Because...

495
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:54,017
...I like wind, Brian.

496
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:57,719
So do I.

497
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:32,549
You want me to get your stuff?

498
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:35,955
No, thanks, Early. I can manage.

499
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:40,262
I meant to say luggage, ma'am.

500
00:38:57,248 --> 00:38:58,579
I got them.

501
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,046
Hi, honey.

502
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:07,383
Mama.

503
00:39:31,545 --> 00:39:32,910
When you dream...

504
00:39:33,113 --> 00:39:35,081
...there are no rules.

505
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:37,349
People can fly.

506
00:39:37,618 --> 00:39:39,245
Anything can happen.

507
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:43,989
Sometimes, there's a moment
as you're waking...

508
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:47,183
...when you become aware
of the real world around you...

509
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,224
...but you're still dreaming.

510
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,427
You may think you can fly,
but you better not try it.

511
00:39:54,635 --> 00:39:58,071
Serial killers live
their whole lives in that place.

512
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:02,105
Somewhere between dreams and reality.

513
00:40:02,576 --> 00:40:04,840
Guess it's your turn to pay, Early.

514
00:40:45,886 --> 00:40:47,478
Hey, move it!

515
00:40:49,056 --> 00:40:51,115
Stupid son of a bitch.

516
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:13,340
You know, I used to smoke
before I met Early.

517
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,548
But he broke me of that.

518
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:18,517
Broke you?

519
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:22,380
Yeah, because Early, he don't think...

520
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:26,252
...that women should smoke
or drink or cuss.

521
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,257
So you know what I do?

522
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:31,158
I spell all my cuss words.

523
00:41:57,357 --> 00:41:59,848
"S." Ouch.

524
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,187
"S-H." Ouch!

525
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,935
S-H-l-T!

526
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,275
But you don't do
any of those other things.

527
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:30,447
No. I mean, I better not.

528
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,324
He whips you?

529
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:11,258
No! No, no. Only when I deserve it.

530
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:56,502
You were in there a long time.

531
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,075
Yeah. I took a dump.

532
00:43:58,278 --> 00:44:01,008
You don't want to go in.
It's wall-to-wall stink.

533
00:44:01,214 --> 00:44:02,943
Just gonna go wash my hands.

534
00:44:03,149 --> 00:44:04,878
Ain't got no sink.

535
00:44:05,085 --> 00:44:06,450
- No sink?
- Nope.

536
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:08,746
Damnedest thing I ever seen.

537
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,319
Let's go.

538
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:24,198
How about I drive, bud?

539
00:44:28,074 --> 00:44:29,564
No, mama, get in the back.

540
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:31,300
$28.35, sir.

541
00:44:31,511 --> 00:44:33,706
- How much?
- $28.35.

542
00:44:34,347 --> 00:44:35,336
Hope I got that.

543
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:38,846
Make it an even 30.

544
00:44:39,753 --> 00:44:41,721
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

545
00:45:03,176 --> 00:45:08,079
When you first meet people, all you
see are the differences between you.

546
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:12,047
But as time passes,
you start noticing the similarities.

547
00:45:12,786 --> 00:45:14,913
I guess that's how
all friendships begin.

548
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:19,990
Okay, so you first. You put down
a card, and then I put down a card.

549
00:45:20,193 --> 00:45:22,559
And then when they match up...

550
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,127
...and it's the same card...

551
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:26,458
...then you go "snap" and I take it.

552
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:29,032
And I take the cards
that's there and...

553
00:45:29,235 --> 00:45:30,224
Like that.

554
00:45:36,343 --> 00:45:37,605
Snap.

555
00:45:38,678 --> 00:45:41,613
I thought you said
you never played this before.

556
00:45:41,815 --> 00:45:43,009
I haven't.

557
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:46,083
I really haven't.
I'm a fast learner, I guess.

558
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:50,916
I was reading in your deal how they
never caught that Black Doler killer.

559
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:52,421
- Black Dahlia.
- Yeah.

560
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:53,751
They didn't.

561
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,794
Well, I was wondering how come.
See what I'm getting at?

562
00:45:57,998 --> 00:45:59,488
It's like...

563
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:03,191
Well, some people think
he just stopped killing...

564
00:46:03,403 --> 00:46:05,098
...disappeared back into society.

565
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:09,742
That's dandy, but I want to know what
a smart fellow like yourself thinks.

566
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,603
I always thought
it was a serial killer.

567
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:16,304
Anybody who took that much time
and care bisecting a human being...

568
00:46:16,516 --> 00:46:19,076
- Bisecting?
- You know, he cut them in two.

569
00:46:19,285 --> 00:46:22,152
- He hacked them up?
- Two pieces, yeah. In half.

570
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:24,414
Anybody who did that
must've enjoyed it...

571
00:46:24,624 --> 00:46:28,082
...and he would've done it again
until somebody stopped him.

572
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,258
That's good.
That's a good theory, Bri.

573
00:46:35,802 --> 00:46:37,167
You want to hear mine?

574
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:40,502
Sure.

575
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:42,663
Okay.

576
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:45,610
Ain't you gonna record it?

577
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:55,386
Early Grayce's Black Dahlia theory.

578
00:46:55,588 --> 00:46:57,112
June 23rd.

579
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:02,461
Okay. Now, I'm betting
he's still alive.

580
00:47:03,463 --> 00:47:06,864
Real old, living in a trailer park
or something somewhere.

581
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:08,728
But he's alive, see?

582
00:47:11,738 --> 00:47:14,298
Now, he's thinking about what he done.

583
00:47:14,507 --> 00:47:17,965
Going over it, over and over it,
in his head every night...

584
00:47:18,178 --> 00:47:20,646
...figuring he's smart
for getting away with it.

585
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:23,680
- That's possible.
- Hey, you shoot pool?

586
00:47:33,026 --> 00:47:34,493
Come on, bud.

587
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,760
Designated driver.

588
00:47:38,631 --> 00:47:40,758
Minnesota Fats.

589
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,369
Don't forget your key.

590
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:48,736
Why did I open my big mouth?

591
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:52,037
Please come home soon.

592
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:55,142
Let's go!

593
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:01,577
Jesus, bud, you damn near
swallowed her!

594
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:13,425
Why didn't you go with them, Adele?

595
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:16,927
Because...

596
00:48:17,137 --> 00:48:21,073
...you know how Early feels
about women drinking.

597
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,311
So how did you
and Early meet, anyways?

598
00:48:29,149 --> 00:48:31,344
I was hitchhiking this one day...

599
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:34,145
...and Early stopped.

600
00:48:34,354 --> 00:48:37,983
And I walked up
to look in the window...

601
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:39,488
...and I looked in.

602
00:48:39,692 --> 00:48:42,752
And Early's face,
he was down like that...

603
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:44,827
...because he was serious.

604
00:48:45,031 --> 00:48:46,862
And then he... He said:

605
00:48:47,066 --> 00:48:49,227
"You getting in? " And...

606
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,299
And then he looked up.

607
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:00,479
And that's when I saw his eyes.

608
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,242
And, I swear, Carrie,
he has the eyes of an angel.

609
00:49:06,452 --> 00:49:11,446
And then, I just... I ended up
moving in his trailer with him...

610
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:13,990
...because I thought
it'd be kind of neat.

611
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:16,119
But...

612
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:22,124
You know what? I was thinking that...

613
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:25,429
What if me, you,
and Brian and Early...

614
00:49:25,638 --> 00:49:28,766
...all moved into a house
together in California?

615
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:30,943
Wouldn't that be fun?

616
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:34,809
Well, I mean...

617
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:38,447
Well, we'll see what happens.

618
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,517
You never know.

619
00:49:41,721 --> 00:49:43,188
Okay.

620
00:49:51,064 --> 00:49:53,692
Do you want me
to fix your hair for you?

621
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,632
Yes.

622
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,637
Because...

623
00:50:02,308 --> 00:50:04,208
...I don't really like it...

624
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,105
...that much.

625
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:08,103
Come on, then.

626
00:50:10,817 --> 00:50:14,412
- Okay.
- It doesn't look that bad...

627
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:16,555
...but I think we should fix it.

628
00:50:23,363 --> 00:50:26,924
I'm betting we're gonna find us
some doors around here.

629
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:29,260
Yeah, the doors out front,
on the street.

630
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:31,437
Not "doors."

631
00:50:31,638 --> 00:50:34,004
- Huh?
- Doors, bud.

632
00:50:35,675 --> 00:50:37,870
Openings to other dimensions.

633
00:50:40,313 --> 00:50:43,305
You see, I read, bud.

634
00:50:43,616 --> 00:50:47,052
And I'm telling you,
if a man knows what he's doing...

635
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:51,349
...he can transport himself to
anywhere in this goddamn universe.

636
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:55,457
- Didn't know that, did you?
- No, I didn't.

637
00:50:55,795 --> 00:50:58,525
I should tell you
I'm not much of a pool player.

638
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:00,460
Oh, it ain't hard.

639
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:02,266
I can teach you.

640
00:51:02,468 --> 00:51:03,867
- Really?
- Yeah.

641
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,163
Spot you a few balls first game too.

642
00:51:06,372 --> 00:51:09,705
- You're not gonna hustle me, are you?
- How much money you got?

643
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:18,245
What's that?

644
00:51:18,718 --> 00:51:20,413
That's a portfolio of my work.

645
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,383
That's what that is.

646
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,886
Your pictures? Can I look at them?

647
00:51:27,994 --> 00:51:29,427
Yep. Go right ahead.

648
00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:37,361
Oh, my Lord!

649
00:51:40,873 --> 00:51:42,704
Did you take this one?

650
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:44,740
I took all of those.

651
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:47,941
Yeah, that one's me.

652
00:51:48,348 --> 00:51:50,509
No, it isn't!

653
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:51,911
Hold still, you.

654
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:53,983
Oh, I'm sorry.

655
00:51:57,523 --> 00:51:59,684
Oh, my God, Carrie.

656
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:02,452
If Early ever saw me
in a picture like that...

657
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,789
...l'd be black-and-blue for a week.

658
00:52:11,371 --> 00:52:13,498
You shouldn't let him do that to you.

659
00:52:20,813 --> 00:52:23,407
You think Early's mean to me?

660
00:52:27,453 --> 00:52:29,353
Well, he's not.

661
00:52:31,457 --> 00:52:34,324
He may punch me once in a while...

662
00:52:36,062 --> 00:52:38,121
...but he's not mean.

663
00:52:43,936 --> 00:52:45,961
When I was 1 3...

664
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,272
...there were these three boys.

665
00:52:52,478 --> 00:52:53,809
And they raped me...

666
00:52:54,013 --> 00:52:57,676
...in the back of this truck and...

667
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:02,679
And...

668
00:53:04,357 --> 00:53:07,190
...they hurt me so bad...

669
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:10,920
...that I was in the hospital
for, like, four months.

670
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:16,797
And I feel safe with Early because...

671
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:21,039
...most of the time,
he treats me really nice.

672
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:23,433
And...

673
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,470
...I know that he'd never...

674
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,275
He would never let anything like that
ever happen to me again.

675
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:38,550
I like my hair.

676
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:42,216
You did a really good job, Carrie.

677
00:53:43,029 --> 00:53:46,328
It's really professional.

678
00:53:53,573 --> 00:53:55,473
Hey, Marlene! Come here, baby.

679
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:59,438
Why don't you and me get together
tonight and sweat it up some?

680
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,813
Fuck off, T.J.

681
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,606
Hey!

682
00:54:11,424 --> 00:54:14,086
There you go. That'll be five bucks.

683
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,825
Wait. Wait a minute.
These aren't Lucky Lager.

684
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,069
- We ordered Lucky Lager.
- Take a look around you.

685
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:27,831
If you see something lucky
around here, you let me know.

686
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:35,409
Why don't you tell me
what you think is so funny?

687
00:54:36,382 --> 00:54:38,111
- What?
- You think I'm funny?

688
00:54:39,118 --> 00:54:40,107
No.

689
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,584
What would a jizz-gargling
cum-drunk fairy like you do...

690
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:45,586
...with a pretty girl like that?

691
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:48,453
What are you talking about, man?
Just relax.

692
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:50,390
Hit him. Because it's coming.

693
00:54:50,596 --> 00:54:52,587
What's that? This your boyfriend?

694
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:56,029
No, he's not my boyfriend.
Why don't you cool it, man?

695
00:54:56,435 --> 00:54:58,767
- Hey, asshole!
- This ain't Lucky Lager.

696
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:10,348
Break it up!

697
00:55:11,384 --> 00:55:14,148
Wasn't that guy's fault.
T.J. Started it.

698
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,922
Dipshit!

699
00:55:33,472 --> 00:55:34,734
Rack 'em up!

700
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:40,305
Because your pink replaces your red

701
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:44,608
My ma was a beautician.

702
00:55:44,817 --> 00:55:48,514
- Really?
- Yeah, she likes pink a lot.

703
00:55:49,922 --> 00:55:52,117
You should've seen her face.

704
00:55:52,325 --> 00:55:56,921
She was mad when she first
found out I was with Early...

705
00:55:57,129 --> 00:56:00,360
...on account of him just
getting out of jail and all.

706
00:56:02,501 --> 00:56:06,028
She hasn't talked to me
in over a year now.

707
00:56:06,305 --> 00:56:08,603
I wish she'd call me, Carrie.

708
00:56:08,808 --> 00:56:10,571
Early's been in jail?

709
00:56:14,213 --> 00:56:15,578
Uh-huh.

710
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,246
What for?

711
00:56:23,022 --> 00:56:25,217
For carrying a gun.

712
00:56:28,294 --> 00:56:31,024
And resisting arrest.

713
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:34,262
It's a really
interesting story, actually.

714
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:38,503
He put up a fight
with the policeman...

715
00:56:38,704 --> 00:56:40,262
...and they struggled...

716
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:43,203
...because he didn't want
to be arrested.

717
00:56:43,409 --> 00:56:45,843
I'd have done the same thing.

718
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:49,877
Why aren't you laughing now?

719
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:54,252
I don't know. I just don't think...

720
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:58,150
...that carrying guns
and resisting arrest is very funny.

721
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:09,223
Well...

722
00:57:09,435 --> 00:57:13,769
...l'm gonna go back
to my hotel room now, Carrie.

723
00:57:20,212 --> 00:57:22,942
I had a really great time with you.

724
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,377
I just think I had too many beers.

725
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:34,491
And I wasn't even supposed
to be drinking in the first place.

726
00:57:34,694 --> 00:57:37,754
Adele, you don't have to go.
I didn't mean...

727
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,301
Great.

728
00:57:46,872 --> 00:57:48,806
Look at this dipshit.

729
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:53,004
- Hey, watch it, asshole!
- Fuck you!

730
00:57:53,212 --> 00:57:55,703
Get him, Bri. Tear him up!

731
00:57:56,449 --> 00:57:58,974
Oh, I gotta see a man about a mule.

732
00:58:00,052 --> 00:58:01,314
What?

733
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,015
Take a piss.

734
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:09,156
Hey, see if there's any "reebs"
in the back seat.

735
00:58:09,462 --> 00:58:13,364
- What?
- "Reebs." Beers.

736
00:58:13,566 --> 00:58:16,399
That's what we used to call them
when we were kids.

737
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,231
That's "beer" spelled backwards.

738
00:58:19,438 --> 00:58:20,928
Shit.

739
00:58:21,307 --> 00:58:24,367
- Think I chipped the concrete, Bri.
- The last one.

740
00:58:25,144 --> 00:58:27,942
I want you to have it
for saving my ass back there.

741
00:58:28,147 --> 00:58:31,639
It ain't nothing. I picked out
that big Yankee mother a year ago.

742
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:34,513
By God, I'm uglier than you are.

743
00:58:35,688 --> 00:58:37,121
Come on!

744
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:39,615
Thank you.

745
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:45,997
How long you had your woman, bud?

746
00:58:46,198 --> 00:58:47,392
Oh, three years.

747
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,127
She's a good one.
She's a breeder, you dog.

748
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:54,198
I'll tell her you said
that she's a breeder.

749
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,340
She'll like that. I'll tell her.

750
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:58,635
Can I get a hork off that, bud?

751
00:59:09,021 --> 00:59:10,648
Do you remember them doors?

752
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:14,019
Them doors I was talking about, Bri?

753
00:59:17,797 --> 00:59:21,756
I got me a couple of them, found me
a couple of them in Kentucky.

754
00:59:23,035 --> 00:59:25,833
Hell, I wasn't even looking
for the first one.

755
00:59:27,473 --> 00:59:30,670
I was on the side of the road,
swinging my sickle.

756
00:59:32,311 --> 00:59:34,871
I turned around,
and there's this door...

757
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,571
...this big old door.

758
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:42,413
And light's coming out,
blinding me, real gold.

759
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,782
And I'm thinking, "This can't be."

760
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:47,151
So I close my eyes...

761
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,551
...and I count one, I count two...

762
00:59:49,762 --> 00:59:52,890
...I count three,
I count four, five...

763
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,226
...and I open my eyes...

764
00:59:58,571 --> 01:00:00,004
It wasn't there.

765
01:00:12,184 --> 01:00:13,173
Come on.

766
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,197
Am I late?

767
01:00:30,402 --> 01:00:31,767
I'm sorry.

768
01:00:33,272 --> 01:00:37,800
Early and me, we got
into a fight in this bar.

769
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,944
I'm fine, though. I was just...

770
01:00:40,145 --> 01:00:42,841
It was me and him against,
like, 30 guys.

771
01:00:43,382 --> 01:00:46,317
You know, we gotta talk
about your good buddy Early.

772
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,543
Who said he's my good buddy?

773
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:51,353
You sure been acting like you were.

774
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:54,150
Out whooping it up
and drinking and everything.

775
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,488
- You've been drinking too. Come on.
- Oh, yeah, right.

776
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:01,132
You should've seen how scared
she was that he was gonna find out.

777
01:01:03,002 --> 01:01:04,663
He beats her, you know.

778
01:01:05,004 --> 01:01:06,699
How do you know that?

779
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,131
Because she told me,
that's how I know that.

780
01:01:12,945 --> 01:01:15,345
I gotta see a man about a mule.

781
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,846
But only when she "deserves" it.

782
01:01:22,087 --> 01:01:24,419
Did you happen to know
that he was in jail?

783
01:01:24,657 --> 01:01:27,820
Yeah. Yeah. For stealing a car.

784
01:01:29,595 --> 01:01:32,325
Really? Is that what he told you?

785
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:35,364
He told her it was for carrying a gun.

786
01:01:35,868 --> 01:01:39,235
Brian, it could be for murder
for all we know.

787
01:01:40,272 --> 01:01:43,503
Will you stop being
so fucking melodramatic?

788
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:45,903
Melodramatic!

789
01:01:47,479 --> 01:01:49,242
If it was murder...

790
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:52,373
...he'd still be in jail...

791
01:01:53,619 --> 01:01:55,382
...or he'd be on parole...

792
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:58,750
...in which case, he wouldn't
be allowed to leave the state.

793
01:02:00,626 --> 01:02:05,393
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave
the state. You ever think about that?

794
01:02:06,899 --> 01:02:08,890
Oh, okay. We'll get the keys...

795
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:11,467
...and sneak out.
Is that what you want?

796
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,001
What's wrong with you?

797
01:02:13,205 --> 01:02:16,766
Can we talk about this in the morning
when the room isn't spinning?

798
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:23,414
So how are you feeling now, Brian?

799
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:28,179
Does your stomach feel
kind of like it's...

800
01:02:28,387 --> 01:02:30,480
...in these knots and it's twisty...

801
01:02:30,689 --> 01:02:34,125
...and you could just explode
at any given moment?

802
01:02:34,893 --> 01:02:40,229
Well, my daddy, he used to make
this great drink for hangovers.

803
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:43,993
And he'd make a blend of
sauerkraut juice and Tabasco sauce...

804
01:02:44,203 --> 01:02:47,934
Goddamn! You see that woman?
She's butt-ugly.

805
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:51,576
- He put in a little bit of lemon...
- Hairy too.

806
01:02:51,777 --> 01:02:55,770
...for the tartness.
And then the last ingredient, Brian...

807
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:59,917
...this is the best one, was an egg
so that he could have breakfast...

808
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:03,145
...and get rid of his hangover
all in the same time.

809
01:03:03,355 --> 01:03:05,789
Shave that dog and teach it to hunt!

810
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,325
Early lived in the moment.

811
01:03:10,529 --> 01:03:13,589
He did whatever he wanted,
whenever he wanted.

812
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:15,494
It was that simple.

813
01:03:17,736 --> 01:03:21,069
I don't know if I was fascinated
or frightened by him.

814
01:03:21,573 --> 01:03:23,200
Probably both.

815
01:03:24,977 --> 01:03:28,071
Okay, what should I call you?

816
01:03:28,714 --> 01:03:31,478
I can't call you Lucy. Lucy's gone.

817
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,548
I'll call you Shelly.

818
01:03:33,752 --> 01:03:38,052
Hi, Shelly. I know you're thirsty.

819
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,021
What? What's going on?

820
01:03:44,229 --> 01:03:45,696
- Look.
- What?

821
01:03:45,898 --> 01:03:47,126
Look!

822
01:04:15,327 --> 01:04:18,922
The only thing my old man
ever give me was this goddamn .45.

823
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,226
Japanese, but it's pretty good.
Go on, shoot it.

824
01:04:24,436 --> 01:04:25,664
No, take it. Shoot it.

825
01:04:25,871 --> 01:04:28,203
- I don't know how to do it.
- You can do it.

826
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:31,604
- I haven't...
- Point it and shoot the damn thing.

827
01:04:34,279 --> 01:04:36,747
No, you're jerking it.
You're all like this!

828
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:41,879
You gotta hold it soft.
Like your pecker. Okay?

829
01:04:42,654 --> 01:04:44,451
Boys will be boys.

830
01:04:47,059 --> 01:04:49,027
You know any tricks, Carrie?

831
01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:50,684
No.

832
01:04:50,896 --> 01:04:52,227
Now, hold on. Hold on.

833
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:54,365
- You want to learn some?
- No.

834
01:04:54,566 --> 01:04:56,796
Aim. Okay, loosen up.

835
01:04:57,002 --> 01:04:58,765
Loosen your elbow.

836
01:04:58,971 --> 01:05:00,700
You gotta breathe, bud.

837
01:05:00,906 --> 01:05:02,066
Hold it.

838
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:03,396
Shoot.

839
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:06,743
- Hey, Carrie!
- Good one.

840
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,708
You look good with a gun, Brian.

841
01:05:08,914 --> 01:05:11,815
That's a good one, bud.
That's super. Good one.

842
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:16,050
Like that gun? I'll give it to you.
I want you to have it.

843
01:05:16,255 --> 01:05:18,689
- I don't need a gun.
- Go on, take it.

844
01:05:18,891 --> 01:05:20,916
I'll get me another one.

845
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:25,586
You never know out in California with
all them cuckoos. Best hold on to it.

846
01:05:25,998 --> 01:05:28,728
Now give it another shot,
you mean boy. Go on.

847
01:05:29,034 --> 01:05:30,934
Shoot that damn thing.

848
01:05:33,672 --> 01:05:36,038
That's super.
That's some super shooting.

849
01:05:36,241 --> 01:05:37,606
Look at that.

850
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:15,078
We're gonna sit this one out, bud,
if that's to your "satisfication."

851
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,304
Fine.

852
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,316
Honey! Honey.

853
01:06:24,056 --> 01:06:27,389
If you need some help, bud,
you just holler. I'll be there.

854
01:06:55,153 --> 01:06:56,586
Shit.

855
01:07:40,399 --> 01:07:41,764
What is that?

856
01:07:42,501 --> 01:07:44,628
A copy of the tape they found.

857
01:07:45,337 --> 01:07:46,599
He recorded everything.

858
01:07:46,805 --> 01:07:48,272
Where am I?

859
01:07:50,909 --> 01:07:53,605
Mister, can you help me?

860
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,546
Speldor had him working in here...

861
01:07:57,516 --> 01:07:59,848
...before he was 8 years old...
- Who are you?

862
01:08:00,052 --> 01:08:03,783
...killing animals with a sledgehammer
that was bigger than he was.

863
01:08:05,557 --> 01:08:08,583
Can you... Can you get me
out of here, please?

864
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:12,559
Look, I don't know who you are.

865
01:08:12,764 --> 01:08:15,198
I don't know what you want me to be...

866
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,301
...but, please, just let me go, okay?

867
01:08:18,937 --> 01:08:20,996
When she was pissed at him...

868
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,798
What are you doing?

869
01:08:24,443 --> 01:08:26,604
...she'd beat the shit out of him...

870
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:29,208
...then lock him in here overnight.

871
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:35,519
I have... My parents, they have money.
I'll give you money...

872
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:37,746
...if that's what you want.
Let me go.

873
01:08:37,956 --> 01:08:39,014
One morning...

874
01:08:39,224 --> 01:08:41,590
Oh, God! Oh, God!

875
01:08:42,694 --> 01:08:44,423
...the little boy wakes up...

876
01:08:46,098 --> 01:08:47,588
...picks up the sledgehammer...

877
01:08:47,799 --> 01:08:50,097
What are you gonna do
with those things?

878
01:08:50,302 --> 01:08:52,133
...starts hurting back.

879
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:55,597
Oh, God, no!

880
01:09:02,948 --> 01:09:05,348
How does he get from...

881
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,142
What are you doing?

882
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:08,645
I'm finished.

883
01:09:10,055 --> 01:09:12,182
I know you're upset about the gun.

884
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:14,621
I'm not upset about the gun!

885
01:09:16,328 --> 01:09:19,525
I'm upset about the gun,
but that is not it. It's...

886
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:23,429
God, can we please turn this off?

887
01:09:27,506 --> 01:09:30,066
Goddamn it, what is going on here?

888
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:35,602
A week ago, you would never have
picked up that gun. Never!

889
01:09:35,814 --> 01:09:38,647
Then this afternoon,
you're out there wielding a gun...

890
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:41,045
...like you're Clyde-fucking-Barrow!

891
01:09:41,253 --> 01:09:43,653
What's going on with you?
Please talk to me!

892
01:09:43,855 --> 01:09:46,915
It was stupid.
It was a cheap thrill, I admit it.

893
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:51,391
It was stupid.
It was just bang-bang, like kids.

894
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:54,695
Okay? But I need you
to take these photos.

895
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,925
We need them.
I don't want to blow it.

896
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:00,629
- Oh, the pictures. The book.
- Okay?

897
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:04,036
God, that really is all
that matters to you, isn't it?

898
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:06,904
That really is all
you care about, isn't it?

899
01:10:07,846 --> 01:10:10,280
God, I cannot believe
I agreed to do this!

900
01:10:10,482 --> 01:10:11,710
That is such crap!

901
01:10:13,185 --> 01:10:17,622
You wanted to come take these photos
every bit as much as I wanted you to.

902
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:19,891
Wrong.

903
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,285
Wrong!

904
01:10:21,493 --> 01:10:24,121
I did whatever it took
to get you off your ass...

905
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:27,924
...and us on our way to California.
And there's a big difference.

906
01:10:55,694 --> 01:10:57,821
- Early.
- What?

907
01:11:47,879 --> 01:11:49,369
Early.

908
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:51,278
Wait.

909
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,213
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry.

910
01:11:57,422 --> 01:11:58,946
I'm sorry.

911
01:12:01,092 --> 01:12:03,083
I want him out of our car.

912
01:12:04,663 --> 01:12:05,755
Why? What happened?

913
01:12:05,964 --> 01:12:08,159
- I want him out of our car.
- What happened?

914
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:11,802
Next gas station, it's either
him or me. It's up to you.

915
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:41,323
...hundreds of acres
and forced 7 0 people to evacuate...

916
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:43,865
...was originally thought
to have been arson.

917
01:12:44,069 --> 01:12:47,527
Yeah, can I get
a carton of Victory Kings...

918
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:50,674
...and $20 worth of gas
in the car? Thanks.

919
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:52,740
Their names haven't been released...

920
01:12:52,944 --> 01:12:54,206
Here's your change.

921
01:12:56,815 --> 01:12:59,716
Looks like a bad one coming in.
Y'all better be careful.

922
01:12:59,918 --> 01:13:01,249
Where you headed?

923
01:13:02,354 --> 01:13:03,946
California.

924
01:13:05,123 --> 01:13:09,219
California. I hear it never rains
out there, huh? It must be nice.

925
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:53,570
Hi, Carrie.
I have to go to the bathroom.

926
01:14:09,421 --> 01:14:12,288
...fatal stabbing and robbery
of Joseph Davies Robbins...

927
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,958
...at this East Texas gas station.

928
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,094
He is armed and dangerous.

929
01:14:17,796 --> 01:14:20,230
If you see this man, please notif...

930
01:14:24,903 --> 01:14:27,633
...with a history of arrests
is still at large.

931
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:32,105
Grayce is 25 years old,
5' 1 1, " with long brown hair.

932
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,437
He has a tattoo on his left arm.

933
01:14:34,646 --> 01:14:37,342
He was last seen in East Texas
at a gas station...

934
01:14:37,549 --> 01:14:39,813
I ain't riding no bus, bitch.

935
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:42,680
...to be responsible
for the murder of his landlord...

936
01:14:42,887 --> 01:14:47,347
...John Diebold of Nassau County.
The murder occurred last Tuesday.

937
01:14:47,559 --> 01:14:52,053
We would like to repeat. : There is
a nationwide hunt for Early Grayce.

938
01:14:52,263 --> 01:14:54,629
Knew that boy'd have
a hogleg here somewhere.

939
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:56,322
Not a word.

940
01:15:00,572 --> 01:15:04,008
Hello! Get over here, skinny.
Sit your ass in that corner.

941
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:05,604
Come on.

942
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:16,450
- Honey, what are you doing?
- They gave us the boot, mama.

943
01:15:16,654 --> 01:15:19,088
Keep Brian busy.
I don't want him coming in.

944
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:21,758
- Honey, you're scaring...
- Right now, missy. Get!

945
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:33,961
- Hi.
- Hi.

946
01:15:34,172 --> 01:15:37,903
I'm just getting my things,
and then I'm gonna leave, Brian.

947
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:40,734
What's your name, boy?

948
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:42,679
Walter Livesy.

949
01:15:42,881 --> 01:15:47,341
I think I gotta kill you, Walter.
How do you feel about that?

950
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,353
Not so good.

951
01:15:51,189 --> 01:15:54,352
- You sure you have to?
- I don't know. Wish I did.

952
01:15:54,559 --> 01:15:56,356
- Early, please...
- Shut up!

953
01:15:57,529 --> 01:15:59,190
Goddamn it!

954
01:15:59,397 --> 01:16:02,025
I'm trying to have
a conversation with Walter.

955
01:16:04,803 --> 01:16:06,771
I'm sorry about that, Walter.

956
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:11,064
Hey, don't forget your yo-yo.
Listen, Adele...

957
01:16:11,276 --> 01:16:14,404
...you not coming with us
has nothing to do with you guys.

958
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:15,943
It's between Carrie and me.

959
01:16:17,348 --> 01:16:18,645
Where you from?

960
01:16:20,518 --> 01:16:22,509
Vernon, Florida.

961
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,654
Don't know it. Any hunting?

962
01:16:26,357 --> 01:16:27,483
Turkeys, sometimes.

963
01:16:28,927 --> 01:16:30,656
Yeah, turkeys are real smart.

964
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:32,727
Smarter than most people think.

965
01:16:34,432 --> 01:16:37,560
Tell you what, Walter.
I want you down on your belly.

966
01:16:38,303 --> 01:16:39,770
Get on your belly.

967
01:16:41,706 --> 01:16:45,802
Stay there for a long time
after we leave. We got a deal, son?

968
01:16:46,911 --> 01:16:48,503
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

969
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,212
You mind if I hold on to that Bible?

970
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:53,577
What do you want
with your Bible, Walter?

971
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,154
He thinks I'm gonna kill him.

972
01:16:57,355 --> 01:17:00,085
- That'd make me a liar, wouldn't it?
- No, sir.

973
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:01,280
No?

974
01:17:06,598 --> 01:17:08,088
Here you go, Walter.

975
01:17:12,871 --> 01:17:15,840
I wonder if Adele would like one...

976
01:17:20,712 --> 01:17:22,646
- What was that?
- Oh, my God.

977
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:25,042
Nothing, Brian.
It was just the thunder.

978
01:17:29,287 --> 01:17:30,311
Oh, my God.

979
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:33,149
Hey, Early, what the fuck
are you doing?

980
01:17:33,358 --> 01:17:35,189
You'll like this one. Get in.

981
01:17:35,393 --> 01:17:38,328
Big fella, you're riding shotgun.
Adele, you drive.

982
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:41,692
- What are you doing?
- Come on, bud. Come on, let's go.

983
01:17:45,937 --> 01:17:48,997
- You all right? What happened?
- Get us out of here, mama.

984
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:51,072
Oh, she gonna lie.

985
01:17:56,147 --> 01:17:59,014
- What happened?
- He shot him in the head.

986
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:03,085
- Who shot who in the head?
- No, he didn't, Carrie!

987
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:09,726
Everybody just shut up!

988
01:18:10,295 --> 01:18:14,425
Goddamn, bitch, quit squawking!
Nothing's changed.

989
01:18:14,999 --> 01:18:18,059
I'm gonna get you there,
safe, to California.

990
01:18:18,269 --> 01:18:21,397
If Adele don't kill us
with her driving first.

991
01:18:38,656 --> 01:18:40,248
Early.

992
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,293
What'd you get us?

993
01:18:47,065 --> 01:18:49,295
I got Chinese food.

994
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:53,697
What is it?

995
01:18:54,372 --> 01:18:56,932
The guy, he didn't speak
too good of English...

996
01:18:57,141 --> 01:18:58,802
...so I just got what they had.

997
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:01,410
Smells like butt. You get the beer?

998
01:19:04,048 --> 01:19:05,913
What is this, Chink beer?

999
01:19:06,517 --> 01:19:08,644
Goddamn it, Adele.

1000
01:19:11,155 --> 01:19:12,349
Well...

1001
01:19:13,324 --> 01:19:15,224
...give this one to what's-her-name.

1002
01:19:15,426 --> 01:19:17,690
Come over here, bud.
Get you some grub.

1003
01:19:17,895 --> 01:19:21,422
What the hell's a Chinaman doing
in the middle of an American desert?

1004
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,262
Adele, where are the forks and spoons?

1005
01:19:33,177 --> 01:19:37,477
Is it me, or has this trip gone downhill
since we ran out of Lucky Lager?

1006
01:19:44,355 --> 01:19:47,085
Wish I had me some chili beans.

1007
01:19:57,969 --> 01:20:00,199
How many people
have you killed, Early?

1008
01:20:03,241 --> 01:20:05,675
Well, now, how many people
you seen me kill?

1009
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:08,804
None.

1010
01:20:09,113 --> 01:20:10,944
That's how many I killed.

1011
01:20:15,319 --> 01:20:16,377
If you say so.

1012
01:20:16,988 --> 01:20:18,285
Damn right I do!

1013
01:20:19,157 --> 01:20:21,387
Just shut up! Eat your food.

1014
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,391
You ain't never killed no one,
have you, Bri?

1015
01:20:34,005 --> 01:20:35,029
- No.
- No?

1016
01:20:35,239 --> 01:20:37,707
Ain't seen nobody
killed either, have you?

1017
01:20:39,577 --> 01:20:41,408
- No, I haven't.
- No.

1018
01:20:43,181 --> 01:20:44,705
Tell me something, big time:

1019
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:49,012
How the hell you gonna write a book
about something you know nothing about?

1020
01:20:51,789 --> 01:20:55,691
Mama, sing us a song or something.

1021
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:09,236
I...

1022
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,872
...wish...

1023
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:17,013
...Carrie was happy

1024
01:21:19,117 --> 01:21:20,778
I...

1025
01:21:20,985 --> 01:21:22,748
...wish...

1026
01:21:22,954 --> 01:21:27,891
...she would smile

1027
01:21:44,961 --> 01:21:48,419
You guys want your picture taken?

1028
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:50,428
Come on, Carrie, smile.

1029
01:22:04,013 --> 01:22:06,948
He was breathing when
I walked out of there.

1030
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:10,745
See, Carrie, it's okay.
He was breathing.

1031
01:22:11,988 --> 01:22:14,786
Ain't we getting near
the next murder site?

1032
01:22:14,991 --> 01:22:16,652
It doesn't matter anymore.

1033
01:22:16,893 --> 01:22:19,555
The hell if it don't.
Give me that map.

1034
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:26,461
Someday me and Adele,
we'll be walking along...

1035
01:22:26,669 --> 01:22:29,137
...we'll see your book
in some store window.

1036
01:22:29,339 --> 01:22:33,298
We'll buy it and put it on our
coffee table, right, mama?

1037
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:49,490
Let's go have us a look, people.

1038
01:22:49,692 --> 01:22:53,321
- Early, I'm gonna stay here.
- You don't want to go, mama?

1039
01:22:57,667 --> 01:23:00,465
You watch Carrie.
I'll take the pictures, Bri.

1040
01:23:10,413 --> 01:23:12,643
You run, Bri gets it.

1041
01:23:16,552 --> 01:23:18,179
Lead the way, bud.

1042
01:23:49,052 --> 01:23:52,510
So, uh, what happened here?

1043
01:23:53,289 --> 01:23:56,190
Two brothers, prospectors,
lived here in the '70s.

1044
01:23:57,527 --> 01:23:58,824
Yeah, so?

1045
01:23:59,662 --> 01:24:03,496
They picked up hitchhikers, young men,
and brought them here.

1046
01:24:05,735 --> 01:24:06,963
Hey, Bri.

1047
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:11,163
It won't give me nightmares, will it?
Get out of the way.

1048
01:24:14,477 --> 01:24:16,707
This one's called "Walk the Dog."

1049
01:24:24,787 --> 01:24:26,948
My favorite one is "Rock the Cradle."

1050
01:24:35,698 --> 01:24:39,327
They were asked just before they were
executed why they did it.

1051
01:24:39,836 --> 01:24:42,066
And they said, "To be famous."

1052
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:45,669
Why did you do it, Early?

1053
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,002
Do what, Bri?

1054
01:24:49,912 --> 01:24:51,880
You didn't have to kill the guy.

1055
01:24:53,249 --> 01:24:55,342
Move a little to the left.

1056
01:24:58,621 --> 01:25:00,384
You wanted to.

1057
01:25:02,225 --> 01:25:03,487
Why?

1058
01:25:06,362 --> 01:25:10,230
Help me out, Early,
I don't know shit about killing.

1059
01:25:10,533 --> 01:25:12,330
You gotta tell me.

1060
01:25:14,103 --> 01:25:17,163
- Does it make you feel good?
- Huh?

1061
01:25:19,909 --> 01:25:21,638
- Powerful?
- Huh?

1062
01:25:21,878 --> 01:25:23,345
- Superior?
- Huh?

1063
01:25:25,581 --> 01:25:26,878
What?

1064
01:25:27,683 --> 01:25:29,173
Who are you angry with?

1065
01:25:29,819 --> 01:25:31,616
Your mother?

1066
01:25:32,421 --> 01:25:33,979
Your father?

1067
01:25:35,024 --> 01:25:37,857
You want to know about
my daddy, do you?

1068
01:25:39,662 --> 01:25:40,526
Yeah.

1069
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:43,826
I'll tell you about my daddy.

1070
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,661
Adele, you gotta help us out here
and talk to Early. He's sick...

1071
01:25:48,871 --> 01:25:50,805
...and he needs some help.

1072
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,600
- You've gotta...
- You're messing up my trick.

1073
01:25:53,809 --> 01:25:55,777
Adele, listen to me, please.

1074
01:25:56,746 --> 01:26:00,739
The police are after him.
He killed a man back there.

1075
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:03,077
No, that ain't true.

1076
01:26:03,286 --> 01:26:05,254
I saw him kill a man!

1077
01:26:05,454 --> 01:26:08,150
No, Carrie, that ain't true.
It ain't true.

1078
01:26:08,357 --> 01:26:10,985
I'm your friend, why would I lie?

1079
01:26:11,761 --> 01:26:13,126
He said he didn't.

1080
01:26:13,362 --> 01:26:16,058
Why would I lie about this?
I know you know.

1081
01:26:16,265 --> 01:26:19,792
- I don't know why you're saying this.
- Why would I lie?

1082
01:26:22,305 --> 01:26:25,706
He said he didn't do it,
and you ain't my friend.

1083
01:26:26,042 --> 01:26:27,737
You're on private property.

1084
01:26:27,944 --> 01:26:30,538
I need some kind of identification.

1085
01:26:30,746 --> 01:26:33,408
I'm sorry, Carrie.
Please don't say anything.

1086
01:26:34,016 --> 01:26:35,984
We got a match. I'll call for backup.

1087
01:26:36,419 --> 01:26:38,182
Please, don't say anything.

1088
01:26:38,588 --> 01:26:39,486
All right, ladies.

1089
01:26:39,722 --> 01:26:42,589
I'd like both of you to step
slowly away from the car...

1090
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:04,211
No, Early!

1091
01:27:11,954 --> 01:27:14,320
Got them both on a dead run.

1092
01:27:16,325 --> 01:27:21,058
No, no, no, Early!

1093
01:27:22,298 --> 01:27:24,198
Come on, mama.

1094
01:27:27,069 --> 01:27:29,299
Tell me that don't hurt.

1095
01:27:30,406 --> 01:27:32,465
- Shoot him.
- What?

1096
01:27:34,944 --> 01:27:37,378
Put that crippled dog
out of his misery.

1097
01:27:39,615 --> 01:27:42,550
You want to know about it,
you gotta do it, son.

1098
01:27:43,052 --> 01:27:44,781
Shoot him!

1099
01:27:44,987 --> 01:27:49,720
Lay it on in there.
Come on, mean boy.

1100
01:27:49,925 --> 01:27:51,620
Come on, mean boy, do it!

1101
01:27:52,995 --> 01:27:55,555
Shoot him!
Shoot the dog, shoot the dog!

1102
01:27:57,633 --> 01:27:59,328
It's him or you, boy!

1103
01:28:00,036 --> 01:28:02,664
Shoot him! Come on!

1104
01:28:03,139 --> 01:28:05,505
Go! Go, mean boy!

1105
01:28:09,078 --> 01:28:10,511
Pussy faggot!

1106
01:28:10,746 --> 01:28:13,681
Look at his face!
It's not your father! Look at him!

1107
01:28:13,883 --> 01:28:15,441
I know that, you idiot!

1108
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:19,109
That police is in a world of hurting,
and this is a mercy kill.

1109
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:28,824
Let's hit the road.

1110
01:28:40,176 --> 01:28:42,644
Not even a simple "Thank you."

1111
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,311
Thank you.

1112
01:28:47,316 --> 01:28:49,716
Thank you for what, Adele?

1113
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,854
I don't know, Early.

1114
01:28:54,056 --> 01:28:57,787
It was for saving
your fucking life back there!

1115
01:28:57,993 --> 01:29:01,451
You were this close to spending
the night in the county morgue!

1116
01:29:01,697 --> 01:29:04,996
- He wasn't gonna shoot, you murderer!
- Stop it, Carrie.

1117
01:29:05,234 --> 01:29:07,259
- Are you fucking insane!?
- Shut up!

1118
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:09,495
- He's a murderer!
- Shut up, Carrie!

1119
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:17,902
Goddamn bunch of loons!

1120
01:29:37,066 --> 01:29:39,500
Look, mama, there's a pretty house.

1121
01:29:41,537 --> 01:29:43,528
Maybe they got some beer.

1122
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:50,406
Look at all the cactuses.

1123
01:29:52,214 --> 01:29:54,842
They're beautiful.

1124
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:58,542
You know what makes
cactuses so strong?

1125
01:29:58,754 --> 01:30:02,884
You can just forget about them
forever and they'd still live.

1126
01:30:03,092 --> 01:30:04,616
They'd just keep growing...

1127
01:30:04,827 --> 01:30:08,422
We got to do something
before Early kills somebody else.

1128
01:30:08,631 --> 01:30:11,725
- And they breed.
- Adele, will you listen to me?

1129
01:30:15,571 --> 01:30:18,699
You can't do nothing, Brian.
Just sit still.

1130
01:30:39,228 --> 01:30:40,923
Adele.

1131
01:30:43,599 --> 01:30:46,830
You have beautiful cactuses, ma'am.

1132
01:30:49,205 --> 01:30:51,105
I just love them.

1133
01:30:52,441 --> 01:30:54,671
My mama had a garden...

1134
01:30:54,877 --> 01:30:57,846
...and I had this baby cactus.

1135
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,538
- And I was gonna plant it...
- You gotta talk to Adele.

1136
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,684
She looks up to you. She'll listen.

1137
01:31:03,886 --> 01:31:07,378
I tried talking to her at the mine.
It didn't work.

1138
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,057
Then try again.

1139
01:31:09,258 --> 01:31:12,591
Hey, Bri, you ever stop...

1140
01:31:12,795 --> 01:31:17,357
...and think, if you switched
two letters in your name...

1141
01:31:17,666 --> 01:31:20,294
...you'd spell "brain"?

1142
01:31:27,142 --> 01:31:29,042
Boy, you got a problem.

1143
01:31:33,782 --> 01:31:35,682
What's wrong with grandma?

1144
01:31:48,931 --> 01:31:50,398
Where's your husband?

1145
01:31:53,636 --> 01:31:54,796
I'm a widow.

1146
01:31:57,172 --> 01:31:58,730
Yeah?

1147
01:32:22,431 --> 01:32:24,092
That you, Peaches?

1148
01:32:25,401 --> 01:32:28,097
Sweetheart, come on over here.

1149
01:32:28,304 --> 01:32:31,296
It's so clear, you can't believe it.

1150
01:32:42,117 --> 01:32:43,812
It's just amazing.

1151
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,318
Come on over. Take a look, honey.

1152
01:32:56,398 --> 01:32:57,956
I want you to see this.

1153
01:33:00,402 --> 01:33:02,029
Peaches?

1154
01:33:07,676 --> 01:33:09,735
Early?

1155
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:11,143
Early.

1156
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:19,788
Guess what, Early?

1157
01:33:19,989 --> 01:33:24,153
Miss Musgrave has this guest house
in the back...

1158
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:27,887
...and it's real beautiful.
And it's empty, hon.

1159
01:33:28,097 --> 01:33:31,464
- She said if me and you wanted to...
- Hank!

1160
01:33:33,569 --> 01:33:34,627
Hank!

1161
01:33:38,774 --> 01:33:42,073
Well, you're a widow now, Peaches.

1162
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:46,477
Boring.

1163
01:33:47,683 --> 01:33:48,945
Boring.

1164
01:33:51,687 --> 01:33:53,211
Dog shit.

1165
01:33:54,456 --> 01:33:57,323
That don't leave much
to the imagination, does it?

1166
01:34:27,322 --> 01:34:29,950
I know him. That's my daddy.

1167
01:34:32,127 --> 01:34:33,685
Fucker.

1168
01:34:34,763 --> 01:34:35,752
Boring.

1169
01:34:40,636 --> 01:34:42,035
You're not gonna die.

1170
01:34:54,349 --> 01:34:56,078
That's you, ain't it?

1171
01:35:02,558 --> 01:35:03,582
Yeah, that's me.

1172
01:35:03,826 --> 01:35:05,919
Do you like it? What do you think?

1173
01:35:21,844 --> 01:35:23,778
Dog shit.

1174
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,041
You can go now.

1175
01:35:37,793 --> 01:35:39,420
Call me.

1176
01:35:40,596 --> 01:35:42,723
You should control your woman, boy.

1177
01:35:43,699 --> 01:35:45,599
Stinky. Stinky.

1178
01:35:46,869 --> 01:35:50,327
Lucky for you
they take all kinds in California.

1179
01:35:51,673 --> 01:35:53,641
That's where we'll be tomorrow.

1180
01:35:55,077 --> 01:35:56,806
California.

1181
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:00,138
Adele!

1182
01:36:01,984 --> 01:36:03,451
Mama!

1183
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,786
Stupid.

1184
01:36:09,024 --> 01:36:10,753
Adele!

1185
01:36:13,295 --> 01:36:15,024
Goddamn it.

1186
01:36:16,565 --> 01:36:18,624
Peaches!

1187
01:36:19,802 --> 01:36:20,666
Peaches!

1188
01:36:23,205 --> 01:36:25,503
- Peaches!
- Stop it!

1189
01:36:25,741 --> 01:36:26,799
Stop it, Early!

1190
01:36:28,911 --> 01:36:29,935
Stop it!

1191
01:36:31,914 --> 01:36:32,881
What are you doing?

1192
01:36:33,081 --> 01:36:36,642
Get the piano up and try
and slide your hands under.

1193
01:36:37,019 --> 01:36:38,748
Mama, what are you...

1194
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,824
Why are you crying?
I'm the one that got hit.

1195
01:36:49,031 --> 01:36:52,933
Because I decided, Early.

1196
01:36:53,869 --> 01:36:57,236
I'm not gonna climb up
that Hollywood sign with you.

1197
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:00,033
- And why not?
- You're mean, Early!

1198
01:37:00,943 --> 01:37:05,039
- No, I'm not.
- You hurt those people, Early.

1199
01:37:05,414 --> 01:37:07,177
I don't want to do it with you.

1200
01:37:08,317 --> 01:37:10,251
I loved you, Early.

1201
01:37:10,452 --> 01:37:14,081
You just be quiet. You are mean.

1202
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:31,230
- Run! Go!
- No, I'm not leaving you here!

1203
01:37:33,609 --> 01:37:36,339
- Brian...
- Go! Go!

1204
01:37:41,216 --> 01:37:43,047
- Adele!
- Shut up!

1205
01:37:43,285 --> 01:37:44,582
- Adele!
- Shut up!

1206
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:45,912
- Adele!
- Shut up!

1207
01:37:47,289 --> 01:37:48,347
Shut up!

1208
01:37:59,268 --> 01:38:01,168
Looks like I need me a new woman.

1209
01:38:04,406 --> 01:38:05,395
No!

1210
01:38:06,174 --> 01:38:07,402
Shut up!

1211
01:38:10,112 --> 01:38:12,546
Oh, God, I'll do anything.
I'll go with you.

1212
01:38:13,348 --> 01:38:16,806
Please don't kill him.
Oh, God, I'll do anything.

1213
01:38:17,853 --> 01:38:20,014
Please don't kill him!

1214
01:38:43,211 --> 01:38:46,703
Oh, mama, we gotta find us a door.

1215
01:38:47,182 --> 01:38:50,709
Save us some time...
Goddamn, that's a super dress.

1216
01:38:51,219 --> 01:38:53,187
Yeah, that's just super.

1217
01:40:14,703 --> 01:40:18,434
Oh, I didn't think
he'd left anyone alive.

1218
01:40:19,374 --> 01:40:20,636
Where's Carrie?

1219
01:40:20,842 --> 01:40:22,833
They took off down the road.

1220
01:40:24,112 --> 01:40:25,545
Watch your head.

1221
01:40:29,751 --> 01:40:30,740
Grab that chair.

1222
01:40:32,687 --> 01:40:35,417
I'm gonna lift the piano.
Slide it under.

1223
01:40:50,372 --> 01:40:54,468
He pulled out all the phone lines.
The nearest one is 21 miles away.

1224
01:40:56,678 --> 01:40:58,441
He took the fire road west.

1225
01:40:58,647 --> 01:41:02,777
Take your car and get to that phone.
Call the police.

1226
01:41:18,066 --> 01:41:19,260
Shit!

1227
01:41:37,686 --> 01:41:39,085
Get up there.

1228
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:57,200
Well, how you all doing?

1229
01:41:57,405 --> 01:41:58,770
I'm Early.

1230
01:41:59,074 --> 01:42:01,838
This is my woman, Carrie.

1231
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:05,407
Sorry to inconvenience you all
like this, but, well...

1232
01:42:05,614 --> 01:42:07,980
...looks like we'll
be staying the night.

1233
01:42:08,183 --> 01:42:09,207
Don't you move...

1234
01:42:09,918 --> 01:42:13,217
...you Pinocchio-looking knuckleheads.

1235
01:45:26,915 --> 01:45:28,382
No!

1236
01:46:37,385 --> 01:46:38,374
Door...

1237
01:46:38,686 --> 01:46:40,551
...where you been?

1238
01:46:45,093 --> 01:46:47,755
Gotta transport...
Transport...

1239
01:47:13,388 --> 01:47:15,049
Carrie!

1240
01:47:44,652 --> 01:47:46,176
Motherfucker!

1241
01:48:08,276 --> 01:48:10,301
Brian came back!

1242
01:48:11,746 --> 01:48:15,944
Hey, Bri, you want
to ask me some questions?

1243
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:25,289
Ask me some questions!

1244
01:48:25,493 --> 01:48:26,653
Come on!

1245
01:48:27,529 --> 01:48:29,258
Do I feel powerful?

1246
01:48:29,464 --> 01:48:31,864
Do I feel superior?

1247
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,628
No.

1248
01:48:40,508 --> 01:48:41,668
I feel good.

1249
01:48:45,547 --> 01:48:46,673
You're bleeding.

1250
01:48:51,619 --> 01:48:53,177
You're bleeding.

1251
01:49:00,495 --> 01:49:02,122
Skynyrd!

1252
01:49:02,597 --> 01:49:04,428
Lynyrd Skynyrd!

1253
01:49:04,732 --> 01:49:06,427
I like that one.

1254
01:49:37,465 --> 01:49:38,898
The keys.

1255
01:49:40,802 --> 01:49:42,497
They're around his neck.

1256
01:50:51,939 --> 01:50:55,102
I'll never know why
Early Grayce became a killer.

1257
01:50:55,543 --> 01:50:57,738
I don't know why any of them do.

1258
01:50:58,746 --> 01:51:00,907
When I looked into his eyes...

1259
01:51:01,115 --> 01:51:02,742
...I felt nothing.

1260
01:51:03,651 --> 01:51:04,845
Nothing.

1261
01:51:06,187 --> 01:51:10,749
That day, I learned any one of us is
capable of taking another human life.

1262
01:51:11,693 --> 01:51:15,527
But I also learned that there is
a difference between us and them.

1263
01:51:16,197 --> 01:51:18,324
It's in feeling remorse.

1264
01:51:18,766 --> 01:51:20,495
Dealing with guilt.

1265
01:51:21,436 --> 01:51:23,700
And confronting your conscience.

1266
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:26,333
Early never did.

1267
01:51:41,489 --> 01:51:43,480
June 22nd, the Novak Farm.

1268
01:51:43,691 --> 01:51:48,128
Mr. Baxter slammed the door in my
face today, calling me a damn ghoul.

1269
01:52:23,231 --> 01:52:26,257
I'm betting he's still alive.

1270
01:52:26,467 --> 01:52:29,493
Real old, living in a trailer park
or something somewhere.

1271
01:52:29,704 --> 01:52:31,695
But, he's alive, see?

1272
01:52:31,906 --> 01:52:34,272
Now, he's thinking about what he done.

1273
01:52:34,475 --> 01:52:38,741
Going over it, over and over it,
in his head every night...

1274
01:52:38,946 --> 01:52:41,744
...figuring how smart he is
for getting away with it.

1275
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:44,110
Thank you.

1276
01:52:48,322 --> 01:52:49,949
Hey, how's it going?

1277
01:52:50,892 --> 01:52:52,086
Not bad.

1278
01:52:52,293 --> 01:52:53,692
How was your swim?

1279
01:52:54,629 --> 01:52:56,187
It's freezing.

1280
01:52:56,564 --> 01:52:58,122
It's November.

1281
01:52:59,934 --> 01:53:01,094
I know.

1282
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:08,468
There's this gallery in Venice...

1283
01:53:08,676 --> 01:53:11,907
...and I showed them my work,
the Icon series.

1284
01:53:12,113 --> 01:53:15,014
- I think they're interested.
- That's great.

1285
01:53:15,216 --> 01:53:18,447
Well, it's not definite,
but it's encouraging.

1286
01:53:20,488 --> 01:53:22,979
Well, let's celebrate.
I'll take you to lunch.

1287
01:53:23,257 --> 01:53:24,485
Okay.

1288
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:27,550
So, what happens next?

1289
01:53:27,829 --> 01:53:30,263
I have a meeting
at the gallery on Thursday...

1290
01:53:30,464 --> 01:53:33,991
...and they want to see
some more of my work, so...

1291
01:53:34,202 --> 01:53:36,830
I'm sure they're gonna love it
as much as I do.

1292
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,798
Hi.

1293
01:53:41,242 --> 01:53:43,369
Guess who this is.

1294
01:53:43,845 --> 01:53:45,870
It's me. It's Adele.

1295
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:49,015
I know I'm probably not
supposed to be talking...

1296
01:53:49,217 --> 01:53:51,515
...on the tape recorder, but...

1297
01:53:51,719 --> 01:53:54,449
I just wanted to say thank you...

1298
01:53:54,655 --> 01:53:58,250
...for taking me and Early
with you on your trip...

1299
01:53:58,459 --> 01:54:02,190
...because me and Early's
having a really good time.

1300
01:54:03,197 --> 01:54:08,134
And I just hope that
when we get to California...

1301
01:54:08,336 --> 01:54:11,499
...that you guys don't
forget all about us.

1302
01:54:11,706 --> 01:54:15,039
Because friends are important...

1303
01:54:15,243 --> 01:54:19,304
...and, well, you're
the only friends we got.

1304
01:54:19,881 --> 01:54:21,178
Bye.
