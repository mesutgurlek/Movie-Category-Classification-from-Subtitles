he didn't predict

is that we'd create

163
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,919
to discuss these issues

164
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,221
only within
our own circles.

165
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,563
We have to go
out into the world.

166
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,982
We have to break
into other people's circles,

167
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,718
uh, let others know
the truth

JIM: What is it specifically
that you hope to achieve?

00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,594
They need to know
that I know.

171
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,396
Alone, as one man,
I'm no threat,

172
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,199
but what I am
is an idea.

173
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:05,003
What I am is
the embodiment of an idea,

174
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,238
and if it occurred
to me,

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,008
it will eventually occur
to other people as well,

176
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,244
and then there'll be
two people on the street
with megaphones.

177
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,914
Then there'll be
10 people on the street
with megaphones.

178
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,849
Then there'll be

not even listening?

Are you listening?

181
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,096
What, you mean,
me personally? Am I--

182
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,664
Yes!
That's what matters,

183

World War I, 1913.

294
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,679
It's a fact that
Woodrow Wilson's senior advisor,

00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,049
Edward House, deliberately
sent a passenger ship,

into German-controlled waters

297

with the intention
that it be hit by a U-boat,

which it was,

299

into World War I.

and that's what brings the U.S.
into the Vietnam conflict.

305

In 2005, the NSA releases

in isolation,

it's unbelievable to think

that we could be told
such a huge lie,

311
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,889
but if you look at
the broad picture of history,

312
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,225
you can see
that staging attacks

313
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:10,661
against one's own country
is one of the oldest

one of his blue thumbtacks
into the chart,

362
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,899
it's because he was

Go ahead, yeah.
Please, can we do this?

Whether you agreed
with the pattern that he saw,

00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,144
it doesn't matter.
The point is, he always had one.

about the belief

00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,823
in conspiracy theories

378
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:02,093
is that you can't
disprove them.

379
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:08,766
You can't prove that
there aren't secret masters

and manipulate us.

will often

that can't be disproved.

This allows them to have
the delusion go on indefinitely.

Now, I'm not saying
that all people

theories are schizophrenics.

However, if the delusion
goes unchecked,

on these string of dates, right?

All of which take place
before major world events,

This got the ball rolling.

All of Terrance's dates
refer to specific meetings
of the Tarsus Club,

421
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:33,577
all of which take place
right before major world events.

That's what the dates are.

00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:48,138
You know, it's like
sometimes I just feel like

480
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,443
just...start over.

481
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,781
Get away from
this whole fucked-up world.

482
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:11,328
Last night, Aaron
got an email, um, from someone

483
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,164
saying that
he wanted to meet

484
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,567
on the conspiracy
chat room site.

485
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,103
Said we can talk
about Murray Chance

486
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,405
and the Tarsus Club.

487
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:25,909
The thing is that Aaron
in what he posted online

488
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,678
never mentioned
Murray Chance.

489
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,217
So we'll see.

511

[ voice
electronically altered ]
I was doing a bio piece

512
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,200
on Murray Chance
and his family,

513
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:33,604
and quite by accident,
I stumbled on the fact

514
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:36,073
that the Chance family
going back generations

515
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:38,342
had attended
this annual retreat

516
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:41,178
held by an organization
called the Tarsus Club.

517
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,547
Now, I was told
that these meetings

518
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:47,017
were not about setting
policy or agenda.

519
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,919
But the more
I looked into them,

520
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,722
the more I realized
this couldn't be further
from the truth.

521
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,857
Very real
and tangible shifts

522
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:57,528
in world financial markets,
in foreign policy,

523
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,531
and even in
so-called random events,

524
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,566
coincided
with these retreats.

525
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:05,002
JIM: But in your article,
you make it sound

526
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:08,372
like it's just a group
of rich white men

527
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,773
getting together
and having a good time.

528
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:12,543
It doesn't seem really
all that nefarious.

529
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:15,746
That's because when
my editor at <i>Time</i> Magazine

530
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:17,915
found out
what I was reporting on,

531
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,216
he butchered the article.

532
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:21,585
JIM: Then why not get rid
of the article entirely?

533
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:24,087
Well, it's in the group's
best interest to have

534
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,557
a little bit of information
out there about themselves.

535
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,959
A total media blackout
is a void

536
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:32,129
just asking to be filled
by fertile imaginations.

537
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,164
I wouldn't be surprised that,
in the very near future,

538
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,502
that Tarsus purposely
lets a little bit
of information out there--

539
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,471
um, news story,
press release,

540
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:44,408
something that
has the appearance
of being objective,

541
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,643
but has been
engineered by them.

542
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:49,813
JIM: So that they can
control the message?

543
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,282
And it also acts
as a little bit of a warning.

544
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:55,519
You know, they allow you
to get a glimpse
of how powerful they are.

545
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,422
AARON:
A warning for who?

546
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,023
People like yourself.

547
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,495
People who have
discovered the truth.

548
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,002
AARON: Did this man
ever contact you

549
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,604
about the Tarsus Club?

550
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,840
Couldn't honestly say.

551
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,676
But your friend
may have tried to contact me.

552
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,545
But you have to understand
that my article

553
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,780
is the only mainstream
document out there

554
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:27,918
that people can find
actual information of Tarsus.

555
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,020
But the truth is,
most of these guys
have monikers

556
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,556
and they're far
too suspicious ever to meet.

557
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,424
JIM: So where is
all of this leading?

558
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,859
What is it specifically

559
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:40,097
that the Tarsus
organization is after?

560
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:45,469
Three words:
new world order.

561
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,006
We have before us
the opportunity

562
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:51,008
to forge for ourselves

563
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,444
and for future generations
a new world order,

564
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,713
a world
where the rule of law,

565
00:31:56,715 --> 00:32:00,951
not the law of the jungle,
governs the conduct of nations.

566
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:04,388
When we are successful,
and we will be,

567
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,524
we have a real chance
at this new world order.

568
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:10,160
A blueprint
of a one-world government,

569
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:14,231
a single organization
that controls every nation

570
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:17,067
and every person
on this planet.

Adolf Hitler, Gorbachev,

572
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:24,808
George Soros,
Herbert Walker Bush.

573
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,512
Um, all these people have
at some point or another

574
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,714
called for
a new world order.

575
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:34,251
A new world order
is likely to emerge

576
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:37,020
from the current
economic crisis.

577
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,789
It's about the future
of the whole region.

578
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,858
It's about the future of Europe
and a new world order.

579
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,827
I think a new world order
is emerging,

580
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,462
and, with it,
the foundations

581
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,899

I think when Aaron's apartment

was burglarized,
a line had been crossed.

At least a line had been
crossed in Aaron's mind.

633
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,968
The police didn't find
any evidence

634
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,304
to suggest that it was anything
other than common thieves.

635
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,441
They certainly didn't find

to the film
that they were making.

638
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,814
But I think at that point,

639
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,183
it almost didn't

00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,356
CAMERAMAN: Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

651
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,824
No, I'm good.

652
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:40,063
You know,
it was one thing

653
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:43,600
when we were
filming Terrance.

654
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,235
You know, that was--

655
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,170
That was
something strange,
and it was out there,

656
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:51,308
but I could
leave it out there.

657
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,149
Now it's
followed me home.

658
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,154
JIM: I just want to go
back over a few things

659
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:06,823
that we discussed
uh, last time we met.

660
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:10,727
I mean, how do you
quantify the decision of...

661
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,196
Why doesn't anyone
ever try to do anything
about these people?

662
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:17,167
You know,
like, uh, expose
them, uh, something?

663
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,804
What is it
that really happens
at these things?

664
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:23,340
You wrote, um,
"The drinking
and deal-making

665
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,575

when the attendees
participate

666
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,377
in the ritual hunting
and slaughter
of the bull."

667
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,712
What's that about?

668
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:29,846
MARK: [ voice altered ]
The ritual.

669
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:32,115
The ritual is based

670
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:35,385
on an ancient and highly secret
set of beliefs.

671
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,487
Which are what?

672
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,490
The worship of Mithras.

673
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:49,766
The cult of Mithras
was both an association

674
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,270
and a religious cult

675
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:58,908
focused on the worship
of this god, Mithras.

676
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,012
Mithras was a deity
that first appeared in Persia

677
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,913
over 4,000 years ago.

678
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,883
Now, according to the myth,

679
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,286
he was born
on the 25th of December.

680
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:12,289
He died and was resurrected
three days later.

681
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,091
Bear in mind,
this was 2,000 years

682
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,327
before the birth of Christ.

683
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,395
Many scholars believe

684
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:21,898
that this is the basis
of Christianity.

685
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,167
Mithraic caves,
where they secretly worshipped,

686
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:27,003
have been discovered throughout
the former Roman Empire

687
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:30,040
from, um, Scotland
to Russia,

688
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:32,876
from the Sahara Desert
to the heart of India.

689
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:37,547
This was essentially the world's
first truly secret society.

690
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,820
So, yes,
there probably were
quite a few Mithraists

691
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:47,857
who had the ear
of quite powerful people.

692
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:57,267
I don't know about, uh,
modern secret societies
with wide agendas.

693
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:00,170
Again, if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

hunting and killing
the bull

696
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,078
is to the Mithraics

697
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,480
what the Crucifixion
was to the Christians.

698
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:14,317
It is the central image
of their belief system.

699
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,091
Would you like to see
the Mithraic secret handshake?

700
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,326
Just do what I do.

701
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,395
Follow my movements
exactly, okay?

702
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,529
Okay.

703
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,636
It's a regular handshake.

704
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,339
The custom that
we have of shaking
our friends' hands

705
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,607
when we meet them
on the street

706
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,209
or when we seal
a business deal

707
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,478
comes directly from
the secret handshake
of the Mithraics.

708
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,647
The first-ever depiction
of people shaking hands
in human history

709
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,417
comes
from a 4,000-year-old
carving of Mithras

I really don't think
that Jim's mind

that the world

It's all true.

That there are these people
that secretly run things.

814

Then they've
always run things, okay?

in a free and open society.

890
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:30,199
And we are as a people

inherently and historically
opposed to secret societies,

to secret oaths,
and to secret proceedings.

893
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:41,210
For we are opposed

by a monolithic
and ruthless conspiracy

895
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,651
that relies primarily
on covert means

896
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:51,053
for expanding
its sphere of influence,

897
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:54,757

01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:17,425
Unfortunately, with
the rise of the Internet,

1127
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:19,293
there's a dark side
to globalization.

1128
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:22,363
Essentially, that is
that anyone with a crazy idea

1129
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:25,933
can communicate it
to millions of people
like a virus.

1130
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:28,402
And the Tarsus Club has been
the target of these viruses,

1131
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:31,405
including these
crazy conspiracy theories.

1132
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:32,573
Well, actually,
it's become something

1133
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:35,476
of a cottage industry,
I think,

1134
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,178
within
conspiracy circles

1135
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,647
to break in
to Tarsus meetings.

1136
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:42,650
In fact, we've grown
so accustomed to it
over the years

1137
01:18:42,652 --> 01:18:46,320
that, uh,
it's almost become
part of the ritual

1138
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:49,457
to scare people off
who try to break in.

1139
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:54,128
JIM: I was
taken to a back room.

1140
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:57,331
I was told
to let them know

1141
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,600
where the rendezvous point
was with Aaron.

1142
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:02,536
We were questioned
for a very long time,

1143
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:06,841
but, uh, eventually
security let us go.

1144
01:19:06,843 --> 01:19:08,542
Even after Aaron realized

1145
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:11,512
that they were
just scaring him,

1146
01:19:11,514 --> 01:19:14,315
he was still very upset.

1147
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:19,520
I think Aaron
had been traumatized
by what had happened.

1148
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:21,522
That was the last time
I saw him.

1149
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:29,730
JENSEN:
To the people screaming
about conspiracy...

1150
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,336
I'll let them in
on a little secret.

1151
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:37,805
It's true.

1152
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:41,242
Global leaders do
get together and collaborate.

1153
01:19:41,244 --> 01:19:44,445
Many of them, including
my boss, Murray Chance,

1154
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:47,414
are working hard
to create a new world

1155
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,250
where all nations
and all people

1156
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:52,553
can come together
in one global community.

1157
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,890
That's what it's all about,

1158
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:59,894
the creation
of a single global community.

1159
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,797
And if
that's a conspiracy...

1160
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,538
If that's a conspiracy,
well, then, yes, we're guilty.

1161
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,708
Hi, bud.

1162
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,447
NICOLE:
Just for the record,

1163
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:23,551
where do you think
Aaron went?

1164
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,590
JIM:
I guess he ended up...

1165
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:37,031
in the same place
Terrance did, didn't he?

1166
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,872
And I just hope
wherever they are,

1167
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:46,574
they both feel free.

1168
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:03,524
[ ominous music ]

1169
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,776
[ discordant horns blowing ]
