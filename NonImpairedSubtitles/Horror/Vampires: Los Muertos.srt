1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,918
Little party, mister?

2
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:37,216
Baby, you passed the audition.

3
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:39,385
Hey! Slow down!

4
00:01:39,552 --> 00:01:41,595
lt's $50 straight up.

5
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:44,098
You want more, it costs more.

6
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:47,852
And l don't do no audition.

7
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,980
Scream and it's over.

8
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,945
Hey, ba--

9
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,949
lf l pull this trigger...

10
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:04,785
...l bet it's gonna hurt you
really bad.

11
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:07,580
What do you think?

12
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,708
Now, razor boy...

13
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:15,129
...why don't you just move away,
nice and slow.

14
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:30,686
Jesus.

15
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:35,733
Thanks, mister. You saved my life.

16
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:39,862
-What can l do for you?
-Smile, sister.

17
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,807
-Derek?
-Hey, man.

18
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:35,436
Some anonymous somebody
wants to bankroll a unit.

19
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:38,814
A whole unit for something
nobody believes in?

20
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:41,692
-Must be the Catholics.
-Yeah, maybe.

21
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:44,403
Bunch of them got wiped out
years ago.

22
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,906
-So what's the gig?
-North Mexico.

23
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:48,574
Sucker count's way up.

24
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:53,287
Client wants a strike so they don't
move up to San Diego or Tucson.

25
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:54,955
Who's the client?

26
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:58,250
Anonymous means
anonymous, Derek.

27
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,920
Aw, hell, Catholics, feds, Hindus....

28
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:05,758
-As long as they pay, who cares?
-Why are we getting all this action?

29
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:10,388
-Big guys are mostly dead.
-Since they stick their necks out.

30
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:14,642
-I work alone.
-It won't happen unless it's a team.

31
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,855
They don't want cowboys, they want
hunters. It's gotta be a unit.

32
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:23,150
There was a priest who
survived that massacre.

33
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:26,362
You might wanna build your team
around him.

34
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:52,740
-Who are you?
-Why don't you ask them?

35
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:56,285
-They know my pulse, blood type--
-l apologize.

36
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:59,455
-We had to make sure you were--
-Human?

37
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:04,418
My name's Derek Bliss.
l'm looking for Father Adam Guiteau.

38
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:09,715
You've nothing to fear f rom me.
He's hiding here. l can keep a secret.

39
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:12,176
Have l found him?

40
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:16,389
When?

41
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:17,973
-Last month.
-How?

42
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,893
-How is not important.
-How is important.

43
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,021
You're a hunter?
Then you know the life.

44
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:27,566
-You're a hunter?
-l dabbled when l was younger...

45
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,111
...and backed away.

46
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,365
You should stay the night.
There's nowhere else nearby.

47
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:37,702
Perhaps l can help in some way.

48
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:49,171
lt's all right to talk.

49
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,559
You saw something!

50
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,936
Hallucination. lt was just--

51
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,189
-Real for a second?
-Yeah.

52
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:10,609
One of them is trying
to link with you.

53
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:16,198
You must resist with all your power,
or it will destroy you.

54
00:09:51,377 --> 00:09:53,295
This one's dead.

55
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:56,048
This one's crazy.

56
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:58,050
These two are good.

57
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:03,639
The others, never heard about them.
Stay small. Fewer targets.

58
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,725
You sure you won't come?

59
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:08,769
Sorry. lf you return,
l'll bless the team.

60
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:14,275
Thanks, Padre, but l can pick that up
along the way.

61
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:40,134
Lester Pomani?

62
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,012
Hello?

63
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:16,170
Brody, listen.

64
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:19,048
That priest you sent me to see? Dead.

65
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:21,759
The first two guys on the list? Dead.

66
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:26,305
I took those names out of my
Rolodex. Nobody else ever saw them.

67
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:29,475
-Then how did the bogeys know?
-Try one more.

68
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:34,814
I'll make some calls and see
who I can recruit. Just one more?

69
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:38,109
l'm looking for Augie Tilton.

70
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:43,656
l know who did it!

71
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:48,828
They run in the church.

72
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,000
-Who's gonna help me? Who's gonna--?
-Hey, buddy, slow down a minute.

73
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,128
l know some things
about the kids in there.

74
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:58,337
Like what?

75
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,591
Like maybe you'd better wait
till the sun comes up.

76
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:56,187
Just sit tight.

77
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:59,315
Hey, maybe you should
just talk to them.

78
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:02,610
-What's your name?
-Sancho.

79
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:06,781
Sancho, your f riend was doing
some special undercover work.

80
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,616
l'm finishing the job.

81
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,118
-Who are you?
-The Lone Ranger.

82
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:15,790
-Then l'm Tonto. l'm going too.
-No, listen to me. lt's dangerous.

83
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,710
-There's more than one in there.
-Then you need help.

84
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:26,050
All right, listen.

85
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:30,554
You can watch my back and stand
by me, but do what l say.

86
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:35,810
No matter what happens,
don't you panic, don't run. Got that?

87
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,478
Yeah. Got it.

88
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:40,731
Twenty bucks.

89
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:44,360
My mama needs the money.

90
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:28,779
Your buddy may have been
their first kill.

91
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:32,033
They might not know what they are yet.

92
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:35,745
Just don't let them bite
or scratch you, okay?

93
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:19,789
Pull!

94
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:38,182
-That's one down, two to go.
-Jesus Christ.

95
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:42,812
You know, these old Dracula movies,
l always thought, what if--?

96
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,447
Kid, put it in the bag.
Go to the light!

97
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:32,695
This is how you make a living?

98
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:36,365
-l guess you'd say that.
-The money good?

99
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:39,869
Not bad. lf you did it every day,
you'd go crazy.

100
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:42,997
My mama needs the money real bad.

101
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:46,417
-How old are you, kid?
-Eighteen.

102
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,754
-l don't hire guys that lie.
-l'm going on 16.

103
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,506
-Come see me in a few years.
-Come on--

104
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:57,011
Look, you did a great job.

105
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:00,097
Appreciate the help. Go on.

106
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:02,975
-Appreciate the help, yeah.
-Hey!

107
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:13,319
Brody, what if the bogeys are...

108
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:16,155
-...you know, linking up to me?
-Come on!

109
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:17,782
Yeah, but what if?

110
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:20,910
That'd mean it's all over,
wouldn't it?

111
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:27,291
You can sit anywhere, hon.

112
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,461
l'm looking for a Jesse Brooks.

113
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:34,507
-Hey! Hotshot.
-Yeah?

114
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:37,259
With you in a couple.

115
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:39,428
-Coffee?
-Yeah, please.

116
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:48,479
Big sigh. Lot of weight.

117
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:54,443
-Business or domestic?
-Business.

118
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:56,195
Temp or perm?

119
00:17:57,154 --> 00:17:59,323
Temp or perm?

120
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:02,785
-Perm, l guess.
-Legal or illegal?

121
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:07,581
-To tell you the truth, l don't know.
-All right.

122
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:11,627
-Life or death? l'm Zoey, by the way.
-l'm Derek.

123
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:15,172
-l already told you. lt's perm.
-So you did.

124
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:17,675
Now, Derek...

125
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:20,886
...would that be actual death...

126
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:24,765
...or un-death?

127
00:18:31,313 --> 00:18:34,275
Would you ex cuse me for a minute?

128
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,008
Oh, shit.

129
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:05,848
Cold as a corpse.

130
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:10,144
Damn. She's cute too.

131
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:14,542
Jesse!

132
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,673
-What are you gonna do, just shoot me?
-Got a reason l shouldn't?

133
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,261
-Why are you out in the daylight?
-You think l did all that.

134
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:10,014
Hey, l ran, just like you did.

135
00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:14,769
Why in the f uck are you standing
here in broad daylight?

136
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:16,937
That requires an explanation.

137
00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:22,151
Can we go somewhere else, preferably
with some shade and maybe a Coke?

138
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:25,946
-Here's your f ucking shade. Get in!
-Jesus Christ!

139
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:28,407
You are a real jerk.

140
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:32,953
Pointing guns at people?
Somebody could get hurt, you know.

141
00:21:33,454 --> 00:21:35,498
-Here's your Coke.
-lt's hot!

142
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:40,836
-Talk to me, damn it. You got bit.
-Not how you think. lt was during sex.

143
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:44,382
-l thought he was just carried away.
-He bit you?

144
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:48,719
-Made blood come. Freaked me out.
-l don't believe a word.

145
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:52,473
Look, when l got bit,
l went directly to Mexico City.

146
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,520
Guy in an AlDS clinic ran a bunch
of tests. He couldn't identify it.

147
00:21:57,687 --> 00:22:01,232
He slipped me an experimental drug
and it worked.

148
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:04,235
l take it daily.
The infection's in check.

149
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:06,862
-How long?
-lt's been almost a year.

150
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:10,324
l have symptoms.

151
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:12,284
l crave red meat.

152
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:14,954
l get cranky with too much sunshine.

153
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:18,457
-Sometimes l see stuff.
-What kind of stuff?

154
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,919
Flashes, like dreams,
only l'm awake...

155
00:22:22,128 --> 00:22:24,588
...and it feels like they're real.

156
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:27,925
l saw you and some guy
with a razor.

157
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,554
Then l saw you yesterday in a church.

158
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:37,935
lt was no surprise at all when
you walked in that coffee shop.

159
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:39,645
-ls it always me?
-No.

160
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:42,857
The night before last
it was this monastery.

161
00:22:43,024 --> 00:22:46,027
Priests all in robes.

162
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:47,463
My God.

163
00:24:09,276 --> 00:24:13,864
They dragged them out here
and stacked them up like firewood.

164
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:19,370
-lt was an all-night feeding party.
-What about your f riend?

165
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:33,050
They destroyed us.

166
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:36,470
Look.

167
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,517
Look what they've done.

168
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:50,901
-She came with several others.
-She? Their master's a woman?

169
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:57,742
You know she's death,
yet you want to give in.

170
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,996
l was buying supplies.
l returned just before dawn...

171
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:05,958
...but ran out of gas on the road.
l saw people coming.

172
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,420
l sensed something was wrong,
so l hid.

173
00:25:09,754 --> 00:25:12,173
Then she passed.

174
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:13,841
l was lucky.

175
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:18,346
She didn't bother with me
because she had what she came for.

176
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:21,974
The history of my church
holds some ugly secrets.

177
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:26,687
One secret is an ancient battle cross.
The Black Cross of Berzier.

178
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:30,816
Vampires believe it gives
the power to walk in daylight.

179
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:33,611
Reverse ex orcism.
Every sucker's dream.

180
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:37,573
There's no secrets.
To civilians it's like mumbo jumbo.

181
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:40,910
You know differently, don't you?

182
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,536
lt's adding up.

183
00:25:42,703 --> 00:25:46,207
Father Adam brings the cross
here because it's safe.

184
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,127
lt was, until his new f riend comes.
She needed it.

185
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:53,881
She needed the blood of a slayer.
Now she's got both.

186
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:57,009
-What slayer?
-l've been recruiting hunters.

187
00:25:57,176 --> 00:26:01,472
The vampire gets there just before me.
These were good hunters.

188
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:06,394
They put up a fight, until the coffee
shop with Jesse Brooks.

189
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,648
That's how it works, isn't it?
l expose you and hand her...

190
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:14,777
-...candidates for a party.
-You can't blame yourself.

191
00:26:14,944 --> 00:26:18,989
-Somebody has to go after her.
-Let me show you something.

192
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,208
Adam knew there would be more hunting.

193
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,670
He worked on this in his spare time.

194
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:40,177
lt's all ready to go.

195
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:47,810
-You're a hunter?
-l've hunted.

196
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:50,980
-l know it's not the same--
-This is suicide.

197
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,776
The vampire didn't attack until
you left. ls she af raid of you?

198
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:59,071
At the restaurant,
she attacked when you left.

199
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:02,366
-She hesitates around you.
-lt's a bad theory.

200
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,411
-Think small.
-How small? You and me?

201
00:27:05,578 --> 00:27:08,205
lf the girl goes off her drugs...

202
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:12,585
...she'll turn on us
in a second, guaranteed.

203
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:15,838
First off, l'm a woman, not a girl.

204
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:19,467
l don't intend on becoming a vampire.

205
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:24,055
l'm fighting my condition with drugs,
and l have an ample supply.

206
00:27:24,221 --> 00:27:26,766
When a cure is found, l'll be normal.

207
00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:33,356
So if you want my help, you can ask
nicely with a little f ucking respect.

208
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:39,195
Maybe she can shoot a crossbow.

209
00:27:39,362 --> 00:27:44,158
Maybe you should ask her very nicely,
with a little f ucking respect.

210
00:27:46,452 --> 00:27:48,329
l'll be back.

211
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:06,764
-What are you doing here?
-Following you.

212
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:09,433
-How?
-My dirt bike.

213
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:14,855
-So you don't think l run away.
-What the hell is this?

214
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:20,861
'' Permission for my son, Sancho,
to have a job on your hunt''?

215
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:22,822
Read the rest.

216
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:26,867
'' He got good grades.
School out in three week.

217
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:29,620
He not flunk nothing.'' Oh, man.

218
00:28:30,204 --> 00:28:32,289
Come on.

219
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,877
Zoey, Father Rodrigo, meet Sancho,
the fearless vampire killer.

220
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:42,591
-There you have it. Team Bliss.
-Derek, listen--

221
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,346
You listen. l start a search,
and everyone l look for ends up dead.

222
00:28:47,513 --> 00:28:52,268
Then suckers wipe this place out.
And we're supposed to go after them?

223
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:56,188
With what? A teenaged dropout
f rom junior high school?

224
00:28:56,355 --> 00:28:59,608
A woman who could
turn on me at any moment?

225
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:03,529
A man of the cloth who's maybe hunted
once in his life?

226
00:29:04,363 --> 00:29:07,825
And me, a son of a bitch
who'd rather be surfing.

227
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:09,785
This ain't gonna work.

228
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,217
Sometimes you need
less than you think.

229
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:29,096
You need less ammo, less courage.

230
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:32,641
A loaf of bread, a couple of fish.

231
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:37,188
When it's all said and done,
there's no other choice, huh?

232
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:55,748
-l got the package. What's in it?
-Goodies. A big advance...

233
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:59,001
...and papers turning you
into an archaeologist.

234
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,253
Why an archaeologist?

235
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,592
Mexican government doesn't recognize
vampire slayer as an occupation.

236
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,055
-What's wrong with them?
-By the way, I found you some help.

237
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:15,142
A guy named Ray from Memphis.
Black dude, tough as nails.

238
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:18,771
Due in tonight, bus out of Tucson.

239
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:33,202
You hear me okay?

240
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:34,870
Loud and clear.

241
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:50,803
-What are we looking for?
-A big, tall black guy.

242
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:00,688
We got a no-show.

243
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:13,034
Hold it. l got a sucker.

244
00:31:14,076 --> 00:31:17,580
You're five seconds away
if l need you, so watch me.

245
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:29,759
Hey, man, you got a light?

246
00:31:32,595 --> 00:31:35,348
Thought for sure you'd be a smoker.

247
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:38,517
Any chance you're f rom Memphis?

248
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:42,438
Lousy part of town
to get what you came for.

249
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:45,816
You a mind reader?
Like you know shit about me.

250
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:49,153
No offense. l know a rookie
when l see one.

251
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:53,699
-You're new at this, ain't you?
-You trying to sell something?

252
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:58,788
l just remember when the thirst
kicked in. Worse than drugs.

253
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:00,998
Worse than smoking.

254
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:02,833
We're on the same side!

255
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:08,714
Drive a guy crazy, all these civilians
running around. lt drove me crazy.

256
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:10,675
All that...

257
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:12,677
...warm blood.

258
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:27,692
Swear to God, you can smell it.

259
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:31,654
-Shit, yeah.
-They smile, they talk to you.

260
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:35,825
But after a while all you hear
is a pulse.

261
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:38,494
Just beating away.

262
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:42,456
And guess what, smart-ass?

263
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,210
l can hear yours.

264
00:33:03,686 --> 00:33:04,770
Good shot.

265
00:33:04,937 --> 00:33:09,108
Yeah. l had a feeling about that punk
all the way down here.

266
00:33:09,275 --> 00:33:11,819
-So you're f rom Memphis.
-Ray Collins.

267
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:14,530
-Derek Bliss.
-Cool to meet you.

268
00:33:14,697 --> 00:33:17,158
What stops a bogey that cold?

269
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:21,537
Smith & Wesson, 12-gauge.
The real secret's the shells.

270
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:25,082
Hand-turned teakwood.
Fill them up with lead.

271
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:28,169
Like a deer slug. Packs a wallop.

272
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:32,798
That hunk of wood goes right inside,
just stays right there.

273
00:33:33,257 --> 00:33:36,886
Of course, you still gotta
do the usual, you know.

274
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,393
What's he doing?

275
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:50,441
Brody said you had a big job.

276
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:54,403
Bring along plenty of those slugs?

277
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,821
Oh, yeah.

278
00:33:55,988 --> 00:33:59,784
What you guys doing?
ls this real, or what?

279
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:11,379
lt's about time we head out.

280
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:17,426
-Got plenty of bloodsuckers in Memphis?
-Plenty everywhere, far as l can tell.

281
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:08,561
-Boss, we need to make a pit stop!
-lt's Zoey! She's sick!

282
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:15,109
lt's her.

283
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,492
-What are you seeing?
-l see the--

284
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:27,329
The cook f rom the coffee shop.

285
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:32,752
There's a priest, with blood.

286
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,879
The ceremony.

287
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:37,006
And the cross.

288
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:07,703
The cook is dead...

289
00:36:08,621 --> 00:36:11,791
...and so is the priest.

290
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,294
And the vampire, is she still alive?

291
00:36:16,337 --> 00:36:19,090
-Outside, in the daylight?
-No.

292
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:22,385
Light still hurts.

293
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:29,058
What? That's good, isn't it?

294
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:33,646
-l thought the sun might finish her.
-At least the ritual failed.

295
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:37,900
-Something l need to know?
-lt's daylight now. You mind?

296
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:49,286
-Hey, if you're keeping a secret--
-The things that l keep to myself...

297
00:36:49,453 --> 00:36:52,248
...will only help us.

298
00:36:56,502 --> 00:36:58,170
Concentrate, Zoey.

299
00:37:01,382 --> 00:37:02,842
Okay. Here.

300
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,511
l think they're here.

301
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,762
Serena.

302
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:11,058
There's an old sugar mill nearby,
built on top of some ruins.

303
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:16,272
Adam told me about it.
Perfect spot for a colony, he said.

304
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:39,670
-How often?
-Once a day, two pills.

305
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:42,340
Another at night if l can't sleep.

306
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:44,133
You got plenty?

307
00:37:44,383 --> 00:37:46,761
-A couple months' worth.
-Then what?

308
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:49,972
Then Mexico City again.

309
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,690
lt was so strong.

310
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:02,610
Not like the other times.

311
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:06,238
lt was like she was stalking me.

312
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:08,657
Look, l gotta ask you...

313
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:12,203
-...did she bite you or something?
-She tried to.

314
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:17,249
At the coffee shop she tasted me.
But something made her stop.

315
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:20,670
Maybe it was the medicine.

316
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:33,849
-This is it?
-Unless someone wants to drive.

317
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:35,935
-No, let's stop.
-l'm hungry.

318
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:40,773
Let's keep it simple. l want everybody
back in here before dark.

319
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,402
Ex cuse me, but ain't no
way l'm sleeping in this.

320
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,987
-You get used to it.
-l was in the Navy.

321
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:50,116
Even on a ship you got more room
than that.

322
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:52,410
l get nervous in tight spaces.

323
00:38:52,576 --> 00:38:55,788
l might wake up in the night
and shoot somebody.

324
00:38:56,038 --> 00:38:59,542
You don't wanna face
a vampire at night.

325
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:04,505
All due respect, but you ain't
been working with Miss Piggy.

326
00:39:04,672 --> 00:39:08,259
Granted, it may take one, two,
even three rounds.

327
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:12,471
When she speaks, even the coldest
of the cold have to listen.

328
00:39:18,477 --> 00:39:20,104
No ex ceptions.

329
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:26,318
Believe me, little brother,
them slugs never lie.

330
00:39:26,485 --> 00:39:30,906
All right, get your beauty rest.
But you gotta drive first shift.

331
00:39:31,157 --> 00:39:32,658
You got it, boss.

332
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:30,651
Hey, honey, what's the matter?

333
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:36,157
What's the matter, honey?

334
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,160
Come on over here and talk to Ray.

335
00:41:39,326 --> 00:41:41,328
Somebody do something to you?

336
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:44,957
l won't hurt you. Come on.

337
00:41:47,043 --> 00:41:48,627
Sit down.

338
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:58,679
You sure are beautif ul.

339
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,602
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

340
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:06,312
Slow down now, darling.

341
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:09,523
You sure are a hot little tamale.

342
00:42:14,904 --> 00:42:19,617
Don't let your hands write no checks
your body don't wanna cash now.

343
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:22,536
Whoa, whoa. Slow down now.

344
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,826
Are you feeling okay?

345
00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:29,205
Yeah. l'll be fine. l'm all right.

346
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:32,875
We'll make it tomorrow morning
if we drive through.

347
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:39,048
-Long way to go if Zoey's wrong.
-She's not wrong. Can't you feel it?

348
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:43,052
-l don't feel anything but uneasy.
-Hey, boss.

349
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,348
What do you say we gas up and
get cool drinks for everybody?

350
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:56,542
That's a new one on me.

351
00:45:56,709 --> 00:46:00,588
l'd have passed here a hundred
times and l'd never know.

352
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:03,341
All right, Memphis. Deep as you can.

353
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:29,742
All right, that's one down.

354
00:46:30,618 --> 00:46:34,747
They're not here to feed.
They're just amusing themselves.

355
00:46:34,914 --> 00:46:38,250
But l do think something else
is going on here.

356
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:42,880
Scare tactics? Maybe she was
counting on us stopping here.

357
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:44,799
Zoey.

358
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:47,968
Where is she?

359
00:46:53,057 --> 00:46:56,519
-Nothing. Blank slate.
-Son of a bitch!

360
00:46:57,853 --> 00:47:02,066
We got a flat tire. l must've
rolled over a nail or something.

361
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:01,208
Say anything about this place?

362
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:03,669
Present day, not much.

363
00:48:04,337 --> 00:48:06,213
Poor farming community.

364
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,550
Different story in the 1200s.
Boom town.

365
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:12,303
Toltec culture was great,
but brutal.

366
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,722
There. lt's there.

367
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:51,717
-She's in there. They all are.
-Let's go in.

368
00:48:51,926 --> 00:48:53,886
No, not yet.

369
00:48:54,053 --> 00:48:57,640
Let's go to the village
and see what we can find out.

370
00:49:43,728 --> 00:49:45,438
Well, where's everybody?

371
00:49:45,604 --> 00:49:47,023
They're watching.

372
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,032
The norteños have come
to kill the devils of the night.

373
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,201
l saw it in a dream.

374
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:00,786
ls it true?

375
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:04,165
We have come to try.

376
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:14,091
Today is Día de los Muertos.
Day of the Dead.

377
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,636
But your timing is very good. Carlo!

378
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:26,270
A beautif ul girl, hungry, homeless...

379
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:29,523
...was taken in by a family
outside of town.

380
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,068
The family became strange.

381
00:50:32,234 --> 00:50:34,445
The light left their eyes.

382
00:50:34,612 --> 00:50:36,030
They disappeared.

383
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:38,532
Soon, others did too.

384
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:42,703
lt was said they went to the ruins
and lived underground.

385
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:48,292
People saw them at night drinking
the blood of those not yet afflicted.

386
00:50:48,918 --> 00:50:51,545
This was once a thriving place.

387
00:50:51,754 --> 00:50:56,634
Now, people cower in beds
while the devils walk the streets.

388
00:50:56,801 --> 00:51:00,846
Two days ago, our priest disappeared.

389
00:51:01,013 --> 00:51:03,766
Last night the church was burned.

390
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:06,602
The police never came around
very much.

391
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:09,105
Now, they don't come around
at all.

392
00:51:51,022 --> 00:51:52,773
l gotta find a doctor.

393
00:51:52,982 --> 00:51:55,985
l am af raid the doctor disappeared.

394
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:58,404
Did he have an office?

395
00:51:59,697 --> 00:52:01,240
ln here.

396
00:52:05,202 --> 00:52:09,415
-Painkillers, antibiotics. Not much.
-We gotta find something.

397
00:52:09,582 --> 00:52:11,751
lt works. l need a line out.

398
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:14,962
How long will it take
to ship her drugs here?

399
00:52:15,129 --> 00:52:18,382
Three, four days, five.
A week, maybe more.

400
00:52:18,591 --> 00:52:22,136
lf we leave now, we'd be there
in a day and a half.

401
00:52:22,345 --> 00:52:24,930
Two days there, two back. A week.

402
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:28,934
They don't have a week.
They lose people every night.

403
00:52:29,143 --> 00:52:31,729
There's a bus today to Mexico City.

404
00:52:31,896 --> 00:52:33,647
l'll take it.

405
00:53:38,921 --> 00:53:41,173
l could go with you.

406
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,176
Stay here. Do what you came to do.

407
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:48,097
The bus will be here soon.

408
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:52,226
Derek, a bus schedule in Mexico
is more like a suggestion.

409
00:53:52,435 --> 00:53:54,103
You know?

410
00:54:06,782 --> 00:54:10,786
Derek says crosses don't
work on vampires anymore.

411
00:54:12,371 --> 00:54:16,584
Maybe the people with the crosses
don't believe anymore.

412
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:49,241
You should eat something.

413
00:54:54,622 --> 00:54:59,251
-You hurt yourself.
-lt's fine. Got it changing the tire.

414
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,475
-Zoey?
-Sorry.

415
00:55:17,061 --> 00:55:19,814
l need to go into the shade.

416
00:55:50,136 --> 00:55:52,972
How did she--?
lt's the middle of the day!

417
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:55,558
-Zoey's medicine.
-How'd she get it?

418
00:55:55,725 --> 00:55:59,645
-All that matters is, where they going?
-The nest.

419
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:29,342
The vampire wants the drug.
She won't harm Zoey.

420
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:32,803
-Till she tells where she got it.
-She won't!

421
00:56:33,012 --> 00:56:36,682
-Face the fact: Zoey might be dead.
-Or worse.

422
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:39,810
l don't care! l'm gonna help her!

423
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:43,564
All right, kid.
Don't get your hopes up.

424
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:03,793
-Okay, let's go in.
-Padre?

425
00:57:05,461 --> 00:57:07,755
There's one last little thing.

426
00:57:13,052 --> 00:57:15,096
Zoey didn't lose her medicine.

427
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,224
She's too caref ul for that.

428
00:57:19,183 --> 00:57:22,728
Somebody went in her
pocketbook and stole it.

429
00:57:22,895 --> 00:57:26,399
l know it wasn't me.
That means it was one of you.

430
00:57:26,607 --> 00:57:28,192
What do you say, Padre?

431
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:33,030
That massacre back at the monastery.
Something you forgot to tell me?

432
00:57:33,948 --> 00:57:36,951
Maybe it's the unlikely suspect
trailing me.

433
00:57:37,118 --> 00:57:39,870
Maybe the bogey's been trailing you.

434
00:57:40,413 --> 00:57:42,748
Or maybe it was about the money.

435
00:57:43,332 --> 00:57:46,627
What do you say?
She slip you a few thou extra?

436
00:57:46,794 --> 00:57:49,714
Look here. l'm a real simple man.

437
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,842
l came down to kill suckers
and get paid.

438
00:57:53,009 --> 00:57:57,346
Anybody looking to throw down on me
is looking to get killed.

439
00:57:57,513 --> 00:57:59,015
What do you say, kid?

440
00:57:59,223 --> 00:58:01,976
Did she get to you?
There's no disgrace.

441
00:58:02,184 --> 00:58:05,771
She's very powerf ul.
lt could happen to anyone.

442
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:10,735
-Get it off your chest, kid. Admit it.
-Son of a bitch.

443
00:58:10,943 --> 00:58:13,571
Tell me the truth. Admit it.

444
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:16,323
-Fuck you.
-Talk to me.

445
00:58:16,532 --> 00:58:18,117
-Fuck you!
-Talk to me!

446
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:41,474
-How did you know?
-l had a dream.

447
00:58:41,682 --> 00:58:45,144
-What if it was wrong?
-Better my mistake than yours.

448
00:58:45,311 --> 00:58:46,937
l'm sorry, kid.

449
00:58:47,104 --> 00:58:49,482
lt could've been anyone of us.

450
00:58:52,651 --> 00:58:55,946
Guess l screwed up big time, boss.

451
00:58:56,238 --> 00:58:59,575
Do what you have to.
l won't hold it against you.

452
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:05,206
She knows you're here.
ln fact, she set it up.

453
00:59:05,414 --> 00:59:06,999
Set it up?

454
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:08,959
-She's the client?
-Yeah.

455
00:59:10,044 --> 00:59:12,546
lt's a simple plan.
Find the cross...

456
00:59:12,755 --> 00:59:15,383
...expose you and the rest of us.

457
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:18,761
She's a smart one.

458
00:59:19,804 --> 00:59:21,472
Boss...

459
00:59:22,556 --> 00:59:26,519
...you haven't lived till you
got head f rom a vampire.

460
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:11,856
The drug wears off quickly,
but it works.

461
01:02:28,409 --> 01:02:30,661
There's a million places to hide.

462
01:02:30,828 --> 01:02:34,540
Slow down. We don't know
how many we're up against.

463
01:02:43,382 --> 01:02:45,009
Look out!

464
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:50,348
Okay, clear!

465
01:04:03,462 --> 01:04:04,922
lt's so quiet.

466
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:09,260
Big mama's waiting to see
if we get tired out.

467
01:04:09,468 --> 01:04:13,014
-Unless the drug wore off.
-l like that theory.

468
01:04:18,436 --> 01:04:20,271
Hey!

469
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,481
-Help!
-Zoey?

470
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:26,736
-l'm out of cable.
-Stay and cover him. You come with me.

471
01:04:26,944 --> 01:04:30,823
-We shouldn't separate.
-Lag behind. Keep us all in sight.

472
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:35,369
Derek!

473
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:42,960
Derek, talk to me!

474
01:04:43,127 --> 01:04:46,797
lt's not a good idea
we get separated this way.

475
01:04:57,516 --> 01:05:00,102
The remote is not working.

476
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:03,189
Sancho!

477
01:05:56,492 --> 01:05:57,702
Stop!

478
01:06:06,752 --> 01:06:09,505
l can give you what you're after.

479
01:06:11,549 --> 01:06:15,803
Not some drug you have to take
every day, but the real thing.

480
01:06:18,347 --> 01:06:20,266
The ritual.

481
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:27,064
Did you think just any priest
could perform it?

482
01:06:29,525 --> 01:06:32,319
l know how it must be done.

483
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:37,533
And l'm also a hunter.

484
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:41,120
Two for the price of one.

485
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,165
-Padre, no.
-lt's best this way.

486
01:06:44,915 --> 01:06:46,751
Why are you so good to me?

487
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:51,922
l have no regard for you, or myself,
only for my f riends.

488
01:06:52,131 --> 01:06:54,884
Something you wouldn't understand.

489
01:06:55,092 --> 01:06:58,429
But if helping you is the cost
of saving them...

490
01:06:59,638 --> 01:07:02,224
...so be it.

491
01:07:10,775 --> 01:07:12,818
Decide, vampire. l don't care.

492
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:17,156
l can dive into this pit and
leave you behind for good.

493
01:07:17,323 --> 01:07:18,949
Stop.

494
01:07:25,164 --> 01:07:27,958
You know a good deal when you see one.

495
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:56,112
Let him go. Just you and me.

496
01:07:56,278 --> 01:07:59,073
No, no, no. Go. lt's okay.

497
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,617
lt's what l want.

498
01:08:53,753 --> 01:08:55,671
There has to be another way.

499
01:08:55,838 --> 01:08:58,632
By morning we're not gonna
recognize her.

500
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,636
The self-control it's taken her
to hold back this long....

501
01:09:02,803 --> 01:09:04,138
l'm sorry.

502
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:13,814
-What is she doing?
-She said to get lost.

503
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:24,033
-You're playing with fire.
-Don't talk. Help.

504
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,286
Help how? What the hell is she saying?

505
01:09:27,495 --> 01:09:30,039
-Take care of the donors.
-Donors?

506
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:49,744
That old truck of yours
still for sale?

507
01:10:50,953 --> 01:10:55,458
lf you give the money to the boy.

508
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:59,253
l think the boy's become a man.

509
01:10:59,795 --> 01:11:01,922
lt's too soon.

510
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:06,469
Show him his way home.

511
01:11:06,677 --> 01:11:08,220
Please?

512
01:12:22,878 --> 01:12:24,255
You're back.

513
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:28,259
Halfway back. About like
where l was when we first met.

514
01:12:28,426 --> 01:12:29,969
l'll take that.

515
01:12:30,136 --> 01:12:32,763
l want you to get back
to Mexico City.

516
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:35,975
No, Derek. You're down to it.
You need me.

517
01:12:36,142 --> 01:12:40,229
lf Rodrigo's got a chance,
l'll infiltrate the ceremony.

518
01:12:40,438 --> 01:12:43,399
-l'll get a shot off.
-She'd hear your heart.

519
01:12:43,649 --> 01:12:47,611
What if l'm infected?
lt'd slow my heartbeat. l'd mix in.

520
01:12:47,778 --> 01:12:51,365
-Don't even think about it.
-l need a f ront row seat.

521
01:12:53,492 --> 01:12:55,286
Lupe.

522
01:12:56,454 --> 01:12:58,748
You got another patient.

523
01:12:58,914 --> 01:13:01,292
This time, we're going in reverse.

524
01:13:56,972 --> 01:13:58,974
You can feel it, can't you?

525
01:14:00,267 --> 01:14:02,770
lt's unbelievable.

526
01:14:02,937 --> 01:14:05,981
Why do you think people
get hooked on drugs?

527
01:14:06,148 --> 01:14:09,193
l didn't know it would be this good.

528
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:17,243
You want me to do this too?

529
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:20,162
No, my f riend.

530
01:14:20,663 --> 01:14:24,792
lf this falls apart,
you're gonna have to kill us.

531
01:14:26,502 --> 01:14:28,170
Me, señor?

532
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:32,925
lf we don't return, Lupe, vámonos.

533
01:14:33,092 --> 01:14:35,511
Go far away f rom here.

534
01:14:42,435 --> 01:14:44,186
Abuelo, we gotta go.

535
01:15:50,378 --> 01:15:52,630
ln the name of the Father...

536
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:55,591
...the Son and the Holy Spirit.

537
01:16:01,222 --> 01:16:03,516
Get that cable as far as you can.

538
01:16:23,869 --> 01:16:25,788
Heed this...

539
01:16:25,996 --> 01:16:28,124
...our earthly wish.

540
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:32,753
That these deeds we do
find favour with the most high.

541
01:16:34,296 --> 01:16:38,551
And both angels and devils...

542
01:16:38,718 --> 01:16:40,845
...here we now are met.

543
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:07,830
One last thing.

544
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:12,293
You're out of luck, vampire.

545
01:17:13,753 --> 01:17:17,381
You assembled every element,
ex cept one.

546
01:17:18,382 --> 01:17:21,010
You forgot to bring a priest.

547
01:17:21,177 --> 01:17:24,305
You can kill me,
but it won't help you.

548
01:17:24,847 --> 01:17:26,307
l'm a hired hand.

549
01:17:26,515 --> 01:17:31,437
l work at the monastery fixing cars
and cutting grass. l'm an impostor.

550
01:17:32,063 --> 01:17:36,734
l saw what you did to the brotherhood.
You destroyed all of them.

551
01:17:36,942 --> 01:17:39,528
l picked up their clothing,
put it on...

552
01:17:39,737 --> 01:17:42,490
...and l vowed l would find you.

553
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,787
lf that's the truth,
you've failed to hurt me.

554
01:17:47,995 --> 01:17:50,206
lf it's a lie...

555
01:17:50,373 --> 01:17:52,708
...you've failed to help yourself.

556
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:28,119
-Let's go.
-l'm going back. Go.

557
01:18:30,871 --> 01:18:32,998
Be ready.

558
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:35,835
Come on. lt's okay. Come on.

559
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:38,087
Come, come.

560
01:18:52,101 --> 01:18:54,145
Can you hear me?

561
01:19:13,789 --> 01:19:15,750
l don't wanna hurt you.

562
01:19:19,587 --> 01:19:21,964
l just wanna see you.

563
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:29,805
l just wanna talk to you.

564
01:19:54,288 --> 01:19:55,998
Sancho!

565
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,215
Zoey!

566
01:20:34,245 --> 01:20:35,913
Zoey, for God's sake!

567
01:21:16,328 --> 01:21:20,332
lf anybody wants to make a run for it,
this is a good time.

568
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:27,923
All right.

569
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:30,176
Oh, and, Padre?

570
01:21:31,969 --> 01:21:34,096
Anything else l need to know?

571
01:21:34,305 --> 01:21:39,185
-l told you my secrets would help.
-That you did, brother.

572
01:21:39,685 --> 01:21:43,731
Need a straight shot with this.
Can you get it on the roof?

573
01:21:43,898 --> 01:21:45,524
l'll see what l can do.

574
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:46,168
Hey, vampire.

575
01:22:47,795 --> 01:22:50,965
l know you can hear me,
because l can hear you.

576
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,508
l can smell you.

577
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:00,307
The only choice left...

578
01:23:00,474 --> 01:23:02,768
...is how to die.

579
01:23:02,977 --> 01:23:05,146
Slow and painf ul...

580
01:23:05,646 --> 01:23:08,107
...or it can be quick and easy.

581
01:23:10,401 --> 01:23:12,278
You decide.

582
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,640
lt's a trap!

583
01:23:47,563 --> 01:23:51,233
Sancho, get your back
up against something solid.

584
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:55,237
Heads up.
She's coming after us.

585
01:24:10,836 --> 01:24:13,673
-We gotta get out of this hole.
-Like this.

586
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:15,883
Separate. She can't be
two places.

587
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:18,386
-Don't count on it.
-Now!

588
01:24:56,507 --> 01:24:57,633
Come on!

589
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:02,680
Zoey, please!

590
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:17,528
Derek!

591
01:26:50,162 --> 01:26:52,915
Okay. Thank you.

592
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:58,546
-How much time you think we have?
-Try to get there as fast as you can.

593
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,923
You sure you won't come?

594
01:27:01,924 --> 01:27:04,093
Yeah. l'm needed here.

595
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:12,935
So you got a plan, amigo?

596
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:15,813
Yeah, clean up around here.

597
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:20,151
Make a special skeleton,
you know, for his grave and all.

598
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:23,446
You get fix ed up.

599
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:26,824
Come back soon.

600
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:29,452
Maybe hunt with me some more.

601
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:34,331
You're such a pro.
l better find something else to do.

602
01:27:42,214 --> 01:27:44,633
Head back home, okay?

603
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:54,101
l could've kept your secret, you know.

604
01:27:54,268 --> 01:27:56,479
You wouldn't have taken me.

605
01:27:56,645 --> 01:27:59,565
lt's hard to keep a secret
f rom a vampire.

606
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:01,317
-Where is it?
-What?

607
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:05,196
You know what. The cross.
You went back for it.

608
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:11,327
That's a secret l can't share
with you right now.

609
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:13,704
Maybe when we meet again.

610
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:18,668
-lf the medicine doesn't work--
-lf it doesn't work, you will change.

611
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:22,880
You will try to survive and
everything will be different.

612
01:28:23,422 --> 01:28:26,008
l'll pray for good medicine.

613
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:30,012
Take care.

614
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:40,648
Yeah. Thanks for the ride.

615
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,633
Sunlight getting to you?

616
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,511
We could slow down, let it outrun us.

617
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:15,349
No, let's make it last
as long as we can.
