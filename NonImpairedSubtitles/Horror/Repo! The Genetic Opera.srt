00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,608
I can go out with a bang.

No, no, please!
I can't be outside.

343
00:27:57,889 --> 00:27:59,686

350
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:17,740
My kids have been...

351
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:21,245
Well, disappointing.

352
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:23,008
I'm Rotti Largo.

353
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,446
I know.

354
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:26,711
I own GeneCo

355
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:27,877
Please let me go.

356
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:30,615
Sorry to be

357
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:35,023
So difficult

358
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:37,721
I had no choice

359
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:39,161
You're a tough one to find

360
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,222
Climbing through holes

361
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,199
Tell me, why do you hide...

362
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:44,826
- I'm not.
- Your pretty face?

363
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:47,633
I cannot be outside

364
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:51,506
I have a blood disease

365
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:54,670
But there is hope, an antidote

366
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:57,112
And you could be the first

367
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:59,912
To sample it, the GeneCo fix

368
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:02,510
To all blood diseases

369
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:05,055
And I can use someone like you

370
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:10,254
The poster child of progress

371
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:13,627
It's the cure you sought, Shilo

372
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:17,964
Your chance to see
the world, Shilo

373
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:22,996
In your grasp

374
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:24,099
I don't...

375
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,803
A function awaits.

376
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:28,903
Will you be my date?

377
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,912
I can't.

378
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:31,471
Blind Mag will be there.

379
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,212
- Mag?
- You two should meet

380
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:35,480
No.

381
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,647
I must leave

382
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:40,282
My dad will worry

383
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:45,553
Who says that Dad

384
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:52,536
Needs to know everything?

385

Penile tissue inch by inch

390
00:30:26,938 --> 00:30:30,601
Skinnin' off the muscles slow

391
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:34,475
Harvesting the kidneys for the fall

392
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:38,312
Savin' up the livers in the fridge

393
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:41,580
No one ever thanks me
when I'm done

394
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:45,316
How self-absorbed people can be

395
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,652
With a slice

396
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,689

Returning organs good as new

Mag was 19, not much older than you

471

And at that moment knew

473
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:36,549
I'd help her see

Shilo.

505
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,008
Yes, Dad?

506
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:56,880
Did you take your medicine?

507
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:57,922
Yes.

508
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,479
<i>...for GeneCol</i>

509
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:01,422
What's that?

510
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:02,754
What's what?

511
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,055
That.

512
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:05,060
Oh. That.

513
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:06,721
My window, it's cracked

514
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:09,494
Then why aren't you
wearing your mask?

515
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:10,966
Should I head back?

516
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:12,024
No, I'm fine

517
00:38:12,103 --> 00:38:14,571
I can be there in no time

518
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,936
<i>That won't be needed</i>

519
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:17,031
But, Shilo...

520
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,837
Your patients need you

521
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,343
<i>Dad, who's that?</i>

522
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:22,468
Oh, that?

523
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:24,674
One of my patients. He's sick.

524
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,215
- Will he live?
- It's looking grim

525
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:30,345
You should stay there for a while

526
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:32,685
I will rush home when I'm done

527
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:34,748
Take your time, nothing's wrong

528
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:36,088
I love you

Don't bother me.

Where are we going?

Where are you taking me?

542
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,578
Mr. Largo, how are you?

543
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:31,774
The folks at home would like to know
your thoughts and views

544
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:33,248
about Zydrate use...

545
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:35,547
And its abuses

546
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,612
Would you care to comment, sir?

547
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,850
Well, thank you, sir.

548
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:43,325
Let me direct the matter
to my daughter

549
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:47,558

the Zydrate support network

00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:50,601
Welcome Amber to the stage

551
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:55,700
Welcome Amber to the stage

552
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:41,242
How old are you?

553
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:42,547
17.

554
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,350
I had my first surgery
when I was 13.

555
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:47,015
And thanks to Z,

556
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:50,117
I couldn't feel
or remember a thing.

557
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:53,823
A month later, I was turning tricks.

558
00:40:57,935 --> 00:41:01,496
<i>I'll keep a lock on it all</i>

559
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:05,699
Drug market

560
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:07,870
Submarket

561
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,282
Sometimes I wonder
why I ever got in

562
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:16,115
Blood market

563
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:18,781
Love market

564
00:41:20,124 --> 00:41:24,424
Sometimes I wonder
why they need me at all

565
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:26,759
Zydrate comes
in a little glass vial.

566
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:28,162
A little glass vial?

567
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:29,164
A little glass vial.

568
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:30,564
And the little glass vial

569
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:32,830
goes into the gun like a battery.

570
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:35,537
And the Zydrate gun

571
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:39,167
goes somewhere
against your anatomy.

572
00:41:39,243 --> 00:41:41,234
And when the gun goes off, it sparks,

573
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:42,939
and you're ready for surgery.

574
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:44,174
Surgery.

575
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:52,046
Grave Robber

576
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:56,560
Sometimes I wonder
why I even bother

577
00:41:56,627 --> 00:42:02,427
Grave Robber

578
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,960
Sometimes I wonder
why I need you at all

579
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:09,802
And Amber Sweet
is addicted to the knife.

580
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:12,299
Addicted to the knife?

581
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:13,468
And addicted to the knife,

582
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:16,172
she needs a little help with the agony.

583
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:17,578
Agony.

584
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:20,173
And a little help comes
in a little glass vial

585
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:22,219
in a gun pressed
against her anatomy.

586
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:23,719
And when the gun goes off,

587
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:26,916
Miss Sweet is ready
for surgery, surgery.

588
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:31,586
Grave Robber

589
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:37,256
Sometimes I wonder
why I need you at all

590
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:40,827
It's clean, it's clear, it's pure.

591
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,532
- It's what?
- It's rare.

592
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:44,632
It takes you there.

593
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:45,676
It what?

594
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,734
It takes you there

595
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:49,871
It's clean, it's clear...

596
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:52,347
Before the cut

597
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:54,350
It's clean, it's clear...

598
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:57,216
I can do nothing at all

599
00:42:57,288 --> 00:42:58,915
It's surgery, it's surgery.

600
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,548
It's surgery.

601
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:05,392
It's the way your friends
may change inside.

602
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:10,423
Feel alive

603
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:22,569
Hey, that's Blind Mag's song.

604
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:24,171
Who did that?

605
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:29,251
So you think you got heart

606
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,447
So you think you got balls

607
00:43:31,522 --> 00:43:33,854
So you think Mag can sing

608
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:36,826
I don't think nothing at all

609
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:39,192
So you think Mag has pipes.

610
00:43:39,263 --> 00:43:41,823
Well, it's my turn to shine.

611
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:44,231
When the Repo Man strikes!

612
00:43:44,302 --> 00:43:47,328
What are you talking about?

613
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:51,734
Mag's contract's got
some mighty fine print.

614
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:52,798
Some mighty fine print?

615
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:54,105
Some mighty fine...

616
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:55,202
And that mighty fine print

617
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:57,611
puts Mag in a mighty fine predicament.

618
00:43:58,783 --> 00:43:59,909
If Mag up and splits,

619
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:01,383
her eyes are forfeit.

620
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:03,852
And if GeneCo and Rotti so will it,

621
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:05,922
then a repo man will come,

622
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,617
and she'll pay for that surgery.

623
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:09,091
Surgery.

624
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:11,655
Surgery.

625
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:14,357
I can't feel nothing at all

626
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:21,465
Cleanin' up the city since 030

627
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,474
<i>I can't feel nothing at all</i>

628
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:28,668
Sir, we have Amber.

629
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:30,680
<i>We're bringing her in.</i>

630
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:21,096
<i>Incoming message.</i>

631
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:24,532
<i>Nathan Wallace, come to mu office at once.</i>

632
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:37,607
Honey?

633
00:45:38,682 --> 00:45:40,172
Are you awake?

634
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:23,550
Well, who ordered pizza?

635
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:26,221
I could sure go for a slice!

636
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:29,562
Oh, never too pressed
for that dramatical entrance

637
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,191
You wanted to see me?

638
00:46:31,268 --> 00:46:32,360
Thank you for coming

639
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:33,767
Have your new assignment

640
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:34,964
Hot off the meat truck!

641
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:36,199
Is there a reason why

642
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:37,740
You couldn't phone me this target?

643
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:40,606
This is a job of special importance.

644
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:43,476
It is involving a GeneCo employee,

645
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:44,912
a singer we all know.

646
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:46,472
That has-been soprano

647
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:47,915
A traitor to GeneCo

648
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:49,179
Tonight is her last show

649
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:50,686
I can't afford a scandal here

650
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:52,585
Please handle Mag as best you can.

651
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:55,523
Take her down

652
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:57,026
But Mag's eyes...

653
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:59,085
Are GeneCo's.

654
00:46:59,163 --> 00:47:01,290
I know this may seem hard

655
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:03,925
Mag was Marni's best friend

656
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:07,402
You break my friggin' heart

657
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:10,804
You can reunite them.

658
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:13,708
I cannot do this job

659
00:47:16,013 --> 00:47:18,413
Remember who you are.

660
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:23,412
Remember what you did to Marni.

661
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:33,988
Must I take you back there

662
00:47:34,064 --> 00:47:35,361
Please don't take me back there

663
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:37,024
Why relive that moment?

664
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:38,295
I can't relive it

665
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:39,563
That dark, fateful night

666
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:41,571
When you murdered your wife

667
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:44,631
It's too painful

668
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:48,505
Marni was past helping

669
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:50,240
Shilo's life was slipping

670
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:51,838
Shilo was slipping

671
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:54,646
She needed her dad,
and I needed skilled hands

672
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:58,017
So I fixed things

673
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:01,057
We made an agreement

674
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:04,288
I will honor that agreement

675
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:06,454
- You'll do as you're told
- I'll do as I'm told

676
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,122
So Shilo never knows

677
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:11,362
About that dark and fateful night.

678
00:48:11,435 --> 00:48:16,031
Or my secret repo life

679
00:48:16,106 --> 00:48:22,636
Don't deny your repo life

680
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:29,752
Dear Marni, I am so sorry

681
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,051
Can you forgive me for this?

682
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:36,552
Not the death doctor
with the hungry scalpel

683
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:39,653
Here's my prognosis, will they live?

684
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,061
Doubtful.

685
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:42,792
You're the street physician

686
00:48:42,866 --> 00:48:44,959
Carving rare sculptures

687
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:46,662
Paint your ass like a Rembrandt

688
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:48,466
Ha! You like that?

689
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:51,838
Better start praying
when you see him coming

690
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:53,206
For tonight, it's curtains

691
00:48:53,277 --> 00:48:57,111
You're the night surgeon

692
00:48:57,181 --> 00:49:00,014
I remember

693
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:03,019
Remember what you did to Marni

694
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:04,054
And who you are

695
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:06,749
I remember

696
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:09,019
Remember what you did

697
00:49:09,093 --> 00:49:10,390
To your knife!

698
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:11,553
See it glide.

699
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:13,859
See it slice!

700
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:15,330
Who's your night surgeon?

701
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:17,424
I hope you have my money

702
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:19,025
<i>Or it's buon viaggi</i>

703
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,264
He'll do your ass like dishes

704
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:23,067
Amputation

705
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,040
Remember who you are

706
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:27,703
- Please, please, please!
- I remember

707
00:49:27,778 --> 00:49:30,144
Remember what you did to Marni

708
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:31,806
Remember who you are

709
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:34,316
I remember

710
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:36,876
Remember what you did to her

711
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:38,478
Remember who you are

712
00:49:38,555 --> 00:49:41,285
I remember

713
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:43,849
Remember what you did to Marni

714
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:45,792
Remember who you are

715
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:47,854
I remember

716
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:50,764
Remember what you did to her

717
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:53,598
I remember every dying whisper

718
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,104
Every desperate murmur

719
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:58,869
I remember when I gazed upon her

720
00:49:58,942 --> 00:50:00,534
She looks just like you

721
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:04,310
I remember

722
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:07,475
I remember working every victim

723
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:08,984
With acute precision

724
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:12,614
I remember every time I hold you

725
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,715
My blunt companion

726
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:16,555
I remember

727
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:18,561
I dismember

728
00:50:18,629 --> 00:50:21,427
'Cause the claims medic gives no anesthetic

729
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:24,626
90-day delinquent
gets you repo treatment

730
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:28,160
Remember horror
on your street corner

731
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:29,762
Make your mama boil you

732
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,071
I'm a night surgeon

733
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:43,108
I remember

734
00:50:46,724 --> 00:50:47,850
Nathan!

735
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:50,154
I cannot do this job.

736
00:50:50,227 --> 00:50:52,923
Find someone else.

737
00:50:53,964 --> 00:50:55,363
No one walks away from me.

738
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:02,669
He wants out?
Then I will take him out.

739
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:40,271
Shilo? Is your name Shilo?

740
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:42,312
Can I talk to you?

741
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:43,812
Can you come down, please?

742
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:46,406
- Why?
- So we can speak.

743
00:51:46,483 --> 00:51:48,542
I saw you at the show

744
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:51,588
I thought I'd seen a ghost

745
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:53,714
Your resemblance is striking.

746
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:55,850
You have your mother's eyes, her hair

747
00:51:55,926 --> 00:51:57,621
I was told you died with her

748
00:51:57,694 --> 00:51:59,924
All these years have come and gone

749
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:01,191
How do I put this?

750
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:02,892
I'm your godmom

751
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:04,558
State your business.

752
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:05,727
Business?

753
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:06,735
What do you want?

754
00:52:06,804 --> 00:52:07,793
I want, I want

755
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:08,997
To finally meet you

756
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:10,835
Something real
to cling to, leave you

757
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:12,637
With the hope that you will go to

758
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:14,734
All you're meant to, all I failed to

759
00:52:14,812 --> 00:52:16,780
In you is a world of promise

760
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,781
We have both been
kept in bondage

761
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:20,874
But you could learn
from all my failures.

762
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:22,714
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

763
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:24,117
Or let them through the gate?

764
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:25,416
That, either. A big risk.

765
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:26,421
- A big fence.
- A big mistake.

766
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,548
A new friend.

767
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:43,495
Oh, my God. Mom?

768
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:44,768
How'd you do that?

769
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:46,867
- Do what?
- That. That eye thing.

770
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:48,639
These eyes can do more than see.

771
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:50,907
I know. I mean, I've seen you sing.

772
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:52,812
- Where?
- From my window.

773
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:54,441
I can see the world from there.

774
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,986
Name the stars and constellations.

775
00:52:57,054 --> 00:52:59,079
Count the cars
and watch the seasons.

776
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:00,851
I wish we could have watched together

777
00:53:00,924 --> 00:53:01,856
I can't have guests.

778
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:02,914
- Never?
- Ever.

779
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:04,585
If Dad found out
that I'd been let out

780
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:06,026
or that you'd been let in...

781
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:07,893
I should go, then, before I do

782
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:10,126
- Promise me you won't
- Better that you don't.

783
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,963
Don't forget a sheltered rose

784
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:13,764
It's best if I resume my life

785
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:16,135
Needs a little room to bloom
outside her bedroom

786
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:18,231
<i>Chase the morning</i>

787
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:22,641
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

788
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:26,608
<i>Chase the morning</i>

789
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:30,519
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

790
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:36,950
Let your life be a dream

791
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:40,986
Integrity, honesty

792
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:45,398
It's too late for me

793
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:46,993
Don't look back

794
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:52,565
Till you're free
to chase the morning

795
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:56,409
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

796
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,074
<i>Chase the morning</i>

797
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:02,912
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

798
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:12,826
<i>Yield for nothing</i>

799
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:32,078
Hi, Nathan.

800
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:35,142
Mag.

801
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:37,311
How did you get in here?

802
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:38,649
Don't you have a show tonight?

803
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:40,587
- How are you, Nathan?
- Busy.

804
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:41,988
You never were

805
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:44,721
A man of many words, Nate

806
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:47,559
- You told me Shilo died
- Listen...

807
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:50,532
Nathan, I promised your late wife

808
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:53,502
I'd be present in Shilo's life

809
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,061
Please, Mag

810
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:57,902
Shilo's very ill

811
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:59,567
It's not safe

812
00:54:59,643 --> 00:55:01,736
For her to see people

813
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:03,905
I need to give her her medication.

814
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,082
Dad, let her stay in here

815
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:09,550
No, she's leaving

816
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,212
Please hide her here

817
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:12,949
- From what?
- She'll be dead

818
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:14,650
Look, I told her she was sick

819
00:55:14,725 --> 00:55:16,192
Nathan, you are hurting me

820
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:17,556
- Dad!
- My daughter needs a rest

821
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:20,893
I'll be fine, Shilo, don't you fret

822
00:55:20,964 --> 00:55:24,331
Repossessions are dangerous

823
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:26,096
You're not safe

824
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:27,830
- Dad, she's not safe
- Shilo, don't you fret

825
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:29,394
- Leave my daughter
- Your daughter's

826
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:30,701
She is sick

827
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:33,402
You've turned this house

828
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:35,069
- Into a zoo
- I can't have this

829
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:36,772
Marni wouldn't want this for you

830
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:39,111
Set her free

831
00:55:39,182 --> 00:55:40,945
- Please don't leave
- Set her free

832
00:55:41,018 --> 00:55:42,144
Come back

833
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:44,187
- Keep it down, Shi
- Come back!

834
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:46,347
It's your bedtime, it's late

835
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:47,856
- Dad, am I...
- Please

836
00:55:47,924 --> 00:55:49,414
- She will die
- Nonsense

837
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:51,393
- It's arrived, Dad
- Nonsense

838
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:53,554
- It's a contract
- A contract?

839
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,097
- Come and see
- Nonsense

840
00:55:55,165 --> 00:55:56,723
Come see

841
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,768
Mag's in trouble, Dad

842
00:55:58,835 --> 00:56:00,029
Where'd you get this?

843
00:56:00,103 --> 00:56:02,731
Read it, Dad, a repo man will come

844
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:05,036
and take Mag's eyes!

845
00:56:05,108 --> 00:56:06,837
There are things in life

846
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,810
That we do best to leave alone

847
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:10,471
She'll die, you must help her, Dad

848
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:12,572
- That are beyond control
- You must stop her

849
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:13,638
That you don't want to know

850
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:15,082
Will you save Mag?

851
00:56:15,152 --> 00:56:16,210
She will lose her eyes

852
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:17,685
Unless you stop this repo man

853
00:56:17,754 --> 00:56:19,119
Shilo, this is senseless

854
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:20,713
- Dad, you have to try.
- Shilo

855
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:22,816
- This is pointless.
- You can't let her die!

856
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:24,121
Please, shut up!

857
00:56:40,877 --> 00:56:46,110
Your mother's death
taught me to accept

858
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:50,051
That nothing ever lasts in this world

859
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,887
Foolish dreams
can destroy a grown man

860
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:00,752
What chance has a 17-year-old girl?

861
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:06,298
I don't know what I was thinking

862
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:09,998
There's no sense in girlish dreaming

863
00:57:10,073 --> 00:57:15,773
I'm just 17, 17

864
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:18,079
And it's better than 40.

865
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,151
Mama drama's got to go

866
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:29,321
Nothing's gonna bring her back

867
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:33,191
Experiment with something living

868
00:57:35,165 --> 00:57:37,565
Because I'm sweeter than 16

869
00:57:39,102 --> 00:57:40,569
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

870
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:53,774
I've always longed for true affection

871
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:57,115
But you compared me to a corpse!

872
00:57:57,187 --> 00:57:58,984
Dead, with the dead

873
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:02,616
- I'm joining the living
- 17

874
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:06,458
Because I'm freer than 16

875
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:08,794
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

876
00:58:18,642 --> 00:58:20,200
Shilo.

877
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:32,817
Something's changing

878
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:37,226
I can feel it

879
00:58:37,294 --> 00:58:39,728
17 now

880
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:43,228
Why can't you see it?

881
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:47,667
17 and you can't stop me

882
00:58:47,737 --> 00:58:51,571
17 and you won't boss me

883
00:58:52,776 --> 00:58:56,007
You cannot control me, Father

884
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:01,016
Daddy's girl's a fucking monster

885
00:59:08,992 --> 00:59:10,425
I'm sorry.

886
00:59:10,493 --> 00:59:11,858
<i>Shilo.</i>

887
00:59:18,835 --> 00:59:20,860
<i>Listen, alll</i>

888
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:45,019
I've never been
so surgically maimed

889
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:46,790
Amber, please, it's not that bad.

890
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:49,627
I'll be the laughingstock of the stage

891
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:51,223
Daughter, please, it's not that bad

892
00:59:51,301 --> 00:59:53,235
This is your fault,
I asked you to help me

893
00:59:53,303 --> 00:59:55,168
No, Amber, please

894
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:56,865
I warned you about this

895
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,773
Happiness is not a warm scalpel

896
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:02,471
I don't care! It's not fair!

897
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:11,250
Baby, baby, baby,
don't do this

898
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:15,553
I will never sing again

899
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:20,824
I gave you the life I wished I'd had

900
01:00:20,897 --> 01:00:25,960
I look like a crime scene, Dad

901
01:00:26,036 --> 01:00:30,530
All you ever do is take, take, take

902
01:00:30,607 --> 01:00:34,703
All I ever do is give

903
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:39,772
That surgery was only 90 grand

904
01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:41,612
I did not complain

905
01:00:41,685 --> 01:00:43,312
When you changed your name

906
01:00:43,386 --> 01:00:45,479
From Largo to Sweet

907
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:47,386
I need a stage name!

908
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:49,015
You are a disgrace

909
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:52,255
Your genes are not worthy of mine

910
01:01:09,846 --> 01:01:11,711
Are you okay, Daddy?

911
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:16,785
I'll have one of my surgeons fix you up

912
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:18,753
so you can sing tonight.

913
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:20,187
Thanks, Daddy.

914
01:01:29,132 --> 01:01:31,692
Flesh is weak.

915
01:01:31,768 --> 01:01:35,670
Blood is cheap.

916
01:01:35,739 --> 01:01:38,833
Inconsistent.

917
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:42,366
Consistently

918
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:45,881
Use your sense

919
01:01:45,949 --> 01:01:49,214
Save your cents

920
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:56,521
The only thing with persistence is

921
01:01:56,593 --> 01:01:58,493
Gold

922
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:03,055
It makes the world go round

923
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:05,567
Gold

924
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:10,698
It makes the world go round

925
01:02:13,343 --> 01:02:14,935
But before I go

926
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:16,137
My kids will know

927
01:02:16,212 --> 01:02:18,908
About the man they have crossed

928
01:02:18,982 --> 01:02:21,314
As Marni did the day she fled

929
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:23,443
And became Nathan's wife

930
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,216
She forced my hand,
he dug her grave

931
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:28,553
I will not be betrayed

932
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:31,287
Empty the trash of all of them

933
01:02:31,361 --> 01:02:37,891
And leave it all to the kid

934
01:02:40,236 --> 01:02:41,931
Lay the bait

935
01:02:43,106 --> 01:02:46,075
Shilo's fate

936
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:48,702
But only if

937
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:52,646
And will she appreciate

938
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:56,116
That gold

939
01:02:56,186 --> 01:02:59,747
It makes the world go round

940
01:02:59,823 --> 01:03:02,656
Gold

941
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:08,095
It makes the world go round

942
01:03:08,164 --> 01:03:15,536
Gold

943
01:03:18,341 --> 01:03:20,366
<i>Shilo, I have uour cure.</i>

944
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:22,604
<i>Tonight all will be revealed.</i>

945
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:24,806
<i>See uou at the opera.</i>

946
01:03:24,881 --> 01:03:28,715
So Rotti thinks he can take Shilo.

947
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:30,013
Dad?

948
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:32,111
Nothing, Shilo, nothing

949
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:34,918
Go to bed

950
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:40,659
Why didn't you tell me
I had a godmother?

951
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:43,062
What?

952
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:45,294
What are you talking about, precious?

953
01:04:22,572 --> 01:04:27,874
<i>Lovelu, Mag, sing</i>

954
01:04:45,695 --> 01:04:47,925
<i>Attention, all GeneCo personnel.</i>

955
01:04:47,997 --> 01:04:50,431
<i>Apprehend the Repo Man
Nathan Wallace at once.</i>

956
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,660
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

957
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:54,464
<i>I want Nathan Wallace taken out.</i>

958
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:01,974
Shilo?

959
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:05,378
Come to the opera with me

960
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:09,416
Shilo!

961
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:19,356
Tonight we are betrayed

962
01:05:21,064 --> 01:05:23,999
Keep Shilo safe

963
01:05:25,268 --> 01:05:29,432
Make Rotti pay

964
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:33,936
I'll man his grave

965
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,843
At the opera...

966
01:05:36,913 --> 01:05:40,144
tonight.

967
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:48,348
<i>Shilo, this dress</i>

968
01:05:48,424 --> 01:05:49,721
<i>once belonged to uour mother.</i>

969
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:51,054
<i>I would be most honored</i>

970
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:53,357
<i>if uou wore it to the opera.</i>

971
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:55,989
I must be brave

972
01:05:58,067 --> 01:06:00,160
Come, come what may

973
01:06:01,971 --> 01:06:03,700
Can I be saved?

974
01:06:06,042 --> 01:06:11,605
Is there a way at the opera tonight?

975
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:20,753
I've made my peace

976
01:06:20,823 --> 01:06:22,757
No chance for peace

977
01:06:22,825 --> 01:06:24,759
I hold no grudge

978
01:06:24,827 --> 01:06:27,057
I'll end this grudge

979
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,757
I'm gonna sing

980
01:06:28,831 --> 01:06:30,822
I'll stain the streets

981
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,765
- My final song
- They'll run with blood

982
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:39,570
At the opera tonight

983
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:44,805
One more hit for the show

984
01:06:44,881 --> 01:06:46,712
- Make it fast
- Take it slow.

985
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:48,774
One more hit of the glow

986
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:50,216
Go get cut.

987
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:51,685
For tonight's show

988
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:53,346
Tonight I set the stage

989
01:06:53,423 --> 01:06:54,856
Tonight we set the stage

990
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:57,825
My greatest play

991
01:06:57,894 --> 01:06:58,952
My greatest face.

992
01:06:59,028 --> 01:07:00,757
I'll take the lead

993
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,855
- My greatest rage!
- Pavi gets laid.

994
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:05,400
All debts are paid

995
01:07:05,468 --> 01:07:07,561
At the opera tonight

996
01:07:07,637 --> 01:07:10,936

At the opera tonight

Repo Man

01:07:25,755 --> 01:07:28,417
My eyes

<i>Repo man, at the opera tonight</i>

Bloodbath

01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:39,164
It's gonna be a bloodbath

'Cause no one crosses GeneCo

1007

No, not even Repo

At the opera

Everybody, everybody, testify

I needed a kidney

GeneCo showed this
single mom sympathy

1046
01:09:53,469 --> 01:09:57,701
This makeover came
for a small added fee

1047
01:09:57,773 --> 01:10:03,541
Now I look smashing on live TV

As an encore, GeneCo will cure

A very sick and needy young girl

1097
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,382
She's been caged up like a monster

By her overbearing father

1099

But tonight we're gonna set him right

And for all your viewing pleasures

1101
01:17:00,562 --> 01:17:03,554
Didn't I tell you not to go out?

1102
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:04,758
Didn't I?

1103
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,233
You did, you did

1104
01:17:07,303 --> 01:17:10,295
Didn't I say the world was cruel?

1105
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:11,430
Didn't I?

1106
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,372
You did, you did

1107
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:16,741
Then tell me how this happened

1108
01:17:16,812 --> 01:17:19,975
What I did wrong, tell me why

1109
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:23,610
Can't we just go home, Shi

1110
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:26,849
And forget this dreadful night?

1111
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:30,289
Didn't you say that you were different?

1112
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:31,451
Didn't you?

1113
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:33,392
I am, I am

Say you aren't that person

1115
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:38,196
Say it

1116
01:17:38,267 --> 01:17:39,700
I am, I am

1117
01:17:39,768 --> 01:17:43,363
Then tell me how to act, Dad

1118
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,306
What to say, Dad, tell me why

1119
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:49,902
All you've ever told me

1120
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:57,351
Every word is a lie

1121
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:11,123
Didn't you say that you'd protect me?

1122
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,326
Didn't you?

1123
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:13,925
I tried, I tried

1124
01:18:14,003 --> 01:18:17,029
Is that how you'd help me?

1125
01:18:17,106 --> 01:18:18,869
Is it?

1126
01:18:18,941 --> 01:18:19,999
I tried, I tried

1127
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:23,340
Don't help me anymore, Dad

1128
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:26,040
You are dead, Dad, in my eyes

1129
01:18:26,115 --> 01:18:29,050
Someone has replaced you

1130
01:18:29,118 --> 01:18:31,814
Dad, I hate you, go and die

1131
01:18:31,887 --> 01:18:34,981
Didn't I build a house, a home?

1132
01:18:35,057 --> 01:18:36,183
Didn't I?

1133
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:38,123
<i>A cure is waiting.</i>

1134
01:18:38,193 --> 01:18:40,991
Didn't I raise her all alone?

01:18:41,063 --> 01:18:42,257
Didn't I?

1136
01:18:43,732 --> 01:18:47,133
Then Rotti took her from me

1137
01:18:47,202 --> 01:18:49,830
Stole my Shilo, he's to blame

1138
01:18:49,905 --> 01:18:54,103
Have I failed my daughter?

1139
01:18:54,176 --> 01:18:57,873
Then let the father die

1140
01:19:01,183 --> 01:19:08,817
And let the monster run

1141

<i>Repo Man</i>

1142
01:19:36,218 --> 01:19:37,845
Stop!

1143

You've exceeded all my plans

1144
01:19:45,394 --> 01:19:48,261
More than you
could say for Amber

1145
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,560
More than I could say for you.

1146
01:19:50,632 --> 01:19:52,099
What?

1147
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,465
Or your just-as-worthless brother

1148
01:19:56,038 --> 01:19:58,336
I just want to get my cure

1149
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:00,807
And I promise to deliver

1150
01:20:00,876 --> 01:20:02,935
Don't you lay a hand on her.

1151
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:04,808
Hold your tongue before an elder.

1152
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,246
Touch her, and I swear I'll kill you.

1153
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:09,443
Bring it on, you cheap imposter.

1154
01:20:12,654 --> 01:20:16,613
Even though I'm terminally ill

1155
01:20:17,893 --> 01:20:19,417
I'm dying, you idiots.

1156
01:20:19,495 --> 01:20:20,621
Please don't say you're dying, Father.

1157
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:22,027
Please say you ain't dying, Father.

1158
01:20:22,097 --> 01:20:24,088
So I planned my perfect end

1159
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:26,157
A tale befitting any opera

1160
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:28,760
And ending only I could spin

1161
01:20:28,837 --> 01:20:30,702
Ending you will be my pleasure.

1162
01:20:30,772 --> 01:20:32,672
I no longer trust you, Dad.

1163
01:20:32,741 --> 01:20:34,936
You can never trust a monster.

1164
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:37,171
And there's more beneath his mask.

1165
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:43,677
Did you know he killed your mother?

1166
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:46,414
It was just an accident

1167
01:20:46,488 --> 01:20:50,117
- Accidents can end in murder.
- Shilo, believe me

1168
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:52,922
And that's not his greatest fib

1169
01:20:52,995 --> 01:20:55,691
Someone tell me what is going on

1170
01:20:55,764 --> 01:20:57,664
Tell her, tell her

1171
01:20:57,733 --> 01:20:59,530
Someone tell me what is going on

1172
01:20:59,601 --> 01:21:01,262
- Let's leave
- Tell her, tell her

1173
01:21:01,336 --> 01:21:03,531
- Let's leave
- Someone tell me what is going on

1174
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:05,368
- No more
- Tell me, tell me

1175
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,670
- Tell her, tell her
- Tell me

1176
01:21:07,743 --> 01:21:08,732
No more.

1177
01:21:10,245 --> 01:21:13,840
May I introduce you

1178
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:18,444
To the man who made you sick?

1179
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:26,325
He's poisoned all your medicine

1180
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:34,435
- I can't breathe
- You've got to fight through it.

1181
01:21:34,503 --> 01:21:38,371
Someone, please,
please help my daughter

1182
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,375
This will pass.
You've got to fight through it.

1183
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:44,708
I've deceived the only one that matters

1184
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,179
- I need my pill.
- You need to know

1185
01:21:46,248 --> 01:21:47,738
- You've got to fight.
- It's not your fault

1186
01:21:47,816 --> 01:21:48,748
Believe me, Shilo.

1187
01:21:48,817 --> 01:21:49,875
It's me who failed you

1188
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:51,419
My stomach.

1189
01:21:51,486 --> 01:21:53,886
- It's his medicine
- My medicine

1190
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:54,923
It's your medicine?

1191
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:55,922
I'm the cause

1192
01:21:55,991 --> 01:21:57,390
Of all your sickness

1193
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:08,699
<i>Here's to the medi...</i>

1194
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:16,272
<i>That's all there is</i>

1195
01:22:16,345 --> 01:22:18,040
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

1196
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:56,944
Your mother once
promised her love to me

1197
01:22:57,019 --> 01:23:00,785
Had she never fled, you'd be mine.

1198
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:03,290
Deny your father now,

1199
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:05,656
for the world to see.

1200
01:23:06,728 --> 01:23:08,787
Kill him.

1201
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:10,593
Kill him!

1202
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:11,792
No.

1203
01:23:11,867 --> 01:23:13,027
And I'll leave you GeneCo

1204
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:15,001
- What?
- All of it?

1205
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:16,298
Oh, yes.

1206
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:17,360
Oh, no!

1207
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:18,872
So witness it, people.

1208
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,431
All I have to do is sign the paper

1209
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:24,604
All you have to do is pull the trigger

1210
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,979
- I want you to do what is right
- You want to pay me

1211
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,314
- to kill my father?
- This man killed your mother, your mother

1212
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:33,320
- Shilo
- He betrayed you both, he's a liar

1213
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:35,856
- And he poisoned you
- Force me to kill

1214
01:23:35,924 --> 01:23:38,290
I am not a murderer

1215
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,794
But you share your dad's genetics

1216
01:23:40,862 --> 01:23:42,921
What if he passed this to you?

1217
01:23:42,998 --> 01:23:45,091
I don't have to share his choices

1218
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:47,192
Didn't you say you were infected?

1219
01:23:47,269 --> 01:23:49,965
Didn't you, didn't you?

1220
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:54,500
I poisoned you

1221
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:57,739
I'm worse than Rotti, imprisoned you

1222
01:23:57,813 --> 01:24:01,510
I couldn't lose you,
what have I done?

1223
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:05,576
Forgive me, Shilo,
I drugged your blood

1224
01:24:05,654 --> 01:24:08,555
Oh, God, what have I done to you?

1225
01:24:08,623 --> 01:24:12,491
You used my mother's death
to use my father

1226
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:16,088
You used my father's death
to use me, too

1227
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:19,998
Your dad deserved
whatever happened to him.

1228
01:24:20,068 --> 01:24:22,332
He needed me, and so do you.

1229
01:24:22,404 --> 01:24:25,771
I remember

1230
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:29,109
Remember my mistakes

1231
01:24:29,177 --> 01:24:31,372
Remember you can change

1232
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:34,745
Remember that I love you

1233
01:24:34,816 --> 01:24:38,718
I'm sorry that I failed you

1234
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:42,553
Remember that it's up to you

1235
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:47,357
To go and shape your life into

1236
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:49,329
One that's worthy of remembering

1237
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:53,300
No!

1238
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:00,736
Dad!

1239
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:03,607
Dad, no, please!

1240
01:25:03,678 --> 01:25:05,441
Somebody!

1241
01:25:05,514 --> 01:25:07,778
Somebody, please help.

1242
01:25:07,849 --> 01:25:10,613
Money-grubbing beggars,
no better than I am.

1243
01:25:10,685 --> 01:25:13,813
You! Don't come near me.
You're embarrassing.

1244
01:25:13,889 --> 01:25:15,948
You're disgusting.

1245
01:25:16,024 --> 01:25:17,787
You're not men. You're creatures.

1246
01:25:17,859 --> 01:25:18,985
I'm embarrassed by you.

1247
01:25:21,897 --> 01:25:24,559
Get away. I don't need you,
not either one of you.

1248
01:25:24,633 --> 01:25:26,123
Go away!

1249
01:25:29,204 --> 01:25:31,764
Don't show your face to me.

1250
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,171
You're disgusting.

1251
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:34,401
You're not my daughter.

1252
01:25:34,476 --> 01:25:35,636
You're nothing.

1253
01:25:44,386 --> 01:25:47,219
When I'm gone, GeneCo will crumble.

1254
01:25:49,424 --> 01:25:51,517
I doubt the world will remember

1255
01:25:51,593 --> 01:25:55,689
how lucky they were
to have Rotti Largo.

1256
01:26:13,148 --> 01:26:16,208
Dad, be still

1257
01:26:16,284 --> 01:26:19,481
There is nothing you need say

1258
01:26:19,554 --> 01:26:22,455
It can wait

1259
01:26:25,026 --> 01:26:28,928
Shi, your mother's calling me

1260
01:26:32,133 --> 01:26:35,159
Sometimes I wanted to cry

1261
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:38,001
When the people on TV

1262
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:40,405
Were not quite the way we were

1263
01:26:40,475 --> 01:26:43,501
Somehow I guess I just knew

1264
01:26:47,883 --> 01:26:52,047
But I didn't know I love you so much

1265
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:59,384
I didn't know I love you so much

1266
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:01,486
But I do

1267
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:07,065
Sometimes I'd stay up all night

1268
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:10,099
Wishing to God

1269
01:27:10,171 --> 01:27:12,332
That I was the one who died

1270
01:27:12,407 --> 01:27:16,366
And sometimes there's
not enough time

1271
01:27:19,915 --> 01:27:23,681
But I didn't know I love you so much

1272
01:27:23,752 --> 01:27:31,520
I didn't know I love you so much

1273
01:27:31,593 --> 01:27:33,618
But I do

1274
01:27:36,331 --> 01:27:47,672
I didn't know I love you so much

1275
01:27:47,742 --> 01:27:49,607
But I do

1276
01:27:51,346 --> 01:27:53,837
Shilo, go

1277
01:27:53,915 --> 01:27:56,941
Dad, I will not leave you here

1278
01:27:57,018 --> 01:27:59,009
You will live

1279
01:27:59,087 --> 01:28:02,784
But you've already saved me, dear

1280
01:28:02,857 --> 01:28:06,156
Go and change the world for me

1281
01:28:07,562 --> 01:28:10,588
And we will always have each other

1282
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:13,065
In our time of need

1283
01:28:13,134 --> 01:28:14,294
- Daddy
- Shilo

1284
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:15,461
You're the world

1285
01:28:15,537 --> 01:28:17,528
To me

1286
01:28:21,776 --> 01:28:24,939
Oh, Daddy, please, no.

1287
01:28:25,013 --> 01:28:27,743
Please, please.

1288
01:28:32,787 --> 01:28:34,049
Please, get up.

1289
01:28:36,925 --> 01:28:38,153
Please.

1290
01:28:52,774 --> 01:28:54,799
Years

1291
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:57,674
It's been so many years

1292
01:28:57,746 --> 01:29:00,874
Resenting the years

1293
01:29:00,949 --> 01:29:03,975
And my heredity

1294
01:29:05,687 --> 01:29:10,454
Oh, I have hated and loved you

1295
01:29:10,525 --> 01:29:13,858
I have hidden behind you

1296
01:29:13,928 --> 01:29:17,056
But I finally see

1297
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:23,401
You I've mistaken for destiny

1298
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:26,406
But the truth is my legacy

1299
01:29:26,474 --> 01:29:30,535
Is not up to my genes

1300
01:29:30,612 --> 01:29:35,447
True, though the imprint is deep in me

1301
01:29:35,517 --> 01:29:39,044
It will always be up to me

1302
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,487
Up to me

1303
01:29:51,466 --> 01:29:54,492
Free at last

1304
01:30:02,844 --> 01:30:09,340
Free at last

1305
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:43,951
Goth opera

1306
01:30:44,018 --> 01:30:46,213
Blood saga

1307
01:30:47,555 --> 01:30:51,685
Sometimes I wonder
how we ever got here

1308
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,285
Old grudges

1309
01:30:54,362 --> 01:30:56,159
Scorned lovers

1310
01:30:57,632 --> 01:31:01,659
Sometimes I wonder
why we all don't move on

1311
01:31:01,736 --> 01:31:04,899
'Cause we all wind up
in a tiny pine box.

1312
01:31:04,973 --> 01:31:07,464
A mighty small drop
and a mighty dark plot.

1313
01:31:07,542 --> 01:31:08,839
And the mighty fine print

1314
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:11,470
hastens the trip to our epilogue.

1315
01:31:11,546 --> 01:31:12,604
Epilogue?

1316
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,704
But the little girl fled,

1317
01:31:13,782 --> 01:31:14,942
and the king is dead.

1318
01:31:15,016 --> 01:31:17,280
And the castle is left for the taking.

1319
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:21,220
But GeneCo may survive
if it undergoes surgery,

1320
01:31:21,289 --> 01:31:22,449
surgery.

1321
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:24,822
Surgery, surgery.

1322
01:31:24,893 --> 01:31:27,191
- Surgery.
- Surgery.

1323

01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:50,545
GeneCo will live on,

1327
01:31:51,719 --> 01:31:53,016
Me.
