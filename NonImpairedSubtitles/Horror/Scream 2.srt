to just deal with thatand move on.

The way I see it,
someone's outto make a sequel.

You know, cash in on all
the movie murder hoopla.

So It's our job to observe
the rules ofthe sequel.

799
00:49:30,585 --> 00:49:33,039
Number one:
the body count is always bigger.

800
00:49:33,112 --> 00:49:37,365
Numbertwo: the death scenes are always
more elaborate... more blood, more gore.

Carnage candy.
Your core audience justexpects it.

Numberthree: if you wantyour sequel
to become a franchise, never ever...

How do we find the killer, Randy?
That's what I wanna know.

Oh.
Let's look atthe suspects.

805
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,077
There's Derek, the obvious boyfriend.
Hello, Billy Loomis.

806
00:49:52,146 --> 00:49:54,414
The guy's premed,
and his pity-me surface wound...

conveniently missed
every majorvein and artery.

808

- So you think it's Derek?
- Notso fast.

809
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,732
Let's assume the killer, or'ers,
has a half a brain.

810
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,969
He's nota Nlck At Nlte
rerun type of guy.

He wants to break some new ground.

- Right? So forgetthe boyfriend.
- Right.

- It's tired. Who else do we got?
- There's...

Mickey, the freaky
Tarantino film student.

So, let's move on.

Let's notmove on.

- Sid's roommate?
- Uh-huh.

822

Serial killers
are typicallywhite males.

823
00:50:39,108 --> 00:50:42,587
That's why it's perfect. It's sort of
againstthe rules, but not really.

a terrific serial killer.

- Gale? A killer?

No. Gale's a lotofthings,
but Gale's nota killer.

'Cause you were stabbed in the back.

she's a target.

- What is it?
- Look, I'm a little confused here.

whywould you wanna be here
when the killer strikes again?

850
00:51:57,036 --> 00:52:00,264
I mean, granted, I should've
read your book before I took this job.

851
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:02,369
But I'm reading it now,
and... Whoo!

The guy ain't in the union no more.

It's a job, Joel.

859
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:23,231
And like every job,
there's a few drawbacks.
