You spoke to me
on the phone earlier.

want me a certain way or...

Um, no. Just... just be yourself.

we don't entertain.

DEBORAH: No, I have not.

129
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,330
- Always been a regret of mine.
- Mom, you went to Germany.

130
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,998
Remember?

131
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,168
- Well, that must, um...
- Remember?

132
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,504
Oh, must've been
a long time ago.

133
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,633
Well, but you were there.
You loved it. Remember?

The story of Alzheimer's
is never about one person.

135
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,182
My PhD thesis film posits
that this insidious disease

136
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,267
not only destroys the patient,

137
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,144
but has
a physiological influence

138
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,021
on the primary caregiver.

139
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,316
<i>Alzheimer's occurs when</i>
<i>abnormal protein fragments</i>

140
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,319
<i>accumulate in the hippocampus,</i>
<i>killing neurons.</i>

141
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,406
<i>The disease then creeps towards</i>
<i>the front of the brain,</i>

142
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,532
<i>wiping out neurons responsible</i>
<i>for logical thought</i>

143
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,326
<i>and problem solving.</i>

144
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,412
<i>It then assaults</i>
<i>the sensory region,</i>

145
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,705
<i>sparking terrifying hallucinations.</i>

146
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:58,293
<i>Eventually, it erases a person's</i>
<i>oldest and most precious memories.</i>

147
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,755
<i>In end stage, Alzheimer's</i>
<i>destroys the part of the brain</i>

148
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,799
<i>that regulates the heart</i>
<i>and breathing.</i>

149

<i>When swallowing goes,</i>
<i>death is not far behind.</i>

- DEBORAH: Take this one off.
- SARAH: Huh?

151
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,683
- Well, it's so military.
- What do you think?

152
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,768
Let's just... Yeah.

a shirt of your dad's?

I guess I would have,
you know, a senior moment.

160
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,494
Sure, you know, I'd put the toast in
and it would pop up

161
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,039
and I'd put the... push it
back down again or something.

162
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,916
Toast it twice. Big deal.

163
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,335
On several occasions,
she left the stove on.

164

OK? Burnt up the spice rack,
the whole wall.

your grandmother,

166
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,008
she was frightening.

167
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,093
She would leave a pot
on the stove

168
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,721
until it melted right down
to the little glass top.

and that was a clue.

what we call MCI -

175
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,694
Through a battery of tests,

176
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,197
we were able to diagnose
with 95% certainty

177
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,200
that she was in the early stages
of Alzheimer's.

MIA: How did she take the news?

179
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,580
It's devastating,
obviously, for anyone,

180
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:20,417

with the notable,

And that's why we're here...

However, the notion
of spiritual parasites

00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,966
does exists among
many thousands of cultures

the Masai, the Inuit,
Aborigines.

1115

a weak mind is susceptible

She was beyond reason.
