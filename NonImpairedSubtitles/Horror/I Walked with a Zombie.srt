1
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,451
<i>I walked with a zombie.</i>

2
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:05,649
<i>It does seem an odd thing to say.</i>

3
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:07,588
<i>Had anyone said that to me a year ago...</i>

4
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,423
<i>I'm not at all sure</i>
<i>I would have known what a zombie was.</i>

5
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:13,089
<i>I might have had some notion...</i>

6
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:15,359
<i>that they were strange and frightening...</i>

7
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,501
<i>even a little funny.</i>

8
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:20,464
<i>It all began in such an ordinary way.</i>

9
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:22,729
- You're single?
- Yes.

10
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:26,402
- Where were you trained?
- Memorial Hospital here in Ottawa.

11
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:31,213
Now this last question is a little irregular,
Miss Connell.

12
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:34,046
I really don't know quite how to begin.

13
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:36,385
Do you believe in witchcraft?

14
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:37,545
Well...

15
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:41,255
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital...

16
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:44,056
but I had my suspicions
about the Directress of Training.

17
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:46,153
Now, as to salary, it's quite good.

18
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,563
- $200 a month.
- That is good.

19
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,863
But I'd like to know a little bit more
about the case.

20
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm afraid I can't tell you much...

21
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:55,431
only that the patient is the wife
of Mr. Paul Holland...

22
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,235
with whom we do considerable business.

23
00:01:57,308 --> 00:02:00,573
- That will mean another interview?
- No, this is quite final.

24
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:02,670
You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.

25
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,011
He lives on Saint Sebastian
in the West Indies.

26
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,550
The West Indies?

27
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:10,247
That's not so bad, sit under a palm tree...

28
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:13,688
go swimming, take sunbaths.

29
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:16,750
Palm trees.

30
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,610
<i>It seemed only a few days</i>
<i>before I met Mr. Holland in Antigua.</i>

31
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:37,341
<i>We boarded the boat for Saint Sebastian.</i>

32
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,906
<i>It was all just as I had imagined it.</i>

33
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:42,475
<i>I looked at those great glowing stars.</i>

34
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,078
<i>I felt the warm wind on my cheek.</i>

35
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:49,183
<i>I breathed deep</i>
<i>and every bit of me inside myself said:</i>

36
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,228
<i>"How beautiful."</i>

37
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,660
It's not beautiful!

38
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,663
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.

39
00:02:57,735 --> 00:03:00,295
It's easy enough to read the thoughts
of a newcomer.

40
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:03,340
Everything seems beautiful
because you don't understand.

41
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:04,670
Those flying fish...

42
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:07,905
they are not leaping for joy.
They're jumping in terror.

43
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:10,171
Bigger fish want to eat them.

44
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:12,539
That luminous water...

45
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:15,848
it takes its gleam
from millions of tiny dead bodies.

46
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:18,586
The glitter of putrescence.

47
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:24,126
There's no beauty here,
only death and decay.

48
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,725
You can't really believe that.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,128
Everything good dies here, even the stars.

50
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,776
<i>It was strange to have him break in</i>
<i>on my thoughts that way.</i>

51
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,749
<i>There was cruelty and hardness</i>
<i>in his voice.</i>

52
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:49,442
<i>And yet something about him I liked.</i>

53
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,088
<i>Something clean and honest...</i>

54
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:54,920
<i>but hurt, badly hurt.</i>

55
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:25,113
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort.
And now, no longer.

56
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,022
The Hollands
was the most old family, miss.

57
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,561
They brought the colored folks
to the island...

58
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,927
the colored folks and Ti-Misery.

59
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:35,829
Ti-Misery? What's that?

60
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,360
A man, miss. An old man who lives
in the garden at Fort Holland.

61
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:44,532
With arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful,
weeping look on his black face.

62
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:45,837
Alive?

63
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,243
No, miss, he's just the same as he was
in the beginning...

64
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:51,679
on the front side of an enormous boat.

65
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,547
- You mean a figurehead.
- If you say, miss.

66
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:57,747
And the enormous boat
brought the long-ago fathers...

67
00:04:57,822 --> 00:05:02,350
and the long-ago mothers of us all,
chained to the bottom of the boat.

68
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:06,289
They brought you to a beautiful place,
didn't they?

69
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:08,730
If you say, miss. If you say.

70
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,072
<i>Fort Holland.</i>

71
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:27,215
<i>From the gate,</i>
<i>it seemed strangely dreamlike.</i>

72
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,310
<i>The garden had life of its own.</i>

73
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:32,618
<i>I was to know all the nooks and crannies</i>
<i>of that great house...</i>

74
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,490
<i>to love them or hate them,</i>
<i>according to what happened there.</i>

75
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:39,792
<i>In that house,</i>
<i>I was to hear a strange confession...</i>

76
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:44,062
<i>a confession only madness could have</i>
<i>wrung from the lips of a sane person.</i>

77
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,262
<i>And yet it was in the same room...</i>

78
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:50,205
<i>with the candles lit, that I made</i>
<i>the discovery of my own love...</i>

79
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:52,765
<i>knew happiness, deep through the heart.</i>

80
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,305
<i>My room...</i>

81
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:59,406
<i>I still can remember my delight,</i>
<i>unpacking, getting ready for dinner.</i>

82
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,976
<i>Yet, all the while,</i>
<i>I wondered at the stillness of Fort Holland.</i>

83
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:06,922
<i>The fact that I saw no one</i>
<i>on the garden paths or in the rooms.</i>

84
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:15,323
Yes?

85
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,232
- Miss Connell, it's dinner.
- Thank you.

86
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:30,839
- Miss Connell?
- Yes.

87
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:34,146
I'm Wesley Rand.
Paul wanted me to introduce myself.

88
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,351
It seems we're dining by ourselves,
Miss Connell.

89
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:39,719
But I think I'll introduce you
to everyone anyway.

90
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,419
Here in the master's chair, sits the master,
my half-brother, Paul Holland.

91
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:44,756
But you've met him already.

92
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,421
Yes, on the boat.

93
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:51,098
That chair in the corner
is the particular property of Mrs. Rand...

94
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,694
mother to both of us
and much too good for either of us...

95
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:55,864
too wise, in fact,
to live under the same roof.

96
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,773
- She prefers the village dispensary.
- She's a doctor?

97
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:00,606
No, she just runs the place.

98
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:03,442
She does everything else, though.
An amazing woman. You'd like her.

99
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:05,141
I like her already.

100
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,652
That's my chair,
and this is Miss Connell, who is beautiful.

101
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:10,050
Thank you.

102
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:11,611
Who sits there?

103
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:13,880
My brother's wife.

104
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:17,286
Here, this isn't cozy at all.

105
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:20,397
Makes me seem aloof,
and I'm anything but that.

106
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,058
But you are an American.

107
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:27,900
I went to school in Buffalo.
Paul went to school in England.

108
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:30,372
I wondered about your different accents.

109
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,638
I'm still wondering about your names,
Rand and Holland.

110
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:35,574
We're half-brothers.

111
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:37,637
Paul is Mother's first child.

112
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:41,515
When his father died, she married
my father, Dr. Rand, the missionary.

113
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:52,152
The jungle drums, mysterious, eerie.

114
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:57,062
That's the work drum
over at the sugar mill.

115
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:59,329
Saint Sebastian's version
of the factory whistle.

116
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:02,270
It means that the sugar syrup
is about ready to be poured.

117
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,035
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.

118
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,439
Of course.

119
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,807
It was nice of you
to spend this much time with me.

120
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:11,314
Don't worry, I wasn't missed. The only
important man around here is the owner.

121
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:13,850
- Mr. Holland?
- Yes, the redoubtable Paul.

122
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,785
He has the plantation, and I, as you
must have noticed, have the charm.

123
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:20,654
I don't know. He spoke to me on the boat
last night, and I liked him very much.

124
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:22,818
Yes, our Paul...

125
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,161
strong and silent and very sad...

126
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,198
quite the Byronic character.

127
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,931
Maybe I should cultivate it.

128
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:34,136
- Maybe you ought to go to the mill.
- It'll wait.

129
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:43,839
I was just going to the mill.

130
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:46,542
- Good night, Miss Connell.
- Good night.

131
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:50,948
- Have the servants made you comfortable?
- Yes, thank you.

132
00:08:51,522 --> 00:08:54,150
Looks very nice, Clement.
I'll take it to Mrs. Holland.

133
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:56,022
- Can't I take it for you?
- No, thank you.

134
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:58,721
Tomorrow's soon enough
for you to start work.

135
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:35,411
Mrs. Holland.

136
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,761
Mrs. Holland?

137
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,370
Mrs. Holland.

138
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,638
Mrs. Holland?

139
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:10,618
I didn't mean to get you up, Mrs. Holland.

140
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:12,744
Mrs. Holland.

141
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:38,374
Jessica!

142
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,215
Take Mrs. Holland to her room, Alma.

143
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,855
Come, Miss Jessica. Come with Alma.

144
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,055
I heard someone crying, a woman.

145
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:55,496
A woman crying?
There's been no crying here.

146
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,267
Mr. Paul, yes, there was crying tonight.

147
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,031
It was Alma,
her sister was brought a-birthing.

148
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,638
Thank you, Clement.

149
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:25,090
Clement, I'm going to stay
with Miss Jessica...

150
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:27,687
in case the nurse lady
takes to roaming again.

151
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,734
Don't you go crying anymore.
That's what frightened Miss Betsy.

152
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:34,168
She didn't soothe me any,
hollering around in the tower.

153
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:39,133
Why was the maid crying?

154
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:41,575
I'm not sure I can make you understand.

155
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:43,374
Do you know what this is?

156
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:46,881
- A figure of Saint Sebastian.
- Yes.

157
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,215
But it was once the figurehead
of a slave ship.

158
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,254
That's where our people came from...

159
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:53,517
from the misery and pain of slavery.

160
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:55,957
For generations, they found life a burden.

161
00:13:56,026 --> 00:14:00,156
That's why they still weep when a child
is born and make merry at a burial.

162
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:07,164
I've told you, Miss Connell,
this is a sad place.

163
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,353
Good morning, miss.

164
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,721
Thank you for waking me.

165
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:32,489
I didn't want to frighten you
out of your sleep, miss.

166
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:35,396
That's why I touched you
farthest from your heart.

167
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,225
Don't get up, miss.
I brought your breakfast...

168
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,167
just like I do for Miss Jessica.

169
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:44,435
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma.
You don't have to do that for me.

170
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,373
I know it, miss, but I like to do it.

171
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:49,674
I like to tend for Miss Jessica,
and I want to tend for you.

172
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:52,807
You settle right back now,
and I'll mix you your coffee.

173
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,407
Thank you.

174
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,749
Miss Jessica used to say
this is the only way...

175
00:14:57,821 --> 00:14:59,516
for a lady to break her fast...

176
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,718
in bed, with a lacy cushion
to bank her head on.

177
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:05,489
If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell.

178
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,460
She looked so pretty.

179
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,590
She must have been beautiful.

180
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,464
What happened to her, Alma?

181
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,629
She was very sick,
and then she went mindless, miss.

182
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,202
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma,
you and I.

183
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,607
I do my best.

184
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:24,512
Every day I dress her just as beautifully
as if she was well.

185
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,243
It's just like dressing a great big doll.

186
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:30,184
What's this?

187
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:33,485
A puffup, I call it.
But Miss Jessica always says <i>brioche.</i>

188
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,922
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast.

189
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:37,017
I don't know
whether I'll be able to get away with it.

190
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,598
I made it clear
in my letter to the company...

191
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,690
this is not a position for a frightened girl.

192
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,132
I am not a frightened girl.

193
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:47,636
That's hard to believe
after what happened last night.

194
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:49,764
If I were as timid as you seem to think,
Mr. Holland...

195
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,104
I wouldn't have gone to the tower
in the first place.

196
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:56,440
And what's so alarming about the tower,
Miss Connell?

197
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,205
Nothing really.

198
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:01,751
But you must admit
it's an eerie sort of place, so dark.

199
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:03,844
Surely, nurses aren't afraid of the dark?

200
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,183
Of course not.

201
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,159
I used to be afraid of the dark
when I was a child.

202
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,352
But I'm not afraid anymore.

203
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:18,490
Frankly, it was something of a shock to
see my patient that way for the first time.

204
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:21,732
Nobody had told me
Mrs. Holland was a mental case.

205
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:26,141
A mental case?

206
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,269
- I'm sorry.
- Why should you be?

207
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:30,370
My wife is a mental case.

208
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,613
Please remember that, Miss Connell...

209
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:36,517
particularly when some
of the foolish people on the island...

210
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:38,555
start regaling you with local legends.

211
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,523
You'll find superstition a contagious thing.

212
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:44,216
Some people let it get the better of them.

213
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:48,263
- I don't think you will.
- No.

214
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:53,132
Come along. I'll introduce you
to Dr. Maxwell and your patient.

215
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:56,672
I can't tell you how glad I am
to have you here, Miss Connell.

216
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,640
I know I'll enjoy working with you, Doctor.

217
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,201
I have an enormous respect for nurses,
but most of them scare me.

218
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,146
I always feel them behind my back,
looking at their training manuals...

219
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:08,013
counting my mistakes.

220
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:09,814
I'll keep tabs on you.

221
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,120
She makes a beautiful zombie,
doesn't she?

222
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:17,456
- It's pitiful.
- I knew Jessica. We were friends.

223
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,553
Sometimes it's better for a doctor
to laugh...

224
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,825
than pull a long face
when things are hopeless.

225
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:23,389
Yes, I know.

226
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:28,632
But I don't know about zombies, Doctor.
Just what is a zombie?

227
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,697
A ghost, a living dead. It's also a drink.

228
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:35,677
Yes, I tried one once,
but there wasn't anything dead about it.

229
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:38,806
But we have a more serious problem
to deal with, Miss Connell.

230
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:41,112
You want to know about your patient,
don't you?

231
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,379
Please.

232
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:44,978
I'll try to put it simply.

233
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:47,315
Mrs. Holland had a tropical fever...

234
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:48,722
very severe.

235
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:53,222
We might say that portions of the
spinal cord were burned out by this fever.

236
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:55,755
The result is what you see...

237
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,857
a woman without any willpower...

238
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:00,961
unable to speak or even act by herself.

239
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,063
Though she will obey simple commands.

240
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,574
- Does she suffer?
- I don't know.

241
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,304
I'd rather think of her as a sleepwalker
who can never be awakened...

242
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,779
feeling nothing, knowing nothing.

243
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,681
There's very little we can do
except keep her physically comfortable...

244
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:17,549
light diet, some exercise.

245
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:19,612
She can never be cured?

246
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,781
I've never heard of a cure.

247
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,126
Could you give me some details
of treatment and diet?

248
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:29,323
- I prepared these for you last night.
- Thank you.

249
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:33,262
I'll drop by in a day or so
to see how you are getting on.

250
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:42,802
You didn't find your patient so frightening
in the daylight, did you?

251
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,178
Mrs. Holland must have been
very beautiful.

252
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,342
Many people thought her beautiful.

253
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,718
Tell me, Miss Connell,
do you consider yourself pretty?

254
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:55,657
I don't know. I suppose so.

255
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:57,125
And charming?

256
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:59,594
- I've never given it much thought.
- Don't.

257
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:01,961
You'll save yourself
a great deal of trouble...

258
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,432
and other people
a great deal of unhappiness.

259
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:31,519
- Betsy, where are you going?
- It's my day off.

260
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:33,893
What in the world can you do
with a day off in St. Sebastian?

261
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,261
I was just beginning to wonder.

262
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:37,630
Aren't there shops and restaurants
and things here?

263
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:40,261
"And things" is a better description
of what you'll find.

264
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:42,237
I'd better come along
and show you the town.

265
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,603
Don't you have to work?

266
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:46,666
By a curious coincidence,
it's my day off, too.

267
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:53,474
<i>Some talk of Alexander</i>
<i>And some of Hercules</i>

268
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:58,149
<i>Of Hector and Lysander</i>
<i>And such great names as these</i>

269
00:19:58,755 --> 00:20:02,088
<i>But of all the world's great heroes</i>
<i>There's none that</i>

270
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,921
Ti-Joseph, better bring me another.
I have to keep the lady entertained.

271
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,397
Must be hard work entertaining me
if it requires six ounces of rum.

272
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:12,162
- Six ounces?
- Higher mathematics.

273
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:14,430
Two ounces to a drink.
Three drinks, six ounces.

274
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,699
How did you know there were two ounces
in a drink?

275
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:19,537
I'm a nurse. I always watch people
when they pour something.

276
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:22,772
I watched Ti-Joseph,
and it was exactly two ounces.

277
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:25,447
<i>There was a family</i>

278
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:30,350
<i>That lived on the isle of Saint Sebastian</i>
<i>A long, long while</i>

279
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,412
<i>The head of the family was a Holland man</i>

280
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,755
<i>And the younger brother</i>
<i>his name was Rand</i>

281
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:37,919
<i>Ah, woe</i>

282
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:41,863
Listen, did I ever tell you the story
about the little mule on the plantation?

283
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:43,661
Wait a minute, I want to listen.

284
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:46,794
<i>The Holland man, he kept in a tower</i>

285
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,431
<i>A wife as pretty as a big, white flower</i>

286
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:53,533
<i>She saw the brother</i>
<i>and she stole his heart</i>

287
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,875
<i>And that's how the badness</i>
<i>and the trouble start.</i>

288
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:04,519
Ti-Malice, you tripped up my tongue.
Why do you wish trouble me for?

289
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:07,318
You saw Mr. Rand go in there.
Why don't you tell me?

290
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,858
Apologize, that's what I'll do.

291
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:12,224
Creep in just like a little fox,
and warm myself in his heart.

292
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:15,890
I wouldn't have listened, Wesley,
if I'd realized I...

293
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,932
- Mr. Rand, I've come to apologize.
- All right.

294
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:24,073
It's just an old song
I picked up somewhere.

295
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:26,905
- Don't know who did make it up.
- All right, all right.

296
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:30,140
Some of these singers on this island,
they'd tattletale on anybody.

297
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:34,343
Believe me, I never would sing that song
if I'd known you were with a lady.

298
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,010
Get out of here!

299
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:40,182
Don't let it bother you so, Wesley.

300
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,258
You heard what he sang.

301
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:43,989
Shocked?

302
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:47,330
- I just wish I hadn't heard.
- Why?

303
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:49,922
Everybody else knows it, Paul saw to that.

304
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,060
Sometimes I think he planned
the whole thing from the beginning...

305
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:54,660
just to watch me squirm.

306
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:56,330
That doesn't sound like him.

307
00:21:56,406 --> 00:22:00,240
That's right, he's playing
the noble husband for you, isn't he?

308
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,711
That won't last long.

309
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,979
I think we'd better go now.
Will you take me home?

310
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:10,584
One of these days he will start on you
just like he did on her.

311
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:13,748
"You think life's beautiful,
don't you, Jessica?"

312
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:17,087
"You think you're beautiful,
don't you, Jessica?"

313
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:21,053
What he could do to that word "beautiful."

314
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:23,998
That's Paul's great weapon, words.

315
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,694
He uses them like other men use their fist.

316
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,145
Wes, it's time we started home.

317
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,820
<i>The wife and the brother, they want to go</i>

318
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,953
<i>But the Holland man, he tell them no</i>

319
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:58,392
<i>The wife fall down and the evil came</i>

320
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:01,960
<i>And it burned her mind in the fever flame</i>

321
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,007
Wes, we must get back to Fort Holland.

322
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:09,604
<i>Shame and sorrow for the family</i>

323
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,143
<i>Her eyes are empty and she cannot talk</i>

324
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:16,777
<i>And a nurse has come to make her walk</i>

325
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,385
<i>The brothers are Ionely</i>
<i>and the nurse is young</i>

326
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:23,923
<i>And now you must see</i>
<i>that my song is sung</i>

327
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:27,756
<i>Ah, woe, ah, me</i>

328
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:30,990
<i>Shame and sorrow for the family</i>

329
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:35,031
<i>Ah, woe, ah, me</i>

330
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:38,932
<i>Shame and sorrow for the family</i>

331
00:23:40,777 --> 00:23:43,268
- I think you need some help.
- I'm afraid so.

332
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:45,447
Ti-Joseph...

333
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:49,417
get Mr. Rand onto his horse
and start him toward the Fort.

334
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:51,044
But he's in no condition to ride.

335
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,112
I don't think he could even sit
in the saddle.

336
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,714
Don't worry about a sugar planter.

337
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:58,090
Give him a horse,
and he'll ride to his own funeral.

338
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:05,757
I really intended going out to the Fort
and meeting you long before this.

339
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:08,368
I'm Mrs. Rand, Wesley's mother.

340
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,766
Mrs. Rand...

341
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,434
Now don't tell me you're sorry
that I should meet you this way.

342
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,911
I'm even a little glad that
Wesley's difficulties brought us together.

343
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,175
Believe me, he doesn't do this often. It's...

344
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,776
Nonsense. I know Wesley's been drinking
too much lately.

345
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:27,456
I know a great deal more about
what goes on at the Fort than you'd think.

346
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,085
I know all about you...

347
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,492
that you're a nice girl, competent...

348
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:34,655
and kind to Jessica.

349
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:36,756
The Fort needs a girl like you.

350
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:39,096
Come, I must get you back there.

351
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:41,160
I'll walk back with you and stay the night.

352
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:44,105
- The change will do me good.
- Thanks, Mrs. Rand.

353
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:47,169
I think you're every bit as nice
as Wesley says you are.

354
00:24:47,244 --> 00:24:50,736
So, he says I'm nice.
He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell...

355
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:52,441
a very nice boy.

356
00:24:53,183 --> 00:24:55,981
I'm worried about his drinking, though.

357
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,754
You could do me a great favor.

358
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:00,187
I'd love to.

359
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:02,487
Use your influence with Paul.

360
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,188
Ask him to take the whiskey decanter
off the dinner table.

361
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:09,061
- I have no influence with Mr. Holland.
- Try it.

362
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:11,531
You may have more than you think.

363
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:19,539
No, it's not a drought, Bayard.
Rain's just a little late, that's all.

364
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:21,702
I've seen the drought before, Mr. Holland.

365
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:24,576
The cane is too dry,
and it's dangerous that way.

366
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,513
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

367
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:30,417
I heard about your little misadventure
yesterday. On your first day off, too.

368
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,786
- I had a good time up to a point.
- Wes can be very entertaining.

369
00:25:33,857 --> 00:25:36,348
Yes, he can. But I was wondering...

370
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:39,122
you know, if you could leave
the whiskey decanter off the table...

371
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:41,220
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.

372
00:25:41,298 --> 00:25:44,734
I can remember it
in my grandfather's time and my father's.

373
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:47,668
But it must be an added temptation
to Wesley and...

374
00:25:47,737 --> 00:25:50,604
though your brother is not
an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland...

375
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,835
I can tell you, as a nurse,
that it won't be long.

376
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:56,868
Miss Connell, I engaged you to take care
of my wife, not my brother.

377
00:25:56,946 --> 00:26:00,382
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay
where it is.

378
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,428
There they go.

379
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,560
Bayard told me they were going
to ask Damballah for rain.

380
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:22,332
The fields are as dry as dust.

381
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:24,066
But what is it, Mr. Holland?

382
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,267
It's a big seashell, a conch.

383
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:30,177
They make a sort of bugle out of it
to call the faithful to the <i>houmfort.</i>

384
00:26:30,246 --> 00:26:32,544
But I don't know what a <i>houmfort</i> is
or a Damballah.

385
00:26:32,615 --> 00:26:34,879
It's voodoo. The <i>houmfort</i> is the temple...

386
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:37,647
and Damballah is one of the gods,
the big papa god.

387
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,279
You don't seem very disturbed by it.

388
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:41,984
I thought voodoo was something
everyone was frightened of.

389
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,026
I am afraid it's not very frightening.

390
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:46,324
They sing and dance and carry on.

391
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,160
And then, as I understand it,
one of the gods comes down...

392
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,632
and speaks through one of the people.

393
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,597
For some reason,
they always pick a night like this.

394
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:57,105
This hot wind even sets me on edge.

395
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,271
Clement, you've forgotten the decanter.

396
00:27:01,811 --> 00:27:05,645
I think from now on, Wes,
we'll try serving dinner without it.

397
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:07,515
That's odd.

398
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,212
What are you trying to do,
impress Miss Connell?

399
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:12,777
You would make a better impression
without whiskey.

400
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:13,880
Thank you.

401
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:17,757
You've always had such tender concern
for me and for Jessica.

402
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,254
- Let's drop it, Wes.
- Why?

403
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:23,758
It isn't considered polite
to quarrel before ladies.

404
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:27,200
I see, let's be reserved and gentlemanly.

405
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:31,972
You were so reserved and gentlemanly,
so polite, that night with Jessica.

406
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,702
- I remember...
- Wes!

407
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:39,172
Miss Connell...

408
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:44,152
I think it will be better if I had Clement
bring the rest of your dinner to your room.

409
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,927
I heard you playing.

410
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,765
I often do.

411
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,633
I know what you went through tonight.

412
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,899
I kept thinking of what you said...

413
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:39,806
that all good things died here violently.

414
00:28:42,912 --> 00:28:44,641
Why did you come in here?

415
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,504
I don't know.

416
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,349
I wanted to help you.

417
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,388
And now that I'm here, I don't know how.

418
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,218
You have helped me.

419
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:58,417
I want you to know
that I'm sorry I ever brought you here.

420
00:28:58,495 --> 00:29:02,659
When I thought of a nurse, I thought
of someone hard and impersonal.

421
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:06,828
I love Fort Holland.

422
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:08,768
And what you saw tonight...

423
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:10,999
two brothers set against each other...

424
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:13,065
and a woman driven mad
by her own husband...

425
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:14,700
do you love that?

426
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:16,506
You didn't drive her mad.

427
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:24,218
Before Jessica was taken ill,
there was a scene...

428
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:27,346
an ugly scene.

429
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:29,888
I told her she couldn't go...

430
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,894
that I'd keep her here by force,
if necessary.

431
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:36,931
You never knew Jessica as she was.

432
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,667
I think it would be best for all of us
not to discuss this again.

433
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,437
Thank you. I know you meant to be kind.

434
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:02,248
<i>I don't know how their own love</i>
<i>is revealed to other women.</i>

435
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:05,021
<i>Maybe in their sweetheart's arms,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

436
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:06,822
<i>To me it came that night...</i>

437
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:09,763
<i>after Paul Holland had almost thrust me</i>
<i>from the room...</i>

438
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:11,891
<i>certainly from his life.</i>

439
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,027
<i>I said I love him.</i>

440
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:18,235
<i>Even as I said it,</i>
<i>I knew he still loved his wife.</i>

441
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:23,402
<i>And then, because I loved him,</i>
<i>I felt I had to restore her to him...</i>

442
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,214
<i>to make her what she'd been before...</i>

443
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:28,476
<i>to make him happy.</i>

444
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,391
All that you say comes to the same thing.

445
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,553
You are asking me to pass a sentence
of life or death on my wife.

446
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,655
Insulin shock treatment
is an extreme measure, Paul...

447
00:30:42,732 --> 00:30:45,701
as Miss Connell pointed out
when she suggested it to me, but...

448
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:49,363
You admit that this is terribly dangerous.
So why do you advise it?

449
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:53,102
I've worked with it. I've seen cures.
It's at least a hope.

450
00:30:53,176 --> 00:30:56,907
It's the very danger itself, Paul,
that makes the cure possible.

451
00:30:57,213 --> 00:30:59,704
Insulin produces a state of coma.

452
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:03,149
Then the patient is revived
by a violent shock to the nerves.

453
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:05,915
That shock can kill, but it can also cure.

454
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,987
I don't know.

455
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,554
It's a hard decision to make,
but yours is only a technical responsibility.

456
00:31:15,698 --> 00:31:18,394
Technical responsibility.
Real responsibility.

457
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:20,265
The question is, will she live or die?

458
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,396
You're wrong, Mr. Holland.
It isn't a question of life or death.

459
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:25,100
Your wife isn't living.

460
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,166
She's in a world
that's empty of joy or meaning.

461
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:30,872
We have a chance
to give her life back to her.

462
00:31:58,341 --> 00:32:01,139
- Well?
- She's alive, that's all.

463
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:07,007
Don't take it so much to heart, Betsy.

464
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,812
I imagined it so differently.

465
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:14,280
I've been waiting for hours,
trying to imagine Jessica well again.

466
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:16,754
And I come bringing you nothing.

467
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:19,624
Instead, you come bringing me sympathy,
Betsy...

468
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:22,597
and a generous heart. Don't forget that.

469
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:25,357
Don't call that nothing.

470
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,933
Very sad. Very sweet.

471
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:35,573
The noble husband and the noble nurse
comforting each other...

472
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:37,670
because the patient still lives.

473
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:41,540
I've been imagining, too, Paul...

474
00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:44,643
only I didn't have to wonder how I'd feel.

475
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:46,483
I knew.

476
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:51,224
I'm not in love with another woman.

477
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:12,207
I'm sorry, Miss Betsy.
I'll take it right away.

478
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,011
That's all right, Alma.
Is this your sister's baby?

479
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:18,281
Yes, Miss Betsy. This is little Ti-Victor
and my sister, Melisse.

480
00:33:18,354 --> 00:33:20,982
I'm so glad I came out.
I've been wanting to meet you, Melisse.

481
00:33:21,057 --> 00:33:22,285
More so, miss.

482
00:33:22,358 --> 00:33:25,521
He's a wonderful baby. He's beautiful, yes.

483
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:27,124
He's chosen you, miss.

484
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:30,290
That's what we say, Miss Betsy,
when a baby first goes visiting.

485
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:32,698
Those he smiles at will be his friends.

486
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:34,760
That makes me very proud.

487
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:36,999
Here, Ti-Victor.

488
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:40,300
That's so you won't forget I'm your friend.

489
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:42,241
Thanks, Miss Betsy.

490
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:49,411
It's nice to see people so happy.

491
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:51,610
They're not always happy, Miss Betsy.

492
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:52,984
I suppose not.

493
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:56,750
Things so bad nobody can help,
not even Dr. Maxwell.

494
00:33:57,226 --> 00:33:59,888
Doctors and nurses
can do only so much, Alma.

495
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:01,854
They can't cure everything.

496
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:04,798
Doctors that are people
can't cure everything.

497
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:06,834
What do you mean
"doctors that are people"?

498
00:34:06,903 --> 00:34:10,202
There are other doctors.
Yes, other doctors.

499
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:11,570
Better doctors.

500
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:13,773
- Where?
- At the <i>houmfort.</i>

501
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:15,543
That's nonsense, Alma.

502
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:18,136
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.

503
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:19,714
Mama Rose was mindless.

504
00:34:19,782 --> 00:34:23,582
I was at the <i>houmfort</i> when the <i>houngan</i>
brought her mind back.

505
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:26,554
- Was Mama Rose like Mrs. Holland?
- No.

506
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:29,318
She was mindless
but not like Miss Jessica.

507
00:34:29,392 --> 00:34:30,882
But the <i>houngan</i> cured her.

508
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,760
Are you trying to tell me that
the voodoo priest could cure Mrs. Holland?

509
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:37,231
Yes, Miss Betsy, I mean that.

510
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:39,760
The <i>houngan</i> will speak
to the rada drums...

511
00:34:39,836 --> 00:34:42,600
and the drums will speak
to Legba and Damballah.

512
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:46,034
Better doctors.

513
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:57,780
Ti-Peter, how do you ever expect
to get to heaven with one foot...

514
00:34:57,854 --> 00:35:01,153
in the voodoo <i>houmfort</i>
and the other in the church?

515
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:03,353
Get along with you.

516
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,160
Some of this native nonsense.

517
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:10,393
The <i>houngan</i> has his prescription,
and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.

518
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,332
You never talked
about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.

519
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,563
Haven't I? I suppose I take it for granted.

520
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:18,664
- It's just part of everyday life here.
- You don't believe in it?

521
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,972
A missionary's widow?
Isn't very likely, is it?

522
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:25,536
I don't mean believe in it
like believing in a religion.

523
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:28,616
I mean, do you believe it has power?

524
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:31,380
Do you think it could cure a sick person?

525
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:34,048
Frankly, my dear,
I didn't expect anything like that...

526
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:36,216
from a nice levelheaded girl like you.

527
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,953
What are you driving at?

528
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:41,519
I heard the servants talking
about Mama Rose.

529
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,963
They said she'd been mindless.

530
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,964
Her son drowned. It affected her mind.

531
00:35:48,037 --> 00:35:52,167
The <i>houngan</i> cured her
by giving her a little practical psychology.

532
00:35:57,513 --> 00:36:00,038
What if I took Jessica to see him?

533
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,016
You don't know what goes on
at the <i>houmfort.</i>

534
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:04,075
It might be very dangerous
to take her there...

535
00:36:04,153 --> 00:36:05,882
dangerous for both of you.

536
00:36:06,022 --> 00:36:07,785
These people are primitive.

537
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:11,588
Things that are natural to them
might shock and horrify you.

538
00:36:13,062 --> 00:36:16,361
- I'm not easily frightened.
- That may be the pity of it.

539
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,762
I'm going to the <i>houmfort,</i> Alma.

540
00:37:03,045 --> 00:37:06,572
You go right from the mill
to an obeah sign in the cane.

541
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:11,112
Here you turn
and face a banyan tree on the hill.

542
00:37:11,988 --> 00:37:15,822
Walk toward it and keep walking.
Keep walking, Miss Betsy...

543
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:18,155
and you'll come to the crossroads.

544
00:37:18,227 --> 00:37:22,220
There's a guard there, Carrefour.
He keeps the crossroads.

545
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:26,699
But he won't do you no harm
when he sees the voodoo patches.

546
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,966
He'll let you pass.

547
00:42:57,433 --> 00:42:58,991
Where are my people?

548
00:42:59,068 --> 00:43:03,095
Let them bring me the rice cakes.
Let them dance and be happy.

549
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:52,519
Damballah, this woman is ill.

550
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,627
Mrs. Rand.

551
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:08,231
I knew you'd come.

552
00:44:08,303 --> 00:44:10,669
I couldn't let you go back
without some word.

553
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:14,334
I came here to tell you again
Jessica cannot be cured.

554
00:44:15,244 --> 00:44:16,768
But what are you doing here?

555
00:44:36,198 --> 00:44:38,894
...and when my husband died,
I was helpless.

556
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,366
They disobeyed me.

557
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:45,002
And, accidentally, I discovered the secret
of how to deal with them.

558
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:47,666
There was a woman with a baby.

559
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:52,112
Again and again, I begged her
to boil the drinking water. She wouldn't.

560
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,048
Then I told her the god Shango...

561
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:58,348
would kill the evil spirits in the water
if she boiled it.

562
00:44:58,854 --> 00:45:01,345
From then on, she boiled the water.

563
00:45:01,423 --> 00:45:03,653
But that still doesn't explain
why you're here.

564
00:45:03,725 --> 00:45:06,159
Perhaps not, but I am here.

565
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:10,157
It seems so simple
to let the gods speak through me.

566
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,701
I should have known
there's no easy way to do good, Betsy.

567
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,473
- She doesn't bleed.
- Zombie.

568
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,975
She doesn't bleed.

569
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:01,148
Get her back to the Fort, Betsy.

570
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,411
Do as I say. They won't hurt you.

571
00:46:09,024 --> 00:46:11,788
Leave them alone. Let them go.

572
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:35,976
Where have you been, Miss Connell?

573
00:46:39,388 --> 00:46:42,915
- I wanted to help you.
- Help me? How?

574
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,321
I took Mrs. Holland to the <i>houmfort.</i>

575
00:46:48,797 --> 00:46:51,061
I thought they might cure her.

576
00:46:52,367 --> 00:46:55,359
There's no telling what
you may have started with this insanity.

577
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,429
Because you wanted to give my wife
back to me?

578
00:46:58,507 --> 00:47:01,169
Why should that mean so much to you?

579
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:02,871
You know why.

580
00:47:03,879 --> 00:47:06,575
You saw it the other night at the piano.

581
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:11,911
What I saw the other night
I could hardly believe, Betsy.

582
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:17,021
I thought I was looking at a woman
who had compassion for me...

583
00:47:17,526 --> 00:47:19,016
who loved me.

584
00:47:20,095 --> 00:47:22,427
And yet you made that trip
to the <i>houmfort...</i>

585
00:47:22,497 --> 00:47:24,328
to bring Jessica back to me.

586
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,603
You, the nurse who's afraid of the dark.

587
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:33,499
Yes.

588
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:37,741
You think I love Jessica
and want her back.

589
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,872
It's like you to think that,
clean, decent thinking.

590
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,020
I wish it were true...

591
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,424
perhaps for your sake.

592
00:47:57,032 --> 00:47:58,522
Mind me now, horse.

593
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:00,697
Come away from there.

594
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:05,172
Are you ever stubborn.

595
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,731
Just like that old Sabreur man
at the <i>houmfort...</i>

596
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:10,539
sticking your nose in places
where it isn't wanted...

597
00:48:10,612 --> 00:48:12,637
making trouble for everybody.

598
00:48:14,716 --> 00:48:15,705
Alma.

599
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:18,515
You try it this way.

600
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:21,853
Turn your back on him.

601
00:48:22,658 --> 00:48:24,649
You see, that's the way it is with a horse.

602
00:48:24,726 --> 00:48:27,320
You can't look at him
and lead him at the same time.

603
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:29,557
Sounds sort of manlike, doesn't it?

604
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:32,358
- Whose horse?
- The police horse.

605
00:48:32,434 --> 00:48:34,959
Police? I didn't know
there was a policeman on the island.

606
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,470
Just this horse, Miss Betsy.

607
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,530
When they asked the Commissioner
if any policemen were wanted...

608
00:48:39,608 --> 00:48:43,237
he said my horse is all the police
we need on Saint Sebastian.

609
00:48:43,311 --> 00:48:44,403
Commissioner?

610
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:47,312
Yes, Miss Betsy.
I expect there's some trouble...

611
00:48:47,616 --> 00:48:50,278
not just little trouble,
like Mr. Rand gets into...

612
00:48:50,352 --> 00:48:53,879
when he's been drinking more than a little,
but real big trouble.

613
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:57,288
You don't suppose it's because I took
Mrs. Holland to the <i>houmfort,</i> do you?

614
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,385
They haven't been talking loud enough
for me to hear, Miss Betsy.

615
00:49:00,462 --> 00:49:03,625
But I've been holding this horse
for coming on close to an hour.

616
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:05,963
And they've been just talking and talking.

617
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:08,002
I feel it's something very bad.

618
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:11,763
You do have a horse to hold, Alma...

619
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,173
and Mrs. Rand has asked me
to have a cup of tea with her.

620
00:49:15,377 --> 00:49:17,242
Horse, you stand still.

621
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:53,511
You're staying here with Jessica tonight,
Betsy?

622
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:56,380
- Mrs. Rand thought it might be best.
- She's right.

623
00:49:58,754 --> 00:50:00,779
I've caused you so much trouble, Paul.

624
00:50:00,856 --> 00:50:02,881
No, it was bound to come.

625
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,385
As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here.
I want to talk to you.

626
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,362
Perhaps when you're finished in here,
you'd come into the garden.

627
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:11,899
Is it about this afternoon?
I saw the Commissioner here.

628
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,061
Jeffries? Yes, he was here.
He and Maxwell.

629
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,831
They're in a great stew about it.

630
00:50:16,905 --> 00:50:18,429
Seems those people up at the <i>houmfort...</i>

631
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:21,340
won't stop drumming and dancing
till they've gotten Jessica back...

632
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:24,071
and finished their ritual tests,
something of that sort.

633
00:50:25,213 --> 00:50:29,809
For her own safety, Jeffries and Maxwell
want Jessica sent away to Saint Thomas...

634
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:31,147
to the asylum.

635
00:50:32,053 --> 00:50:34,317
- It might be best.
- Maybe.

636
00:50:34,856 --> 00:50:36,949
But Wesley insists she stay here.

637
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:38,715
But he hasn't the right.

638
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:41,661
He hasn't any legal right,
if that's what you mean.

639
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:44,899
But he says that I am responsible
for Jessica's illness...

640
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:47,230
that I deliberately drove her insane.

641
00:50:48,203 --> 00:50:50,364
You couldn't have done that, Paul.

642
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:51,867
I don't know.

643
00:50:52,274 --> 00:50:54,970
I've gone over it and over it,
and I don't know.

644
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:47,192
I want you out of it.
I want you to go back to Canada, Betsy.

645
00:51:47,262 --> 00:51:48,320
Why?

646
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,694
Because of Jessica. Because of myself.

647
00:51:51,032 --> 00:51:53,796
Because I don't want you
to be made miserable and unhappy.

648
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:55,336
But I want to stay.

649
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:59,333
I'm afraid it's not what you want.
I want you back in Canada.

650
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:02,506
Naturally, as my employer,
you have the right to dismiss me.

651
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,546
Don't, Betsy.
You know that isn't what I mean.

652
00:52:06,848 --> 00:52:09,146
You remember the first night I saw you?

653
00:52:09,217 --> 00:52:12,209
You were looking at the sea.
You were enchanted.

654
00:52:12,721 --> 00:52:15,281
But I felt I had to destroy
that enchantment...

655
00:52:15,357 --> 00:52:17,382
make you see ugliness and cruelty.

656
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:19,484
- You were trying to warn me.
- No.

657
00:52:19,794 --> 00:52:21,523
I was trying to hurt you.

658
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,963
It was the same way with Jessica.
I had to hurt her.

659
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:28,400
Everything she did or said
made me lash out at her.

660
00:52:28,637 --> 00:52:30,468
That's why I want you to go.

661
00:52:30,972 --> 00:52:32,337
You see, Betsy...

662
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,509
since you've been here...

663
00:52:36,578 --> 00:52:40,378
I've seen how fine and sweet things
can be between a man and a woman...

664
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,575
how love can be calm and good.

665
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:48,111
I'd rather not have that sort of love,
than have it and destroy it.

666
00:52:48,189 --> 00:52:49,918
You want me to leave you?

667
00:52:50,158 --> 00:52:51,750
That's why I want you to go.

668
00:52:51,826 --> 00:52:55,489
It's no good for you to stay
so long as I have this fear of myself.

669
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,769
Paul.

670
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,983
What are you doing here?

671
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,925
Get out of here.

672
00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:48,661
Carrefour!

673
00:55:50,672 --> 00:55:52,162
Carrefour, go back.

674
00:56:00,582 --> 00:56:04,211
Paul, let him go.
Don't touch him. Don't try to stop him.

675
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:26,334
I can send this off by the next boat.

676
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:28,739
If you have any letters,
you'd better get them ready...

677
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,141
to go with this parcel.

678
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:32,406
Any news I have can wait till I get home.

679
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,744
It will be pretty stale by that time.

680
00:56:34,883 --> 00:56:36,714
Perhaps not, Mother.

681
00:56:37,552 --> 00:56:39,315
Betsy is leaving us.

682
00:56:39,921 --> 00:56:42,389
Why, Betsy, we can't lose you.

683
00:56:42,924 --> 00:56:46,724
We've grown to depend on you.
I have and I know Paul has.

684
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:48,785
Mother, Betsy has her reasons.

685
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:53,963
I hope you won't feel I'm deserting you
or think badly of me.

686
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,866
Think badly of you, Betsy?

687
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:02,038
Dr. Maxwell has
some unpleasant news for us.

688
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,908
- An accident at the mill?
- No, it's about Jessica.

689
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:07,948
A result of our discussion
the other day, I'm afraid.

690
00:57:08,016 --> 00:57:09,210
What about her?

691
00:57:09,284 --> 00:57:12,879
In view of all the circumstances,
some of the things Wesley's been saying...

692
00:57:12,954 --> 00:57:16,549
and the fact that one of the voodoo people
got into your house last night...

693
00:57:16,624 --> 00:57:19,149
the Commissioner has decided
on a legal investigation.

694
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,694
In other words, I'm on trial.

695
00:57:20,762 --> 00:57:22,252
I wouldn't put it that way, Paul...

696
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,561
but there's been a lot of talk.
The whole thing's getting out of hand.

697
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:28,261
A pretty scene, half the island
crowding into the courtroom...

698
00:57:28,336 --> 00:57:30,270
to watch our dirty linen
get a public scrubbing.

699
00:57:30,338 --> 00:57:32,329
Wait a bit, Wes.
Let's talk this over with the...

700
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,467
Talk it over! Talk now, Paul,
and tell them that you're not responsible...

701
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:40,011
that every bit of this doesn't rest squarely
on your shoulders.

702
00:57:40,815 --> 00:57:43,841
If you'll be good enough
to take me to the Commissioner, Doctor.

703
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,081
I think there'll be no need
of an investigation.

704
00:57:47,155 --> 00:57:50,352
But why, Mrs. Rand?
What could you have to tell him?

705
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,393
Jessica is not insane.

706
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:54,519
Please take me to the Commissioner.

707
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,223
I can explain the whole thing to him.

708
00:57:56,297 --> 00:57:58,458
Mother, what are you trying to say?

709
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:00,395
She is dead.

710
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:02,301
Now, Mrs. Rand.

711
00:58:02,837 --> 00:58:04,099
She is dead...

712
00:58:04,672 --> 00:58:06,230
living and dead.

713
00:58:06,674 --> 00:58:10,610
Mrs. Rand, you're not seriously trying
to tell me that my patient is a zombie?

714
00:58:10,678 --> 00:58:12,009
I'm not mad.

715
00:58:12,814 --> 00:58:13,940
It's true.

716
00:58:15,016 --> 00:58:16,574
- I did it.
- Mother.

717
00:58:16,718 --> 00:58:18,345
Wesley, let me explain.

718
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,980
I wanted to so often. Now I have to.

719
00:58:24,492 --> 00:58:28,519
Betsy, tell them about the <i>houmfort,</i>
tell them what you saw there.

720
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,865
You must, Betsy,
they'll have to believe you.

721
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,333
Mrs. Rand was at the <i>houmfort...</i>

722
00:58:35,403 --> 00:58:36,995
but there's nothing wrong with that.

723
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:38,299
She's gone there for years...

724
00:58:38,373 --> 00:58:40,500
trying to take care of those people,
to help them.

725
00:58:40,575 --> 00:58:42,236
I think I understand.

726
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,303
I've often talked a little voodoo
to get medicine down a patient's throat.

727
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:51,145
But it was more than that, Doctor.
I entered into their ceremonies.

728
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:54,483
I pretended I was possessed by their gods.

729
00:58:55,857 --> 00:58:58,087
But what I did to Jessica...

730
00:58:59,193 --> 00:59:02,128
It was when she wanted to go away
with Wesley.

731
00:59:02,196 --> 00:59:04,630
That night, I went to the <i>houmfort.</i>

732
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:07,896
I kept seeing her face smiling
because she was beautiful enough...

733
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:11,166
to take my family in her hands
and tear it apart.

734
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:14,832
The drums, the chanting, the lights.

735
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:18,410
I heard a voice speaking
in the sudden silence...

736
00:59:19,947 --> 00:59:21,278
my voice.

737
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,382
I was speaking to the <i>houngan.</i>

738
00:59:25,086 --> 00:59:26,644
I was possessed.

739
00:59:28,156 --> 00:59:30,624
I told him the woman
at Fort Holland was evil...

740
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,853
and asked him to make her a zombie.

741
00:59:33,094 --> 00:59:34,789
Then what happened?

742
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,587
I hated myself.

743
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:39,494
On the way home,
I said over and over again...

744
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:41,626
there were no such people...

745
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,463
no strange drugs...

746
00:59:46,274 --> 00:59:49,243
- there was no such thing as a zombie.
- You were right.

747
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,976
I said it, and I made myself believe it.

748
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,314
But when I got here,
Jessica was raging with fever.

749
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,442
She was raging with fever.

750
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:02,046
A fever with a long Latin name
and a bad reputation for its aftereffects...

751
01:00:02,957 --> 01:00:04,686
usually some form of insanity.

752
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:06,249
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.

753
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:08,454
You were tricked
by your own imagination, Mrs. Rand.

754
01:00:08,663 --> 01:00:11,393
But I am not an imaginative
or fanciful woman, Doctor.

755
01:00:11,466 --> 01:00:13,127
As I understand it...

756
01:00:13,201 --> 01:00:15,795
in order to turn a person into a zombie...

757
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:18,430
whether by poison or hocus-pocus...

758
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,335
you must first kill that person.

759
01:00:21,442 --> 01:00:22,704
Is that right?

760
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:24,166
Yes.

761
01:00:24,278 --> 01:00:26,906
She was feverish. She was delirious.

762
01:00:27,815 --> 01:00:30,215
But I don't remember her dying...

763
01:00:30,518 --> 01:00:33,351
or even being in a state resembling death.

764
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,249
No coma, nothing.

765
01:00:38,326 --> 01:00:41,659
I'm afraid you are an imaginative woman,
Mrs. Rand.

766
01:00:42,997 --> 01:00:44,362
Of course.

767
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:47,990
Of course.

768
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:21,028
Jessica.

769
01:01:23,571 --> 01:01:24,560
Jessica.

770
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,030
Jessica.

771
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:30,275
She won't obey me.

772
01:01:30,511 --> 01:01:31,500
Jessica!

773
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:45,688
It's the <i>houmfort...</i>

774
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:47,928
they're trying to get her back.

775
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,793
But how can they?
How could they make her understand?

776
01:01:50,865 --> 01:01:52,093
How would she know?

777
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,428
They know how.

778
01:01:53,568 --> 01:01:56,969
They have charms that can draw a man
halfway around the world.

779
01:01:57,071 --> 01:01:59,130
Obeah tricks, magic...

780
01:01:59,607 --> 01:02:01,131
everybody knows that.

781
01:02:01,209 --> 01:02:03,905
We may have believed all that
when we were boys, Wes.

782
01:02:03,978 --> 01:02:06,742
But we're grown men now.
We know it's all nonsense.

783
01:02:06,814 --> 01:02:08,042
- Do we?
- Yes.

784
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:10,140
- You've forgotten...
- I have not forgotten.

785
01:02:10,218 --> 01:02:13,153
I could see what was in your mind
when Maxwell was talking.

786
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:15,587
Just because he didn't know
about Jessica's coma...

787
01:02:15,656 --> 01:02:17,624
you thought everything
he said was wrong...

788
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,489
and that mother's story was right.

789
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,755
- That's ridiculous.
- It is true.

790
01:02:22,129 --> 01:02:23,858
Why did she come out here?

791
01:02:23,998 --> 01:02:26,660
How can they make her move,
do anything they want?

792
01:02:26,734 --> 01:02:28,531
They can make anybody
do what they want.

793
01:02:28,603 --> 01:02:30,833
You're thinking
just as they want you to think.

794
01:02:30,905 --> 01:02:32,429
That's what it's for...

795
01:02:32,673 --> 01:02:34,766
the conches, their cheap mummery.

796
01:02:34,909 --> 01:02:36,001
Let me in.

797
01:02:36,744 --> 01:02:38,336
Come with me, Jessica.

798
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:41,571
You saw that.

799
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,910
I saw nothing
that would convince a sober man.

800
01:02:45,987 --> 01:02:48,353
You better get some sleep, Wes.

801
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,806
Why don't you go to bed, Wes?
It's been a hard day for all of us.

802
01:03:15,716 --> 01:03:17,411
I'm sorry, Wes.

803
01:03:17,652 --> 01:03:19,847
I think I know how you must feel...

804
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,616
and I am sorry.

805
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,988
I only wish
there was something I could do.

806
01:03:25,059 --> 01:03:26,890
She ought to be free.

807
01:03:30,698 --> 01:03:32,757
You could free her, Betsy.

808
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,395
You could do it.
You're a nurse. You have the drugs.

809
01:03:35,469 --> 01:03:36,959
It would be so quick.

810
01:03:38,806 --> 01:03:41,832
Her heart beats. She breathes.
That's life, Wes.

811
01:03:44,078 --> 01:03:46,569
I once took an oath to guard life.

812
01:03:47,548 --> 01:03:48,947
I shouldn't have asked it of you.

813
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:51,075
But it was only because
I can't make you believe...

814
01:03:51,152 --> 01:03:52,676
that she's already dead.

815
01:03:53,554 --> 01:03:55,215
Wait a minute.

816
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,624
There's one other thing.

817
01:03:57,992 --> 01:03:59,289
You love Paul.

818
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:03,294
Then what good will it ever do you
if Jessica is still...

819
01:04:03,364 --> 01:04:04,353
Wesley.

820
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:09,132
I'm afraid I love him too much for that.

821
01:04:10,671 --> 01:04:11,865
I'm sorry.

822
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:45,816
<i>Oh, Lord God, most holy...</i>

823
01:07:45,953 --> 01:07:49,389
<i>deliver them</i>
<i>from the bitter pains of eternal death.</i>

824
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,758
<i>The woman was a wicked woman...</i>

825
01:07:51,826 --> 01:07:54,386
<i>and she was dead in her own life.</i>

826
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:55,790
<i>Yea, Lord...</i>

827
01:07:55,896 --> 01:07:58,922
<i>dead in the selfishness of her spirit...</i>

828
01:07:59,066 --> 01:08:01,227
<i>and the man followed her.</i>

829
01:08:01,302 --> 01:08:04,032
<i>Her steps led him down to evil.</i>

830
01:08:04,271 --> 01:08:06,569
<i>Her feet took hold on death.</i>

831
01:08:07,007 --> 01:08:08,668
<i>Forgive him, oh, Lord...</i>

832
01:08:08,843 --> 01:08:11,869
<i>who knowest the secret of all hearts.</i>

833
01:08:12,346 --> 01:08:13,813
<i>Yea, Lord...</i>

834
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,149
<i>pity them who are dead...</i>

835
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:19,510
<i>and give peace and happiness</i>
<i>to the living.</i>

836
01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:37,526
