00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,951
will you tell us what it is, please,
that the Maypole represents?

317
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,911
[Sighs heavily]

318
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,634
Really, Daisy.
You've been told often enough.

319
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,434
- Miss Rose, I know!
- I know!

320
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,200
- All right, then, anybody.
- [All] Phallic symbol.

321
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,399
[Rose] The phallic symbol.
That is correct.

322
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,796
It is the image of the penis,

323
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,072
which is venerated in religions
such as ours

324
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,591
as symbolising
the generative force in nature.

325
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,910
Oh, can I help you?

326
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,960
C-could I have a word with you,
please, Miss?

327
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,233
Certainly. Girls, open your desks
and take out your exercise books.

328
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,917
Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall
report this to the proper authorities.

329
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,554
Everywhere I go on this island,
it seems to me I find degeneracy.

330
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,072
And there is brawling in bars,
there is indecency in public places,

331
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,113
and there is corruption of the young,
and now I see it all stems from here.

332
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,635
It stems from the filth taught here
in this very schoolroom.

333
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,879
I was unaware that the police had
any authority in matters of education.

334
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,470
Aye, aye, well,
we'll see about that.

335
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,275
Girls, could I have your attention,
please?

336
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,073
Now, I am a police officer.

337
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,437
Well, as you can see.

338
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,949
I have come here from the mainland

339
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,835
to investigate
the disappearance of a young girl.

340
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,554
I have a photograph here...
Excuse me.

341
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,913
...which I would like you
to pass around amongst yourselves.

342
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,874
Meanwhile, I'll write her name over there
on the blackboard.

343
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,957
Rowan Morrison.

344
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,357
That's her name.

345
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,070
Now, do any of you recognise
either the name or the photograph?

346
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,840
- No.
- There's your answer, Sergeant.

347
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,157
If she existed, we would know her.

348
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,160
- Whose desk is that?
- No one's.

349
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,874
Thank you.

350
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,636
[Girls giggle]

351
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,034
The little old beetle goes round and
round, always the same way, you see,

352
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,199
till he ends up right up tight
to the nail, poor old thing.

353
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,914
[Giggling]

354
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,713
"Poor old thing"?

355
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,510
Then why in God's name
do you do it, girl?

356
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,078
I'd like to see the school register,
please.

357
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm afraid you'll have to have
Lord Summerisle's authority.

358
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,712
This is a police matter.

359
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,070
I'm afraid you'll have to have
a search warrant or permission

360
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,714
from Lord Summerisle himself.

361
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,878
I'm afraid you'll just have
to bear with me, won't you?

362
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,275
[Miss Rose clears her throat]

363
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,075
You're liars.
You are despicable little liars.

364
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,080
Rowan Morrison is
a schoolmate of yours, isn't she?

365
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,715
And that is her desk, isn't it?

366
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,400
- Well, isn't it?
- I think you ought to know...

367
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,029
And you are the biggest liar of all!

368
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,754
I warn you,
one more lie out of you,

369
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,589
and I will charge you with obstruction.

370
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,553
And, believe me, Miss Rose,
that is a promise.

371
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,239
Now...

372
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,152
...for the last time,

373
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,999
where is Rowan Morrison?

374
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,191
I would like to speak
to you outside, Sergeant.

375
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,470
Girls, get on with your reading.

376
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,197
It's the "Rites and Rituals of May Day",
chapter five. I won't be long.

377
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,039
Well?

378
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,474
You don't understand, Sergeant.
Nobody was lying. I told you plainly.

379
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,797
If Rowan Morrison existed,
we would know of her.

380
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,390
You mean, she doesn't exist?
She's dead?

381
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,637
- You would say so.
- Oh, come on, come on.

382
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,354
She's either dead, or she's not dead.

383
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,677
Here, we do not use the word...

384
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,360
[Mouths "dead"]

385
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,872
We believe that
when the human life is over,

386
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,880
the soul returns to trees, to air,

387
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,038
to fire, to water, to animals.

388
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,513
So that Rowan Morrison
has simply returned

389
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,149
to the life forces in another form.

390
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,513
Do you mean to say
you teach the children this stuff?

391
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,840
Yes. I told you,
it is what we believe.

392
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,395
They never learn anything
of Christianity?

393
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,194
Only as a comparative religion.

394
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,199
The children find it
far easier to picture

395
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,199
reincarnation than resurrection.

396
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,718
Those rotting bodies
are a great stumbling block

397
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,514
for the childish imagination.

398
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,119
Why, of course.

399
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,072
And may I ask,

400
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,158
where is the rotting body
of Rowan Morrison?

401
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,432
Right where you'd expect it to be,
in the earth.

402
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,030
You mean, in the churchyard?

403
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,949
- In a manner of speaking...
- No! In plain speaking.

404
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,870
The building attached to the ground
in which the body lies

405
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,152
is no longer used
for Christian worship,

406
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,279
so whether it is still a churchyard
is debatable.

407
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,313
But forgive me. I must get back
to my girls. Good morning to you.

408
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,513
[Howie] "Here lieth Beech Buchanan,

409
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,599
"protected by
the ejaculation of serpents"?

410
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,071
- [Howie] Morning.
- Morning.

411
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,079
I see you plant trees
on most of the graves here.

412
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,716
- Aye, that's right.
- What tree is that?

413
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,036
That's a rowan.

414
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,629
- And who lies there?
- Rowan Morrison.

415
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,437
- How long has she been dead?
- Oh, six or seven months.

416
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,951
They're just a wee bit late
with the headstone.

417
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,350
What on earth's that?
It looks like a piece of skin.

418
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,598
- Why, so it is.
- Well, what is it?

419
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,037
The poor wee lassie's navel string,
of course.

420
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,472
Where else should it be
but hung on her own little tree?

421
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,110
Where does your minister live?

422
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,799
Minister?

423
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,718
[Chuckles]

424
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,118
"Minister"!

425
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,077
[May] What a silly girl you are to make
all this fuss. It's just a little frog.

426
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,517
It'll do that poor sore throat good.

427
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,631
Anyone'd think you didn't 
want to get better.

428
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,229
Now, in he goes!

429
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,517
And out he comes. There.
Now, that didn't hurt much, did it?

430
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,712
- [Myrtle] it tasted horrid.
- Never mind, darling. It's all over now.

431
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,310
Here's your sweet for being a brave girl.
Which one would you like?

432
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,719
There. He's got your horrid old sore
throat now, hasn't he, poor creature?

433
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,797
Can't you hear him croaking?

434
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,395
Can I do anything for you, Sergeant?

435
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,115
I doubt it,
seeing you're all raving mad.

436
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,477
Good day.

437
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,433
I'd like to see
your index of deaths, please.

438
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,597
Do you have authority?

439
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,069
No, I meant from his lordship.

440
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,395
I don't need it.

441
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,235
I'm afraid you have to get permission
from Lord Summerisle.

442
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,471
Miss...

443
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,797
If you don't cooperate with me
here and now,

444
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,879
you may well find yourself inside
a police cell on the mainland tonight!

445
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,798
Have I made myself quite clear?

446
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,637
Please.

447
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,233
Thank you.

448
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,510
M, M, M, M...

449
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,593
"Benjamin and Rachel Morrison."

450
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,791
Rachel and Benjamin...

451
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,830
- Names from the Bible.
- Yes. They were very old.

452
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,150
But there's no record
of Rowan Morrison's death,

453
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,438
which means, of course,
there is no death certificate.

454
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,678
- Did you know her?
- Yes, of course.

455
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,434
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's her.

456
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,389
How did she die?

457
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,310
I don't know. I don't know
anything about her. Nothing.

458
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,560
Thank you.

459
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,435
[Doorbell tinkles]

460
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,750
[Howie] Are you Mr Lennox,
the photographer?

461
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,874
Oh, I'm firstly a chemist,
secondly a photographer.

462
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,833
I understand you take the harvest
festival photographs every year.

463
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,554
- The ones I saw in The Green Man.
- Yes.

464
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,671
It's rather humdrum work, I'm afraid.

465
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,155
What happened
to last year's photograph?

466
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,396
Isn't it there with the others?

467
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,876
No, no, it's not. Apparently it's been
broken or damaged in some way.

468
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,994
- Oh, what a pity.
- Would you have a copy of it?

469
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,999

He had his chance,
and in the modern parlance, he blew it.

545
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,198
- What?
- It's very simple. Let me show you.

546
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,676
In the last century,
the islanders were starving.

547
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,593
Like our neighbours today,
they were scratching a bare subsistence

548
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,071
from sheep and sea.

549
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,354
Then in 1868, my grandfather
bought this barren island

550
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,630
and began to change things.

How formidably benevolent he seems.

553
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,999
Essentially the face of a man
incredulous of all human good.

554
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,509
You're very cynical, my lord.

555
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,596
What attracted my grandfather
to the island,

556
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,714
apart from the profuse source
of wiry labour that it promised,

557
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,593
was the unique combination
of volcanic soil

558
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,633
and the warm Gulf Stream
that surrounded it.

559
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,791
You see, his experiments
had led him to believe

560
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,389
that it was possible to induce here
the successful growth

561
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,433
of certain new strains of fruit
that he had developed.

562
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,793
So, with typical mid-Victorian zeal,
he set to work.

563
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,560
The best way of accomplishing this,
so it seemed to him,

564
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,115
was to rouse the people
from their apathy

565
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,312
by giving them back
their joyous old gods,

566
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,272
and as a result of this worship,

567
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,553
the barren island would burgeon
and bring forth fruit in great abundance.

568
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,911
What he did, of course, was to develop
new cultivars of hardy fruits

569
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,117
suited to local conditions.

570
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,639
But, of course, to begin with,

571
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,876
they worked for him
because he fed them and clothed them,

572
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,954
but later, when the trees starting fruiting,
it became a very different matter.

573
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,913
And the ministers fled the island,
never to return.

576
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,077
He brought me up the same way,

577
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,036
to reverence the music and the drama
and the rituals of the old gods.

578
