1
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,193
Hello?

2
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,298
Hello?

3
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,236
Stop.

4
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,338
Don't move.

5
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,675
They can see us.

6
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,714
What is this?

7
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,849
I don't know.

8
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,284
Where are we?

9
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,652
Where do you think?

10
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,156
Hello?

11
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,292
Oh, my God!
It's all right, okay?

12
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,261
It's all right. You're okay.
Help! Help!

13
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,462
Just calm down!

14
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,630
- John!
- You're fine.

15
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,565
Where are you?

16
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,170
Oh, shit.

17
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,340
Is she dead?

18
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,144
I think so.

19
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,747
Jesus Christ. What was that?

20
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,282
I don't know.

21
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,086
What was that?

22
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,193
Oh, shit.

23
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,361
What the fuck?

24
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,696
- What?
- Everyone freeze!

25
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,732
- Oh, my God.
- They can see if we move.

26
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,370
Stand still, and we'll be fine.

27
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,612
Don't lift your feet
off the ground.

28
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,414
And don't touch anyone.

29
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,190
- What's that noise?
- Shh!

30
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,197
Oh, my God.

31
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,573
Where's that coming from?

32
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,475
Quiet!

33
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,551
Okay, now...

34
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,121
calm down. Calm down.

35
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,291
It's no use!

36
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,398
- Everybody calm down!
- No.

37
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,936
- We need to calm down.
- Everybody!

38
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:34,406
Calm the fuck down!

39
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,682
Just... just think! Breathe.

40
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:59,364
Here we go.

41
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,401
Everybody shut up
for one second!

42
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,536
Does anybody know
what the hell's going on?

43
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,804
They're killing us.

44
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,540
No, it's not them.

45
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,109
Are you guys seeing this?

46
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,813
The lights on the floor...
you see them move?

47
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,448
- No, I don't see anything.
- What lights?

48
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,184
What are you talking about?
Look at your hands.

49
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,888
When you move them,
it changes the floor.

50
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,289
Oh, shit.

51
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,691
Yeah.

52
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,660
I only see one.

53
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,362
Yeah, I only see mine.

54
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,365
I think you can only
see your own.

55
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,108
What did they do to us?

56
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,077
I think they messed
with our hands.

57
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,746
What does that mean?

58
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,448
- It's us.
- Us?

59
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,817
What do you mean?

60
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,186
We're choosing who dies.

61
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,736
- Fuck!
- What happened?!

62
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:11,970
Somebody did it.

63
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,039
Nobody fucking do anything,
okay?

64
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,075
Well, it's not working,
you see?

65
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,477
We have to try something.

66
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,212
Nobody do it!!

67
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,913
Okay.

68
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,783
God damn it!

69
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,185
- What the hell?
- What is wrong with you people?

70
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,622
All of us, We're gonna die!
All of us, We're gonna die!

71
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,258
We're all fucked!

72
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,001
Oh, my God.

73
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,904
This is unbelievable.

74
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,239
It's a vote.

75
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,040
What?

76
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,542
We're voting.

77
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,511
Look, they're killing
whoever gets the most votes.

78
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,845
How do you know that?

79
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:57,182
Because the chimes go off
when you close your hands.

80
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,683
And that's when you choose.

81
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,519
We should try not doing
it again.

82
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,687
Forget it.
Someone's gonna screw it up.

83
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,656
Wait.

84
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:08,093
What if we... what if we
vote for her again?

85
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,528
Yeah, let's try that. Okay.

86
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,163
Guys, that's not...
no, that's not gonna work.

87
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,831
We have to try something.

88
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,368
Yeah, everybody, let's vote
for the dead woman again.

89
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,936
- Really? Are you serious?
- Come on.

90
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,683
You guys picked
the wrong person.

91
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:35,020
- No, we didn't.
- Guys, it just doesn't work.

92
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,455
But why him?

93
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,457
Maybe he got
the second-most votes.

94
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,493
- Or the most so far?
- We have to try something.

95
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,695
No, I-it's not gonna work,
guys, okay?

96
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,997
There's nothing we can do.
We're all screwed.

97
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,467
- Let's try not voting again.
- Please.

98
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,302
- It's not gonna work.
- We need to try.

99
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,304
Okay, nobody vote.
Let's wait it out.

100
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,606
How do we know
that won't kill us all?

101
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:03,014
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

102
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,290
Is it over?

103
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,963
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, nobody move!

104
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:21,299
Just everybody let's ride
this out.

105
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,240
No!

106
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,645
If we don't choose,
it chooses on its own.

107
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:38,316
Somebody needs to do something!
This is not working, obviously.

108
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:43,121
- When you said that...
- Everybody quiet!

109
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,925
Now, there is no reason

110
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,828
for us all to just keep killing
each other off like this.

111
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,796
Well, what the hell else
are we gonna do, my man?

112
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,465
We don't have a choice.

113
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:58,103
What I mean is we can choose to
go about this in a certain way.

114
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,774
Look.

115
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,310
So There's about a minute
or two between each round.

116
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,345
That's not a lot of time.
Yeah, no shit.

117
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,781
Maybe if we spend
less time worrying

118
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,684
about who's gonna die next
and more time trying

119
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:13,852
to figure this thing out,

120
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:18,323
we'll get somewhere
and be able to stop this.

121
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,192
What do you suggest?

122
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,728
Okay, I've been
looking around the circle.

123
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:29,134
And I see five or six people
in their 70s and 80s.

124
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,169
If this is a vote,
I say they go first.

125
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,604
That'll buy us some time.

126
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,473
- Please.
- No, no, hell, no, man.

127
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,975
- Mnh-mnh.
- Are you serious?

128
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,476
Look, the way I see it,

129
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,679
they'd be the next people
to die in real life, right?

130
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,081
What's the difference?
He's right.

131
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,516
Old people first.

132
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:47,586
That's, uh, t-that's fair.
How is that fair?

133
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,220
They'd be the next
to die anyway.

134
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,656
Yeah, of natural causes,
not of us killing them.

135
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,292
- What's the difference?
- This is crazy.

136
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,895
- We have no choice.
- That's fucked up, kid.

137
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:02,100
It's a fucked up situation,
but we have to do something.

138
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,502
Which one first?

139
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,876
We'll start with him,
go clockwise after that.

140
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:15,914
1, 2, 3...

141
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,248
Now wait a minute.

142
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:17,794
4, 5, 6.

143
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,254
That should buy us 10 minutes.

144
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,156
No, no, no.
There has to be another way.

145
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,258
You have a better idea?

146
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,730
Anyone?

147
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,768
We're sorry.

148
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,770
It's the only way.

149
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:42,040
But I have just as much of
a right to live as any of you.

150
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,508
You've lived your life,
old man.

151
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,881
Please.

152
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,285
Please!

153
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,594
Okay.

154
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:07,532
I know that was hard,
but you all did the right thing.

155
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,401
We're gonna have to make
some difficult decisions.

156
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,202
Just shut up, all right?
We get it.

157
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,738
You wanted to buy some time,
and we did that.

158
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,806
Let's not waste it.

159
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,308
Let's figure out
what the hell this is.

160
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,378
Any ideas?

161
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,113
Come on! Somebody?

162
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,682
What about him?

163
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,984
- Who, me?
- Yeah, I mean, you ought to know

164
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,719
something about this.
I don't know anything.

165
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,187
- Oh, bullshit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

166
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,689
you guys have to know.
Know about what?

167
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,524
Uh, how about... what about
a fucking alien invasion?

168
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,825
- I don't know.
- What?

169
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,627
Look, I know
just as much as you do.

170
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,897
- Bullshit, man.
- I swear I don't know anything.

171
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,100
Well, does anybody remember
anything else?

172
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,636
I was in glendale.

173
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,738
Yeah, I do.

174
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,541
We were stuck in traffic
on the freeway.

175
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,910
- Me, too.
- So was I.

176
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:55,080
Right, uh, we were trying
to get out of the city,

177
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:58,016
but it was total log jam,
so I got out of the car

178
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,517
and... and started running.

179
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,252
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everybody was running.

180
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,388
Yeah, and then
everything went dark.

181
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,390
That's what I remember.

182
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,239
So, what happened?

183
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,175
- I was pulled up.
- Into the ship?

184
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,777
I don't know.

185
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,645
Tractor beam?

186
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,013
Fuck.

187
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,950
- So are we in the ship now?
- Do you think there are

188
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,953
other people doing this?
Other circles?

189
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:38,556
They wouldn't go through
all of this for just 50 of us.

190
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,625
Why Would they do this?

191
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,895
I don't know, but the next time
that I could see,

192
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,464
I was in a small room,
and everything was red,

193
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,933
like, um, like a darkroom.

194
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,369
And there were a ton of bodies
piled up on one another.

195
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,805
I assumed that they were dead,
but I don't know.

196
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,141
They might have just been
unconscious.

197
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,309
Everybody but me
and one other guy.

198
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,179
- An alien?
- No. No, no, no, he was a human.

199
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,014
- Who? One of us?
- I don't know.

200
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,249
I don't see him in here.

201
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,750
Everything else is
kind of a blur.

202
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,385
I just remember waking up
right here, and there was...

203
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,787
Some kind of gas.

204
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,657
I think that we were
all drugged.

205
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,192
Does anybody
else remember anything?

206
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,031
Come on. Anybody!

207
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,866
Yeah! Yeah.

208
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,068
I do.

209
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,638
- You?
- Yeah.

210
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,073
I remember the... the red room.

211
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,209
And I-I saw him.

212
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,344
And I saw them.

213
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,747
Well, what did they look like?

214
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:41,920
Well, they were big
and black... dark green, maybe.

215
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,055
A-a-and wet.

216
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,390
And they spoke, too.

217
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,892
It sounded almost like Chinese.

218
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:48,993
Chinese?

219
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,931
Yeah, Chinese,
or Japanese, maybe.

220
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,632
Chinese aliens?

221
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,968
Bullshit. He's lying.

222
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,404
Yeah, he's next in line.
He's just trying

223
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,406
to buy some time.
No, II-I swear.

224
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,909
Uh, tell them.
Tell them you saw me.

225
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,315
You see? He's full of shit.

226
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,650
I swear I'm telling the truth.

227
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,587
Just give me some time
to think.

228
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,789
It's a trick.
Don't believe him.

229
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,025
It's coming back to me.
It's coming back... numbers.

230
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,362
I remember numbers.
And there was something else.

231
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,598
That they...

232
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,501
now, where were we?

233
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,071
Wait. Who's next in line?

234
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,775
Her with the hat.

235
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,110
Who, me?

236
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,478
Yeah.

237
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,013
How old are you?

238
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,414
52.

239
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,583
- That's not old.
- Old enough.

240
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,686
Hey, we said 70 or 80, not 50.

241
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,156
What's the difference?

242
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,592
That's a big difference.

243
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,362
Come on, lady. You're not 52.

244
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,529
How old are you?

245
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,265
Don't lie.

246
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,800
- I'm 52.
- Bullshit.

247
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,536
Yeah. Why's your hair so white?

248
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,408
Chemotherapy.

249
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,643
I had cancer.

250
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:16,314
Aren't you supposed
to be bald, then?

251
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,182
What kind of cancer?

252
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,685
Breast cancer.

253
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,587
So You're dying, then?

254
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,925
No. It's in remission.

255
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,826
I'm better now.

256
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,131
You sure?

257
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,432
Yeah.

258
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,900
I beat it.
It could come back, though.

259
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,002
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

260
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,637
I'm just saying
she's more likely to die

261
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,673
than the rest of us.
That's not true.

262
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,441
What are you, a doctor, lady?

263
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,944
Actually, yes, I am, asshole.

264
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,913
Look, cancer or not,
she's over 50.

265
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,348
She's gonna have to go
eventually.

266
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,884
- What?
- We never agreed to that.

267
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,886
- Yeah, no way, man.
- I mean, what, do we start

268
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,988
killing off people
over 40 next?

269
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,823
I'm 43.

270
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,224
You gonna kill me next,
asshole?

271
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,660
- Hey, you got a problem?
- Yeah, I got a problem.

272
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,162
I think maybe
anyone over the age

273
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,098
of, maybe, I don't know, 35
might have a problem.

274
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,767
What do you guys think?

275
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,570
Okay, hey, now...

276
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,372
just hold on a second.

277
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,007
Let's...

278
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,346
I'm just trying to help.

279
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,247
Fuck you.

280
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,027
Listen.

281
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,330
We Can't be afraid to talk
to each other in here.

282
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,100
It's the only way We're gonna
figure out how to stop this.

283
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,801
Come on, man.
We're not gonna stop this.

284
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,737
We're just fucked.
We don't know that.

285
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,106
Exactly... we don't know
anything yet.

286
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,008
If they wanted to kill us, they
Would have done that already,

287
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,309
but they didn't.

288
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,912
So let's use this time
and try and figure out why.

289
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,214
Okay.

290
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,150
What do we do?

291
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:04,188
Maybe we should figure out
why they chose us.

292
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,590
Chose us?

293
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,091
Yeah.

294
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:11,195
Why they picked us
to be in here.

295
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,131
It was a giant space vacuum,
right?

296
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,266
I don't think
we were hand-picked.

297
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,467
Yeah, he's right.

298
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,936
This is... this is just random.

299
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,972
We don't know that.
Maybe it wasn't random.

300
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:24,375
Maybe they chose us
for a reason.

301
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,844
There's probably a zillion
people doing the same thing.

302
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,579
We're doing right now.

303
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:32,150
Okay, but it's just us in here,
right?

304
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:35,586
I think we need to know
more about each other.

305
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:42,160
Maybe if we do,
this will all make sense.

306
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,863
It's worth a shot.

307
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:49,467
Anybody want to start?

308
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,436
Uh, yeah.

309
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,337
I'll go first.

310
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,273
Hi, I'm Beth.

311
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,044
Um, I live
in woodland hills, California,

312
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,346
but originally
I'm from Richmond, Virginia...

313
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,115
born and raised.

314
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:08,986
I've worked in human resources
for the past 11 years.

315
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:12,423
Um, I just kind of fell into it.

316
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:16,828
I actually went to college
to be an English major...

317
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,362
university of Virginia.

318
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,298
Go Wahoos.

319
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,366
I'm 36, single.

320
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,768
No kids.

321
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,904
But I do have two nephews
from my sister Noreen.

322
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,740
She's actually my twin sister.

323
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,243
What else? Um...

324
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,911
Oh, I have a dog.

325
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,781
Her name is Cloody,
and she's a terrier mix.

326
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,249
And I have two cats,

327
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,384
J.J. And Ricky.

328
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,120
Oh, my God.

329
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,655
Um...
I-I think that's about it.

330
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,657
I-is there anything else
I should say?

331
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,326
No, that's great.

332
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,228
Great job.

333
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,429
Who wants to go next?

334
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,132
What?!

335
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,204
At least she didn't have kids.

336
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah, that's
what I was thinking.

337
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,176
- Me, too.
- So what?

338
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,844
That doesn't matter.
She was still a human being

339
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,814
just like any of you.

340
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,116
- What was her name?
- Beth.

341
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,018
Maybe we shouldn't say
our names.

342
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,820
Why not?

343
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,121
How does it help?

344
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,923
What's the point
in talking at all then?

345
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,325
No, no names. He's right.

346
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,861
We don't make this harder
than it already is.

347
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:27,532
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
if it's anonymous, it's...

348
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,767
what? Easier to kill everyone?

349
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,170
That's not
what I was gonna say.

350
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,438
- I'll say it then.
- It doesn't matter.

351
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,041
Names aren't necessary.

352
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,310
Someone else should speak.

353
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,112
How about you?

354
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,847
- Me?
- Yeah, You're next in line.

355
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,316
No, fuck that, man.
I ain't saying shit.

356
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,585
You seen what happened to her.
She ain't say nothing wrong.

357
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,521
Well, someone should speak.

358
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,924
Okay. I will.

359
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,593
I'll try to keep this short.

360
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,329
My name's Craig. Hey, no names.

361
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,164
Right, I'm sorry.

362
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,034
Anyway, the reason
I'm saying anything is

363
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,736
because my wife is standing
next to me.

364
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,004
I thought
that Would be important.

365
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,007
That Can't just
be a coincidence, right?

366
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,110
Well, is anyone else related?

367
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,447
Anybody... Know each other?

368
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,450
Yes.

369
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,485
I know her.

370
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,354
Susan.

371
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,823
How?

372
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,492
We're, uh... Coworkers.

373
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,462
Neighbors.

374
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,297
Never mind.

375
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,533
It's not important.

376
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,936
Affair... got it.

377
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,142
Anyway, I-I just wanted
to ask everyone,

378
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:48,613
respectfully,
please don't vote for my wife.

379
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:52,883
You can vote for me,
but, please, just spare my wife.

380
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,254
No.

381
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,857
No, everyone will take that
into consideration.

382
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,959
Okay, thanks.

383
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,673
Uh, okay.

384
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:19,744
Um, uh, you go next.

385
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:21,746
Come on, go.

386
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,248
Hey. Do you speak English?

387
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,619
- Oh, well, he's gone.
- I-I-it's okay.

388
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,087
I-I speak Spanish.

389
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,123
We don't need
a fucking translator.

390
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,824
Yeah, I'm sorry,
but he's right.

391
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,092
It's a waste of time.

392
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,461
- No, it's not.
<i>- Señor.</i>

393
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,145
What's he saying?

394
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,247
See? It's already wasting time.

395
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,382
No, it's not.
We're all human beings.

396
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,151
Yeah, we all count the same
in here.

397
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,621
We shouldn't kill someone else
over someone

398
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,691
who Can't even contribute
to the conversation.

399
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,426
Hhhe's right. That's not fair.

400
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,861
I mean, I'll bet
he's not even here legally.

401
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,296
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, what,

402
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,131
now you need a green card
to be fucking abducted?

403
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,833
You know what I'm saying?

404
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,635
I mean,
he shouldn't even be here.

405
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,003
What does that matter?

406
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,673
Ask him if he was
in the country legally.

407
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,544
Ask him.

408
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,653
No.

409
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,054
Ah, see?

410
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,789
Come on. It doesn't matter.

411
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,324
Sure it does!
This guy was probably

412
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,859
hanging out
in front of the home depot

413
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,728
with 20 other illegal aliens.
Whatever.

414
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,429
Look, while the rest of us were
running away from the ships,

415
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,031
he was probably running
towards one going,

416
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,566
<i>"trabajo, trabajo!"</i>
You know what, asshole?

417
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,968
These guys work their asses off
for barely minimum wage.

418
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,738
Taking American people's jobs.

419
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,539
- Here we go.
- What?

420
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,041
You don't think I work hard?

421
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,677
Yeah, I'm sure your
corner office is a real drag.

422
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,448
Hey.

423
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:18,062
Hey. Hey.

424
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,998
- Who, me?
- Yeah, don't I know you?

425
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,401
Huh. I wonder why.

426
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,737
No, seriously... he asked
if we knew anyone in here.

427
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,973
I know him.

428
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,508
I don't know you, man.

429
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,811
You're a mechanic
in north Hollywood.

430
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,980
Raul.

431
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:38,115
Raul Jimenez.

432
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,217
- I remember you.
- What'd he do?

433
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,086
I didn't do shit.
He's lying, man.

434
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:45,322
He beat the shit
out of his girlfriend...

435
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,624
really bad.

436
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,225
At least, I think
it was his girlfriend.

437
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,060
Hopefully not anymore.
Come on, man.

438
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,762
Serious?

439
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,597
Are you sure it was him?

440
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,132
Yeah.

441
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:58,035
I remember him 'cause of
that tattoo under his right eye.

442
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,004
That teardrop... see it?

443
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,773
- Fuck you, man.
- What's it for?

444
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,408
It's for my cousin.

445
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,844
He got shot.

446
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,379
By a pig like you.

447
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,614
Yeah, and it's my fault
you guys are criminals.

448
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,882
He was 16.

449
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,717
One less criminal
on the street.

450
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,786
Fuck you, man.

451
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,254
Is it true or not?

452
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,890
- About his cousin?
- I don't know.

453
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,827
No, about him.

454
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,862
Yeah, it's true.

455
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,398
Tell them.

456
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,668
Tell them how you beat the shit
out of her.

457
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,969
And it wasn't the first time,

458
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,872
and it won't be the last time,
either.

459
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,340
Tell them!

460
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,942
Okay, maybe
we shouldn't stereotype in here.

461
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,310
Bitch got
what she deserved, man.

462
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,479
- Shit.
- There he is. See?

463
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,081
These assholes...
man, these assholes never learn.

464
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,716
She shouldn't have
fucked around on me, man!

465
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:48,619
Like that makes it okay
to beat the shit out of her.

466
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,654
Oh, yeah?

467
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,156
What are you gonna do, man?

468
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:55,059
You gonna shoot me? Huh, pig?!

469
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:58,162
I don't think I need to.

470
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,604
Recognize anyone else?

471
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:07,771
No, I don't think so.

472
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,206
Yeah, anybody else?

473
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,876
Unpaid parking tickets?

474
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,411
- What if that's important?
- Huh?

475
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:17,915
Like, maybe
We're supposed to figure out

476
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,750
who's good and who's bad.

477
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,752
The world doesn't work
that way, sweetheart.

478
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,921
That's right.

479
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,689
Too much gray area.

480
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:29,226
But maybe that's
what they want us to do...

481
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,061
kill off certain people.

482
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,998
And, like,
oh, my God, who's gonna decide?

483
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,533
You?

484
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,602
No, not me.

485
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:42,006
All of us... as a group.

486
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,341
Kind of
what We're doing already?

487
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:47,244
Kind of not stopping
this whole thing at all?

488
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:49,680
We don't know that. It might.

489
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:53,651
There has to be a reason
behind all of this, right?

490
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,919
God, sweetheart.

491
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,087
Not every shitty thing
that happens in this world

492
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,656
has to have a reason behind it.

493
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:01,492
Maybe they just want to fucking
watch us kill each other.

494
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:09,133
Well, we should
at least consider it.

495
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,368
Consider what?

496
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,872
What she means is...

497
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:17,508
who deserves to live?

498
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,615
Okay.

499
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,983
Based on what?

500
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,185
Based on everything.

501
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,888
Morals and values,
what you have

502
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,656
or haven't done in life.

503
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:35,025
I think we need
to put it all out there.

504
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,994
Yeah, and we've got
plenty of time standing around

505
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,929
debating everybody's character.

506
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,131
Well, We're here
to do something.

507
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,100
It's to die.

508
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,841
H-hey, um...

509
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,977
I got an idea.

510
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,212
How about we, uh...

511
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,281
How about we kill
all the black people next, yeah?

512
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,949
What are you talking about?

513
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,153
Don't play the race card, man.
This is all just fucking chance.

514
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,655
Yeah? Right.

515
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:07,424
That's why most of us are dead,
right?

516
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,059
It's every man
for himself in here.

517
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,096
Yeah, you need to shut up
with this racism stuff, okay?

518
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,397
Nobody gives a shit around here.

519
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,299
I give a shit around here.

520
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,567
Look, I'm just saying.

521
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,435
I'm not fucking next, all right?

522
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:21,805
Y'all done reached
your minority quota.

523
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,440
That's fair.

524
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,210
This guy... man, do you see
anything fair going on in here?!

525
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:29,747
This is the exact
fucking opposite of fair!

526
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,782
Okay.

527
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,717
We'll see.

528
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,923
Don't look at me, man.

529
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,492
You started this shit.

530
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:44,895
Come on, man.
You know I'm right, brah.

531
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,230
Think about it.

532
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,999
They'll kill
each and every one of us off

533
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,435
until There's none of us left.
Come on, man.

534
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,404
There's plenty of white people
that are dead, too.

535
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:55,606
Come on, man, There's
plenty more still alive, too.

536
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:58,776
What exactly are you trying
to do with this?

537
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:00,210
Make yourself a target?

538
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,079
Because that's
exactly what You're doing.

539
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:04,181
Yeah. Real smart.

540
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,350
You don't see me
counting asians.

541
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,584
Well, maybe you should try.

542
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,254
Don't fall
for this racism bullshit.

543
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,756
He's just trying
to save his own ass.

544
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,092
You damn right,
you uptight asshole.

545
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:16,794
- So what?
- So what?

546
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,362
You feel like you
deserve a free pass

547
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,831
because You're fucking black?

548
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,499
Nobody cares.

549
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,101
Exactly. Nobody gives a shit.

550
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,469
I ain't talking
to your stupid ass.

551
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:26,837
I'm trying to help you, bro!

552
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,605
You shut the fuck up,
talking to me, man.

553
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:32,276
It's not gonna
fucking help you here.

554
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,610
Right.

555
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,813
'Cause it usually helps me
out there, right?

556
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,781
Oh, here we go.

557
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:41,518
Let's all feel bad
for the black guy.

558
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,721
'Cause he had to struggle
so much more than we did.

559
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:44,988
All right.

560
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,958
Just drop it.

561
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,562
Like you people don't get
enough help.

562
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,030
What the fuck you just say?

563
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:56,300
You guys are all the same.
You run around.

564
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:57,968
You just want people
to hand you things

565
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,170
like you fucking earned it.

566
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:03,540
That's what wrong
with this country now...

567
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,043
socialist bullshit.

568
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,213
What?

569
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,715
You want some reparations, too?

570
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,420
I mean, Jesus Christ.

571
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,021
Give me a fucking break
around he...

572
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,395
I think we need to keep

573
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,731
our personal prejudices
out of this.

574
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,099
It's not helping the situation.

575
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,467
Yeah, they don't matter
anymore.

576
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,736
No, no, hell no.
They absolutely matter!

577
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,771
What you mean?

578
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,540
I'm not gonna die
so some racist can live.

579
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,542
Everything...
every single thing needs

580
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:40,277
to be out there on the table.

581
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,678
Yeah, so if we could have

582
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,380
all the racists step forward,
that'd great.

583
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,683
Look... whatever
your race, ethnicity,

584
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:49,453
nationality is,
it's not important.

585
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,255
What's important is
that, collectively,

586
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,090
we figure out how to stop this.

587
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,192
We're on the same team here.
Oh, are we, though?

588
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,194
We all want to live, don't we?

589
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,896
Yeah.

590
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,063
So let's work together.

591
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,532
We Can't keep turning
against each other.

592
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,133
Yeah, that's
what they want us to do.

593
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,402
I think she's right.
That's what this is about.

594
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,837
They want us to play
their little game.

595
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,405
Maybe they're watching
us right now.

596
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,007
- Studying us.
- Let's not give them

597
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,742
- what they want.
- Exactly.

598
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:13,410
Any ideas?

599
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:16,113
What happens if we force a tie?

600
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,282
- We tried that.
- No.

601
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,984
We tried not voting at all.

602
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,687
There'd be more time
between rounds.

603
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,357
Hey, everybody.

604
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,659
Vote for yourself.

605
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,696
Hhow do we do that?

606
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,798
You Can't vote for yourself.
It doesn't let us.

607
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,734
All right, then, everybody vote
for the person

608
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,703
to your right, then.
The living person.

609
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,505
Right, don't vote
for the empty spaces.

610
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,842
If we do it right, we should
all get exactly one vote.

611
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:55,285
8, 7, 5, 4...

612
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,355
3, 2, 1.

613
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,490
No!

614
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:01,625
- The fuck?
- Damn it!

615
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,327
- It didn't work.
- Ohh!

616
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,996
- What happened?
- We screwed up.

617
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,431
- All right, let's try it again.
- It won't work!

618
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,032
They thought of everything!

619
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,068
Did you vote for the person
to your right or your left?

620
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,103
I did right. This way.

621
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,138
Well, somebody messed it up.

622
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,040
Somebody just made a mistake.

623
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,409
Okay, look,
we have to try this again.

624
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,911
All right.

625
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,780
Very carefully this time,
everybody vote for the arrow

626
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,148
that points to the person
on your right.

627
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,084
Got it?

628
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,094
Sweetie, you see the arrow?

629
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:41,698
This arrow... You're gonna
pick that arrow, okay?

630
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,901
Okay.
No, We're all gonna be okay.

631
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,870
I promise, okay?

632
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,894
- Come on!
- No!

633
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:13,597
It's a tie.
Everyone vote again!

634
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:25,075
What the fuck just happened?

635
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:26,643
- They tied.
- How?

636
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,646
We all got the same number
of votes, right?

637
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,215
No, we didn't.

638
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,583
How do you know?

639
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:36,453
- 'Cause I voted for him.
- What? What are you...

640
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,721
why Would you do that?

641
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:39,389
Because he voted
for the pregnant girl.

642
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,657
I saw him.

643
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,159
If I didn't vote him,
she'd be dead.

644
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:45,062
- You sure?
- Yes.

645
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,798
Why Would he do that?

646
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,766
Look...

647
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:55,205
We all know that we Can't
vote for ourselves, right?

648
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:59,476
Well... What do you think happens

649
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,245
when we get down
to the last person left?

650
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,686
One of us gets to live.

651
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,689
It's a game.

652
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,224
It's a process of elimination.

653
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,460
The last man standing gets
to walk out of here alive.

654
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,195
Or woman.

655
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:19,529
Why Would they do that?

656
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,031
I don't know,

657
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:24,234
but between the kid
and the pregnant girl,

658
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,503
I'm sure that guy figured
it's most likely gonna

659
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,006
come down to one of them
in the end.

660
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:35,112
If we get rid of them,
we'll all have a better chance.

661
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,817
You know what? If he's right,

662
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,652
and one of us do get
to walk out of here,

663
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:46,289
it should be one of them.

664
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,191
Why's that?

665
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,826
'Cause it's common sense.

666
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,295
People, come on.

667
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,830
Things are different in here.

668
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,932
Women and children first...
I'm sorry.

669
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,935
But that shit
doesn't matter anymore.

670
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:01,304
Look at the pregnant woman.

671
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,106
She counts as two people.

672
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:06,576
One of them's gonna die
eventually, so...

673
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:07,778
Which one?

674
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,388
It's okay. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

675
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,925
No! No!

676
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,427
No!

677
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:26,296
Oh, come on, come on, come on!
Don't do anything!

678
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:27,664
They'll both die.

679
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,934
We have to know what happens.

680
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,010
What is wrong with you people?

681
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:43,313
She's just a kid.
Why Would you go after her?

682
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,782
One of them has to die.
We need to decide.

683
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,150
- No, we don't.
- Listen, we should just

684
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:48,819
leave them out of this
for as long as possible.

685
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,754
Let's just forget about it.
No, we Can't do that -

686
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,289
- not anymore.
- Why not?

687
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,391
It's too dangerous for them.
They've been exposed.

688
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:58,695
Oh, come on, no one is going
to vote for them again, right?

689
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,797
She's never heard
of birth control,

690
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,499
so she gets to live?

691
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,734
We need to come
to a majority decision

692
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,269
before each elimination.

693
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,039
Otherwise, they are constantly
gonna be in jeopardy.

694
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,174
He's right.
We need to protect them now.

695
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,211
We don't even know
what kind of a kid she is.

696
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,046
I mean, what if she's

697
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:17,481
a miserable brat?

698
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:18,648
She's like 10.

699
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,252
Hey, kid, you get good grades?

700
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,854
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, yeah.

701
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:26,523
Straight a's?

702
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,125
Oh, my God. She got a "b."

703
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,392
Let's kill her.

704
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,629
Look, at least one of them is
gonna have to die.

705
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,064
So we should decide now.

706
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,779
Just kill them both!
Just fucking kill them...

707
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,820
what about volunteers?

708
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,722
- What?
- Volunteers?

709
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:01,224
- Are you nuts?
- I don't know.

710
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:04,694
Maybe someone wants
to step forward.

711
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,113
I'll do it.

712
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,286
- Why?
- Now, wait a minute.

713
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:31,988
He doesn't have to tell you
or anybody else why.

714
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,857
He's volunteered.
That's enough.

715
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,325
Well, I want to know why.

716
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,494
Lady, it's
none of your business.

717
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:38,728
Hey!

718
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,630
Let him answer.

719
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,266
Why?

720
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,670
I guess I just don't want
to kill anyone.

721
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,572
How old are you?

722
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,640
16.

723
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,175
No, someone else.

724
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:54,811
What do you mean
"someone else"?

725
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,112
He's a fucking kid, man.

726
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:58,481
He's 16. That's old enough.

727
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:01,051
- Old enough to what, to die?
- To make your own decisions.

728
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,119
He's a stupid kid.
He doesn't know any better.

729
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,855
I don't care.
If you volunteer, you volunteer.

730
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,624
It's his choice
if he wants to die.

731
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:10,393
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
If someone wants to volunteer,

732
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,396
we should respect that,
no matter who it is.

733
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:17,534
Son, what's your name?

734
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,369
I'm Shaun.

735
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,737
Shaun.

736
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:24,074
Are you sure
that you want to volunteer?

737
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,013
No.

738
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,751
I'll do it.

739
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,688
It's fine.

740
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,970
Whew.

741
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,206
Well, uh, this is gonna be
a whole lot easier

742
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,074
if we can get a few volunteers.

743
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:00,610
Easier for who? You?

744
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:04,781
Look, we got to take control
of this situation.

745
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,017
And this is the best way.

746
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,885
I mean, hey,
if We're all gonna die,

747
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,720
it might as well be
on our own terms.

748
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,056
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll teach
those fucking aliens.

749
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,658
Hey, We're doing
what we can, man.

750
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,326
Yeah,
it's the best idea we got.

751
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:17,694
Then you volunteer.

752
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,062
I don't see you
stepping forward.

753
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,031
We should all step forward.

754
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,465
I mean, everybody but her.

755
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,467
So mass suicide, then?

756
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,836
Well, that... that's great.
Let's do that.

757
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,239
Hey, uh, kid...

758
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:31,441
You still want to volunteer?

759
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,109
No.

760
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,246
Yes.

761
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,884
You're a fucking hero, kid.
You know that?

762
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,786
Yeah, right.

763
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:44,621
No, I'm serious.

764
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,856
Look, if I make it out of here,

765
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,159
I'm naming my next kid
after you.

766
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,102
- Thanks, Scott.
- Thank you, Scott.

767
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:07,143
Fucking assholes.
You knew his name was Shaun!

768
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,945
Whatever. The kid's a hero.

769
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,214
Yeah, he bought us two minutes.
Somebody toss him

770
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:13,316
a purple heart.
All right, enough.

771
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,693
What?

772
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,262
What are you looking at me for?

773
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,035
Oh, you think it should be me?

774
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,740
I was in Afghanistan
for the past two years

775
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:40,110
risking my life
to keep the rest of you safe.

776
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,416
I just got back two days ago.

777
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,952
I was on my way
to see my family.

778
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:55,091
I got a 7-month old

779
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,927
who doesn't even know who I am.

780
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,932
My wife...

781
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:05,335
I haven't seen my wife in...

782
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,575
I'm not fucking dying in here.

783
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,945
I'm not.

784
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,248
I'm going home to them.

785
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,084
Don't worry...
I'm not voting for you.

786
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,585
Me, neither.

787
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,821
Yeah, We're... We're gonna
get out of here, man.

788
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:26,689
- Yeah, sure we are.
- Come on, man.

789
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,959
No, you come on, man.
He knows the truth.

790
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,829
We all do.
Let's just accept it.

791
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:35,331
Just stop.

792
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,902
You're gonna die, dude.
We all are.

793
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:41,404
Time is, uh, running out.

794
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:45,241
Yeah, we still need
a volunteer.

795
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:47,277
Anybody.

796
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:54,050
I volunteer.

797
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,130
My son, Oscar...

798
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:10,066
He passed away last year.

799
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,708
- He was riding...
- His motorcycle.

800
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,350
It's okay.

801
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,623
I've forgiven him.

802
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,065
You'll see him again.

803
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,133
Do you think?

804
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:47,003
Absolutely.

805
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,439
Okay.

806
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:53,510
I go in peace.

807
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,745
Bye, everybody.

808
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,214
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

809
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,792
"You'll see him again.

810
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,295
Absolutely."

811
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,564
- Bullshit.
- Yeah, seriously.

812
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,299
He was just trying
to give her some peace

813
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,735
in her last moments of life.

814
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,870
There's nothing wrong with that.

815
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,840
She sacrificed herself
so that others could live.

816
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,475
That doesn't go unnoticed.

817
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:27,110
- Says who?
- Says God.

818
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:28,945
How do you know?

819
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:31,347
I'm a minister.

820
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:34,117
And God is watching
over all of us.

821
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,853
He has a plan.
We just have to have faith.

822
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:37,987
Amen.

823
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,823
Enough, man.

824
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,225
I'm sorry?

825
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,894
With all due respect...

826
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,262
That's just bullshit.

827
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:47,830
Standing around there
talking about faith

828
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:50,600
when people are being blasted
to shit left and right,

829
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,835
that's fucking ridiculous.
Hey, man.

830
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:55,204
If there is a God,

831
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,073
he doesn't give a shit
about any of us!

832
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,541
That's not true.

833
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,543
Oh, my God.
We're all dying in here.

834
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:02,845
This shit's not gonna end
until this motherfucker

835
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:05,648
gets all of us, okay?

836
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,817
So, you want to have faith
in something?

837
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,319
Have faith in this!

838
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,521
Okay, because that's God
in here now, all right?

839
00:43:11,523 --> 00:43:13,590
That's God right now in here.

840
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,259
So pray to him,
or ask him, even better?

841
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,361
What does thou sayeth, God?

842
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:21,264
Who among us will get to go
to your divine kingdom?

843
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,966
Hey. Take it easy.

844
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:24,534
Or what?

845
00:43:24,536 --> 00:43:26,502
You're gonna fucking kill me
because I have an opinion?

846
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:29,472
It's just as valid
as yours, man.

847
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:31,474
Looking around this room,
actually,

848
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:33,009
I think
I might have some friends.

849
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:35,445
I think people agree with me.

850
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,881
95% of people believe in God.

851
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,116
You're in the minority.

852
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:44,387
Yeah, well,
95% of people are idiots.

853
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,522
Are you calling us idiots?

854
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:51,828
I'm not calling anybody idiots,
all right?

855
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,596
All I'm saying is this...
if there is a God,

856
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,264
is this something...
does this seem like

857
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:56,466
he Would allow this?

858
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,668
Is this something he Would do?

859
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:03,039
You fuckers are gonna kill me
because You're afraid I'm right?

860
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:05,308
What are you doing?
You're fucking cowards, huh?

861
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,576
Wait, please.

862
00:44:06,578 --> 00:44:09,178
I didn't even say
anything wrong.

863
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,214
He did. Who the fuck is this?!

864
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,043
Looks like God
just cut you a break.

865
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,611
Yeah.

866
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:43,846
For another two fucking minutes.

867
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,354
Guys, I know this girl.
Don't I know you?

868
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,290
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I know you from somewhere.

869
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:55,792
- Me?
- Yeah.

870
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:58,061
Are you an actress?
You are so familiar.

871
00:44:58,063 --> 00:45:00,530
No, I'm not an actress.

872
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:03,633
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stacy something.

873
00:45:03,635 --> 00:45:06,335
- No, Christina.
- Christina.

874
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:09,405
- Christina.
- Yeah.

875
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:14,477
Wait a minute.
Is Stacy your stage name, then?

876
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:18,948
No. I told you...
I'm not an actress.

877
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,251
That's what it is, right.

878
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:25,455
Guys, actress, porn star...
I get it now.

879
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:27,256
It's a huge difference.

880
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,192
What? I'm not a porn star.

881
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:32,061
Hey, I don't think anybody
cares around here, you know?

882
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,064
I mean, I just couldn't
figure it out before.

883
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,933
Now I know.

884
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,136
What?

885
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:43,339
Whew. I'm a huge fan.

886
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,308
What the fuck are you doing?

887
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,510
I don't do porn.
I don't think it's a problem.

888
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:48,644
I think everybody's got
to make a living.

889
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,279
I don't have a problem with it.

890
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,015
- I don't do porn.
- All right, whatever.

891
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:56,419
Hey, I'm just trying
to pay her a compliment.

892
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,054
He's lying.

893
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,957
I got to be honest with you,
you know?

894
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,327
I did like you better, though,
before your enhancements,

895
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:07,263
because now,
it's just like, "wha bam!"

896
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,799
Look at these bad boys."

897
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:11,234
He's lying.

898
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:12,502
Are they real?

899
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:14,203
That is none
of your fucking business.

900
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,672
- Are you saying they're real?
- So what?

901
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:18,641
Half the girls in L.A. have
fake boobs.

902
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:20,309
Yeah, and I'm sure
it's great for business.

903
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,513
- I don't do porn!
- Who paid for them?!

904
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:25,515
Tell them. Go ahead.

905
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,617
Oh, it's okay, sweetheart.
Who paid for them?

906
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,252
- Was it your employer?
- No.

907
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:31,521
- No?
- I-I mean, he did,

908
00:46:31,523 --> 00:46:33,122
but it's not like that.
He did? No?

909
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,792
Oh, now it's getting
really difficult to decide.

910
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:40,196
No, David is my boss,
but We're also...

911
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:41,330
I am not...

912
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:42,999
ah, aha!

913
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:47,170
You see, Stacy over here thought
if she gets those double d's,

914
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:48,838
oh, David's gonna love her.

915
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,407
I mean, he's gonna love her way
more than his own wife and kids.

916
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,676
I mean, who cares
if they're already a family?

917
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:56,212
It's never stopped you before,
has it?

918
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:58,347
What, are you gonna run off
with him?

919
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,483
You're gonna have a bunch
of kids on your own?

920
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:01,751
Settle down by the beach?

921
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:04,086
Is that what You're gonna do,
Stacy?

922
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:34,517
I think
we should take into account

923
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:39,488
if people have families,
children.

924
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,758
Why? How many kids do you have?

925
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,362
- I have seven.
- Of course you do.

926
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,431
- Yeah, I got 12.
- Yeah, I got 26.

927
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,800
Oh, now, now, come on,
seriously!

928
00:47:50,802 --> 00:47:53,169
Shouldn't that be taken
into consideration?

929
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:55,805
Yeah. Yeah, we have a daughter.

930
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:57,240
Yeah.

931
00:47:57,242 --> 00:48:00,176
Emily. She's 3.

932
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:02,078
We all got families.

933
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,913
Yeah, your kids
ain't gonna save you in here.

934
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:05,748
Hey, and I'm not asking
to be saved.

935
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,752
I'm just saying...

936
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:15,224
If you don't have children,
maybe you should volunteer.

937
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,826
I think that's reasonable.

938
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:19,528
Yeah, well, maybe some of us
want to have kids someday.

939
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,431
- Yeah, well, I still am a kid.
- Yeah, me, too.

940
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:25,868
And I think
that if you don't have children,

941
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:29,839
you should do the right thing
and step forward.

942
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,378
How old are you?

943
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,280
What, me?

944
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:39,548
35, but I have a kid.

945
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,585
- Just one child?
- Yeah, a daughter.

946
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,820
- You married?
- Yes.

947
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:47,323
What does your husband do?

948
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,991
I don't... uh...

949
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:50,726
You don't what?

950
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:53,863
Why the sudden interest in me?

951
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:55,698
Well, We're
all just being honest.

952
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,600
I just thought
I'd ask you a question.

953
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:58,801
Well, I'm not on trial,

954
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:00,836
so how about you tell us
about your life?

955
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:02,405
Easy... I'm 41.

956
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:06,676
Uh, I've got two boys,
an 18-month-old baby daughter.

957
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:10,112
Married to the same
amazing woman for 12 years.

958
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,148
Um... That's it. Your turn.

959
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:19,755
Shit.

960
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,261
Still waiting.

961
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:27,596
I raised
my four younger siblings

962
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:29,165
during my father's
heroin addiction

963
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,866
and my mother's
clinical depression,

964
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:34,136
then attended vassar
under a work-study scholarship

965
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,972
before serving in the
peace corps for three years

966
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,107
in Nepal,
and then returned to the U.S.,

967
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:40,943
where I've worked
for a non-profit ever since.

968
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:44,814
Okay, but you still haven't
answered my question.

969
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,216
What does your husband do?

970
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:50,486
I have a wife.

971
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,654
Oh!

972
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,790
So, You're a lesbian.

973
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:57,460
Yeah, so, what?
It doesn't make any difference.

974
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:59,662
That's not necessarily true.

975
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,598
Dude, so she's gay.
Big deal... what's the matter?

976
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,300
What, you think it's okay
for a child to be raised

977
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,434
with two gay moms?

978
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,169
It's not fucking 1950, dude.

979
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,672
Yeah, seriously.
Mind your own business.

980
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,007
What, you think it's okay

981
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:13,743
to raise a baby girl
in that environment?

982
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:16,212
Two gay moms having sex
all over the place?

983
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:21,517
It's not as bad as two men,
but it's still wrong.

984
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,887
Maybe it's a good thing
that You're here.

985
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,555
You're gonna give
that little girl a chance

986
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:28,124
to have a normal life.
Whoa, whoa.

987
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:30,292
Come on, man.
Where are you going with this?

988
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:33,462
- I'm not homophobic or anything.
- Yeah, right.

989
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:38,901
Do you think that this is
someone worth dying for?

990
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:41,237
I know a lot of you
are religious.

991
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:45,775
This country was based
on family values.

992
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:48,177
This is a woman who has sinned.

993
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:52,481
Doesn't that mean something?

994
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:53,682
We've all sinned.

995
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:56,385
Yes, but some more than others.

996
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,888
I mean, maybe that's
the whole point of this thing.

997
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:04,160
Maybe if we figure out
who the sinner is amongst us,

998
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:06,362
that maybe
this whole thing will end.

999
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:09,698
I mean, we have no idea
what these aliens want.

1000
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,867
I mean, maybe that's the answer.

1001
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:15,771
So aliens want me to die
because I'm gay?

1002
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:17,573
Look, nothing personal.

1003
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:21,243
I'm just trying
to get this to stop.

1004
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,047
You think I'm the only one?

1005
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,160
Cowards.

1006
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,739
My son's gay.

1007
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:55,778
And There's not
a damn thing wrong with him.

1008
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,514
- What if he had a point?
- Just drop it already.

1009
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:00,516
No, no,
not about the gay stuff.

1010
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:03,519
I mean,
what if one of us dies...

1011
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,554
the one they want.

1012
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,323
This all ends.

1013
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:09,758
Jesus, we just keep going
in circles.

1014
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,427
Why Would they single
one of us out?

1015
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,963
We have a problem.

1016
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:16,031
What?

1017
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:17,933
Well, this guy said
that one of us might make it

1018
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:21,036
out of here alive, right? Yeah.

1019
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:24,707
Yeah, because we Can't vote
for ourselves.

1020
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:26,275
Right.

1021
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,077
Well, I'd like to know
what's gonna happen

1022
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,914
when There's
only two people left.

1023
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,249
What do you mean?

1024
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,817
If There's
only two people left,

1025
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:37,953
you can only vote
for the other person.

1026
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,826
- Shit, they Would tie.
- And they Would both die.

1027
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:46,095
No, no, no. Not necessarily.

1028
00:52:46,097 --> 00:52:48,397
One person doesn't have to vote.

1029
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:50,633
Wait, what?

1030
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,269
- A sacrifice.
- Yes.

1031
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:54,770
What does that mean?

1032
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:57,373
It means that if it comes down
to one of us and one of them,

1033
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,008
we don't vote.

1034
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,777
Somebody Would have to sacrifice
themselves to save the other.

1035
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:05,047
Yeah, right.
And who Would do that?

1036
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:07,116
I Would.

1037
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:08,684
Sure you Would.

1038
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,620
I Would. Wouldn't you?

1039
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:13,455
I really don't know
what I Would do.

1040
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:16,058
Let's hope it doesn't
come down to you, then.

1041
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,693
At least he's being honest.

1042
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,695
In here, the truth
gets you killed.

1043
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:23,432
In here,
everything gets you killed.

1044
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,301
We should pick someone
we can trust.

1045
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:27,102
We Can't trust anyone in here.
I think we know that by now.

1046
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:28,737
Well, somebody's gonna
have to do it.

1047
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,972
We should decide.

1048
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:32,274
We don't have
to decide anything.

1049
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:35,144
Whoever's left in the end
will make that decision.

1050
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,881
What if it comes down
to the two of them?

1051
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:41,584
Well, then,
they'll have to decide.

1052
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:45,287
Or we can decide for them.

1053
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,368
You should have never
married that asshole.

1054
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,204
I know.

1055
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,340
Together.

1056
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,783
What happened?

1057
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:17,253
- They tied.
- How romantic.

1058
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:21,690
I thought if no one voted,
I-I-it chose randomly.

1059
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:22,925
Not in a tie, I guess.

1060
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,894
See? They both Can't live.

1061
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,796
That means
one of them has to go.

1062
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:28,931
They're not going anywhere.

1063
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,333
One of them has to die.

1064
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,203
You guys want them to decide?
A little kid?

1065
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:37,406
That's too much responsibility
for a child.

1066
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:38,807
Yeah, he's right.

1067
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:41,944
We need to be the ones to do it.
Do what?

1068
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,279
He wants us
to kill one of them.

1069
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:45,781
I'm just saying
we do what needs to be done.

1070
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,284
Bullshit! You're just trying
to save your own fucking ass.

1071
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,853
It doesn't save me
any more than it saves you,

1072
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:54,623
but it guarantees that one of us
will make it out of here alive.

1073
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,760
Otherwise, we will all die.

1074
00:54:57,762 --> 00:54:59,495
Listen, this is a trick,
all right?

1075
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:01,330
Once he gets one of them
out of the way,

1076
00:55:01,332 --> 00:55:04,033
he'll just go after the other.
Don't fall for his bullshit.

1077
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:08,237
If we had to choose
one of them,

1078
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:09,872
who Would it be?

1079
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,411
What do you do?

1080
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,614
- What?
- Oh, come on, man.

1081
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:21,250
Hey, it's a fair question.

1082
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,385
What do you mean,
like, for work?

1083
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:25,254
Yeah. Of course it'd be the guy

1084
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:27,556
in the sweater vest to start
this class bullshit, right?

1085
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:30,959
Hey, hey, hey!
We're trying to decide

1086
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:32,461
who deserves to live, right?

1087
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:35,130
Oh, and, uh, career choice is
the way to do that.

1088
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:39,268
I'm just saying
that some people contribute

1089
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,637
more to society than others.

1090
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:42,905
Who cares what she does?

1091
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:44,273
She's pregnant.
That's what matters.

1092
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:46,975
Well, there are plenty
of babies.

1093
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:49,144
I mean, people have
lots of babies.

1094
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:53,148
The world has enough single moms
on welfare.

1095
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,117
She might be unemployed.
So, what?

1096
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,153
That doesn't matter.

1097
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:00,122
What does your husband do?

1098
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:02,624
- What?
- The daddy... the baby daddy.

1099
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,093
What does he do?

1100
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,095
Do you even know

1101
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:08,297
who the father is?
Yes, I know who the father is.

1102
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:10,999
Yeah, yeah,
but you aren't married, huh?

1103
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,837
Look, he's... We're waiting.

1104
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,139
You're waiting for what?
For him to get out of prison?

1105
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:20,142
- Oh, come on!
- He's not in jail.

1106
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:25,814
Okay, so, what does he do
for a living then?

1107
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,883
Enough with the inquisition.

1108
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:39,061
Well, what do you do?

1109
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:41,864
- I work for a bank.
- Of course you do.

1110
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:47,669
We lend people money
to start their own businesses.

1111
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:50,105
Does anybody here have
their own business?

1112
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:51,340
How much did you make
last year?

1113
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:53,375
I'm not talking about salaries.

1114
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,377
Well, You're the one that
started talking about the jobs.

1115
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:59,181
No, I'm talking about being a
contributing member of society.

1116
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:02,618
Now, I work my ass off
every single day,

1117
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,621
and I never,<i> never</i> take handouts
from anyone.

1118
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:09,158
I lend people money
to live their dreams.

1119
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,293
And... and outside of work,
I contribute

1120
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:13,695
a significant amount of money
to charity.

1121
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:16,698
Well, that's easy when You're
pulling down six figures.

1122
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,966
- Hm.
- Oh, uh-huh?

1123
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:20,102
A-and what do you do?

1124
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,438
Uh, I'm a graduate student.

1125
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,506
Uhhuh, in?

1126
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:28,110
- Psychology.
- -Well,<i> that's</i> useful.

1127
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:29,478
How about you? What do you do?

1128
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,647
- Fuck off, dickhead.
- What do you do, huh?

1129
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:33,715
You collect
your disability checks?

1130
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:35,584
Listen, guy.

1131
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:37,653
If You're trying to get us
to not vote for you,

1132
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:39,421
You're going about it
the wrong way.

1133
00:57:39,423 --> 00:57:41,290
Seriously. Look, look, look -

1134
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:46,128
we need to come up
with some sort of metric here,

1135
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,063
some way to decide

1136
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:50,165
who deserves to live
to the next round.

1137
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,134
All I know is is
if one of us gets to live,

1138
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,336
it's gonna be one of those two.

1139
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:57,239
At least, if I have
anything to say about it.

1140
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,083
Well, I think we all know
what that means.

1141
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,251
Yeah, yeah, he's right.

1142
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:11,186
She's gone. He should be next.

1143
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:13,288
- Oh, nice, two-for-one.
- Seriously.

1144
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,057
Well, I mean,
somebody has to go, right?

1145
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,692
Don't you see
what they're doing here?

1146
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:18,994
They just killed her to get the
majority back in their favor.

1147
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,729
They knew
that she was on our side.

1148
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,064
- What side?
- Yeah, yeah,

1149
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:24,032
there aren't any sides here.
Oh, really?

1150
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,934
So you never voted
for the two of them?

1151
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:28,103
- No, of course not.
- Bullshit.

1152
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:30,138
You don't know
who's voting for who in here.

1153
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,607
None of us do. I think we have

1154
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:33,942
a pretty good idea.
People, please, if they get

1155
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:36,445
the majority back on their side,
they will kill both of them.

1156
00:58:36,447 --> 00:58:38,714
That's what they want...
to get them out of the way.

1157
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:40,883
Only the rest of us
can stop that from happening.

1158
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:43,151
You're paranoid, man.

1159
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:44,486
Okay, who's with me?

1160
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:47,189
The two girls plus me...
that's three.

1161
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:48,490
There's 16 of us left in here.

1162
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:50,025
We just need six more
to get to nine.

1163
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,560
That's enough. Wait, nine what?

1164
00:58:51,562 --> 00:58:53,595
- Nine votes for a majority.
- Exactly.

1165
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:54,830
I'm in.

1166
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,431
Good, good. Five more.

1167
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:58,100
Everybody understand?
This is crazy.

1168
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:02,271
It's not gonna work, man.
All right, I'm in.

1169
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:03,906
- So am I.
- That's six.

1170
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:05,307
That's six. We need three more.

1171
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:06,942
What about you guys?

1172
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:09,144
What exactly
are you asking us to do?

1173
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:10,913
We're asking you to help us.

1174
00:59:10,915 --> 00:59:12,347
- Yeah, but how?
- Look.

1175
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:14,216
They are gonna vote
for one of those two girls

1176
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,651
each and every time.

1177
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:17,886
Eventually, they are gonna get
what they want,

1178
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,187
unless we stop them.

1179
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:20,789
- Stop them how?
- By block voting.

1180
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:22,224
Hey, man, it's
just playing defense.

1181
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,725
He's right.
There's no other way.

1182
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,995
- It's just a numbers game now.
- This is ridiculous!

1183
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,864
Are you with me?

1184
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:34,236
- What do we do?
- No one's voting for them

1185
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,737
this round, okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1186
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,706
we said the guy
who doesn't speak any English.

1187
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:40,208
He Can't help us now,
so, once he's gone,

1188
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,477
we can all discuss
what to do next.

1189
00:59:44,315 --> 00:59:46,248
You all know
what needs to be done!

1190
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,451
Yeah, vote for the kid!

1191
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:53,121
It's the only chance
that we have!

1192
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,129
Aah!

1193
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,298
God... Damn it!!

1194
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,533
You're fucking pathetic man.

1195
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:06,001
You'd kill a kid
to save your own life.

1196
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:08,270
Yeah, that's right.
I want to live... just like you.

1197
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,038
No, not just like me.
I wouldn't do that.

1198
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,506
Oh, yeah, well,
we'll see what you do

1199
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:13,275
when it's<i> your</i> ass on the line.

1200
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,310
No, I don't think you will.

1201
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,614
What's that supposed to mean?
Huh?

1202
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,382
What, y-y-You're gonna
kill me now?

1203
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,484
Why?
Because I want to live, huh?

1204
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:24,286
I'm... I'm a fucking bad person

1205
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,755
because I don't want
to fucking die in here?

1206
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,559
You know what? Fine.

1207
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:34,262
You want to play games?
I'll play your game.

1208
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:37,265
I say we get rid
of both of them right now,

1209
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:38,800
starting with the kid!

1210
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:42,104
That gives us all a chance
to walk out of here alive.

1211
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:47,309
Now, I know I'm not the only one
in here that wants to do that.

1212
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:48,877
He's right.
There's 15 of us left.

1213
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,513
All we need is six
to even the playing field.

1214
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:53,081
- This isn't a game.
- No, it's not.

1215
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,617
But you decided to make it
a game when you chose sides.

1216
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,586
Well, we chose.
We just chose the side

1217
01:00:57,588 --> 01:00:59,721
that said everyone
in here is equal.

1218
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:00,822
No one's special.

1219
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,991
You of all people
should understand that.

1220
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,494
Hey, you.

1221
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:07,429
Don't you love your wife?
Of course, I do.

1222
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:09,464
Well, well, don't you want
to give her a chance

1223
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:11,800
to get out of here? Huh?

1224
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:13,869
How's that gonna happen
if You're on their side?

1225
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:16,071
Listen to him.
If you choose their side,

1226
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:18,540
You're just sentencing your wife
to death.

1227
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:20,809
Our way will give her
a chance to live.

1228
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:21,877
Right.

1229
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:24,046
Yeah, yeah, b-but...

1230
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:25,247
but nothing!!

1231
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:28,183
Do you want to save her or not?!

1232
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,719
Okay, okay, fine! We're in!

1233
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:32,754
- Me, too.
- What?

1234
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:34,523
Well, he... he's right.

1235
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:35,857
What?!

1236
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:39,127
Okay, that's, uh, that's five.
We just need three more.

1237
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:41,396
Everybody vote for the kid.

1238
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:44,533
We're voting for you.

1239
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:47,202
Come on, people!
Don't you want to live?

1240
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:53,975
All right, make them tie again.
They'll both die.

1241
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:55,210
- That's fair.
- What?!

1242
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,611
He's right.
We'll take that trade.

1243
01:01:56,613 --> 01:01:58,346
What?! W-what are you doing?!

1244
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,549
Don't do it! She's just a kid!

1245
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:01,850
Aah!

1246
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,991
Fuck. What just happened?

1247
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,593
You lost, assholes.

1248
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:12,894
Fuck you.

1249
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,629
Why didn't they tie?
Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

1250
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:16,531
Why did they tie the first time
and not the second?

1251
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:18,767
'Cause somebody
changed their vote.

1252
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:21,136
Who?

1253
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:22,938
Why don't you ask your wife?

1254
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:27,242
It was you?

1255
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,511
No.

1256
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:31,980
I mean, yes, but...

1257
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:34,349
why'd you switch?

1258
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:35,717
I didn't.

1259
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:38,687
All right, I just didn't vote
the second time.

1260
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:41,423
I couldn't. I'm sorry.

1261
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,425
Right, because You're
a good person.

1262
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,060
Hey, stay out of this, okay?

1263
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:48,997
Look, listen, lady, nobody said
this was going to be easy,

1264
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:50,565
but it needs to be done.

1265
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:53,702
Yeah, listen,
they both Can't live anyway.

1266
01:02:53,704 --> 01:02:57,706
He's right... one of them is
going to have to die eventually.

1267
01:02:57,708 --> 01:03:01,143
We need to band together.
Otherwise, they're going to win.

1268
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:03,311
There's no winning here, man.

1269
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,781
We all lose, okay?

1270
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:06,848
And that's fine.

1271
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,751
We've had plenty of time
to accept that.

1272
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:11,853
There's only one thing left
that we can do,

1273
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:14,523
and that's go out of here
with some dignity.

1274
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:19,027
And maybe we can save
two people instead of one.

1275
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:20,862
But he's not talking about her.

1276
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:23,732
He's talking about getting r-I-d
of the k-I-d

1277
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,767
sooner rather than later.
I think she can spell.

1278
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,536
We just need
to get this over with.

1279
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:30,272
Rip the band-aid off.
Why drag it out?

1280
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:33,275
- You're outnumbered, man.
- He's right.

1281
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:35,377
It's over.

1282
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,349
Hey.

1283
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:43,652
You want to live, right?

1284
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:46,421
Yeah.

1285
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:49,090
But I don't...
Want to kill a little kid.

1286
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,725
It's okay.

1287
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:53,595
Fine, everybody vote
for the guy with one arm.

1288
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:55,263
Oh, please, man.

1289
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:57,799
No, no, no, listen, listen,
if we get rid of him,

1290
01:03:57,801 --> 01:03:59,701
it'll even things out,
and we'll actually have

1291
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:01,870
more time to talk about this.
There's nothing left

1292
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:04,239
to talk about.
Man, listen, You're just trying

1293
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:06,908
to buy yourself more time.
I'm trying to buy everybody

1294
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,710
some time.

1295
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,494
All right, what the hell
just happened?

1296
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:27,762
What does that mean?

1297
01:04:27,764 --> 01:04:30,398
It means
the tables have turned, bitch.

1298
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,568
People are starting
to see things clearly.

1299
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,404
Who did that?

1300
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:40,442
G.I. Joe next...
he's the leader of the pack.

1301
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:42,811
Kill him first,
the rest will cave.

1302
01:04:42,813 --> 01:04:45,480
Great idea.
There's only 13 of us left.

1303
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:47,549
We only need seven.

1304
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:50,518
What do we do?

1305
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,254
There's nothing you can do.

1306
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:53,989
We've got the majority now.

1307
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:02,097
Let's vote for her.

1308
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:03,565
What?

1309
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,767
He wants to protect her?
Let's put him to the test.

1310
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:08,270
Hey, hey, hey,
just wait a minute, okay?

1311
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:09,738
Everybody do it. He'll switch.

1312
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,674
No, wait! Give me a second.
Be reasonable, man.

1313
01:05:12,676 --> 01:05:14,509
I am being reasonable.
You want to give

1314
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:15,710
- your wife a chance?
- Yeah!

1315
01:05:15,712 --> 01:05:17,545
Then, do the right thing!

1316
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:19,047
Otherwise, she's got
30 seconds to live.

1317
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:21,049
- No!
- There's no right thing in here!

1318
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:23,218
Yes, there is! We all know it.

1319
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,922
Listen, if you kill me,
you'll die, and she'll die next.

1320
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,323
We all know that.

1321
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:32,627
- Come on.
- Do you love your wife or not?

1322
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,434
Come on, please.

1323
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,870
Oh, fuck! Okay!
Yes, I'll switch!

1324
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:43,805
Fucking pick someone else!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

1325
01:05:43,807 --> 01:05:45,473
All right, everybody vote
for the black guy.

1326
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,108
- Wait, what?!
- Okay.

1327
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,610
Fuck y'all, man!

1328
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,626
Of course.

1329
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,695
True love conquers all.

1330
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:08,096
You're out of options,
my friend.

1331
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:09,998
Yeah, well, you all
just killed yourselves.

1332
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,902
Congratulations,
you, you, you, you all did this!

1333
01:06:13,904 --> 01:06:15,904
And you...

1334
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:19,107
You just killed your wife.
I hope You're happy.

1335
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:20,308
I did what I had to do.

1336
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,277
Yeah, well, now she's gonna die
because of you.

1337
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:24,045
At least my way gave her
a chance.

1338
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:27,549
- Just shut the fuck up, man.
- Yeah, just drop it.

1339
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,454
You're probably not
even married.

1340
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:34,155
What?

1341
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:37,325
I mean, think about it.

1342
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,462
What are the odds of them being
the only married couple in here?

1343
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:41,997
Those other two
knew each other.

1344
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:43,932
- So they said.
- That's not gonna work, dude.

1345
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:45,967
So You're saying
that they're married

1346
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:49,037
and they just happened to be
placed right next to each other?

1347
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,672
Unh-unh.

1348
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,941
Think about it, people!

1349
01:06:52,943 --> 01:06:55,777
Isn't it possible that they just
made this whole thing up?

1350
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:57,479
- No.
- Why Would they lie?

1351
01:06:57,481 --> 01:07:00,949
To survive... nobody wants to
kill someone's wife or husband,

1352
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:02,951
especially right
in front of each other.

1353
01:07:02,953 --> 01:07:07,288
They just made this whole thing
up to get our sympathy.

1354
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,057
You're crazy.

1355
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:11,493
Am I?

1356
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:13,661
How long you been married?

1357
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:15,830
Five years.

1358
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:18,233
What's his parents' names?

1359
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:20,502
Um, mark and Lisa.

1360
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:22,103
Where'd she go to college?

1361
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:23,838
Ucla.

1362
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,708
When's his birthday?

1363
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,810
- Uh, April.
- April?

1364
01:07:28,812 --> 01:07:32,280
9th April 9th.

1365
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:34,582
What's his name?

1366
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:38,286
What?

1367
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:42,891
What is your husband's name?

1368
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,462
He already said his name.

1369
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:49,330
That's right. He did.

1370
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:50,632
When?

1371
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:55,203
The first time he spoke,
he said his name.

1372
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,408
Just drop it, man, okay?

1373
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:04,813
What's... His name?

1374
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:11,286
She doesn't know.

1375
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:13,888
Of course she doesn't.

1376
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,356
Yes, of course, she does.

1377
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:17,258
She's just not gonna
play your fucking games.

1378
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,661
Let's put them in a tie
and see what happens?

1379
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:21,162
- What?
- If they're married,

1380
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:24,265
There's no way
they will vote for each other.

1381
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,673
Okay... We made it up.

1382
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:33,641
But it was her fucking idea!
What?

1383
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:35,143
Yeah, yeah.
I just went along with it.

1384
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:37,112
No, he said it first.
I had nothing to do with it.

1385
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,681
Oh, come on!
She's a liar! Look at her!

1386
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:42,650
- Please don't kill me.
- No, kill this bitch!

1387
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:54,729
Why are you crying?

1388
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:56,764
Just shut the fuck up,
all right?

1389
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,701
- You shouldn't have lied to us.
- I didn't lie.

1390
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:01,870
Yes, you did.
You said you were married.

1391
01:09:01,872 --> 01:09:03,271
I<i>am</i> married.

1392
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:07,742
Just not to him,
and I do have a daughter, Emily.

1393
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:09,811
I didn't lie about that.

1394
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,746
How many people in here
do you think were married?

1395
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:13,214
Had husbands, wives, kids?

1396
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:15,817
You had no problem
with killing any of them.

1397
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:18,286
- I didn't kill them.
- Yes, you did.

1398
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,391
We all did.

1399
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:26,461
But listen, you still have
a chance to make it out of here.

1400
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:29,564
There's 11 of us left.
We just need 6 votes.

1401
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:34,102
If you join our side,
I promise I will keep you alive.

1402
01:09:34,104 --> 01:09:36,704
Don't listen to him.
He's just trying to use you.

1403
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:38,740
Hey, you want
to get out of here?

1404
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:43,311
You want to go back home and see
your real husband, see Emily?

1405
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:45,413
Yeah.

1406
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:47,348
Good.

1407
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,585
How about you?

1408
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:52,720
What side are you on?

1409
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:58,092
What, you don't speak?

1410
01:09:58,094 --> 01:10:00,762
Okay, he doesn't want to tell us
who he's voting for.

1411
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:02,063
And that's fine.
I understand that.

1412
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:03,932
Nobody wants to make enemies
in here.

1413
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:07,235
I'm gonna go ahead and say
that he's on our side.

1414
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,141
You have a daughter, don't you?

1415
01:10:13,143 --> 01:10:15,710
- What's her name?
- Chloe.

1416
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:18,880
That's a beautiful name...
Chloe.

1417
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,548
You want to see her again?

1418
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:21,950
Obviously.

1419
01:10:21,952 --> 01:10:25,220
- And your partner?
- Wife.

1420
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:32,193
- Amelia.
- Chloe and Amelia.

1421
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:35,830
Do you want
to see both of them again?

1422
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,739
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1423
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,307
Wait a minute.
Hey, that's five.

1424
01:10:46,309 --> 01:10:48,676
We just need one more.

1425
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:50,178
Come on, people... one more.

1426
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,913
- Who are we voting for?
- The army guy.

1427
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,015
No! Pick somebody else.

1428
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:55,617
- Uh, the cancer lady.
- What?

1429
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:59,120
No, no, no, all right.
You all know who to vote for.

1430
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:01,456
Shit!

1431
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,558
Fuck.

1432
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,026
Fuck.

1433
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:18,873
Holy shit.

1434
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:32,520
What do we do?

1435
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:35,423
It's... it's okay.

1436
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:37,125
It's okay.

1437
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,827
Okay, There's,
uh, seven of us left.

1438
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:41,362
All we need is four.

1439
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:46,200
One, two, three...

1440
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,970
Is it a boy or a girl?

1441
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:53,708
I don't know.

1442
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,576
Don't you want to find out?

1443
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,080
Yes, of course, I do.

1444
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:01,883
All it takes is one vote.

1445
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:05,520
It's really that simple...
just once.

1446
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:07,689
No.

1447
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:10,258
No, no, please.

1448
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,328
Please.

1449
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,997
Please. No, no, I won't do it.

1450
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:18,032
I will not do it.
Well, then You're killing

1451
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:20,802
your own child.

1452
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:22,937
How about you, man?
You want to live?

1453
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,308
You know where I stand.

1454
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:29,577
- What about you?
- Jesus Christ.

1455
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:31,446
What do you think?

1456
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,283
Forgive me.

1457
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:39,887
No, don't!

1458
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:42,290
Yes! Jesus Christ!

1459
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:43,958
Thank you, Jesus! That...

1460
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,060
okay, so it's, uh,
it's three to three.

1461
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:49,997
There's no way
you can protect them now.

1462
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:52,567
Yeah? Okay, well,
we'll see about that.

1463
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:56,437
You realize
that it's you or them, right?

1464
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:00,608
So be it.

1465
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:03,344
Are you volunteering?

1466
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:06,714
If I go, you go.

1467
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,283
Okay, um, how about this?
I'll make you a deal.

1468
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:12,120
You give me one of them,
and I'll give you her.

1469
01:13:12,122 --> 01:13:15,223
- W-what?
- A trade.

1470
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,899
Which one do you want?

1471
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,768
Either one...
doesn't matter to me.

1472
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:28,836
What?! What are you doing?

1473
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,406
Okay, deal. Deal.

1474
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:34,041
You get the little girl,
I get the phony wife.

1475
01:13:34,043 --> 01:13:35,576
The three of us will vote
for her. The three of you

1476
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,311
will vote for her.
How do I know I can trust you?

1477
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:41,349
- No.
- We'll vote in order.

1478
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:44,318
1, 2, 3.

1479
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,454
- Okay, deal.
- W-w-wait a second.

1480
01:13:46,456 --> 01:13:50,758
It's okay.
Listen... trust me, just...

1481
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,326
Okay. I'll go first.

1482
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:53,961
- But I-I-I...
- Trust me.

1483
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:56,097
- I don't know about this.
- It's okay.

1484
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:59,200
It's okay. I got you this far.

1485
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:01,903
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

1486
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:04,205
Okay.

1487
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:08,075
- What are you doing?
- Just do it!

1488
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,144
No, no.

1489
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,383
Okay, now her.

1490
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,690
Okay, it's your turn. Go.

1491
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:24,625
Hey, go. It's your turn.

1492
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:25,960
What are you doing?
It's your turn!

1493
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,996
- Come on, man, vote!
- Hurry!

1494
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:30,865
What are you doing?
Vote for the kid!

1495
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:33,668
Are you nuts? Vote for the kid!

1496
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,204
What is he doing? Vote!
What are you doing?

1497
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:37,905
Come on! Vote! Please vote!

1498
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:39,340
Vote!

1499
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:46,881
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't you vote?

1500
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:48,749
Because he doesn't vote.

1501
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:52,086
- Never has, not once.
- What?

1502
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:53,821
He's never even said
a word, never voted,

1503
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,723
and he's made it all this way.

1504
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:57,725
Dumb fucking luck.

1505
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,861
Maybe.

1506
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:01,996
Maybe not.

1507
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:05,733
What?

1508
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:07,668
- Maybe it was no accident.
- What are talking about?

1509
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:10,771
I think that There's a reason
why he's still alive.

1510
01:15:10,773 --> 01:15:15,042
Yeah, because he's been hiding,
hoping we wouldn't notice him.

1511
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:17,211
Well, guess what, buddy?
Your time's up.

1512
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:19,313
There's nowhere left
for you to hide.

1513
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:20,448
No.

1514
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:22,850
No, I don't think that's it.
Then what?

1515
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,318
Think about it.

1516
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,721
He's the only person in her
who has never voted.

1517
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:30,224
So he's survived this long just
because he hasn't participated?

1518
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:32,059
I don't know. Could be.

1519
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:34,896
That's the answer
to all of this.

1520
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:38,299
So what does that mean?

1521
01:15:38,301 --> 01:15:41,869
That he... he gets to live?

1522
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,738
Maybe.

1523
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:44,939
Does that make him untouchable?

1524
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:48,075
There's one way
to know for sure.

1525
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:51,045
Yeah.

1526
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,413
Let's see what happens.

1527
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:56,984
If we vote for him,
maybe all this will stop.

1528
01:15:59,522 --> 01:16:01,956
Come on.

1529
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,824
Come on.

1530
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,398
Wait.

1531
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:23,477
So you made all that up?

1532
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:25,613
No, no.

1533
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:27,148
He's never voted.

1534
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:28,849
I don't think so, at least.

1535
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:30,985
That, and he's never said
a world... I mean,

1536
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:33,421
not that I can remember.

1537
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,627
I don't think he wants
to give them anything.

1538
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:43,464
We've already given them enough.

1539
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:49,804
Do you want us to vote for you?

1540
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:56,744
He knows we
don't have a choice.

1541
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:25,706
Why are they doing this to us?

1542
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:30,845
It's some kind of experiment,
I guess.

1543
01:17:30,847 --> 01:17:33,014
And that's it.

1544
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:34,448
Yeah, maybe.

1545
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:37,785
I mean, maybe they just
wanted to learn about us.

1546
01:17:37,787 --> 01:17:40,921
Learn what?

1547
01:17:40,923 --> 01:17:42,923
I don't know.

1548
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:47,228
Maybe just to see
what we Would do

1549
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,997
and who we Would choose and why.

1550
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,599
For what?

1551
01:17:51,601 --> 01:17:53,734
To understand us...
what we value,

1552
01:17:53,736 --> 01:17:56,037
what we don't,
what matters to us.

1553
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:58,939
By making us kill each other?

1554
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:01,842
When we kill someone,
We're judging them,

1555
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:03,811
and We're saying that There's
something wrong with them.

1556
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:06,847
I think that's
what they've been looking for.

1557
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:13,254
So what do we do now?

1558
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:15,790
That's up to the two of you.

1559
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,327
But how do we choose?

1560
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,797
I don't know.

1561
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:26,434
But once I'm gone, one of you
is gonna have to step forward,

1562
01:18:26,436 --> 01:18:28,969
otherwise, you'll both die.

1563
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:31,906
But You're gonna have
to decide for yourselves.

1564
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:33,674
I Can't do it for you.

1565
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:45,286
You don't have much time.

1566
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:54,695
I'll go.

1567
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:02,937
- For the baby, right?
- Uh-huh.

1568
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:05,272
That's very brave of you.

1569
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:07,241
What's your name?

1570
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:08,476
Katie.

1571
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:12,980
Okay, Katie.
We'll go together, okay?

1572
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,617
Okay.

1573
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:18,152
Okay.

1574
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:20,488
It has to end this way.

1575
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:30,030
There's no more time. Do it!

1576
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:06,767
fuck. Come on.

1577
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:16,577
Of course.

1578
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:19,446
Of course.

1579
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:22,183
All that...
all that for nothing?

1580
01:20:22,185 --> 01:20:25,252
All that.
What's the matter, huh?

1581
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:28,355
What?
I'm not good enough for you?

1582
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:32,593
What?
I'm not the one that you wanted?

1583
01:20:32,595 --> 01:20:36,564
I'm exactly the same
as everybody else in here!

1584
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:38,432
They all got to make
their own choices!

1585
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:40,000
They chose to kill each other.

1586
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:44,205
That's what you wanted to see,
right, huh?

1587
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:46,073
Well, there you go,
congratulations.

1588
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,808
We're assholes.

1589
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,780
Fuck you.

1590
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:07,454
We all know that we Can't vote

1591
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:11,158
for ourselves, right?

1592
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:15,529
Well... What do you think happens

1593
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:18,032
when we get down
to the last person left?

1594
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,002
It's a game.
It's a process of elimination.

1595
01:22:22,004 --> 01:22:24,972
The last man standing gets
to walk out of here alive.

1596
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:34,081
Between the kid
and the pregnant girl,

1597
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,250
I'm sure
it's most likely gonna come down

1598
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:38,552
to one of them in the end.

1599
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:42,189
You're gonna have to decide
for yourselves.

1600
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:43,924
I Can't do it for you.

1601
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,494
It has to end this way.

1602
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,231
You don't have much time.
