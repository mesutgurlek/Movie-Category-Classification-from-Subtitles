1
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,807
What are you gonna do this weekend?

2
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:43,006
- l don't know. What are you doing?
- lt's none of your business.

3
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:45,106
Did you finish that thing
for your Lit class?

4
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:48,243
No. lt's due in like two weeks
or something.

5
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:53,514
Oh, sweetJesus in the morning.

6
00:00:55,294 --> 00:00:56,784
Again with these people?

7
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:04,068
He's burnin' in hell!

8
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:28,357
<i>Because,</i> /<i>f what the framers</i>
<i>of our const</i>/<i>tut</i>/<i>on mean--</i>

9
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:34,525
What, Travis? Fifteen minutes?

10
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,931
lf you prick me, do l not bleed?

11
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,935
Where you been?

12
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:41,336
l was dropping my grandma off
at the airport...

13
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,399
and on the way back the Five-Pointers
blocked up Lennox Hill.

14
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:48,036
Oh, so Abin Cooper's after you too now?

15
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:50,445
Yeah, and l ain't even gay.

16
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,949
Nah, you're not gay. You're just curious.

17
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:55,077
lf anybody would know,
it would beJarod.

18
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:56,654
What?

19
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:58,222
All right, all right, all right.

20
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:03,159
So every once in a while
we add amendments to the Constitution...

21
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:07,926
to expand, or more importantly, define,
the parameters of our rights.

22
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,500
Like the First Amendment-

23
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:13,129
which Abin Cooper practiced this morning
on Lennox, making Travis late.

24
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,036
Those people are such assholes.

25
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:18,633
Okay. l'm gonna let that ride
because this is a passionate issue...

26
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:21,042
and because, yes, they are assholes.

27
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:24,178
Wait. Who's Abin Cooper?

28
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:26,717
He's that creepy church guy...

29
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,549
that's always saying
how God's all pissed off at everybody.

30
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:31,122
Yeah, him and his family are the ones...

31
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:33,487
that are always holding up signs
outside of funerals and stuff.

32
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:35,719
This was they were protesting the funeral...

33
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:37,955
of the gay kid who
got killed two weeks ago.

34
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:39,530
Yeah.Jacob Harlow.

35
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:41,600
He went here.
l didn't teach him, but he went here.

36
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,167
lt was all over the news, right?

37
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:45,328
Jessie, l am both happy and sad...

38
00:02:45,437 --> 00:02:48,497
that you don't know
who Abin Cooper is...

39
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:50,472
but, l mean, come on.

40
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:52,168
Abin Cooper
and the Five Points Trinity Church...

41
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:54,143
they're like right in our own backyard.

42
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,942
Come on, Mrs. Vasquez,
Cooper's Dell is like 30 minutes away.

43
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:58,983
Yeah. Too close.

44
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:01,917
Abin Cooper holds
our entire state up for ridicule.

45
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,683
All right?
Ultraconservatives avoid this guy.

46
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:10,354
Did you know last year the head of the
largest neo-Nazi faction in this country...

47
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:13,158
issued a statement
distancing his politics...

48
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:16,200
from Cooper's and Five Points'?

49
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:19,271
Even the Nazis think this guy
is " nuckin' futs."

50
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:24,536
All right, let's just hope that the Cooper
clan sticks with the First Amendment-

51
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:28,170
- Why?
- and stays away from the Second Amendment.

52
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:32,444
- What is the Second Amendment?
- We get guns.

53
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:39,650
What is this, man?

54
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:42,556
lt's like Craigslist
for people who want to get fucked.

55
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:45,152
l thought Craigslist was Craigslist
for people who want to get fucked.

56
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:47,789
What kinda dirty shit you lookin' at, boy?

57
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:52,361
Fuck, faggot!

58
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,168
Touch my dick again and see what happens.

59
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:59,373
- Such an animal.
- They're all the same, man.

60
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:01,742
- You can't see any faces.
- Oh, shit. You showin' him?

61
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:04,042
Dude, get your fuckin' flappers
outta here.

62
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:05,980
Yeah, look, it doesn't matter.
You can see the tits.

63
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:08,019
You can see the fuckin' pussy, man.
Fuck the faces.

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,884
How we know we wanna fuck the face
unless we can see what they look like?

65
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,720
- Right, thank you.
- You fuckin' bag their head, man. All right?

66
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:15,487
Look, these bitches wanna fuck.

67
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:17,789
Even if they do wanna fuck,
they're all in New York and LA.

68
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,363
Lots more in LA Look-

69
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:21,433
New York. LA.

70
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,864
- Road trip.
- LA.

71
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,936
- LA-
- l get the point, all right, but look.

72
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:26,664
This one's a little closer to home.

73
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:31,340
Holy shit! Cooper's Dell?

74
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:32,671
- Let me see.
- No fuckin' way!

75
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:34,439
We're gettin' laid, boys.

76
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:36,537
How do we know she's gonna fuck us,
or even one of us?

77
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:38,742
l've been talking back and forth with one
for two weeks now.

78
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:40,443
She says she's interested.

79
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:42,019
Fuckin'-

80
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:44,021
l just got a little hard.

81
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,683
l don't wanna fuckin' fuck
some chick that he just stuck his dick in.

82
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:49,386
- Look, look-
- His greasy-assed fuckin' dick.

83
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:50,962
lt's not greasy.

84
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:53,258
There ain't gonna be no sloppy seconds,
boy, okay?

85
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:57,426
She wants to fuck
all three of us at the same time.

86
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:00,901
-Jesus Christ.
- l call the ass.

87
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:02,735
You're not gettin' the fuckin' ass.

88
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:06,072
What if this turns out to be one of them
<i>Catch a Predator</i> deals?

89
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:07,645
Who we preyin' on?

90
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:11,113
We're the fuckin' minors here.
She's the one who says she's 38.

91
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:14,413
Jesus. lt's gonna be like fucking my mom.

92
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:17,455
l ain't sure it ain't
your mom, motherfucker.

93
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:19,581
- Fuck you.
- l don't think l should go, man.

94
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,819
l'm having some doubts over here.

95
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:23,394
Oh, you're going.

96
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,395
You don't think the three of us
balling this woman in the same room...

97
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,227
is a little faggoty?

98
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:31,167
Jesus Christ, man.
Don't be so fuckin' middle-class.

99
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,302
l'm gonna take the car out, all right?

100
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:38,137
No, no, no. Hey, we're gonna be
on TV in a minute. Watch.

Probably go see a movie or something.

119
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,184
Fill up the tank before you bring it back.

120
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:32,286
- Can l get some money for gas?
- No.

121
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:33,990

122
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:50,109
So how are we gonna do this?

123
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:54,518
How do you mean?

124
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,713
Talkin' about how are you

- What are you talking about?
- Me and the lady.

You fuckin'-

127
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:06,993
This is what happens when fuckin' parents
block porn sites, man.

128
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:08,930
They make socially backwards kids.

129
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:11,559
How about you just pull over
and let me out.

130
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,570
Come on, man. You're being-
Oh, fuck!

131

- You hit it.

00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:21,379
You fuckin' hit it.

Why the fuck are we gettin' out?

lt's so fuckin' dark out
no one could see us if they were looking.

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,286
Holy shit! Look at your fuckin' car.

136
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:35,053
Your fuckin' car!

137
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,321
- Are you kidding me?
- Holy shit, man.

138
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:40,125
Dude, that's, like, a lot of... damage.

139
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,359
That sucks, man.

140
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:46,495
Who the fuck parks their car
on the side of the road like that?

141
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:48,072
You think there's somebody in there?

142
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:50,038
l don't know, man. Nobody's here.

143
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:51,803
Why the fuck did you stop?

144
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,208
Oh, fuck. You got 'em real good.

145
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:56,446
- Holy fuck!
- Fuck!

146
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,880
- Fuck!
- Get in the car! Get in the car!

147
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,381
They ain't following us.

148
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:09,461
Why in the fuck was that guy
on the side of the road?

149
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,995
Who cares, man?
Let's just keep fuckin' going.

150
00:08:12,097 --> 00:08:14,793
- My car's fucked up, man!
- Well, guess what.

151
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,130
Your car's gonna be fucked up
when you get home too.

We're in Cooper's Dell already.

by which he condemned all others.

287
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,251
For there was multitudes
upon multitudes of people...

288

all except Noah and his flock.

exception of Noah and his flock...

No.

00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:09,620
That's not God's love.

311
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:12,781
That's a God that abhors the wicked.

312
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:15,826
He abhors those
that ignore his righteous teaching...

313
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,252
and forsake his covenant...

314
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:21,127
and scoff at his acts.

315
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:24,758
God doesn't love you...

316
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,360
unless you fear him.

317
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,873
We talk about a fear we have
of certain snakes.

318
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:36,605
Well, that'd be a righteous fear.

319
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:38,807
We talkin' about a fear we have
of takin' a cookie...

320
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:41,078
Grandma's cookie jar...

321
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:42,983
'fraid of being caught?

322
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:45,450
l don't believe so.

323
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:49,357
Talkin' about the fear of God. l fear God.

324
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,690
You better believe l fear God.

325
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,525
But my fear is born out of respect-

326
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:57,601
- Oh, fuck.
- admiration...

327
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:59,533
devotion...

328
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:01,434
sacrifice...

329
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:04,097
adoration...

330
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:09,176
and knowledge of the scripture...

331
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,804
that l preach.

332
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:13,713
Give us some knowledge, Daddy.
Give us some knowledge.

333
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:16,343
But l preach knowledge,
and l preach to this...

334
00:20:16,454 --> 00:20:20,220
and l preach, and l preach-

335
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:23,690
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord.

336
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:27,788
l preach like my daddy before me,
and his daddy before him.

337
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,364
My grandaddy built this church
goin' on a hundred years ago.

338
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,233
He used to minister up there...

339
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:38,469
at the 1 2th St. Baptist
up there in the city...

340
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:44,375
till he couldn't stomach
what he called the deviltry anymore.

341
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:48,350
So he abandoned that modern-day Gomorrah
and settled Cooper's Dell...

342
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:51,251
June, 1 91 7.

343
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:55,922
But if he thought people
were depraved back then-

344
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:59,320
l mean, his head'd nearly burst...

345
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,228
if he saw how wicked
this country's become.

346
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,301
l hate the wickedness of America...

347
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:07,903
and all the sin-worshippers
who populate it.

348
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:10,736
"Do l not hate them, O Lord,
that hate thee?''

349
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:12,400
Says in Psalms 1 38...

350
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,104
"Am l not grieved by those
that rise up against thee?

351
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:18,182
l hate them with a perfect hatred.

352
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:22,275
l count them mine enemies."

353
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:24,150
Twenty-one, 22.

354
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:28,555
And who's the greatest enemy
of God, Cheyenne?

355
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,628
- Satan.
- Satan.

356
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:34,291
- That's right, baby.
- Satan.

357
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,391
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:40,403
And who's Satan's instrument
on earth, Fiona May?

359
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:41,870
The homosexuals.

360
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:46,636
That's right, baby. The homosexuals.

361
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:52,978
The homosexuals have run amok
in this nation over 30 years now.

362
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:54,881
Let's see what it's brought us.

363
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:58,214
Rampant fornication...

364
00:21:58,323 --> 00:21:59,790
adultery...

365
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:01,756
abortion...

366
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,724
flagrant sexuality...

367
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:07,355
in every corner of media-
movies, TV, et cetera.

368
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:09,956
Schools, malls, books...

369
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:14,095
clothes, toys, music-

370
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:15,934
Everywhere.

371
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,837
Everywhere!

372
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:22,402
You can't turn on the TVwithout seeing
some jackass wavin' his privates.

373
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:27,549
That's because the moral spine
of this country has been weakened...

374
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:29,984
by permissive attitudes...

375
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:33,785
and an unabashed tolerance
for homosexuals.

376
00:22:33,891 --> 00:22:35,859
Godlessness.

377
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:39,286
Godlessness.

378
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:43,659
The casual acceptance of the gay...

379
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,633
has hastened our demise as a species.

380
00:22:45,737 --> 00:22:49,605
Fact. Why? Because they do not procreate.

381
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:52,005
They do not procreate.

382
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,206
Now, they solicit. Yeah, boy.

383
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:57,804
They recruit.

384
00:22:57,915 --> 00:22:59,382
Yeah, boy.

385
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:02,112
But they do not procreate.

386
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,347
ls there anyone-

387
00:23:04,455 --> 00:23:06,855
anyone-who can look at the news...

388
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:11,019
and deny these are our end times?

389
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:15,031
Outside our fence lays a world at waste.

390
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:19,534
They's famine, such as in Africa...

391
00:23:19,637 --> 00:23:22,606
pestilence, such as the gay Al DS.

392
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:29,709
Monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes
and the ensuing floods, such as New Orleans-

393
00:23:29,814 --> 00:23:32,339
New Orleans is number one sin city.

394
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,884
Thailand-Thailand!

395
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,213
Thailand...

396
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:42,554
where pederasts travel
thousands of miles...

397
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,288
spend untold amounts of money...

398
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:47,931
to sodomize a child.

399
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:52,868
A baby.

400
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:01,338
Thousands upon thousands
dead in that tsunami.

401
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:05,849
l never saw the hand of God
so clearly in all my born days.

402
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:09,848
And the Lord's bore witness
to this apostasy.

403
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:14,150
Apostasy-The leaving of faith,
the denying of religion...

404
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:16,226
denying of morality.

405
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:19,329
He's done with it.

406
00:24:20,498 --> 00:24:21,965
He's done with it.

407
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:25,059
The end is nigh.

408
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,137
- The end is nigh.
- Yes, it is.

409
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,200
Cheyenne, bunny rabbit...

410
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:36,877
do you mind taking
the children out now for the lesson...

411
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:41,111
'cause it's gonna get grown up in here.

412
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:43,811
You ready?

413
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:46,151
Come on, babies. Grandpa loves you.

414
00:24:46,257 --> 00:24:47,747
Come on.

415
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,986
Gimme your hand there. Come on.

416
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:52,222
Come here. Come on, sweetie.

417
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,696
When you get finished today in school...

418
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,960
l want you to tell me
all about it, will ya?

419
00:24:57,068 --> 00:24:58,865
Will you tell me about it later?

420
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:02,437
l wish you'd talk to me sometime.

421
00:25:15,353 --> 00:25:17,184
Would y'all like to see
who we have to thank...

422
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:20,223
for the extinction of the human race?

423
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,750
lt.

424
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:28,760
Y'all know about that Worldwide Web.

425
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,934
Yeah, that's the devil's playground.

426
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:35,369
We harnessed the devils' technology...

427
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:38,636
went out like sheep amongst wolves...

428
00:25:38,743 --> 00:25:42,008
into them homosexually oriented
chat rooms...

429
00:25:43,814 --> 00:25:46,942
and we promised them boys
what they wanted to hear.

430
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,477
Just like an insect...

431
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:55,192
just like moths to a flame,
like flies to horseshit.

432
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,192
lnsects. lnsects...

433
00:25:58,296 --> 00:26:01,322
that are easily trapped
in that snare of God...

434
00:26:01,432 --> 00:26:03,332
on that there Web.

435
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:07,029
And we gonna deal with 'em
the way God taught us to deal with 'em-

436
00:26:07,138 --> 00:26:10,039
the way we dealt
with littleJacob Harlow...

437
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:12,769
who burns in hell as we speak.

438
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,513
Now...

439
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:22,511
there's a commandment
talks against killin', isn't it?

440
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,612
There's a commandment
speaks against killin'.

441
00:26:25,723 --> 00:26:27,691
God's talking about your fellow man.

442
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:30,352
He's not talking about this... insect.

443
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:34,363
l mean, you don't mourn the death
of a germ when it's been cured.

444
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:37,230
And a homosexual...

445
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:39,667
won't stop sinnin' of its own volition...

446
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,366
and it's up to the righteous
to curb the spread of its disease.

447
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:47,569
"lf a man also lie with mankind...

448
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:49,441
as he lies with a woman...

449
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:51,845
they both have committed an abomination...

450
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:55,043
and they shall surely be put to death."

451
00:26:55,152 --> 00:26:58,747
- That is the scripture.
- No. No!

452
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:01,882
That is scripture.

453
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:06,362
Well, the wrath of God...

454
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,265
is revealed from heaven...

455
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:15,562
against <i>all</i> ungodliness.

456
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:17,470
No! Please, help!

457
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:19,042
Help!

458
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:26,279
Now tape him up good, boys.
Now you watch that gay saliva.

459
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:29,080
lf it gets on ya, it can turn ya.

460
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:32,121
Don't get it near his orifices, now.

461
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:37,626
- Shut up!
- Send the sinner straight to hell.

462
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:40,595
Come on, baby.
Send the sinner straight to hell.

463
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:41,995
Shut your mouth!

464
00:27:46,804 --> 00:27:49,432
Send him off wrapped like a package.

465
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:01,584
Come on, Caleb.

466
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,527
Burn in hell, cocksucker.

467
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:16,961
No!

468
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:18,330
Caleb, head hole.

469
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:28,844
Let us out of here!
We didn't do anything!

470
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:30,709
Let us the fuck out of here!

471
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:32,305
Oh, man!

487
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:10,144
You might be worse.

488
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:14,850
Came to these woods to share a woman
with other men in the same bed.

489
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:17,018
Will somebody please fuckin' help me!

490
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:22,930
Fornicatin' ways, they caused the destruction
of both Sodom and Gomorrah.

491
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,523
l don't wanna die!

492
00:29:24,635 --> 00:29:26,330
You already did, sinner.

493
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:28,496
You destroyed your spirit...

494
00:29:28,606 --> 00:29:31,097
in a waste of shame.

495
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,397
Hey, Billy-Ray.

496
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:05,566

497
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:07,268

00:30:18,756 --> 00:30:21,816
- They gonna kill us!
- Listen. Listen to me.

501
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:25,225
l think a bone snapped out of this dead guy's
skin when they dropped him...

502
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:27,991
because l feel something stabbing my leg.

503
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:30,658
What the fuck, man? What the fuck?

504
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:33,931

513
00:30:50,354 --> 00:30:52,754

00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,749
All right?

516
00:30:56,861 --> 00:31:01,662
Just relax and lean back
just a little bit so l can lean forward.

517
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:04,461
lf l can get the bone on the thing-

518
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:06,126
Just can't see straight.

519
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:07,864
Hurry, Trav.

520
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:11,300
lt's only tape, man.

l really want my mom.

522
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:32,685
Oh, you can't do it.

523
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:36,925
Electronic gate.
lt's got one of them magnetic locks on it.

524
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:39,498
- That's why l couldn't-
- Yeah.

525
00:31:39,603 --> 00:31:41,503
l'm sorry to disturb you, Pastor.

526
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:43,197
That's all right.

527
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:46,834
You're a man of the law.
What can l do for you, Officer?

528
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,071
l'm following up on a report
of a traffic accident.

529
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:52,637
Station wagon sideswiped a car
out on Route 9.

530
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,378
Oh, my Lord. Anybody hurt?

531
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:58,887
No, sir. There was no one
in the car at the time...

532
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,653
but l see you got a wagon over there
with some damage...

533
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:06,161
that matches the description.

534
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:09,230
Fuck!

535
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,823
Oh, fuck. l'm free. l'm free.

- l tell 'em and l tell 'em and l tell 'em.
- Sir?

538
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:20,939
That's my granddaughters'.

539
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:24,208
Once in a while they go into town,
you know, get some milk, fetch a paper.

540
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:28,012
Whatever. l believe they're your culprits.

541
00:32:28,118 --> 00:32:30,609
You know, it's not
politically correct to say...

542
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:32,882
but women and cars-

543
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:35,458
Not a good mix.

544
00:32:46,737 --> 00:32:48,967
- Hurry! Hurry, hurry!
- Oh, fuck!

545
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:51,769

546
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:56,035
Go, man! Hurry!

547
00:32:57,147 --> 00:32:59,581
lt's too fuckin' tight, Trav.

548
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:01,412
l can't fuckin' do it. lt's too tight.

549
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:03,486
Billy-Ray! Where are you goin'?

550
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:06,078
Billy-Ray, don't fuckin' go.
Where the fuck are you goin'?

551
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,657
l can't fuckin' do it!

552
00:33:10,227 --> 00:33:11,387
l'm sorry!

553
00:33:11,495 --> 00:33:13,486
Fuck! Fuck!

554
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:17,294
lf l could, l'd like to keep
them insurance devils out of it.

555
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:19,767
You know, rates are high as it is...

556
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,271
and l'm not exactly
Mr. Popularity around here.

557
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:25,341
Well, no, l guess not.

558
00:33:25,442 --> 00:33:28,002
So if you can put me in touch
with whoever it is, you know...

559
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:31,548
that owns the car that they scraped up...

560
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,275
why l can talk to 'em personal.

561
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:36,217
Maybe get him some financial restitution.

562
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,948
Make up for it, you know.

563
00:33:39,556 --> 00:33:41,023
l mean, if you could.

564
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:45,195
l mean, there's only cosmetic damage,
you know. Nobody was hurt.

565
00:33:54,138 --> 00:33:56,834
l guess that'd be fine.
l'll just phone it in to y'all in the morning.

566
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,875
l thank you so much for that.
l'm much obliged.

567
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:01,808
- Hey, you have a good night.
- You too.

568
00:34:01,912 --> 00:34:02,879
Oh, fuck!

569
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:10,319
Pastor, excuse me.

570
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:12,446
Sorry. l got one last thing.

571
00:34:13,057 --> 00:34:16,322
l remember you went over to the Vatican
to protest that dead pope's funeral...

572
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:18,190
a few years back.

573
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:21,059
And l guess what l'm saying is...

574
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:24,859

575
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:39,345
Oh, my God.

576
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,916
- ltaly?
- Yeah.

577
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:46,615
l was thinking about taking my wife
someplace exotic for our five-year...

578
00:34:46,723 --> 00:34:50,181
and, well, ltaly was at the top of the list.

579
00:34:50,294 --> 00:34:53,263
Well, it's full of ltalians.
There is that.

580
00:34:54,932 --> 00:34:56,559
Full of ltalians, huh?

581
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,658
Yeah, l suppose that stands to reason.

582
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:01,329
- All right, you have a good night.
- Thank you.

583
00:35:02,506 --> 00:35:03,734
Oh, fuck.

584

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,619
Them Feds get rather investigative
when it comes to killin' one of their own.

628
00:38:21,204 --> 00:38:22,603
Hello?

629
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:24,173
This is Keenan.

630
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:27,336
l'm sorry. Who now?

631
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:30,780
Yes, sir.

632
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:33,645
That case is under
preliminary investigation.

633
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:42,682
Report was members of the church
were seeking semiautomatic firearms...

634
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:46,456
mid-2004, before AWB expired.

635
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:49,361
We have unconfirmed reports
they got a few.

636
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:58,137
Well, the intelligence suggests
that they were modifying the weapons.

637
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:01,438
At least that was the testimony
of the guy who sold 'em some shotguns.

638
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:04,981
He said they made inquiries
about modifications.

639
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:10,717
No, sir. Undercover infiltration
was unsuccessful.

640
00:39:10,821 --> 00:39:12,288
Can you-

641
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:15,556
l'm sorry. Sir?

642
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,287
Can l call you back?

643
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,320
Yes, sir. Thank you.
lt'll just be a few minutes.

644
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,667
Oh, shit.

645
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:37,508
lf you loved me,
you'd make me some coffee.

646
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,847
Caleb?

647
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,081
Darlin'?

648
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:51,325
Oh, no!

649
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:53,692
No, Caleb!

650
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:57,823
Come on, baby doll. Come on.

651
00:39:57,934 --> 00:39:59,424
Come on. Come on.

652
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:01,970
l know. l know, baby. l know.

653
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:04,496
Timothy 4, baby doll.

654
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,075
Timothy 4.

655
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:10,179
Timothy 4, baby. Timothy 4.

656
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,306
"l am now ready to be offered.

657
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:17,251
The time for my departure is at hand.

658
00:40:17,354 --> 00:40:19,515
l have fought a good fight.

659
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,056
l have fought a good fight.

660
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,186
l have finished my course.

661
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:28,025
l have kept the faith."

662
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:33,269
He's on the lovin' breast ofJesus, baby.

663
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:36,606
He's gone toJesus.

664
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:40,742
l know, baby. l know. l know.

665
00:40:40,844 --> 00:40:42,311
Come on.

666
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:44,039
Let me show you something, sweetie.

667
00:40:44,147 --> 00:40:46,081
Let me show you something. Come on.

668
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:49,451
l want you to see something with me now.

669
00:40:49,553 --> 00:40:50,679
- Lookee here.
- What?

670
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:52,379
Lookee here.

671
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:54,548
Caleb did not die in vain.

672
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:57,456
He sent them two devils to hell
before they killed him.

673
00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:02,196
Probably saved us all
with his last dyin' breath.

674
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:15,071
You go rot in hell, you filthy, filthy-

675
00:41:15,178 --> 00:41:17,078
Come on. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

676
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,011
Come on. We got one upstairs.

677
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:20,742
Save it for him.

678
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:24,548
- Save it for him. Am l right?
- Oh, Daddy, you're always right.

679
00:41:24,654 --> 00:41:26,986
<i>There's a land</i>

680
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,719
<i>Beyond the r</i>/<i>ver</i>

681
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:32,920

682
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:36,965
<i>The sweet forever</i>

683
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:41,197
<i>And you only reach that shore</i>

684
00:41:41,304 --> 00:41:45,104
<i>By fate's decree</i>

685
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:51,147
<i>By and by we'll cross the portal</i>

686
00:41:51,248 --> 00:41:57,380
<i>Where we'll dwell w</i>/<i>th thee,</i> /<i>mmortal</i>

687
00:41:57,487 --> 00:42:01,253
<i>When they r</i>/<i>ng those golden bells</i>

688
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,293
They're a pretty tight-knit group.

689
00:42:04,394 --> 00:42:08,888
Approximately 20, 25 members...

690
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:12,332
all related by blood or marriage.

691
00:42:12,435 --> 00:42:17,566
Makes it impossible
to get any coverts inside.

692
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:19,471
No, sir.

693
00:42:19,576 --> 00:42:23,342
You're thinking of Fred Phelps
and his family up in Kansas.

694
00:42:23,446 --> 00:42:26,006
"God hates fags."

695
00:42:26,116 --> 00:42:29,279
They're irritating,
but they're not gun nuts like the Coopers.

696
00:42:32,255 --> 00:42:34,189
They're suers, not doers.

697
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,919
Last April someone at Five Points...

698
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:41,157
reported an l ED setup
on church property.

699
00:42:41,264 --> 00:42:44,461
No injuries sustained
and minimal damage done to a tree...

700
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:47,128
but in an interview
with the local media...

701
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:51,469
Cooper claimed that if a bomb had gone off
in a synagogue, a black church...

702
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:54,066
or a homo-friendly Unitarian coven...

703
00:42:54,177 --> 00:42:55,508
there'd have been an uproar.

704
00:42:56,112 --> 00:42:57,602
No suspects, no arrests.

705
00:42:57,714 --> 00:43:00,706
Local law enforcement
chalked it up to townie kids...

706
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:02,876
having fun at the church's expense.

707
00:43:02,986 --> 00:43:07,013
But it spooked the Coopers into tearing down
all the barns on their property...

708
00:43:07,123 --> 00:43:09,683
turning 'em into barricade fences.

709
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:12,421
Locals call it " the great wall of bullshit."

710
00:43:14,297 --> 00:43:16,492
Yes, sir, after the one in China.

711
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:20,629
What made 'em persons of interest...

712
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:25,071
was an interview Cooper gave
to the <i>Patr</i>/<i>ot T</i>/<i>mes</i> right about then.

713
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:27,609
He said that
"lf the law won't protect us...

714
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:29,975
from the Philistines and sodomites...

715
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,945
we'll protect ourselves."

716
00:43:32,048 --> 00:43:35,677
You couple that comment
with the allegations, and you can see why-

717
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:39,651
We've had 'em on surveillance off and on.

718
00:43:39,756 --> 00:43:41,348
They're pretty easy to keep track of.

719
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:43,892
When they're not protesting gay bars
or chasing headlines...

720
00:43:43,994 --> 00:43:46,019
they mostly stick to their compound...

721
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:47,756
hold their daily services.

722
00:43:55,105 --> 00:43:57,403
l know l'm low man
on the totem pole...

723
00:43:57,507 --> 00:44:00,032
but are you sure that's wise
at this juncture, sir?

724
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:05,439
Why? Because if you give us
a few more days...

725
00:44:05,548 --> 00:44:09,006
l'm sure we can dig up something
more substantial than the sheriff's-

726
00:44:13,123 --> 00:44:15,648
That's how you wanna play it.

727
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:18,455
No, sir, l'm not questioning
your call at all, sir.

728
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:22,520
l'm saying that our history with
situations like this hasn't been exactly-

729
00:44:29,939 --> 00:44:31,634
Yes, sir. lt's dawn here now...

730
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:34,608
but we can be fully mobilized
and on site in an hour.

731
00:44:36,246 --> 00:44:37,713
l understand.

732
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:12,548

Did he fire at us?

766
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:32,009
- No, he was armed.
- Did he open fire at us?

00:49:10,987 --> 00:49:13,455
You mean in dollars or common sense?

775
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:15,285
Zing!

776
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:24,058
We get the spike mic set up?

777
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:27,568
Well, we were about to,
and then Barney Fife happened.

778
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:30,536
Well-

779
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,041
Let's go old-school.
We get any blueprints or whatnot?

780
00:49:36,879 --> 00:49:39,939
- 1 922.
- lt's all county had.

781
00:49:40,049 --> 00:49:44,486
They haven't built an addition to the original
structure for the last 50 years. No permits.

782
00:49:44,587 --> 00:49:48,318
They got anything on four legs except horses
we gotta look out for?

783
00:49:48,424 --> 00:49:50,654
lsn't this a stable?

784
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,728
No, that's Home Depot.

00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,958
lt was a stud farm. Belonged
to the last neighbors the Coopers ever had...

786
00:49:57,066 --> 00:49:59,125
before Abin drove 'em off
and bought the land.

787
00:49:59,235 --> 00:50:04,002
That's where they load up with all the lumber
so they can build this elegant fucking fence.

788
00:50:04,107 --> 00:50:08,806
Million-dollar views from three directions
and then, bam! " Casa de Bat Shit."

789
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:12,074
Do you know how you get
a valley this beautiful all to yourself?

790
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:15,241
Put a giant fucking cross
on your front lawn.

791
00:50:15,351 --> 00:50:16,978
Give me the horn.

792
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:26,994
This is Special Agent
Joseph Keenan of the ATF.

793
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:30,892
We're here to execute
a search warrant on the premises...

794
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,936
on suspicion of violation
of the National Firearms Act.

795
00:50:35,038 --> 00:50:40,476
Put down any weapons, come out with
your hands up, and you will not be harmed.

796
00:50:40,576 --> 00:50:44,603
Repeat: You will not be harmed.

797
00:50:53,956 --> 00:50:57,653
l think it's the use of the word " repeat''
that makes this work every time.

798
00:51:17,346 --> 00:51:18,904
You wanna breach?

799
00:51:22,885 --> 00:51:24,216
No.

800
00:51:25,388 --> 00:51:26,855
Give 'em a minute.

801
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,485
Get a line opened up.

802
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:35,587
Yeah, that's gonna-

803
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:39,334
Come on!

804
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,099
Goddamn it!

805
00:51:43,706 --> 00:51:45,901
Get down! Agent, get down!

806
00:51:55,118 --> 00:51:56,085
Right now!

807
00:51:58,387 --> 00:51:59,945
This is Special Agent Keenan, sir.

808
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:03,184
Cooper's Dell has escalated
into a firefight.

809
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:05,260
Requesting backup.

810
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:07,454
Get the fuck outta here. Go grab a rifle.

811
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:11,623
The local sheriff shot
and killed an armed assailant.

812
00:52:11,734 --> 00:52:15,226
We C-C'd. They opened fire.

813
00:52:15,338 --> 00:52:17,238
They shot Brooks.

814
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,830
The fucking church people!

815
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:22,607
They're heavy with AK's and TECs.

816
00:52:22,712 --> 00:52:24,202
l need backup now!

817
00:52:27,316 --> 00:52:30,080
You said this was gonna be
a simple in-and-out, sir.

818
00:52:35,057 --> 00:52:36,888
Simple just shit itself.

819
00:52:39,428 --> 00:52:40,793
Media, sir?

820
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:44,495
The closest TV station's
a hundred miles away.

821
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,295
The local paper prints once a week.

822
00:52:46,402 --> 00:52:48,063
Media's not a factor, sir.

823
00:52:54,744 --> 00:52:56,712
Sir, that sounds like-

824
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:01,614
With all due respect, sir...

825
00:53:01,717 --> 00:53:04,845
maybe we should get the deputy
assistant director on this call.

826
00:53:05,588 --> 00:53:08,182
Jesus Christ, there's kids in there, sir!

827
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:10,987
Just give me another 1 0 minutes.
l can open up a line-

828
00:53:13,529 --> 00:53:18,091
l'm gonna want something in writing
to protect myself and my field office.

829
00:53:23,439 --> 00:53:27,000
No, l'm gonna need something more
substantial than your word for this.

830
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:30,237
Either l get a text,
or an e-mail, or something official...

831
00:53:30,346 --> 00:53:32,610
l can stand behind or it's no-go.

832
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,387
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!

833
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:50,831
Down! Who else
is coming out that door, huh?

834
00:53:50,933 --> 00:53:52,833
- lt's just me.
- Bullshit!

835
00:53:52,935 --> 00:53:55,062
There's kids in there
and l wanna get 'em out.

836
00:54:05,181 --> 00:54:08,878
ls that Group 2?
Are they sending us more agents?

837
00:54:08,985 --> 00:54:11,283
The situation's been reclassified.

838
00:54:11,988 --> 00:54:15,014
We're to take down
this domestic terrorist cell.

839
00:54:15,124 --> 00:54:17,490
- We fired on them first,Joe.
<i>- We</i> didn't.

840
00:54:17,593 --> 00:54:19,584
That fat fucking asshole local.

841
00:54:20,563 --> 00:54:22,030
What are the orders?

842
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,393
Hold on a second. We don't even know
what the goddamn situation is in there.

843
00:54:27,503 --> 00:54:30,802
Our intel is limited. We've had
no fucking communication with them!

844
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:33,067
"Our investigation
of the Five Point Church...

845
00:54:33,175 --> 00:54:36,076
at Cooper's Dell
has uncovered an extremely hostile...

846
00:54:36,178 --> 00:54:38,908
domestic terrorist cell, heavily armed...

847
00:54:39,015 --> 00:54:41,950
with intentions of bombing
a local shopping mall this morning."

848
00:54:42,051 --> 00:54:43,518
You're fucking kidding me!

849
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:45,780
"When we came with arrest warrants,
they opened fire on us...

850
00:54:45,888 --> 00:54:48,083
killing the assistant
special agent in charge...

851
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:51,956
leaving us no choice but to take
the premises with deadly force."

852
00:54:53,296 --> 00:54:55,059
Jesus Christ.

853
00:54:55,164 --> 00:54:58,190
There are women,
and there are kids inside there, man.

854
00:54:58,301 --> 00:55:02,169
"ln the resulting firefight,
all suspects were killed."

855
00:55:06,776 --> 00:55:09,267
Give 'em the gas, then dynamic entry.

856
00:55:09,879 --> 00:55:11,312
Joe, the suits ain't here.

857
00:55:12,748 --> 00:55:15,308
We're here,Joe.
You're here. You can call this.

858
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:17,716
And then what, Harry?

859
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,050
The FBl takes over,
and we look like assholes...

860
00:55:20,156 --> 00:55:22,283
who can't do our jobs- again.

861
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:25,258
That's what happens the minute
a single news van rolls up...

862
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:28,125
and any one of these people
walks out of there alive...

863
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,131
goes on CNN and says we're the bad guys.

864
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:33,997
Doesn't matter who the fuck's around
to tell it to the goddamn news.

865
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:37,300
That's exactly what we're gonna be-
the fucking bad guys!

866
00:55:37,406 --> 00:55:39,374
l got 1 8 years in.

867
00:55:39,475 --> 00:55:42,035
l'm not telling my wife she's gotta
clip coupons till we're dead...

868
00:55:42,144 --> 00:55:45,079
'cause l couldn't follow a simple order,
shitty as that order is.

869
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:47,149
And we're not talking about Gandhi here.

870
00:55:47,249 --> 00:55:49,444
l got a piece of Brooks's skull
in my fucking knee.

871
00:55:49,552 --> 00:55:51,611
They're shooting at us
with military ordnance.

872
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:53,882
These ain't a bunch of tweakers
in a motel meth lab.

873
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,684
They are big bad eggs.

874
00:56:00,196 --> 00:56:02,426
Get your men ready for a breach.

875
00:56:03,132 --> 00:56:04,929
<i>S</i>/<i>r, I've apprehended one of the suspects.</i>

<i>Unarmed g</i>/<i>rl, early 20s.</i>

877
00:56:06,602 --> 00:56:09,093
She's says she's the caretaker
of the kids in the house.

878
00:56:09,205 --> 00:56:13,107
She says she wants to get the kids
out the back without her people knowing.

879
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:14,676
l think she's legit, sir.

880
00:56:14,777 --> 00:56:16,642
Requesting instructions. Over.

881
00:56:21,751 --> 00:56:24,311
This is a hostile domestic terrorist cell.

882
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,978
<i>Use of deadly force</i> /<i>s perm</i>/<i>tted.</i>

- She's not even armed. Over.
- We're not terrorists.

884
00:56:30,259 --> 00:56:32,591
Those are your goddamn orders.

885
00:56:33,963 --> 00:56:36,090
lt's the wrong move,Joe.

886
00:56:39,602 --> 00:56:42,799
We're not terrorists.
We're not. You can't do this. Please.

887
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,175
- No! We're not terrorists!
- Stay back! Stay back!

888
00:56:53,282 --> 00:56:56,342
Please, don't! Please! Oh, God.

889
00:57:02,258 --> 00:57:04,317
You need to take this gun
and go back to the house, ma'am.

890
00:57:04,427 --> 00:57:06,258
- Run back to the house.
- l don't want it.

891
00:57:06,362 --> 00:57:07,989
Take the gun and head back
into the house!

892
00:57:08,097 --> 00:57:09,121
No! You're gonna shoot me!

893
00:57:09,231 --> 00:57:11,392
Take the fucking gun, bitch,
and go to the house!

894
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,400
No! Oh, God!

895
00:57:15,805 --> 00:57:17,636
Get in there!

896
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,239
Your daddy's dead.

897
00:57:23,846 --> 00:57:25,939
This is how you respect his memory?

898
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:29,110
By trying to run out on your family?

899
00:57:29,218 --> 00:57:32,415
No. Mama, they think we're terrorists.
They're gonna kill us all.

900
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:34,216
Good.

901
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:37,087
Then l'll be in heaven with Caleb.

902
00:57:37,193 --> 00:57:39,388
lsn't that what you want?

903
00:57:39,495 --> 00:57:41,360
To be with your daddy and Jesus?

904
00:57:41,464 --> 00:57:44,592
But, Mama, what about
Melanie and the babies?

905
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,032
Me and the babies, Mama.

906
00:57:47,136 --> 00:57:51,038
"How sharper than a serpent's tooth
to have a thankless child''!

907
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:56,442
You get down on your knees
and pray for God's forgiveness!

908
00:57:58,447 --> 00:58:00,415
When you get done with that...

909
00:58:00,516 --> 00:58:03,576
you take this,
come join your family up front.

910
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,911
Come on, come on.

911
00:58:15,498 --> 00:58:18,558
- Like a good Christian.
- Yeah.

912
00:58:31,013 --> 00:58:33,447
They're trying to kill
the children, Daddy.

913
00:58:33,549 --> 00:58:35,676
They're trying to kill us all, baby.

914
00:58:38,487 --> 00:58:40,512
l don't wanna live in this world no more.

915
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:43,988
l wanna go toJesus.

916
00:58:47,563 --> 00:58:49,497
Well, baby...

917
00:58:49,598 --> 00:58:51,065
if you die...

918
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:56,995
fighting an army
of sodomite-protecting idolaters...

919
00:58:57,106 --> 00:59:00,940
l suspect the good Lord's
gonna give you a mansion in his kingdom.

920
00:59:03,045 --> 00:59:06,173
You always know what to say
to make me feel better, Daddy.

921
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:12,810
"Now learn ye the parable of a fig tree."

922
00:59:13,556 --> 00:59:15,023
Yes.

923
00:59:15,124 --> 00:59:17,592
Such as Matthew 2 4.

924
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:20,025
"When his branch is yet tender...

925
00:59:20,129 --> 00:59:21,528
and putteth forth leaves...

926
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:24,527
know that summer is nigh."

927
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:27,035
Well, baby...

928
00:59:28,904 --> 00:59:32,135
looks like summer's about as nigh
as it ever gonna get.

929
01:00:05,007 --> 01:00:06,872
Let's go.

930
01:00:06,976 --> 01:00:09,206
l shall see the face of the Lord...

931
01:00:09,311 --> 01:00:10,778
and the Lord's glory shall surely-

932
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:25,122
You're gonna be quiet, okay?

933
01:00:25,227 --> 01:00:26,888
l don't wanna shoot you, but l will.

934
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:30,593
Okay?

935
01:00:33,202 --> 01:00:34,760
Okay.

936
01:00:43,445 --> 01:00:45,436
Are Travis and Billy-Ray dead?

937
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:01,222
So what? You gonna fucking kill me?

938
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:02,957
lf you help me, l won't.

939
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:05,295
Else l will, l swear.

940
01:01:13,876 --> 01:01:16,208
There's government agents outside...

941
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:18,677
and they wanna come in here
and kill my family.

942
01:01:18,781 --> 01:01:20,408
- Fucking good!
- Will you shut up?

943
01:01:20,516 --> 01:01:22,609
l'm trying to save your life.

944
01:01:25,421 --> 01:01:28,948
Those government people-
they're gonna kill you too.

945
01:01:29,058 --> 01:01:31,891
They already shot your friend...

946
01:01:31,994 --> 01:01:34,462
and they are gonna kill everyone
in this house...

947
01:01:34,563 --> 01:01:36,963
'cause they screwed up
what they came here to do.

948
01:01:37,066 --> 01:01:41,025
They're gonna kill us
so that we can't tell on 'em.

949
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:44,328
They don't want any witnesses...

950
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:49,207
so they're gonna bust in here
and shoot all of us...

951
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:53,042
even my little brothers
and my sister and my cousins.

952
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:56,643
But l can't let the babies get killed.

953
01:01:56,752 --> 01:01:58,845
l've done some bad things.

954
01:01:58,954 --> 01:02:02,253
But if l let them babies get killed-

955
01:02:06,962 --> 01:02:10,022
They don't know what
we've been up to in here.

956
01:02:10,132 --> 01:02:14,432
lf they did, they could just arrest us.

957
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:16,401
They could put us on trial...

958
01:02:16,505 --> 01:02:20,737
and then the Zionist media
would make heroes out of'em.

959
01:02:20,843 --> 01:02:23,311
But they are gonna need witnesses...

960
01:02:24,947 --> 01:02:26,676
and that's you.

961
01:02:28,517 --> 01:02:29,677
That's you.

962
01:02:31,587 --> 01:02:35,045
So, if you and me...

963
01:02:35,157 --> 01:02:38,923
we can get out there
without gettin' killed...

964
01:02:39,027 --> 01:02:42,019
we can tell 'em
what's really goin' on in the chapel.

965
01:02:42,131 --> 01:02:45,328
We do that, and they can't
kill the babies.

966
01:02:56,411 --> 01:02:57,378
Sara, baby.

967
01:02:59,014 --> 01:03:00,675
Gimme some sweet tea, will you?

968
01:03:19,134 --> 01:03:21,125
- You want me to save your life?
- No, no.

969
01:03:23,272 --> 01:03:25,206
You want me to save your life?

970
01:03:28,777 --> 01:03:30,642
You killed my fucking friends.

971
01:03:30,746 --> 01:03:34,409
lt's not me l care about
so much as l care about the kids.

972
01:03:35,984 --> 01:03:40,114
My cousin's kid ain't
but three years old and my little sis-

973
01:03:43,325 --> 01:03:46,385
My little sister's only eight.

974
01:03:56,305 --> 01:03:57,636
Fuck you.

975
01:03:57,739 --> 01:04:01,106
You think they're gonna believe
that you weren't one of us?

976
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:05,237
They won't even give you the chance
to tell 'em before they put one in your head.

977
01:04:05,848 --> 01:04:10,842
'Cause once they get inside here
that is exactly what they're gonna do.

978
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:14,313
You think l give a shit?

979
01:04:18,427 --> 01:04:20,418
Fuck you...

980
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:22,292
and your stupid family.

981
01:04:22,397 --> 01:04:25,560
My two best friends are fucking dead.

982
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:28,431
So you know what?
Why don't you just go on and kill me too?

983
01:04:28,537 --> 01:04:31,938
You can take that gun
and just fucking kill me too.

984
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,701
Just put a bullet in my fucking head...

985
01:04:33,809 --> 01:04:37,370
because that's what l've been waiting for
since you tied me to a fucking cross!

986
01:04:38,914 --> 01:04:40,575
Cheyenne!

987
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:43,384
Please.

988
01:04:44,152 --> 01:04:46,620
Yeah, l bet Billy-Ray said please too.

989
01:04:47,823 --> 01:04:49,381
And they still killed him.

990
01:04:51,293 --> 01:04:53,124
So fuck you.

991
01:04:53,228 --> 01:04:55,355
And if you wanna save
your precious fucking babies...

992
01:04:55,464 --> 01:04:57,989
why don't you suck a fucking rescue
outta my dick, bitch?

993
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:01,235
What?

994
01:05:01,336 --> 01:05:03,361
You get away from her, you heathen!

995
01:05:03,472 --> 01:05:06,134
- Get the fuck off me!
- You!

996
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:08,675
Mama, please! Mama, stop it!

997
01:05:08,777 --> 01:05:11,803
- Mama, please! Mama!
- Get off!

998
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:16,846
- You damn heathen!
- Get the fuck off me!

999
01:05:16,952 --> 01:05:18,715
What are you trying to do to her?

1000
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,687
Trying to get what you came for?
What did you do to my girl?

1001
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,916
Mama!

1002
01:05:24,426 --> 01:05:26,417
What's the matter with you, girl?

1003
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:29,854
What's got over you?

1004
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:33,332
Will you put that gun down?
His friends killed your daddy.

1005
01:05:33,435 --> 01:05:35,699
lf we just confess,
they can't kill the babies.

1006
01:05:59,328 --> 01:06:01,262
No, don't go anywhere!

1007
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,140
There's men outside
and they aim to kill us.

1008
01:06:21,249 --> 01:06:24,707
So you take everybody
up to the attic, okay?

1009
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,085
You barricade the door. Okay?

1010
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,782
What'd you do?

1011
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:32,485
You do it!
You get 'em up there, goddamn it!

1012
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:35,392
- You do it right now!
- What did you do, Cheyenne?

1013
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:38,660
- Go!
- Mama!

1014
01:06:38,767 --> 01:06:41,235
Mommy! Mommy!

1015
01:06:43,872 --> 01:06:45,464
ls Mama dead?

1016
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:51,045
Listen.

1017
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:57,879
You go on with Maggie
and the other kids upstairs now, okay?

1018
01:06:57,986 --> 01:07:02,184
You go up to the attic
and you stay there until l come get you.

1019
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:07,125
You don't open that door for nobody else
but me, okay? You understand?

1020
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:09,523
Okay, you go on now.

1021
01:07:09,631 --> 01:07:11,098
Quick, like a bunny.

1022
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:24,278
Stevie, go!

1023
01:07:30,886 --> 01:07:32,444
Go, go, go!

1024
01:07:44,633 --> 01:07:46,362
Cocksuckers!

1025
01:08:10,759 --> 01:08:12,021
Mordechai!

1026
01:08:12,127 --> 01:08:15,392
Top of the crown! Top of the crown!

1027
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:29,271
The Lord is our shepherd.

1028
01:08:30,212 --> 01:08:32,203
The Lord is my shepherd.

1029
01:09:02,077 --> 01:09:03,977
Team, get ready to flank!

1030
01:09:28,103 --> 01:09:29,331
No!

1031
01:10:02,537 --> 01:10:05,438
- Freeze! Drop your weapon!
- Look, don't shoot. l'm a hostage, okay?

1032
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:08,771
- We need to talk to who's in charge.
- Drop the fucking gun!

1033
01:10:08,877 --> 01:10:10,845
You don't have to do this.

1034
01:10:10,946 --> 01:10:12,208
Get back.

1035
01:10:12,314 --> 01:10:14,839
There's enough evidence
to put us all away for life.

1036
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:16,383
- Don't move!
- Get back, all right?

1037
01:10:16,484 --> 01:10:18,975
There's babies in the attic!

1038
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:23,257
No!

1039
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:28,395
You all right?

1040
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:43,336
What the fuck was that?

1041
01:11:04,966 --> 01:11:07,594
Yes, sir!

1042
01:11:07,702 --> 01:11:11,433
Yes, sir! He's calling us home!

1043
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:13,063
Come on, come on!

1044
01:11:13,174 --> 01:11:16,666
Come on, children! Come on!

1045
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:23,743
<i>Everywhere, everywhere</i>

1046
01:11:24,419 --> 01:11:26,910
Drop the artillery!

1047
01:11:50,545 --> 01:11:53,275
There be no need for that anymore.

1048
01:11:53,381 --> 01:11:55,474
Where's that sound coming from?

1049
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,881
"And the four angels were loosed...

1050
01:11:57,986 --> 01:12:02,013
which were prepared
for an hour and a day...

1051
01:12:02,123 --> 01:12:04,614
and a month and a year...

1052
01:12:04,726 --> 01:12:07,092
to slay a third of men."

1053
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,291
Hear ye!

1054
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:14,334
His sacred call to arms!

1055
01:12:14,436 --> 01:12:17,928
The heavenly trumpets sound his name!

1056
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:20,667
The one true God comes to rapture!

1057
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:23,335
His faithful slay the wicked...

1058
01:12:23,445 --> 01:12:27,779
and send this evil world straight to hell!

1059
01:12:29,884 --> 01:12:32,478
Enough! Enough, goddamn it! Enough!

1060
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:34,851
Wait a minute!
Just wait a minute, everybody.

1061
01:12:37,559 --> 01:12:40,153
No more fire and brimstone, preacher!

1062
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:43,425
What does that sound mean?

1063
01:12:43,531 --> 01:12:45,260
Well, boy...

1064
01:12:46,701 --> 01:12:50,967
there ain't nothing left
but fire and brimstone.

1065
01:12:51,573 --> 01:12:53,040
Can't you hear?

1066
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,131
Can't you hear?

1067
01:12:57,412 --> 01:13:00,472
This is the Lord's day of judgment.

1068
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,911
Four trumpet blasts.

1069
01:13:04,018 --> 01:13:06,043
The seals have been opened...

1070
01:13:06,154 --> 01:13:08,816
and the horsemen dispatched.

1071
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:10,891
Three more blasts...

1072
01:13:10,992 --> 01:13:16,453
and he closes the book
on this wicked, wicked world!

1073
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:19,829
- Praise His name!
- Praise His name!

1074
01:13:19,934 --> 01:13:21,458
So come on!

1075
01:13:22,437 --> 01:13:24,371
Come on, G-man.

1076
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:27,171
"G'' for " Godless."

1077
01:13:27,275 --> 01:13:29,334
"G'' for " government."

1078
01:13:29,444 --> 01:13:31,139
Come on.

1079
01:13:31,246 --> 01:13:33,146
Come on. Shoot me.

1080
01:13:33,248 --> 01:13:35,682
Shoot me, you bootlicking...

1081
01:13:35,784 --> 01:13:39,413
flag-worshipping heathen!

1082
01:13:39,521 --> 01:13:43,582
Shoot me!
lt only hastens my reward in eternity.

1083
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:48,025
Shoot me! Shoot me!

1084
01:13:55,904 --> 01:13:58,395
<i>And then what happened?</i>

1085
01:13:58,506 --> 01:14:00,599
<i>Spec</i>/<i>al Agent Keenan?</i>

1086
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,600
Special Agent Keenan?

1087
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:05,178
What happened?

1088
01:14:07,549 --> 01:14:09,983
l subdued the suspect...

1089
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:11,676
with a head butt.

1090
01:14:12,287 --> 01:14:15,950
- A head butt?
- Yes, sir. The suspect was standing...

1091
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:19,085
unnaturally close.

1092
01:14:19,894 --> 01:14:24,297
And then the trumpet blast sounded
three more times, and a fourth and a fifth.

1093
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:26,833
By then it was pretty clear
the rapture wasn't going to happen.

1094
01:14:26,935 --> 01:14:31,065
So we rounded up
the remaining Five Pointers.

1095
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:32,799
On the record, Agent Keenan...

1096
01:14:32,907 --> 01:14:35,307
this inquiry commends you
for peaceably containing...

1097
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:37,241
a potentially explosive situation.

1098
01:14:37,345 --> 01:14:39,813
But, off the record...

1099
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:42,712
you disobeyed a direct order
from a superior,Joe.

1100
01:14:43,718 --> 01:14:45,879
l did.

1101
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:50,219
And l have no excuse
that's gonna mean anything here.

1102
01:14:54,062 --> 01:14:55,791
Yeah. Yeah.

1103
01:15:10,378 --> 01:15:13,074
Well, it is the finding of this inquiry...

1104
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:15,240
that Special Agent
Joseph Keenan be relieved...

1105
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:17,818
as head of Field Office 263.

1106
01:15:17,919 --> 01:15:20,581
He's to be placed
on one-week leave without pay...

1107
01:15:20,688 --> 01:15:22,485
after which time he'll report
to the Washington office...

1108
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,990
for reassignment in the District.

1109
01:15:27,195 --> 01:15:28,662
l'm getting promoted?

1110
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:34,892
You're still gonna kill him.

1111
01:15:35,003 --> 01:15:37,403
The United States government
doesn't kill people, Agent Keenan...

1112
01:15:37,505 --> 01:15:39,473
in or out of custody.

1113
01:15:44,812 --> 01:15:47,576
Of course we're gonna kill him,Joe.

1114
01:15:47,682 --> 01:15:49,149
We're gonna kill him with kindness.

1115
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:52,447
- You're gonna let him go to trial?
- Oh, come on.

1116
01:15:52,554 --> 01:15:55,682
- What is this, September 1 0, 2001 ?
- Patriot Act, bitch.

1117
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:58,884
We can plant him forever, okay?
Without a trial.

1118
01:15:58,993 --> 01:16:02,156
Never show him the light of day,
let alone a TV camera or a microphone.

1119
01:16:02,263 --> 01:16:03,287
How-

1120
01:16:03,398 --> 01:16:05,628
What do you think
we've been doing the last 1 0 years?

1121
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:08,725
Yeah. lt's terrorism,Joe. Okay?

1122
01:16:08,836 --> 01:16:12,567
lf you kill an American because
of a religious belief, you are a terrorist...

1123
01:16:12,674 --> 01:16:14,972
and terrorists get locked the fuck up.

1124
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:18,170
lf it's all so easy
to put these people away for life...

1125
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:20,076
why was l given those orders?

1126
01:16:22,784 --> 01:16:23,808
Truth?

1127
01:16:25,453 --> 01:16:27,921
- 'Cause fuck people like this.
- They're animals.

1128
01:16:28,022 --> 01:16:29,649
l mean, don't get me wrong.Jesus saves.

1129
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:33,420
He ain't gonna save Abin Cooper
from a fuck-load of prison rape.

1130
01:16:33,528 --> 01:16:36,497
Daily shtuppings by Coke-can cocks.

1131
01:16:36,598 --> 01:16:38,327
Savor that irony,Joe.

1132
01:16:42,136 --> 01:16:43,603
Hey, what was it?

1133
01:16:45,139 --> 01:16:47,471
- The trumpet blast.
- Pardon?

1134
01:16:47,575 --> 01:16:50,271
The trumpet blast-What was it really?

1135
01:16:50,378 --> 01:16:52,278
Oh, that.

1136
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,870
Some new neighbors-

1137
01:16:53,982 --> 01:16:57,679
these eco kids from the university
with a compost collective-

1138
01:16:57,785 --> 01:17:02,779
they got an acre off the ass end of
the Five Point property, other side of the hill.

1139
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:06,087
Abin's been giving 'em a bunch of guff
because of the smell of the compost.

1140
01:17:06,194 --> 01:17:09,186
- Was it bad?
- Gets so you can taste it.

1141
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:12,789
But Abin's been harassing these kids...

1142
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,697
sending some of his bigger boys over...

1143
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:16,702
to bitch at first...

1144
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:18,897
maybe break a window or two.

1145
01:17:19,007 --> 01:17:20,838
Then l guess they went old-school-

1146
01:17:20,942 --> 01:17:25,140
Lots of sugar in gas tanks,
burning bags of dog shit.

1147
01:17:25,246 --> 01:17:27,874
- College kids.
- No, that was Cooper and his church.

1148
01:17:27,982 --> 01:17:30,917
The eco kids never so much
as called the cops.

1149
01:17:31,019 --> 01:17:32,577
They-

1150
01:17:33,688 --> 01:17:35,656
They got creative instead.

1151
01:17:35,757 --> 01:17:39,557
They thought it'd be funny
to take a page out of Revelations...

1152
01:17:39,661 --> 01:17:42,653
and get Cooper and his family's hopes up
with the trumpets.

1153
01:17:43,965 --> 01:17:49,460
So they got this big-ass,
rusty old siren...

1154
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:52,164
from a firehouse that just got a new one.

1155
01:17:52,273 --> 01:17:57,074
The fire chief said they could have
the damn thing as long as they carted it off.

1156
01:17:57,178 --> 01:17:58,941
lt's big as a Mini Cooper.

1157
01:17:59,047 --> 01:18:02,141
So they truck this thing down
to their compost collective...

1158
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:06,016
they put it in a barn,
they hook it up to an iPod of all things...

1159
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,588
and they played these
single-note trumpet blasts...

1160
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:10,521
that they pulled off the lnternet.

1161
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:12,957
And they had no idea
that you were even there.

1162
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:16,997
lt was just dumb luck.

1163
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:27,338
Oh, those eco kids
with the compost collective?

1164
01:18:28,609 --> 01:18:31,134
Turns out it was a cover
for a marijuana grow-house.

1165
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:33,145
They're being booked right now.

1166
01:18:33,247 --> 01:18:35,715
But considering how
they probably saved a bunch more lives-

1167
01:18:35,817 --> 01:18:37,614
Yeah, yeah. l'll write a letter.

1168
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:40,044
Yeah.

1169
01:18:41,022 --> 01:18:42,489
Hey,Joe.

1170
01:18:44,726 --> 01:18:46,523
Really...

1171
01:18:46,627 --> 01:18:48,561
why did you shine the direct?

1172
01:18:55,002 --> 01:18:58,233
My grandma on my mother's side-

1173
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:02,002
she had these two dogs,
pure bloodhounds...

1174
01:19:03,444 --> 01:19:05,435
both came up the same litter.

1175
01:19:05,546 --> 01:19:10,643
She kept them
and gave the rest away to the neighbors.

1176
01:19:10,752 --> 01:19:14,210
Both known each other
since they had shit in their eyes.

1177
01:19:14,322 --> 01:19:17,883
Neither one ever treated any better
than the other one.

1178
01:19:17,992 --> 01:19:20,483
Gentlest dogs you'd ever care to meet.

1179
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:24,393
So anyway-

1180
01:19:24,499 --> 01:19:27,866
Thanksgiving of my ninth year,
these two old dogs are trailing me around...

1181
01:19:27,969 --> 01:19:33,032
'cause they know the score- l'm a
animal lover who never finishes his supper.

1182
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:35,632
So right before l get up from the table...

1183
01:19:35,743 --> 01:19:38,871
l toss these two old-timers
a turkey leg...

1184
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,845
attached to a hunk of cartilage.

1185
01:19:43,484 --> 01:19:46,009
And it was like they'd never met.

1186
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,384
They went at each other so ferociously-

1187
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:52,323
all tooth and claw and jugular-

1188
01:19:52,426 --> 01:19:55,054
They forgot anything
they ever had in common...

1189
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:59,623
and scrapped like that discard
decided between their standing and dying.

1190
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:10,977
People just do the strangest things
when they believe they're entitled.

1191
01:20:14,382 --> 01:20:17,840
But they do even stranger things
when they just plain believe.

1192
01:20:19,387 --> 01:20:22,083
<i>I see the face ofjesus</i>

1193
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:25,284
<i>On my way ton</i>/<i>ght</i>

1194
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:35,068
<i>He says to me</i>
<i>Old s</i>/<i>nner, come on</i> /<i>n</i>

1195
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:41,230
<i>I see the face ofjesus</i>

1196
01:20:42,877 --> 01:20:45,311
<i>In that great wh</i>/<i>te l</i>/<i>ght</i>

1198
01:20:55,056 --> 01:20:58,025
ln his shining eyes-

1199
01:20:59,694 --> 01:21:02,254
ln his shining eyes...

1200
01:21:03,464 --> 01:21:05,295
l see the promise...

1201
01:21:07,468 --> 01:21:10,437
of all forgiveness that sets you free.

1202
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,040
l see the face ofJesus...

1203
01:21:15,943 --> 01:21:17,911
on my way this night.

1204
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:27,247
<i>And my sav</i>/<i>or's l</i>/<i>ght to comfort me</i>

1205
01:21:27,355 --> 01:21:29,118
Shut the fuck up!
