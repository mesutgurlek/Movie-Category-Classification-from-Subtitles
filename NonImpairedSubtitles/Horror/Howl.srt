1
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,717
Excuse me, sir, is this
the right train to Newhaven?

2
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,928
Yeah. Next train
on this platform, sir.

3
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,638
Thanks.
All right.

4
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:26,087
Malcolm, Malcolm.
Evening, guv.

5
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,591
Uh, right, 11:30, Newhaven.
Done and done.

6
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,259
Thank you very much.

7
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,027
Bad news?

8
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,445
No.

9
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,997
Right. Congratulations.
Ken called in sick.

10
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:44,874
Looks like you're
on the Eastborough redeye.

11
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,669
Tonight?
Mmhmm.

12
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,837
Hang on,
I've just done my shift.

13
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,675
They must all be lawabiding
citizens on your trains.

14
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,761
You haven't issued
a penalty fare in six weeks.

15
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,932
Or are you
just not man enough?

16
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:14,362
I'll do it.
Good boy.

17
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,030
Platform nine.

18
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,867
You alright, love?
Fine.

19
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,219
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

20
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,971
This is your guard speaking.

21
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,973
I would like
to welcome you aboard

22
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,226
the 23:59 Alpha Trax
service to Eastborough,

23
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:49,814
calling at Morsley Junction,
Woolscot, Edgcombe,

24
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:55,445
Abington Cross, Wychford,
Christchurch, Barrock's Hill,

25
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,073
Old Milton, and arriving
at Eastborough at 1:48.

26
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:00,742
I'd like to remind you
at this time

27
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:03,077
to have your tickets
ready for inspection.

28
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,704
Thank you.

29
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,957
Tickets, please.

30
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,294
Ta. Lovely.
Thank you, madam.

31
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,380
Tickets and passes, please.

32
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,593
Tickets, please.

33
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,386
Good, thank you, sir.

34
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,890
Excuse me, madam, tickets.

35
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,391
<i>I'll</i> get that for you.

36
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,988
Obviously not a fan of trains.

37
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,660
Nasty man.

38
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,080
Tickets, please.

39
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,876
Thank you, madam.

40
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,298
Ticket, please.

41
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,550
What? Oh, Christ. Um...

42
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,011
Hang on.

43
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,138
No rush, you're alright.

44
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,019
That's weird.

45
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,816
I had it this morning.

46
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,652
Today has just been
a complete nightmare.
Let's see...

47
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:18,903
If you don't have a valid pass

48
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,530
I have to charge the full fare.

49
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:27,161
What? Seriously?
I take this train every single day.

50
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:29,121
Those are the rules.

51
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,459
Where is it
you're traveling to?

52
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,337
Eastborough.

53
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,756
Eastborough...

54
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,467
That's gonna be £39 then, please.

55
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,810
Thank you.
Ta.

56
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,230
Apologies. Just wait
for your change.

57
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:56,065
Sorry.

58
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,692
That's lovely, thank you.

59
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:00,027
Tickets, please!
Can I see your tickets, please?

60
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,323
Thank you, sir.

61
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,246
Why don't you get a proper job?

62
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:22,300
It was so great.
The guys, they were so hot.

63
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,553
I'll go tomorrow.
About 12ish, is that alright?

64
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,889
We'll go home, get changed,
and I can wear shorts.

65
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,975
It was brilliant.
I wish you were there.

66
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,977
Tickets and passes, please.

67
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,897
I ran so hard I wet myself.
Yeah... It's really boring.

68
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,398
But the party was amazing.
You'd have loved it.

69
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,649
It was what you
thought it was gonna be.

70
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,443
Can I see your ticket, please?

71
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,403
It was a great night.
You should've been there.

72
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,405
I know! Well, yeah.
It was so brilliant.

73
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,782
Tickets, please?
Yeah, that'll be really cool.

74
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,993
I like that. Yeah. Anyway...
Can you get off your phone?

75
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,079
You're in a quiet zone.
Yeah. That'll be really cool.

76
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,999
Anyway, he's such a boring...
Miss?

77
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:03,507
I know, right?
Thank you.

78
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,219
Oh, my God, this guy
is totally staring at my tits.

79
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,101
Such a perv.

80
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:17,939
What can I say?
It's not my fault.
It was so funny.

81
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,776
Thank you. Ta.

82
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,451
Tickets, please.

83
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,955
Thank you, sir.

84
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,833
Can I see
your ticket, please?

85
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:45,049
Thank you.

86
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:58,562
Tickets, please. Thank you.

87
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,315
Any coffee?
See your tickets, please.

88
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,150
For you, sir?

89
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,654
Chicken?

90
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,614
Thanks.

91
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,826
Hiya.
Alright?

92
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,537
£1.85, please.

93
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,247
Didn't realize
you were on tonight.

94
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,999
Yeah, double shift.

95
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,042
Trying to save as much
as I can this month.

96
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,920
Oh, right. Yeah.
Dave's done the same to me.

97
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:28,259
You still trying to go?
I haven't decided yet.

98
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,762
I don't wanna be serving chicken
sandwiches the rest of my life.

99
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,389
No.
Yes?

100
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,558
Coffee, white,
two sugars, please.

101
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,184
And why would you?

102
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,522
Sorry about your promotion.

103
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,526
David told me.

104
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,447
I think
he told everyone.
Oh.

105
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,033
That doesn't surprise me.

106
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,617
Ah, it's not the end
of the world.

107
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,911
Something else better
will come up, I'm sure.

108
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,955
Well, you should try again.

109
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,207
You know, you're good
with the passengers.

110
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,251
People like you.

111
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:10,426
Ellen...

112
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,011
Do you want to go
for a drink later on?

113
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:17,099
Um... Um...

114
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,727
Well, I don't think
anywhere will be open.

115
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,064
Yeah, no, probably not.

116
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,900
Um, I'm on again
in the morning, so...

117
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,072
Yeah.

118
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,574
I better get on,
but good luck next time.

119
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:36,160
Oh, it was just
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

120
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,661
Don't worry about it.

121
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:41,957
I meant with
the supervisor application.

122
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,295
Right.

123
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,426
Need a piss.

124
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,346
Well done.
That went well, mate.

125
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,244
<i>PM
This is the driver.
Sorry for the bump.</i>

126
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,746
<i>Seems we hit
something on the line.</i>

127
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:28,916
<i>Please remain seated.
We should be on our way shortly.</i>

128
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,292
<i>Thank you.</i>

129
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:36,507
You alright?
Yeah, I'm fine.

130
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,426
That was quite a ride, mate.
Sorry about that, sir.

131
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,136
Yeah.
You alright, Ellen?

132
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,930
Look at this mess.

133
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,766
Don't worry about the mess.
We'll sort that out.

134
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,478
No, I'll do that.
No, no, no. <i>I'll</i> do that.

135
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,692
Allow me.

136
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,076
Thanks!
Any time.

137
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,000
Are these yours?
Cheers, yeah.

138
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,882
Mine, too. Thank you.

139
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,433
Maybe you should
check on the others?

140
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,895
Right, yeah. OK.
You're both sound, fine?

141
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,189
Yeah, I think we
got it covered.

142
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,251
Is everybody alright down here?
Madam, you alright?

143
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,003
Yes, yes, but what happened?

144
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,130
Have we crashed?
Did we come off the tracks?

145
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,715
We're trying to get
to the bottom of it.

146
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,093
You should have seat belts
if you wanna stop like that.

147
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:45,969
I hear you.
Sir, let me help you with these.

148
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,389
- Ged, please!
- Did we come off the track?

149
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,391
Let me take these.
I'll do it!

150
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,727
We're alright.
It's her you wanna worry about.

151
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,398
Ged!
Just take a seat for me.

152
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,566
Calm down.
Miss, you alright?

153
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,402
I've gotta call my mum.
I could have died.

154
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,946
Are you OK, though?
If this is broken, I will sue.

155
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,240
I understand your concern,
but you need to calm down.

156
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,449
Don't touch me, pervert!

157
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,246
Are you alright?
What do you think?

158
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:03,213
You alright, mate?
Yeah. We going soon,
or what?

159
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,883
Yeah, yeah. I'm just waiting
to hear from the driver.

160
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,885
Just take it easy for a minute.

161
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,219
You alright down there, sir?

162
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,015
I dropped my book.
Dropped your book...

163
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,017
Right, hang on.

164
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,814
Sir, here's your book.
Here you go, sir.

165
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,860
Oh, thanks. I've lost my page now.
I'd just got to a good bit.

166
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:28,530
I think you'll be alright, mate.
Just stay there and keep calm.

167
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,164
Driver, this is the guard.

168
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,124
Hello?

169
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,548
Hello?

170
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,694
Ladies and gentlemen,
apologies once again for the delay.

171
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,864
I'm still waiting on word
from the driver.

172
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,242
Thanks for your patience.

173
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,737
Dear, oh, dear.

174
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,740
Come on, sausage. Come here.

175
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,251
Oh, found my page!

176
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,080
This is a no smoking train, miss.

177
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,541
Piss off.

178
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,215
You want me to get out and push?

179
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,804
I don't believe this.

180
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,399
What's happening?
I tried knocking.

181
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,860
He's not answering
the intercom either.

182
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,455
Tony?

183
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,417
Tony?

184
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,544
Tony?

185
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,476
Maybe you should keep
an eye on the passengers.

186
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,604
Well, they wanna know
what's going on.

187
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,690
Perhaps give them some food
or something, keep them sweet.

188
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,027
Not much left.

189
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,945
Better than nothing.

190
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,877
No sign?

191
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:36,898
Hello. Hello. Um...
We seem to have broken down

192
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,359
just outside Eastborough.
I think...

193
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,736
I think it must be
Thornton Forest.

194
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,947
And we can't seem
to locate our driver.

195
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,701
Just looking for some advice
on how to proceed, over.

196
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,620
<i>Tell me about it'.
We've got' chaos out there tonight.</i>

197
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:54,457
<i>We've got' trees
down... signal failures...</i>

198
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,712
<i>ETA for replacement...</i>

199
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,048
Sorry, go again on the ETA?
Four hours?

200
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,050
The storm has brought down
a lot of trees.

201
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,553
You want me to stay
on this skanky train?
Fuck right off.

202
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,598
What does the driver say?
Does he think he can fix it?

203
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,142
The driver...

204
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,185
He's working on it.

205
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:17,397
Right, so he might be able
to get us going again?

206
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,774
No... I don't know... Maybe?

207
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:22,402
Is the train
broken down or not?

208
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,321
What did he actually say?

209
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,615
I haven't been able to speak to him.
I can't get through.

210
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,617
Right. Forget it,
<i>I'll</i> ask him myself.

211
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,077
You can't do that.
Well, watch me do that.

212
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,788
No, we don't know
where he is.

213
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,374
Sorry?

214
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,252
Are you telling us
the driver is missing?

215
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,378
Oh, my God.

216
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,591
He didn't come back.
Where's he gone?

217
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,676
I don't know.
I'm trying to work on it.

218
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,595
I didn't want to worry you
so I didn't say anything.

219
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:51,640
Well, that didn't really work,
did it?

220
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:55,602
I don't suppose you know
how to drive it?
The train, I mean.

221
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:56,978
I'm afraid not.

222
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,105
You need to get
your supervisor on the radio.

223
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,191
My husband
has high blood pressure.

224
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,276
He can't wait here all night.

225
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,030
I want my money back.

226
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,490
Please just calm down.

227
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,329
Alright!

228
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,164
Thank you.

229
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,460
Now, the way I see it,
we've got two options.

230
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:24,047
Either we all sit here
and compose our complaint letters,

231
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,758
or we actually do
something about it.

232
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,386
Like what?
Like use those wiggly things

233
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,555
on the end of your legs
and walk on out of here.

234
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,018
The station can't be more
than, what, a two-mile walk?

235
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:41,147
Three, max. We might even get
a phone signal before then.

236
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,024
I'm in.

237
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:46,361
Wait, wait, wait. No, no!
You can't just...

238
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:49,406
Safety protocol clearly states
passengers must stay

239
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,658
on the train and await assistance.
Those are the rules.

240
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:55,161
Ridiculous.
It's not.
I will lose my job.

241
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:58,081
Sir! You can't get out of there
without any keys.

242
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,918
And do you have
some keys?
Yes.

243
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,503
Would you kindly use them?
No.

244
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,880
Come on!
No, sir.
I will lose my job.

245
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,590
I can't open the door.

246
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,010
We can follow the tracks,
all stay together.

247
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,846
I don't see there'll be
a problem.

248
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,765
Yeah, come on.
It's stopped raining now.

249
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,019
- Please.
- Come on.

250
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,187
Well?

251
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,690
I can't leave the train
with these pensioners.

252
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,029
You just make sure
you keep up, son.

253
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,573
Come on!

254
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:34,617
Wouldn't you rather spend
the night in your own bed?

255
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,370
Huh?

256
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:40,373
Get your keys out.

257
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,126
Please.

258
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,091
I'm gonna lose my job
for doing this.

259
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,231
Come on.
Come on, then.

260
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,192
- OK?
- Yes, fine, come on.

261
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:10,612
Just keep straight
down there. Down there.

262
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:14,240
Keep this side of the...
Wait up there, please.

263
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:17,285
- Want a hand?
- I'll hold your arm.

264
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,829
Queue up there,
please, madam.

265
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,499
No, I'm first.
OK, I'll go first.

266
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,585
- Bit of a drop, isn't it?
- You'll be alright.

267
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,337
Perhaps you won't.

268
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,844
- OK...
- Careful.

269
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,139
Alright?

270
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,934
There's a rail here you've
just got to get your foot on.

271
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,603
Right... Ooh, OK.

272
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,522
Thank you very much.

273
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:48,274
Last but not least.

274
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,443
Whee!

275
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,112
Thanks.
It's my pleasure.

276
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,947
Five, six, seven...

277
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,825
Right, stick together, please.
Mind your step out here.

278
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,077
I'll light the path.

279
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,995
<i>I'll</i> light the track.

280
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,208
That's the long metal thing
that the train goes on, is it, boss?

281
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,669
Stick together, please.

282
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:11,172
I'm Nina.
Billy.

283
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,174
Hey!
Fuel leak.

284
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,717
Oh.

285
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,637
Ooh!
Why don't you walk with me?

286
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,307
We don't want you
falling over in the dark.

287
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,480
Stick together, please!

288
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:31,109
Recognize where we are?
Could be Thornton Forest.

289
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,203
You all right
there at the back, sir?

290
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,717
Can you hurry up at the front?

291
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,927
I want to get there tonight.

292
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,684
Not exactly
a favorite pastime of mine,

293
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,644
trekking through the woods.

294
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,412
Don't worry, it's just
a deer or something.

295
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,247
Keep going.

296
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,760
Come on, guys,
it's getting closer now.

297
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,345
Do you think
it could be the driver?

298
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,804
Why would he be
in the bushes?

299
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:42,972
I don't know.

300
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,474
It just sounds like it could be.

301
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,230
Just wait here.
Can we not just keep on going?

302
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,732
What do you mean "wait here"?

303
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,734
You can't just leave us.

304
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,653
I'll find out.
Where are you going?

305
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,822
Leave us on our own.

306
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:02,784
- Where's he gone?
- Come on!

307
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:14,545
Joe, what is it?

308
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,306
Go. Go.

309
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,102
Back on the train, everyone!

310
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,945
Get back
on the train, everyone!

311
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,620
Hurry!

312
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:51,958
Come on!

313
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,626
Joe, hurry!

314
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,046
Where's the key?

315
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,633
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

316
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,303
Quick!

317
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,351
Alright, go. Go, go, go, go!

318
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,603
- Quickly!
- Hurry up.

319
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,150
Joe, get in!

320
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,777
Joe, get in!
Wait!

321
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,654
Come on!

322
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,906
Wait!
Hurry, come on. Hurry!

323
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,826
- Get in, quick.
- Come on, Joe!

324
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,202
Wait!

325
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,079
Let's go, come on!

326
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,754
- Help me!
- Get in, get in! In, in!

327
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,089
Shut the fucking door!

328
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:04,113
We need to move her.
Someone help me get her up!

329
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,416
We need to get her up.

330
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,169
Help me, please.
Lift, lift. Please.

331
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,880
And lift. Lift her up.
Come on. OK, lift.

332
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,299
Calm down,
shh, calm down.

333
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,718
Everyone, step back!

334
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,389
We'll lie her down
on the chair.

335
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,393
Try and calm her down.
Here, take this.

336
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,144
Alright, wrap it round.

337
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:39,148
Above the wound. Tighter!
Pull it down. Step back.

338
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,237
What can you see?

339
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,114
I can't see anything!

340
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,991
Get the first aid kit!
And water!

341
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,285
Shh.

342
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,832
Breathe, breathe.

343
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,920
- Hurry up.
- Get some water!

344
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,840
You'll be fine.

345
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,925
- Shh...
- Breathe, breathe.

346
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,593
Everybody just stay calm!

347
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,804
I don't know what I'm doing.

348
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,935
Oh, my God, I don't know
what I'm doing.

349
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,271
Pressure on,
get the pressure on!

350
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,442
What do you see?
I can't see anything!

351
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:24,527
The door! Is it secure?

352
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,279
Check the door.

353
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,075
Just over there.

354
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,829
What the fuck was that?

355
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,206
Keep her quiet,
for fuck's sake!

356
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,958
Shh...

357
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:44,213
Get her to shut the fuck up.

358
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:52,597
What is that?

359
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,236
Fuck. Fuck.

360
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,708
Shh...

361
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:28,716
Shh... Please.

362
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,689
It's gone. It's gone.
It's gone.

363
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,199
We've got to get her
to a hospital.

364
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:55,368
We need to get her
to a hospital.

365
00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:00,540
Joe, we've got
to call someone.
Joe! Joe!

366
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,416
Joe. Joe...

367
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,919
Joe! Joe!
We need to call someone.

368
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:08,798
We need to call... call someone.
Just get someone, Joe.

369
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,133
Now! Now! Go, now!

370
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,558
This is the Eastborough
sprinter service

371
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,768
requesting immediate
emergency assistance.

372
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,229
Hello?

373
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:25,106
Hello?

374
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,567
Hello?

375
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,069
Hello?!

376
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,785
You alright, mate?

377
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,329
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

378
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,331
This was working earlier.

379
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:45,293
How about getting
the engine started?

380
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,421
I haven't got the first clue
about trains. Do you?

381
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,757
I know engines.
Dirt bikes, lawnmowers.

382
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,552
It's my old man's business, repairs.

383
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:58,306
- There's your problem.
- The fuel leak?

384
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:00,975
Yeah, the line must have split
when we crashed.

385
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,352
There might be some left
in the tank, but...

386
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:07,481
without pressure we ain't gonna
be able to restart her.

387
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:09,859
We're going nowhere
till it's patched.

388
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,700
I better tell the others.

389
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:46,479
We're just gonna have
to sit tight and wait for help.

390
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:49,649
My wife needs
medical attention now!

391
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:54,320
And meanwhile we're just
a train full of bear bait.

392
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,448
It wasn't a bear.

393
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:00,326
Bears don't howl.

394
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:04,497
What was it then, a wolf?
A dog couldn't do that.

395
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,501
There haven't been any bears
or wolves round here for centuries.

396
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,670
What animal did that to her?

397
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,297
It wasn't an animal.

398
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:18,928
It was more like a man.

399
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,683
Just lie back, love.
You need to rest.

400
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:26,185
No, you're not listening.
You don't understand.

401
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,896
It wasn't an animal.

402
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,526
She's in shock.

403
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:40,408
What happened
to the driver?

404
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,622
What?

405
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,626
What aren't you telling us?

406
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,438
That's inside the train.
Inside?

407
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:18,738
What are you doing?
No, that's not a good idea.

408
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,121
Oh, fuck.

409
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,937
You've got a knife, right?

410
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:53,939
Why would I have a knife?

411
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,166
Get a key!

412
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:27,598
Hurry UP!

413
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,482
No, no!
Fuckin' hell!

414
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:40,152
Ow! Oh, fuck!

415
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,614
Fuck.

416
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,496
Stinks of piss down here.

417
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,832
Who are you?

418
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:56,877
He's one of the passengers
from earlier. Help him up.

419
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,225
I don't-I don't believe this.

420
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:17,690
So... So what you're saying...

421
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,859
is...

422
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,863
is that we've definitely
gone past Barrock's Hill?

423
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,577
Have you not heard anything
we just told you?

424
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,377
No signal.
What a surprise.

425
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,215
I can't believe
I missed my stop.

426
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:50,347
It's great to have you on board.

427
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,914
Try to hold still, love.

428
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:35,351
She's got a fever.
Shock?

429
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,939
I've dealt
with a dog bite before,

430
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,524
but I don't know
what I'm doing.

431
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:45,694
Ellen, just sit down,
stay calm for a minute.

432
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,321
Sit down.

433
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,462
There you are.

434
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,549
You OK?

435
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:10,928
What's wrong with her?

436
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:16,475
They're looking after her,
don't worry.

437
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,060
She'll be fine.

438
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,022
There was so much blood.

439
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:28,070
My daughter's got shoes like those.
They're cool.

440
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:30,990
Thanks.

441
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,325
She cannot wait
to be a teenager.

442
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,160
She hardly ever talks
to me anymore.

443
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,121
She says that I embarrass her.

444
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,833
You seem pretty nice.

445
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:49,299
My mum's my best friend.
Really?

446
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,138
There's hope for me yet, then.

447
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,935
Won't she wonder
where you are?

448
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:02,855
No. She's usually in bed
by the time I get home,

449
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:05,107
and weekends
she's with her dad, so I never...

450
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:09,903
It's back.

451
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:16,952
What the fuck is that?

452
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:26,295
Maybe someone's come to...
Shh...

453
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,425
What the fuck is it?

454
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,260
Stay back.

455
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,887
Where's it going?

456
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,889
Just be quiet. Shh.

457
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:41,935
- Whose phone is that?
- Not mine!

458
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:44,897
- What the fuck?
- It must be someone's!

459
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,483
Someone's got reception!

460
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:50,402
It's yours. Answer it!
Oh, my God. It's me.

461
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:52,321
Well, answer it, then.

462
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,075
Hello? Hello?
Who is it?

463
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:58,577
Mum, you've got to listen to me.
Something's happened.

464
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,330
Tell her where we are.
Please, Mum, no, please.

465
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,415
Give me the phone.
Tell her where we are!

466
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:05,584
Out of my way.
Give me that thing!

467
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,587
Get off me!

468
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:19,681
Help me!

469
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:40,494
Come on!

470
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,214
Shh, shh, shh!

471
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,967
Shut up! Shut up!

472
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,302
I think it's gone.

473
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:00,055
What is it?
Does anyone know?

474
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,974
It ain't a fucking dog,
I can tell you that.

475
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,475
Shut up!

476
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:04,893
We can't just leave her!

477
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:07,020
She's gone!
We've got to go back!

478
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:09,648
Hey, hey, come back!

479
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,817
She might still be alive,
We can't just leave her!

480
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,319
Why did you stop me?
I could have got her!

481
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:17,322
I was trying to save you!

482
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:20,409
It was too late for her!
It's your fault!

483
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,035
Stop it.

484
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,495
You still wanna sit and wait?

485
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,080
I didn't know this would happen!

486
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:26,582
You've got to do something!

487
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,167
It's too easy for it to get in.

488
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,418
What are we gonna do?

489
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,170
Stop listening to this prick.

490
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:32,588
He's doing his best!

491
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,506
I shouldn't even
be on this train.

492
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:36,133
Enough!

493
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,432
Do you all wanna die tonight?

494
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:47,019
Cos if you do, you just
carry on whinging and arguing,

495
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:50,189
and soon enough,
that thing out there,

496
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:52,482
he'll take care of it for you.

497
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:59,156
But if you still intend to get home,
then start acting like it.

498
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:02,367
It's an animal.

499
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:05,579
Animals hunt
what's easy to catch.

500
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,208
And look at us.

501
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,959
We're sitting ducks here.

502
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:22,387
So let's try and make it
a little bit harder

503
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:24,431
for the bastard, shall we?

504
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:29,686
Have you got any tools
on this train?

505
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:09,810
What's wrong with you?
Dodgy kebab gave me the shits.

506
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:19,278
Oh! It's not easy, is it?
What?

507
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:23,073
Here. Here, <i>I'll</i> help you. Yeah.

508
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:27,327
Thank you.

509
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:34,668
Listen, I'm sorry about being
such a cow to you before.

510
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,880
It's just... I've spent too much
of my life on this train.

511
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:41,925
Tell me about it.

512
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,937
Jenny, here's
some water, love.

513
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,106
Oh, sorry,
it's nearly empty.

514
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,860
Was there any water anywhere?
Joe's got the last bottle.

515
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,403
Right.

516
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:51,536
I was told you might have
a bottle of water.

517
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,163
Yeah, course.

518
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:05,550
What was her name?

519
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:07,386
Who?

520
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:10,764
The girl...
The girl who was...

521
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:13,225
Oh. Ooh, um...

522
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:24,361
I don't know.

523
00:48:28,657 --> 00:48:30,075
Do you have any children?

524
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:35,247
Yes. I've got a daughter
who's about to be 13.

525
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,791
Oh.
You?

526
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,923
Wasn't to be.

527
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:49,761
We wanted to, but...

528
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,472
Like we always say,
we have each other

529
00:48:52,556 --> 00:48:55,058
and that's
the most important thing.

530
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:02,732
Thank you.

531
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:06,445
And thank you
for getting us in here.

532
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:08,029
No problem.

533
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:12,325
You're doing alright, you know.

534
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:38,894
It's coming back, you know.
Sorry?

535
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:41,521
Our friend out there
is coming back.

536
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:44,024
Might not.
Might have had enough.

537
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:49,654
Yeah.

538
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,202
Let me show you something.

539
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:03,919
Country house.
Wife, kids, dog, the works.

540
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,755
But then there's this.

541
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:09,841
A city flat.

542
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:11,718
Five minutes' walk
from the office,

543
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:13,595
nice view of Tower Bridge,

544
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,640
perfect for entertaining
young ladies.

545
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:20,227
Discreet.

546
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,897
Two worlds never meet,
and everyone is happy.

547
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,106
Good for you.

548
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,652
The point is, we do
what we have to to get by.

549
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:32,948
Sometimes it ain't nice.

550
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:42,749
Take this lot.
Old, weak, afraid.

551
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,710
They're natural born victims.

552
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:49,130
And when that thing comes back,
when it gets in here,

553
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:51,591
you can stand with them
and wait your turn to die,

554
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:54,886
or you can use your keys
and open one of these doors,

555
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:58,932
and maybe...
maybe you and I...

556
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:01,726
can get out of this alive.

557
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:08,483
Survival of the fittest,
my friend.

558
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:13,780
You think about it.

559
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:21,162
Jesus.

560
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:23,999
Jenny... Jenny.

561
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:27,002
Can you hear me?

562
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:30,171
What the fuck's
happening to her?

563
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:32,382
She needs help.
She's sick.

564
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,676
But why are
her teeth falling out?

565
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:36,636
Shut it!
Look, old man,

566
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,097
I am just saying that...
I know what you're saying.

567
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,516
Stop it!

568
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,019
Joe? Joe?

569
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:47,230
Someone's missing.

570
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,740
The football guy.
He said he needed a shit.

571
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:59,284
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

572
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:03,121
He's gone.
You don't know that.

573
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:04,664
Just give him a minute.

574
00:52:09,586 --> 00:52:11,338
Wait here.

575
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,467
Hurry up.

576
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:18,178
- Hey. hey, where's he going?
- What's happening?

577
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:19,804
Don't wanna lose anyone else.

578
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:21,306
It's fine.
Just one minute.

579
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:22,891
I'm not leaving this open.

580
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,397
Paul?
What?

581
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:32,901
Paul, come on, hurry up,
open the door.

582
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:35,170
You've got to get in the other carriage.
It's not safe here.

583
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,571
Fuck's sake.
Paul?

584
00:52:36,655 --> 00:52:37,989
What?!
Paul, hurry up.

585
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:39,699
I can't do a shit
in peace.

586
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:42,869
No, it's not safe.
For fuck's sake.

587
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:45,705
Come on. Come on!

588
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:48,750
The... The door...

589
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,002
What?
I can't open the door!

590
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,674
Oh, fuck.
The door is jammed!

591
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:02,430
Right... That's it.

592
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:03,682
What are you doing?

593
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:05,350
He's been long enough.

594
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:11,940
Shit! Help me!
Help me!

595
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,066
Let me go!

596
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,237
Get me the fuck out!

597
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,240
Shit! Get me out of here!

598
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:24,369
Get me out! Fuck!
Get me out!

599
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,621
It's fucking broke...

600
00:53:58,278 --> 00:54:00,488
Come on!

601
00:54:00,572 --> 00:54:03,074
Fucking open the fucking door!

602
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,461
What are you doing?
Getting out of here.

603
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:16,629
We're trapped
on this fucking train.

604
00:54:16,713 --> 00:54:18,923
What about Joe?
He made his choice.

605
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,593
At least he had the guts to try.
You should have gone with him!

606
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:23,011
You should be helping him!

607
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:24,429
Just get out the fucking train!

608
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,473
We need to get them out, too!

609
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:29,100
Fuck!
Hurry up!

610
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:31,269
The key.

611
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:39,694
Open the fucking door!

612
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:42,071
Fucking hell...

613
00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:50,371
Let's barricade it, quick!

614
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,377
Hold it, hold it!

615
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:59,172
It's coming, it's coming!

616
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:02,592
- It's not gonna open!
- Hey!

617
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:07,555
We need your help!
Pass me that.

618
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:29,178
Do something! Help him!

619
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:57,707
Fucking die!

620
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:03,504
It's dead. It's OK.

621
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:05,590
Fucking let go!

622
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:07,634
It's dead.

623
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:13,640
Shh... It's gone. OK.

624
00:57:15,642 --> 00:57:18,770
It's OK.

625
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:19,979
It's OK.

626
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:37,163
What did we just kill?

627
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:40,625
It's a man.

628
00:57:41,918 --> 00:57:46,130
But its legs... and its teeth...

629
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,342
are more like a dog's.

630
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:51,386
More like a wolf's.

631
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,683
What?
Just saying.

632
00:57:56,766 --> 00:57:59,310
What are you saying?

633
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:01,813
Isn't it obvious?

634
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:04,232
We're looking
at a werewolf.

635
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:08,653
What, like a full moon
and silver bullet sort of thing?

636
00:58:08,695 --> 00:58:11,572
No...

637
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:15,660
But look at the legs,
triplejointed,

638
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:18,162
the eyes, teeth.

639
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:23,167
Whatever it is, it's some kind
of hybrid between man and wolf.

640
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:25,586
It's wearing a ring. Look.

641
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:29,966
It used to be like us.

642
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:35,263
Perhaps it's a disease.
Like a mutation.

643
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:38,057
Something you catch
from animals.

644
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,395
Or a bite.

645
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:14,302
You're all too young to remember
the Thornton Forest rail crash.

646
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:15,511
1963.

647
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:23,102
Late night express came
off the tracks, somewhere near here.

648
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:28,983
When the emergency services
got to them,

649
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:32,111
there was no one left to save.

650
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:36,574
All sorts of tales
about what they found,

651
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:40,661
bodies half eaten by animals,
some just gone.

652
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:46,918
They never did find out
what really happened.

653
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:51,839
I never gave it much
thought after that.

654
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,808
Until tonight.

655
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:05,603
So this has happened before.

656
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:08,564
We've killed it now,
so we're sweet.

657
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:02,493
Jenny?

658
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,287
Jen?

659
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:07,498
Honey?

660
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,751
She's one of them.

661
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,673
She's fucking one of them.

662
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:18,009
You leave her alone!
She's sick.

663
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,594
No, she's not.

664
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,888
She is infected.

665
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,224
We all know it.

666
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:29,187
And if we are gonna survive,
she has to go.

667
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:31,856
You touch one hair
on my Jenny's head

668
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:34,775
and <i>I'll</i> break your bloody neck.

669
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:36,861
I don't think so, old man.

670
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:39,697
Stay away from her, OK?

671
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,076
Alright.

672
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:53,502
No, no, no!

673
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:58,883
No, no, no, no, no!

674
01:02:01,344 --> 01:02:03,221
Stop it!

675
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:04,972
Leave her alone!

676
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:09,060
Why don't you take a seat, sir.

677
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:11,896
Ged! Ged, where am I?

678
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:15,066
Alright, Jenny.

679
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:17,109
Where am I?

680
01:02:17,193 --> 01:02:19,070
Thank you.

681
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:20,905
- Give me your fucking belt.
- What?

682
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:22,865
Give me your belt!

683
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:27,161
- Tie him down.
- With pleasure.

684
01:02:31,249 --> 01:02:34,502
Her, too.

685
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:37,129
We can't stay here.

686
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:39,423
We're not going to.

687
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:02,488
You've done this before.

688
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:05,032
Dirty bitch.

689
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:07,118
Ow!

690
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:17,169
If we can find the leak,
patch it up,

691
01:03:17,253 --> 01:03:18,921
there might be enough left
to get us moving.

692
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:21,007
All we need is enough
to get clear of the woods.

693
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,633
Who's going?
Me.

694
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:24,468
I'm the only one
who knows how.

695
01:03:24,552 --> 01:03:27,805
I could do
with a lookout, though.

696
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:29,348
I'll do it.

697
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,184
That's that sorted then.

698
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:36,314
So the ASBO kid's
fixing the train?

699
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:39,984
I know engines, you prick.
Yeah, right.

700
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:42,028
I got accepted onto
an engineering course, actually.

701
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:45,197
That's why I was in town today.

702
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:46,574
Impressive.

703
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:49,994
Nuhuhuhuhuh.

704
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:52,997
Watch him.
Of course.

705
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:57,668
Let's go.

706
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:02,882
Engine lights.

707
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:05,760
These go green, it means
I've patched the leak.

708
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:08,429
Fuel gauge.
That needle bounces up,

709
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,015
you need to turn on
the ignition here.

710
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:13,059
Then the main light
should come on.

711
01:04:13,142 --> 01:04:16,270
That's it?
Not quite.

712
01:04:16,354 --> 01:04:19,690
Next you need to prime the pump.
Pull down hard here.

713
01:04:19,774 --> 01:04:23,361
Engage forward
on the column,

714
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:25,571
then you need to push
forward on the accelerator.

715
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:29,408
Nice and slowly.
Drive us out of this shithole, yeah?

716
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,619
Oh, and if you could remember
to pick me up on the way out,

717
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:34,705
<i>I'll</i> buy you a beer.
Is it true?

718
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:36,707
About your interview?

719
01:04:36,749 --> 01:04:38,501
Yeah, pretty much.

720
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:42,213
I saw you chuck
your jacket and tie in the bin.

721
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:45,883
Huh. Stupid cow said I needed
A-levels, didn't she?

722
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,929
Guess we'll see
if she was right.

723
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:55,142
I think you
should say something.

724
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:09,865
This is your guard speaking.

725
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,245
<i>I'd like to apologize
once again</i>

726
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:17,498
<i>for the delay to your journey
this evening.</i>

727
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:27,758
A few hours ago
we were strangers.

728
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:29,885
Most of you probably wish
we still were.

729
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:37,143
But we're gonna try
and get out of here now.

730
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:42,982
We're gonna do
whatever it takes to survive.

731
01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:45,943
Together.

732
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:48,737
<i>All of us.</i>

733
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:55,161
<i>I know you all
just want to get home.</i>

734
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:01,500
<i>So do I.</i>

735
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:14,638
Next stop, Eastborough.

736
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:20,102
You ready?

737
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:23,939
Yeah.

738
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:54,678
Shine it down there.

739
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,612
This is it.

740
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:19,453
Keep an eye out, yeah?

741
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:28,754
OK...

742
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:47,982
You don't remember me
at all, do you?

743
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:53,028
Should I?

744
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:54,989
I've been trying
to place you all night.

745
01:07:55,072 --> 01:07:57,825
Must be three years ago now?

746
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:00,661
I came for an interview
at Naughton and Price Brokers.

747
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,337
I thought it was going
quite well, actually.

748
01:08:02,413 --> 01:08:05,374
But you couldn't stop
looking down my top.

749
01:08:08,877 --> 01:08:12,756
You had a tan line where your
wedding ring should have been.

750
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:16,218
And? Well, you obviously
didn't make the grade.

751
01:08:16,302 --> 01:08:17,678
Oh, well, I was
more than qualified.

752
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,179
But you were more interested

753
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:21,640
in taking me back home
for a followup.

754
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:27,980
Yes...

755
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:35,404
But you're right.
I don't remember you.

756
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:39,950
But I know your type.
Oh, yes?

757
01:08:39,992 --> 01:08:44,747
You arrive one day
in my office, full of sparkle...

758
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:47,958
happy to fight it out
with the boys

759
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:51,045
for a seat at the big table.

760
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:54,214
And then after a couple of years
you swan off for nine months.

761
01:08:57,635 --> 01:09:01,513
And when you return,
you're tired all the time,

762
01:09:01,597 --> 01:09:04,224
wracked by guilt,

763
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:07,478
all that baby weight
making it oh-so-hard

764
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:09,772
to fight your way
back up the ladder.

765
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:15,819
No more sparkle.

766
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:17,988
Jesus.

767
01:09:18,072 --> 01:09:20,074
I feel sorry for your wife.

768
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,204
Don't you worry about her.

769
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:27,665
Hope you haven't got
any kids to fuck up, too.

770
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:35,839
Come on, Jenny. Hold on.

771
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:38,092
Gonna get you
out of here soon.

772
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,177
Use your eyes, granddad.

773
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,179
There is no helping her.

774
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:44,848
She just needs the hospital.
They'll be able to do something.

775
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:49,186
If we don't do something
about her now,

776
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:50,646
it'll be too late.

777
01:10:19,675 --> 01:10:21,260
Joe?

778
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:28,434
Why did you want that
stupid promotion anyway?

779
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:33,230
I don't know.

780
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:36,483
I guess I thought
I could change something.

781
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:38,402
Make people notice me.

782
01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:40,112
It's what you do that matters,

783
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:42,322
not what it says
on your name badge.

784
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:46,285
You've helped those people.

785
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:51,123
You've helped all of us.
Hmm.

786
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:54,668
I'm seriously thinking about
a change of career after tonight.

787
01:11:04,887 --> 01:11:08,307
Fuck, come on.
Fuck, where are you?

788
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,517
Come on, come on.

789
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:14,897
Matt... Matt?

790
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:18,150
Chuck me the tape.

791
01:11:20,652 --> 01:11:22,112
Found the leak.

792
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:23,822
Underqualified, my arse.

793
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:27,242
Here, chuck me that wrench.

794
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,037
Ah, there we go.

795
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:37,878
OK.

796
01:11:38,796 --> 01:11:40,672
Ah, fuck.

797
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,968
Listen, um, about before,

798
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,470
all that business with the ax.

799
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,472
I don't know
what came over me.

800
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:49,598
OK, mate.

801
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:52,643
OK...

802
01:11:57,898 --> 01:12:00,359
Help...

803
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:01,985
Help me...

804
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:04,363
Get that light on me, buddy.

805
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,087
Matt, keep that light on me.

806
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:23,006
Matt! Matt! What the fuck
are you doing?

807
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:26,718
For fuck's sake...

808
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:34,810
Hello?

809
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:55,205
Help me!

810
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:58,417
Hello?
Help!

811
01:13:02,504 --> 01:13:04,214
Where are you?

812
01:13:11,722 --> 01:13:14,099
Help!

813
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:16,685
Look, I...

814
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:22,149
About before, I...

815
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,276
I'm sorry, I...

816
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:26,445
It just all happened so quickly.

817
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:36,830
Where are you?

818
01:13:46,757 --> 01:13:48,216
Help...

819
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:34,221
Oh, no.

820
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,811
Oh, fuck.

821
01:14:41,937 --> 01:14:43,647
Hey!

822
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,315
Help!

823
01:14:45,399 --> 01:14:47,693
Matthew!

824
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:50,737
Fuck! She's fucking changing!

825
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:53,573
Come on, let me out of here!
She's turning, come on!

826
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:55,659
There's one wolf out there

827
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:57,494
and there's one fucking wolf
in here.

828
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:58,829
We're all gonna die!

829
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,831
Just shut up and let me think!

830
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:03,500
Hey! Help! Fuck!

831
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,293
Untie me, you stupid bitch!

832
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:08,338
Come on, come on, come on.

833
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,007
Come on!

834
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:11,967
This should be it.

835
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:21,601
Ellen! Quick!
He got the lights on.

836
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:24,521
Oh!
OK. Fuel...

837
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:27,691
That one.
Right, what's next?

838
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:30,277
Pump.
Prime the pump.

839
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,530
Gears.

840
01:15:33,572 --> 01:15:36,616
OK, what are we doing?
Just wait. Gotta wait for it.

841
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:41,056
Where are they?

842
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:49,648
OK, let's go. Let's go.
No, we can't. Ellen, no!

843
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:56,947
Shit. Shit.

844
01:16:56,988 --> 01:17:00,200
Oh, my God. Come on.
We're moving.

845
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:03,745
Thank fuck!

846
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:08,125
Oh, God.

847
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:10,752
We're moving, Jenny.
Can you-

848
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:15,298
Oh, my God.
What the...

849
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,925
Oh, my God!

850
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,885
Fucking hell!

851
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:21,221
Fucking hell! Let me out
of here! Get me out of here!

852
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:23,181
Do it, do it, do it!

853
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:28,353
Hurry, hurry. Hurry up.

854
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:33,108
Help me.

855
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:39,489
Jenny.

856
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:43,076
It's working. No, look, it's working.
Look, it's working.

857
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,288
It's working. Go, come on,
it's going, it's going.

858
01:17:47,956 --> 01:17:50,167
Christ!

859
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:02,137
Help me!

860
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:04,639
Help me!

861
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:12,355
No! No, God, no.

862
01:18:14,983 --> 01:18:17,235
Oh, no!

863
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:36,046
Please don't... Please don't...

864
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:39,090
Please don't...
Please, please don't kill me.

865
01:18:39,174 --> 01:18:41,384
No, no!

866
01:18:41,468 --> 01:18:42,802
Jenny.

867
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:50,352
No!

868
01:18:55,065 --> 01:18:57,359
Oh, shit.
Jenny.

869
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:09,996
Oh, God.

870
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:20,090
No... Stay away from me!

871
01:19:21,675 --> 01:19:22,842
Stay away!

872
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:30,850
Oh...

873
01:19:37,899 --> 01:19:40,277
No... No!

874
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,695
Fuck!

875
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:46,449
No!

876
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:49,452
Why has it stopped?
What's happened?

877
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:57,377
Ellen, come on!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

878
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:11,266
Stay away from me.

879
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:13,101
Stay away!

880
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:33,163
Better late than never.

881
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:38,418
Good to see you've
finally grown a pair.

882
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,253
Joe! Joe!

883
01:20:40,337 --> 01:20:42,505
Come on! Come on then!

884
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,466
Where's Kate?

885
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:49,054
Where's Kate?

886
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:52,015
She'd still be alive
if you hadn't tied me up.

887
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:24,798
Where exactly
are we going to, boss?

888
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:27,926
The woods.
We'll never stand a chance.

889
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:37,102
Unless one of us stays behind.

890
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:58,081
Stop it!

891
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:02,669
Back off!

892
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:05,088
Get over there! Get back!

893
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:09,426
Fucking bitch.

894
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:19,853
You really think you're
in control, don't you, Joe?

895
01:22:23,148 --> 01:22:25,275
You've finally become a man,

896
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:28,528
and you've stood up to
the challenge well.

897
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:30,280
Haven't you?

898
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:33,950
You think you've got it
all worked out, don't you?

899
01:22:37,162 --> 01:22:39,164
Oh, no.

900
01:22:52,969 --> 01:22:54,929
Come on, then!

901
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:05,982
Oi!

902
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:10,320
Fuck you, bitch.

903
01:23:15,158 --> 01:23:16,493
Come on.

904
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:17,702
Come on!

905
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:20,747
Come on!

906
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,749
Come on, you fucking mutts!

907
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:25,710
Come on!

908
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:28,338
Get that door open.
Come on! Let's 'ave it!

909
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:35,970
Go, go, go! Billy!

910
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:38,181
Billy!

911
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:42,894
Come on!

912
01:24:17,178 --> 01:24:20,598
Follow the track!
The track!

913
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:26,062
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

914
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:27,730
Let's go!
Too late.

915
01:24:27,814 --> 01:24:28,648
What?
It's too late.

916
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:30,441
No, let's go!

917
01:24:30,525 --> 01:24:33,111
They're on to us.
No, let's go, Joe!

918
01:24:33,194 --> 01:24:36,030
There's a track.
There's a track there.

919
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:37,991
Joe!

920
01:24:40,827 --> 01:24:42,412
Come on.

921
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:52,130
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

922
01:24:53,047 --> 01:24:55,925
No, no. No!

923
01:24:55,967 --> 01:24:58,636
Joe! Joe, no, come on!

924
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,430
You have to go.

925
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:02,140
Come with me, Joe!

926
01:25:02,223 --> 01:25:04,601
Run! Ellen, run!

927
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:09,105
Go! Go!

928
01:25:40,428 --> 01:25:42,138
Come on!

929
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:44,682
Come on!

930
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:13,104
Oh! Ow.

931
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:17,984
First thing I'm gonna do
is buy this place

932
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,569
and burn it the fuck down.

933
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,252
Hello?

934
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:40,047
Who's there?

935
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,720
Hello?

936
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:54,604
Joe?

937
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:57,148
Where are you, mate?

938
01:27:57,231 --> 01:27:58,775
Joe?

939
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,877
Oh, fuck!
