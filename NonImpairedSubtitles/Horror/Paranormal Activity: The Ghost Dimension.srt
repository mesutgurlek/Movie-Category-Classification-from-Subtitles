1
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,889
I'm scared.

2
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,474
Don't be scared.

3
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,642
Who is he?

4
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,644
He's gonna be your teacher.

5
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,856
This is a very good day.

6
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,150
Do you know why?

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,820
'Cause today is a beginning.

8
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,906
Your friend, Tobi?

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,326
I've known him for a long time.

10
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,829
I've known him by other names.

11
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,165
Grandma Lois knows him, too.

12
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,918
I had to learn, too.

13
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,253
It was hard at first.

14
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,838
But it was worth it.

15
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,007
Kristi, you're going to grow up

16
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,094
and you're going to have a son
who is one of the chosen.

17
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,470
And, Katie,

18
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,098
your gift is your strength.

19
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,600
A lot is going to be asked of you.

20
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,852
You're gonna have to
take care of your sister

21
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,062
and a lot of others.

22
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,856
There's a special girl out there,
a lot like you.

23
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,983
And he's going to bring her to us.

24
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,371
What did you draw, sweetie?

25
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,957
-Uncle Mike. Screaming.
-That's Uncle Mike?

26
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,626
Screaming?

27
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,503
Remember what we're
gonna do when he gets here?

28
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,755
-Boo!
-Like, real big. Boo!

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Boo!

30
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,299
You want to practice again
before he gets here?

31
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,509
Boo!

32
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,719
Hey, hey, hey!
Remember what we're gonna do, okay?

33
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,684
Spooky. Why is the door open?

34
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,144
Boo!

35
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,479
Oh, my gosh! It's my favorite niece!

36
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,564
What's up, bro?

37
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,066
What is on that face of yours,
Uncle Mike?

38
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,818
What? You like this?

39
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,070
You fertilizing it? Is that Monsanto?

40
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,531
That's funny. Is this a rental?

41
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,866
This is ridiculous!

42
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,659
I can't wait to show you my room.

43
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,536
It's nice and cozy in here.

44
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,164
-Two.
-You have two rooms?

45
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,167
-Hey! How are you?
-Mommy, Mike's here.

46
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,587
Are you staying for a month?
That bag is massive!

47
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,505
Is there anything in there for me?

48
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,007
-Hey, good to see you.
-We love Mike.

49
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,217
-Hey!
-You remember Skyler, right?

50
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,719
How are you?
I haven't seen you in forever.

51
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,803
Good. Yeah!

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
-Hi.
-Nice.

53
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,058
You look good. Your mustache...

54
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,227
She's not European. She's American.

55
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,355
Two weeks? Really?
I thought you said two days.

56
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,066
He just got dumped over email.
He's devastated.

57
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,653
Babe, his bag is his whole apartment.
It's huge.

58
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,993
Just making a rainbow.

59
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,369
-It's okay.
-Sorry.

60
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,871
Yeah, we didn't use that vase, anyway.

61
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,456
Here's Uncle Mike.

62
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,628
Why am I old all of a sudden?

63
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,463
That's exactly what you're
gonna look like when you're old.

64
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,549
-I love this.
-Don't encourage.

65
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,009
What do you mean?

66
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,178
Sounds so good!

67
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,222
Leila, save the rest for the talent show.

68
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,681
You come to the talent show.

69
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,142
I'm gonna be there.
I don't have a date, though.

70
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,894
Because I left her in Chicago.

71
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,230
Kinda why me and Chandra
called it quits,

72
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,190
'cause she didn't want kids. I'm like...

73
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,316
Yeah?

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,820
"I do. So, I'm leaving."
And then I left her. So, that's...

75
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,657
But, yeah, you know, I tried to tell her,

76
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,660
children are the future.

77
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,328
Look at that little artist we got here.

78
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,997
I'm done with my card, too.

79
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,420
Yeah, Merry Christmas.
Happy fucking Holidays.

80
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,505
Festive.

81
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,257
Yoga retreat? Is that what you said?

82
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,342
Yeah. It's a week-long yoga retreat.

83
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,011
-You're here for rehab, right?
-No, I'm not here for rehab!

84
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,514
-Let's be honest. Just call it what it is.
-I'm here for a yoga retreat!

85
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,100
Vodka? Vermouth? What's your poison?

86
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,102
It's just yoga. And I thought
it'd be nice to come up here

87
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,104
and stay with these guys
for a week 'cause I miss them.

88
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,147
-You guys ready?
-Your dad will get electrocuted.

89
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,357
-Wait for it.
-Okay, step back.

90
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,192
Wait for it.

91
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,318
-This is lovely.
-Leila, you gotta

92
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,112
tie it in a knot now,
tie it in a Christmas knot.

93
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,405
She's really got an eye.

94
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,699
I know I say this every year.

95
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,242
No, you don't.

96
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,369
We missed a couple...
We missed a couple years, right?

97
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,372
My grandmother gave it to my mom.

98
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,040
Your grandma.

99
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,543
And your grandma gave it to me.

100
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,919
And you will have it one day.

101
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,254
You got it?

102
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,340
Em, that angel is gorgeous.

103
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,550
Yeah!

104
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,094
That was awesome!
Give me a high five.

105
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,229
I love her so much.

106
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,273
Okay.

107
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,903
I think I'm done over here, buddy.

108
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,950
Yeah, yeah, it's... Well, it's not abstract.

109
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,244
I think it's Christmassy.

110
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,079
Looks great.
It'll look great in the front yard.

111
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,205
Yeah!

112
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,332
The neighbors will love it.

113
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,419
It's just two robust reindeer going at it.

114
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,380
-Two boys going at it.
-Hey, bud, no judgment.

115
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,631
Why don't you actually
do some real work?

116
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,091
-Go grab me a...
-You did a great job!

117
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,885
There's a string of lights
in that box over there.

118
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,929
This box? This is just caulk.

119
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,097
What?

120
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,516
It's caulk.

121
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,893
I think you got the wrong box.

122
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,937
What is that?

123
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,442
That must be from the people
who used to live here.

124
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,527
-There's tapes in here, too.
-What?

125
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,447
-There's tapes in here, too.
-Seriously?

126
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,955
It's working.

127
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,293
Nice.

128
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,381
This is creepy.

129
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,055
Too far.

130
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,308
Focused.

131
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,733
Ladies and gentleman,
award-winning cameraman...

132
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,152
It's so big!

133
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,738
-...from outer space...
-What is that?

134
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,490
Daddy!

135
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,076
How do you hold that? That is huge.

136
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,412
-It's so big!
-"It's so big!"

137
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,788
You look so funny.

138
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,832
-People carried that?
-Yeah.

139
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,084
This is cool. We own this.

140
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,460
Look at our box.

141
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,878
Yeah, it's cool.

142
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,505
This thing is like...

143
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,965
I don't know if it's out of focus or what,

144
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,426
but it's kinda like picking up
some trippy...

145
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,010
That thing is ancient.

146
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,303
Like these trails on the lights.

147
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:14,307
I'm seeing some sort of
odd shape in the middle of the room.

148
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,685
Some sort of blurry thing.

149
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,854
I think it's out of focus.

150
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,274
This thing is so wild.

151
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,359
-This is so weird.
-What?

152
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,445
I'm seeing something
in the middle of the room.

153
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,531
It's probably just old.

154
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,204
It's bizarre. It's like a...

155
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,877
It's so weird.

156
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,881
It sounded like I was underwater
when I walked into this thing.

157
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,050
What is that?

158
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,392
What is this camera picking up?

159
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,935
Hey, Mom. Got it.

160
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,147
She talked about it the entire way home.
She loved it.

161
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,739
Mike is going to flip over this.

162
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,574
All right, sweetie.

163
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,743
You forgot to check.

164
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,414
Bird is guarding the closet.
I'm gonna go in here.

165
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,249
Okay. Closet looks good.

166
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,918
Under the bed.

167
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,087
I don't see anything, except for you.

168
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,715
-I don't see a teepee.
-I don't see a teepee.

169
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,091
The teepee.

170
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,302
-There's no teepee in your room.
-You mean the pink tent?

171
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,262
We're all clear in here.

172
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,098
Wait. One last thing.
Will you hold this for a bit?

173
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,558
This thing is heavy!

174
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,143
Sleep tight. Sweet dreams.

175
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,770
I can't wait for Santa to come.

176
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,522
You can't? Well, you know what?

177
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,608
He gives extra presents
to little girls who go to sleep.

178
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,985
-Night, baby. Love you.
-Night, Mommy.

179
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,448
Where did it go?

180
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,451
Ryan? Are you coming to bed?

181
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,453
I can't see the thing anymore.
I think it's gone.

182
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,038
Well, that's awesome. You fixed it.

183
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,540
You can come to bed.
Play with that tomorrow.

184
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,333
No, I didn't fix anything.

185
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:07,295
We went upstairs, came back,
and now it's completely gone.

186
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,465
If you come to bed right now,
your wife is gonna have sex with you.

187
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,925
Sex?

188
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,137
That's right. I will have sex with you.

189
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,308
That was supposed to be seху.

190
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,977
It's okay! Stay in the mood!

191
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,815
This thing is absolutely sick.

192
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,483
It looks pretty sick.

193
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,277
-The thing is...
-You find anything?

194
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,528
...it's completely custom.

195
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,114
I mean, I've been to 15 websites.

196
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,824
Nothing looks like this camera.

197
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,994
Traditionally, it has three picture tubes.

198
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,289
-This one has six.
-Oh, my God.

199
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,624
It seems like this has
multiple focus rings.

200
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,501
Like, I see "Iris" and "Focus,"

201
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,211
-but this one right here?
-Yeah.

202
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,088
I have no idea what this does.

203
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,923
Why are you so into this?
It's just a camera.

204
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,633
I don't know. It's sitting in my house.

205
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,343
I've never seen any of this before.

206
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,679
I mean, this box?
I've never seen it before, Mike.

207
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,186
This guy.

208
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,023
I definitely picked something up.

209
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,482
That's trippy.

210
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,717
Okay. Can Mommy and Daddy come?

211
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,552
What is this...

212
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,059
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

213
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,855
Is this the same thing?

214
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,191
-Who were you talking to?
-My friend.

215
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,027
Your friend? Where's your friend?

216
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,576
Dad. I want to play hide-and-seek.

217
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,329
-Count to 10! Count to 10!
-Okay.

218
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:10,168
One, two, three...

219
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,673
Where'd it go?

220
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,341
Right. The girls are out tonight.

221
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,509
We got the house to ourselves.

222
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,885
Why don't we take the night off?

223
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,720
I got to get this game
out before Christmas break.

224
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,056
I was going through my bag.

225
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,141
Yeah? What'd you find?
Dirty underwear?

226
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,394
I found a souvenir from my Belgium trip.

227
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,980
This is fine Belgian chocolate
wrapped up in a piece of foil?

228
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,524
Trust me, it doesn't look like much.

229
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,858
It's been in your pocket for a week?

230
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,193
It's not about the presentation.

231
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,028
They put a lot of time
into the chocolate.

232
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,489
Ryan, seriously, I know why
you would expect that from me.

233
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,616
-And I appreciate it.
-I know you pretty well.

234
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,451
I've been living with you for a long time.

235
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,746
Fair enough.
I swear to God, it's not an edible.

236
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,926
He's talking to me.

237
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,930
Santa's the boss, man.
He's got a jolly attitude.

238
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,891
One night he only has to work,
and he's flying around in his sleigh

239
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,893
-with the magic reindeer.
-Mike, I just...

240
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,521
Sign me up, man.
I wish I could be like Santa.

241
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,357
Why do you still have
a VHS cassette player?

242
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,818
Did I ever tell you
that I stole Dad's old pornos.

243
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,823
And I was like, "I need a way
to watch these," so I got a VCR.

244
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,742
He had so many weird, European...

245
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,369
He has one where this guy
wraps his balls in leather.

246
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,620
Do you know about the Internet?

247
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,622
They all from '88 to '92?

248
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,167
I don't know.
Let's see what we got here.

249
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,754
Sit back.

250
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,505
That's not your house, man.
Where is this?

251
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,090
I don't know, dude.

252
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,176
-1988.
-1988.

253
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,927
There she is.

254
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,097
-There she is!
-This is gonna be so hot.

255
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,725
-What is this?
-What are we watching?

256
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,311
Oh, my God.

257
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,397
Those shoulders.

258
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,982
I'm a shoulder guy, apparently.

259
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,818
This is where it gets real good.

260
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,654
Don't cry. Don't cry.

261
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,449
Go back... Where'd your mom go?

262
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,784
Нi!

263
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,619
Bye!

264
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,331
This sucks.
Tell me when the lady comes back.

265
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,749
I'll put in another tape.

266
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,667
Yeah. Look for one marked "Shoulders."

267
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,419
Fellas, how's the game going?

268
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,505
Who's winning?

269
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,674
Why aren't you guys talking to me?

270
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,176
I'm one of you!

271
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,180
Ryan, I think this...

272
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,641
This is wild, man.

273
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,101
Hey, Mike! Next one's up and ready.

274
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,686
Give me some shoulder.

275
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,355
Check this out.

276
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,524
Yоu sure уоu're uр fоr this?

277
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,569
Oh, my God, this is perfect!

278
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
It's аn еаrthquаkе.

279
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,200
-Ноlу shit!
-Dеnnis, it's аn еаrthquаkе!

280
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,743
No, no, no!

281
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,703
What is this?

282
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,497
How about "Opening Doors"?

283
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,165
Did they just film everything?

284
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,000
This could be a porn.

285
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,252
-Okay.
-Think about it.

286
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,171
Fосus, Kristi.
Dоn't usе уоur еуеs tо sее.

287
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,090
-Usе whаt's insidе уоu.
-Okay.

288
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,344
This is a little different.
What, is he hypnotizing her?

289
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,429
Соnсentrаte, Kristi.

290
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,516
I nееd уоu tо соnсеntrаtе.

291
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,851
Concentrate on what, Kristi?

292
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,811
Yоu sее through him, Kristi.

293
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,021
Lеt him shоw уоu whаt hе sееs.

294
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,314
What the...

295
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,066
Lеt him tаkе уоu thеre.

296
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,237
Lеt him shоw уоu.

297
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,947
I hate this family.

298
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,782
There's а roоm.

299
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,701
Is this girl...

300
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,744
-Is she just taking minutes?
-Yeah.

301
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,954
For the meeting?

302
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,292
There's lоts оf соlоrs.

303
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm seeing colors, too, buddy.

304
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,007
There's butterflies.

305
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,260
Тhеre's а big bird оvеr thе dооr.

306
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,304
Whаt's sо funnу?

307
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,764
Тhere's а tent.

308
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,391
А tent?

309
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,726
What?

310
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,562
What? Ryan?

311
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,315
Likе thе оnе mе аnd Kаtiе саmр оut in.

312
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,280
It's right in thе littlе girl's roоm.

313
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,782
Why are you looking at me like that?

314
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,576
Whу wоuld it bе
in the middle of the roоm?

315
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,202
-Come on.
-What am I missing?

316
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,495
The tent in the middle of the room?

317
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,290
Butterflies? A bird above the door?

318
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,875
Does this sound like anything?

319
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,251
Boredom?

320
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,921
She just described Leila's room!

321
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,839
Oh, my God, man,
you're so fucking high!

322
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,257
Mike, she's describing Leila's room.

323
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,592
Did you eat more chocolate than I did?

324
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,636
Is he there, Kristi?

325
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,681
Ryan, come on, man, turn this off.
What are...

326
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,979
Is he in the roоm? Is he in the hоuse?

327
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,025
Dо уоu sее him?

328
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,152
Why is he making her do this?

329
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,862
Who's "him"?

330
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,619
Нe's there!

331
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,413
Did you trip a switch?

332
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,374
No, seriously, I didn't trip a switch.

333
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,210
What did we do, blow a fuse
firing up that old VCR?

334
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,671
Okay, they're back. That was strange.

335
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,130
Yeah.

336
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,300
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

337
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,343
Come with me.

338
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,427
Take your camera.
Go check it out yourself.

339
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,512
All right, fine. Here.

340
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,059
Concentrate. I want you to focus, Ryan.

341
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,477
Dude, shut up.

342
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,646
That's Ponytail.
Do you get what I'm doing?

343
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,648
Wait. Is that the same stuff
from the other night?

344
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,735
What's it doing?

345
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,532
Where did it go?

346
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,256
Mike?

347
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,093
Mike?

348
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,932
Mike, it's not funny. Is that you?

349
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,614
Holy shit.

350
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,043
Goal!

351
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,711
"Mike?"

352
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,547
-"Mike, is that you?" "Mike?"
-Oh, my God!

353
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,549
You scared the shit out of me.

354
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,595
Ryan, I think...

355
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,140
This is crazy.
I think my camera is starting to see...

356
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,184
I think I'm seeing something.

357
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,186
It's a...

358
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,354
It's a dipshit!

359
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,023
Do you see the dipshit, man?

360
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,985
There's, like, particles of
dipshit in your aura, man.

361
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,112
It's right around your...

362
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,323
You're the dipshit, Ryan.

363
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,575
-I'm calling you a dipshit.
-They're here!

364
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,993
Hey!

365
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,496
-Hey, babe!
-Oh, Jesus!

366
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,622
That's Uncle Mike.

367
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,957
That's not a very good...

368
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,584
-Hold on a second.
-Mustache.

369
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,835
A big pile of...

370
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,128
That's not a very good likeness.

371
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,880
So, what exactly do you do again?

372
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,924
It's kind of like feng shui.

373
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,133
I move the furniture around

374
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,136
so that, you know,
it's not blocking the energy.

375
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,680
Which I should probably
do with your house.

376
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,849
-Really? Why?
-Yeah.

377
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,434
It just feels a little different.

378
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,061
Is your energy blocked, Mike?

379
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,688
Mike's energy?

380
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,773
I'm flowing nicely.

381
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,692
If you want to relieve
some sort of blockage...

382
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,320
I don't know what we're
talking about anymore.

383
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,572
Tell her about
the night we had last night.

384
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,325
I've just kind of been

385
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,870
seeing and hearing
some strange things.

386
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,086
You know, I've heard of
spirit photography before,

387
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,380
but I've never actually seen it in person.

388
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,424
What kind of stuff
have you been seeing?

389
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,884
Just shapes.

390
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,719
It could be a spirit of some kind.

391
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,388
But most of the time, these cameras,

392
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,723
they don't pick up on
beings as much as,

393
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,809
different planes of existence.

394
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,061
Somewhere where
a lot of displaced energy

395
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,563
would travel to.

396
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,066
But, you know, sometimes
it's just a camera glitch.

397
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,484
I don't know.

398
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,361
It's weird,
but I don't think this is a glitch.

399
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,029
I saw it in Leila's room,

400
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,615
and then last night it was in the hall.

401
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,869
Guys, Leila's asleep.

402
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,079
We're taking off, okay?
Should be back around 11:00.

403
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,330
-Good night.
-Hey.

404
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,416
Be careful with that camera. Seriously.

405
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,625
Relax, Ryan.

406
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,043
I just want to see what this thing does.

407
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,588
Sky, you don't really think
that thing sees ghosts, right?

408
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,090
Yeah, I think it's totally possible.

409
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,425
What?

410
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,972
The lights look so cool with this thing.

411
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,557
You should see that on mushrooms.

412
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,350
Yeah, I'm gonna need some wine.

413
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,271
Okay.

414
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,440
-Red? White?
-Like, rosé.

415
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,609
Cabernet Sauvi...

416
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,611
I think there's...

417
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,166
Hello? Is somebody there?

418
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,592
-Hey.
-Jesus, you scared me.

419
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,095
It's just me. It's just me. I got the vinо.

420
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,763
I think something's here.

421
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,682
-What?
-I think I felt something.

422
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,016
Okay.

423
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,769
Yeah, I looked through the camera,
but didn't see anything.

424
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,104
That's a timer.

425
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,773
Hold on, I think there's
a night-vision thing.

426
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,817
There it is.

427
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,863
What?

428
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,701
Probably just the wind.

429
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,662
Do you see anything?

430
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,205
No.

431
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,717
Mike, what do you see?

432
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,176
Let's go back inside. Come on.

433
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,520
What the hell is that?

434
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,063
Fuck!
Something just flew out of the pool!

435
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,606
Mike, quiet. You're gonna scare it.

436
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,983
Fuck that! I'm gonna scare it?

437
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,693
Skyler.

438
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,740
Let me see the camera.

439
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,743
What is this?

440
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,789
Mike, there's something here.

441
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,253
This is so crazy.

442
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,097
Leila!

443
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,683
Leila, honey,

444
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,769
what are you doing out here, sweetie?
It's cold.

445
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,938
Let's go inside.

446
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,440
It's cold, sweetie.

447
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,108
Yeah, let's get you inside.

448
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,743
What the hell?

449
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,413
Fuck.

450
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,625
The stuff with the pool was weird.

451
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,543
But she was way more
scared of it than I was.

452
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,711
Yeah.

453
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,089
I mean, maybe we saw something,
but the camera's janky.

454
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,715
We were coming around the corner,

455
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,842
we turned and she was just
standing there.

456
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,803
Did you ask her why she was here?

457
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,388
She was like comatose.

458
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,847
I don't know if she heard us.

459
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,973
It was like she was sleepwalking.

460
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,392
I don't know what she was doing.

461
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,560
She's not a sleepwalker.
She sleeps real soundly.

462
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,645
Hey, guys, look at this.

463
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,689
There's a hole in there.

464
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,943
-Are these yours?
-God, yeah!

465
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,821
It's my rosary.

466
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,697
That's so weird.

467
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,409
Did you see her burying this stuff
out here last night?

468
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,161
No, I didn't see her, but it's possible.

469
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,750
What are you doing?

470
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,669
You know how Daddy's got a new toy.

471
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,380
Kind of like you have all these toys.

472
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,506
Yeah.

473
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,175
Well, Daddy's new toy

474
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,137
saw something very
interesting last night.

475
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,681
I just... I just...

476
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,688
You just... Did you feel something?

477
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,691
I don't want to talk about him.

478
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,819
Who's "him," babe?

479
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,201
Kristi, whаt аre уоu dоing?

480
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,370
What this button does...

481
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,372
Gо bасk tо bed. It's reаllу lаte.

482
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,424
"Spirit photography is something that..."

483
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,358
Hello?

484
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,378
Hello?

485
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,551
Hello?

486
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,600
I don't know. Maybe I'm going crazy.

487
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,662
Yram ydoolb.

488
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,331
Yram ydoolb.

489
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,833
Yram ydoolb.

490
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,501
Lee? What are you doing in here?

491
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,004
Yram ydoolb.

492
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,635
Lee? Honey, is that blood?

493
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,139
What's on your hand, sweetie?
You're bleeding.

494
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,182
What happened?

495
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,976
Honey, answer me. What happened?

496
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,144
You're bleeding.

497
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,036
Yrаm уdооlb.

498
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,872
Yrаm уdооlb.

499
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,208
What is she saying?

500
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,379
I don't know.

501
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,215
Вlооdу Маry.

502
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,718
Вlооdу Маry.

503
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,511
Did you hear that?

504
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,057
Is she talking backwards?
Is she saying, "Bloody Mary"?

505
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,475
What's Bloody Mary?

506
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,019
-It's a game kids play.
-What kind of game?

507
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,313
Originally in the game,
you say it three times

508
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,566
and a witch appears and shows you
who you're supposed to marry.

509
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,319
But when I used to play it,
the way most kids play it,

510
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,695
you say "Bloody Mary" three times

511
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,323
and a bloody witch appears
and grabs you by the neck.

512
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,908
How would Leila know about this game?

513
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,576
There's no way.

514
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,745
How old were you when you played it?

515
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,415
I don't know. I was young.
Maybe her friends showed her.

516
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,335
-Go, man.
-Mike, what?

517
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,295
Check it out. Check it out, man.

518
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,422
I cracked the case.
Right by the ferns, look.

519
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,632
They lived here?

520
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,760
They must've, right?
Why else would it be there? 1987?

521
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,845
So, this is the same house
where they filmed all that weird shit.

522
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,556
Whole place burned down in '92.

523
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,266
No bodies were recovered.

524
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,937
Says the whole family just
disappeared, including...

525
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,272
Including their daughters,
Katie and Kristi.

526
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,692
So, you think our daughter

527
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,278
is talking to a ghost?

528
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,739
Leila's been getting up at night
and playing with something

529
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,283
that only she and this camera can see.

530
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,451
Kids do weird things.

531
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,869
It doesn't mean the house is haunted.

532
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,579
The people who lived here
20 years ago,

533
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,207
they put up cameras
and caught all kinds of things.

534
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,292
And our house is built on top of theirs.

535
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,461
-Did Mike put you up to this?
-No. Look, look...

536
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,838
I feel like every time he comes over,

537
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,215
you guys find some crazy thing
that you wanna do.

538
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,092
No, honey, it's not like that at all.
I promise.

539
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,428
I just want to see if there
really is something here

540
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,555
or if I'm just crazy.

541
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,223
Look, I'll feel better either way.

542
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,142
-Fine. Do it.
-Yes? I can do it?

543
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,894
Yes, you can do it.
For a few days, Ryan.

544
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,315
All right, Mike.
That should just about do it.

545
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,817
Two cameras in here?

546
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,444
Yeah, well, this other one's a control

547
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,821
to see if this one's
picking up something special.

548
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,323
And we'll put the other one on the desk.

549
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,242
So we can watch
your daughter sleep all night.

550
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,618
Nothing weird about that.

551
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,423
Okay.

552
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,432
Okay.

553
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,729
Where?

554
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,234
Hey, sweetie,
what are you doing awake?

555
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,112
It's cold in here.

556
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,781
Get back under the covers.

557
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,620
Let's get you tucked back in.
There you go.

558
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,289
Just go back to sleep, okay?

559
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,830
What was that?

560
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,499
It was nothing. Okay, okay.

561
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,711
Okay, sweetie.

562
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,005
Why don't you lay down
and get some sleep?

563
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,508
Just get some sleep.

564
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:23,982
Hey, Lee.

565
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,444
I saw something in your room last night
with you and Auntie Skyler.

566
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,489
Honey?

567
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,866
What woke you up last night?

568
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,535
Tobi did it.

569
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,496
Tobi did it?

570
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,207
Who's Tobi?

571
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,543
Leila, who's Tobi?

572
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,171
Leila?

573
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,136
It was this big, dark shape
and it was just floating around.

574
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,222
And she called it Tobi.

575
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,140
She's not scared of it at all.

576
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,184
And I know you think
I'm losing my mind here,

577
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,644
but I think it's our ghost.

578
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,771
Emily thinks I'm nuts,
but remember I told you

579
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,691
Leila said her friend Tobi
woke her up last night, right?

580
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,818
-Yeah.
-Okay. Check this out.

581
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,027
This tape is from 1988.

582
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,113
Dоn't sit thеre. Тhаt's Тоbi's sроt.

583
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,157
Sоrry. Is Тоbi sitting there right nоw?

584
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,575
They're talking about Tobi.

585
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,910
Sоrry, Тоbi.

586
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,036
Coincidence.

587
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,956
Four years later, these girls
have grown up a little bit,

588
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,749
and we have Ponytail.

589
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,752
Тоbi's а vеry imроrtаnt раrt оf уоur lifе.

590
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,546
Right?

591
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,047
Оkау.

592
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,552
So, they stayed in touch with Tobes.
That was nice.

593
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,886
No. Mike...

594
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,680
Dude, this is before Facebook.

595
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,098
It was hard to stay in touch with people.

596
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,725
You think it's a guy or girl?

597
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,351
Tobi would be a cool stripper name.

598
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,519
Yeah.

599
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,354
"Coming down to the main stage,

600
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,107
"please welcome Tobi."

601
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,192
I'm telling you, the camera's not busted.

602
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,361
-It's a piece of shit, dude.
-It's seeing something that's there.

603
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,322
And besides,
Tobi is not a common name.

604
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,824
She probably watched the tape.

605
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,743
Mike, she's three feet tall.

606
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,287
She has no idea even what a VCR is.

607
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,248
She couldn't reach up there,
put it in and hit "play."

608
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,875
And get the right tape.

609
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,170
That makes me feel old.
Kids don't know what VCRs are?

610
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,674
What was that?

611
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,303
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

612
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,804
-You did?
-Yeah, man.

613
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,097
Are you seeing anything?

614
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,390
Holy shit.

615
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,641
What, are you picking something up?

616
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,310
-Dude.
-What?

617
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,938
I think it's the icemaker in the freezer!

618
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,274
Does Tobi like ice?

619
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,568
I think we should let him
out of the freezer, man.

620
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,403
Probably why he's so ticked all the time.

621
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,989
There's too much of a coincidence.
That's all I'm saying.

622
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,200
Mike. Keep it down, man.

623
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,326
Everyone's sleeping.

624
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,495
The sound came from out there, dude!

625
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,290
Okay, give me the camera.
Give me the camera.

626
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,091
Mike, something's up there.

627
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,634
It's different, though.

628
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,308
It's moving. Mike, it's moving.

629
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,687
Ryan, let's go. We're gonna wake Leila.

630
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,523
I just want to see where it went.

631
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,210
Do you see anything?

632
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,174
-No.
-I'm not picking anything up.

633
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,892
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

634
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,769
Jesus.

635
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,021
What the hell, man?

636
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,357
Daddy, what are you doing?

637
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,901
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. It's okay.

638
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,862
Everything's okay, okay?
Just go back to sleep.

639
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,031
I screamed because you screamed.

640
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,324
You screamed so loud.

641
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,786
You shouted near your sleeping
daughter's face, so I screamed.

642
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,954
I couldn't see anything.

643
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,664
-Know why I screamed?
-Why?

644
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,875
Because I saw this through the camera.

645
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,626
This seems more concentrated.

646
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,920
It's got more form. It's darker.

647
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,382
And, dude, I fucking
felt that thing fly past me.

648
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,843
That looks like a face.
I mean, it's not human.

649
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,595
But that's crazy, Mike.

650
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,471
Why do you still need
two cameras in here?

651
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,640
I just don't think one camera
can cover the whole room.

652
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,018
It's talking to her
and telling her to do things,

653
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,603
and it's not just in her room.

654
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,272
It's moving all around the house.

655
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,777
I just want to know where
it's going and what it wants.

656
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,196
That's better.

657
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,992
Take me away. Take me away.

658
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,750
Lee! Put those down!

659
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,919
Put those down. Right now.
What are you doing?

660
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,089
Did you turn the gas on?

661
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,841
Leila, you cannot play with matches.

662
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,634
You can't turn the gas on.

663
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,094
What are you doing?

664
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,013
Get back in bed. Okay.

665
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,102
Don't play with matches.
It's the middle of the night.

666
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,729
Ry? Ryan? Ryan.

667
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,362
That Bible is my Bible from upstairs.

668
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,197
It was in the fireplace.

669
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,451
That's what she was trying to burn.

670
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:59,122
The rosary that she tried to bury,
it was also in the fireplace.

671
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,915
She said she was playing a game.

672
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,127
What kind of game can you play
with matches?

673
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,465
She said she was
playing a game with Tobi.

674
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,467
She just knew
you had the book up there.

675
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,469
She probably doesn't know what it is.

676
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,596
I don't know. I put her back to bed

677
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,223
and then I come down here,
and then the angel falls.

678
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,728
I don't know, it just...
It doesn't seem like her.

679
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,398
It seems like she's different.

680
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,650
I didn't want to believe it,
but I think Ryan's right.

681
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,402
There is something in our house.

682
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,905
Lee, I need you to tell me

683
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,574
that you're gonna stop talking to Tobi.

684
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,162
Lee?

685
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,914
Lee, look at your mother.

686
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,248
Can you look at me, please?

687
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,167
Tobi is my friend.

688
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,921
-Lee, he's not your friend.
-He is not... No.

689
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,424
Okay? And Mommy and Daddy
don't want you talking to him anymore.

690
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,010
Lee, promise us you're
gonna stop talking to Tobi.

691
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,763
I promise.

692
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,264
Good.

693
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,394
So, the tapes start in '88.

694
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,813
Lots of Katie and Kristi stuff.

695
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,023
And they're living with their mom.

696
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,358
-Shoulders!
-Right.

697
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,360
-Whу dоеs hе nееd а bоwl?
-Нe wаnts tо eаt.

698
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,362
I haven't gone through all the tapes.

699
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,113
But the footage suddenly jumps

700
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,698
and everything is real different.

701
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,700
-There's nothing in between?
-No.

702
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,369
The mom and her boyfriend?

703
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,871
They're completely
absent in the footage.

704
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,374
Like, nowhere?

705
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,042
Not on any of the tapes.

706
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,045
And this weird cult is taking
care of these girls now.

707
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,047
And they're calling
this other woman Mom.

708
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,549
Is that a milk bath?

709
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,467
I hаd оne mоre dreаm.

710
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,302
Who are these people? Jesus.

711
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,222
It's just thаt I hаd аnоthеr mоmmу.

712
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,226
Аnd then she fell down
sоme sоrt of stаirs.

713
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,978
Тоbi sаid уоu're оn уоur wау, swееtiе.

714
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,563
Yоu're рrogressing niсеlу.

715
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,897
What does all this mean?

716
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,650
I don't know. But this guy is their leader

717
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,570
and it's like he's preparing
the girls for something.

718
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,238
Yоu'll mаkе us sо рroud.

719
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,490
Не nееds hеr. Wе're gеtting сlоsе.

720
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,188
-Still watching tapes?
-Yeah.

721
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,024
I just wanna see if there's a connection.

722
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,192
Didn't we watch this the other night?

723
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,360
No, it's a different night.

724
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,696
But she's doing the same thing.

725
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,866
They literally do this every night.
It's like a ritual.

726
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,075
It's not a normal home video.

727
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,077
It's like some sort of training tape.

728
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,704
Is hе shоwing уоu?

729
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,706
I'm not sure.

730
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,791
It's tоо blurry.

731
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,710
Just lеt him shоw уоu whаt hе sееs.

732
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,878
Lеt him guidе уоu.

733
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,048
I think I see fооd.

734
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,885
Yеаh, I'm рrettу sure it's fооd.

735
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,640
It's just sо mеssу аnd blurry.

736
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,601
I see

737
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,979
а ТV.

738
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,981
What?

739
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,362
I see а lot of ТVs.

740
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,073
What the...

741
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,617
I think she's seeing this.

742
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,369
How is that possible?

743
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,454
I sее tоуs.

744
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,539
Dude.

745
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,459
I sее bunсhеs оf tоуs.

746
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,256
I sее реорlе.

747
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,133
Вrothers.

748
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,802
Fuck.

749
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:44,472
I'm рrettу sure. I think thеу're brothеrs.

750
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,976
Whoa, dude. What the fuck?

751
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,521
I think thеу're wаtсhing mе.

752
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,772
They're talking about us.

753
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,649
Stау with him. Оnlу he саn dо this.

754
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,817
Some bizarre shit.

755
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,443
Оnlу he саn be there.

756
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,658
Daddy! I can't sleep.

757
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,285
What are you doing awake?

758
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,496
What's going on? Tell me.

759
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,708
-You're making so much noise.
-I'm making too much noise?

760
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,501
Daddy'll go up and make
sure everything...

761
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,044
-Bless you.
-Вlеss уоu.

762
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,421
-Okay.
-What the...

763
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,965
Wait, Ry, did you...

764
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,967
What the...

765
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,763
So, this is the tape I was telling you
about from last night. Check it out.

766
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,724
Yоu hеаr nоisеs in уоur roоm?

767
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,142
Dаddу'll gо uр
аnd mаkе sure еvеrything's...

768
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,144
Вlеss уоu.

769
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,312
-Wait. Play that again.
-So, here, I blew it up.

770
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,774
Look. Leila sneezes,
and then Kristi says, "Bless you."

771
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,901
Dаddу'll gо uр
аnd mаkе sure еvеrything's...

772
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,903
Вlеss уоu.

773
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,197
These people,
I think they're watching us.

774
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,199
And I know these tapes
are from 20 years ago.

775
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,745
But they can see what's happening here
with us and with Leila.

776
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,839
There's a door?

777
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,008
Really?

778
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,178
Where does it go?

779
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,765
And I can go there?

780
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,518
All I have to do is draw it?

781
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,979
Okay.

782
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,082
Oh, my God.

783
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,543
What is all this?

784
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,712
I don't think these are just scribbles.

785
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,089
I think there's a pattern to these.

786
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,716
Some of these look familiar.

787
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,469
I know I've seen this stuff before.

788
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,971
Those symbols on Leila's wall?

789
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,516
They're on the tapes too,
in the girls' room.

790
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,975
That symbol there?

791
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,769
It's used by a coven
called the Midwives.

792
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,604
You mean like witches?

793
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,482
These Midwives go all the way
back to the Middle Ages.

794
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,651
-Oh, my God.
-They were into devil worship.

795
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,902
They would use symbols like this

796
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,822
to open these doorways
to different places and times.

797
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,158
-What is that?
-I don't know.

798
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,662
Sounds like it's in Leila's room.

799
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,623
What is that?

800
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:18,960
I don't know.

801
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,928
What is that?

802
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,766
Em, there's something coming
from that recorder.

803
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,309
Be careful.

804
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,814
Honey, what are you doing?

805
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,441
Baby, what? What are you doing?

806
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,318
Honey. Honey.

807
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,279
Lee!

808
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,697
-What the fuck?
-Baby.

809
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,491
Lee, are you okay? Honey.

810
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,369
Baby, baby, breathe. Breathe, baby.

811
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,122
Calm down. Okay, good girl.

812
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,500
Breathe. Good girl.

813
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,966
What were you doing?

814
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,385
He's gonna take me away.

815
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,638
Who's gonna take you away?

816
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,558
Who's gonna take you away?

817
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,731
Who's gonna take you away?

818
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,611
What the fuck?

819
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,827
What is that?

820
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,162
I don't know. I don't see anything.

821
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,805
There's nothing fucking there.

822
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,099
Fuck!

823
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,019
Get Leila! Let's go! Get out of here!

824
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,604
Oh, my... What was that?

825
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,688
Fuck!

826
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,112
Hi, please.
Can I talk to Father Michael, please?

827
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,782
Our house has been...
We think it's like haunted

828
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,450
or something and something's
affecting our daughter...

829
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:21,165
I was on hold, but I'm looking to speak
with Father Alessio? Right.

830
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,125
I'll just call him back at 4:00. Thank you.

831
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,169
She's been acting strange.

832
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,837
And things have just been
starting to happen

833
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,965
more and more and we really
don't know what to do.

834
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,097
Baby Jesus.

835
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,682
Here's Mary.

836
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,062
She's going to have a special baby.

837
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,314
That's right. She is.

838
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,316
Do you remember us coming
into your room last night

839
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,276
when you were on your recorder?

840
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:57,827
Well, when we came in there

841
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,621
and put you back to bed,

842
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,083
you said, "He's gonna take me away."

843
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,755
Who's gonna take you away?

844
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,425
Do you mean Tobi?

845
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,552
Would you please answer me?

846
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,182
Lee, please answer me.

847
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,476
Lee? Answer your mom.

848
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,693
Lee.

849
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,195
Where is he gonna take you?

850
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,283
To be with the others.

851
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,205
Hi. This is my wife, Emily.

852
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,331
Hi. How are you?

853
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,917
We're so grateful that you're here.
Thank you so much.

854
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,170
I just hope I can be of help to you guys.

855
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,964
I think you can.
We'll explain everything to you.

856
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,967
This camera picks up stuff
that none of our other cameras can see.

857
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,927
It's wild.

858
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,804
And you're sure nothing
unusual was happening

859
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,222
in the house
before you started to use it?

860
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,348
No.

861
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:05,102
I've seen this camera on these
tapes from 20 years ago.

862
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,939
It's like they were using
the camera to see this stuff, too.

863
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,649
Father, watch this.

864
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,735
It started out small. Right?

865
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,445
I thought it was just a glitch.

866
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,739
You said it's getting darker
when you see it through the camera?

867
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,240
And bigger, like it's growing.

868
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,785
Look at this dark figure
that moves through the door.

869
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:25,581
Either of you ever experienced anything
like this before, here or any other place?

870
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:26,749
Nothing like this.

871
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,085
I found this tape
of these girls playing Bloody Mary,

872
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,046
the same game Leila
was playing the other night.

873
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,298
What if she learned this from them?

874
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,885
They would tape themselves
doing these weird rituals.

875
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,595
Yоu're dоing sо wеll.

876
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,305
Тоbi is gоing tо bе sо рroud оf уоu.

877
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,390
You think this is
the Tobi that Leila speaks of?

878
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,809
Yeah. We think so.

879
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,103
Has she used any other name
besides Tobi?

880
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,480
No. Just Tobi.

881
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,233
Why?

882
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,945
Sometimes spirits will tend to
hide their own identities,

883
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,447
their true nature.
They'll use another name.

884
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,283
From what you describe,
from what I know,

885
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,244
which is very little,

886
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,206
it sounds as if your daughter

887
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,834
may be being stalked

888
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,545
by a demon or a demonic presence.

889
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,921
If this is happening, we should go.

890
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,714
We should get out now.

891
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,967
We need to leave the house!

892
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,510
I never noticed anything before.

893
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,138
Demons do not haunt houses,
they haunt people.

894
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,723
If you leave this house,
it will definitely follow you.

895
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,559
Demons feed on fear.

896
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,894
The more attention you give,

897
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,605
the stronger it grows,
the bigger it grows.

898
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,649
-You run away, it follows.
-You can't just ignore

899
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,234
what's happening in the house, Father.

900
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,444
Would it be all right
if I spoke with your daughter?

901
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,321
-Would that be okay?
-Yeah.

902
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,907
We have a guest here.

903
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:52,459
He's our friend. He's a really nice man.

904
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:53,878
Stop.

905
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,087
She's a little shy.

906
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,674
Does that name mean anything to you?

907
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,509
No. Why? Should it?

908
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,263
I want you to meet somebody.

909
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,766
Here she comes.

910
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:13,439
Is this your friend?
Does your friend have a name?

911
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,483
Don't tell me. Let me see.

912
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,444
Griselda?

913
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,945
Tell him his name.

914
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,448
Is it Geraldine?

915
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,575
It's Bubba, isn't that right, baby?

916
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,327
I like the name Bubba.

917
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,371
That's a great name.

918
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,457
Bubba looks really hot.

919
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,418
Can I give Bubba a little bath?

920
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,212
Can I put some water on him?

921
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,757
Let me just give Bubba a little water.

922
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,719
Bubba likes it. He's very happy.

923
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,680
Can I give you a little water
on your head?

924
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,766
Make you feel cool?

925
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,392
How about that?

926
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,646
Much better, huh?

927
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,983
You feel better now?

928
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,906
Yeah.

929
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:08,202
So, what are you and Bubba
gonna do today?

930
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,164
You have a secret for me?

931
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,171
What is it, honey?

932
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,927
Oh, my God!

933
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,097
I'm so sorry. This is nothing like her.

934
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,265
It's fine. I'm all right.

935
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,766
Look. I just want you
to take care of your daughter.

936
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,892
-Okay?
-Okay.

937
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,436
I'll be back soon.
Stay calm, stay relaxed.

938
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,690
She fucking bit a priest.

939
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,819
After what Father Todd said, I went back
and did more research.

940
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,404
I found this tape in the camera.

941
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,488
I thought it was blank. But look.

942
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,739
Wait! That's your house.

943
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,534
Look at the date.
It's three days before we moved in.

944
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,952
...vеry hарру with this hоusе.

945
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,412
It's а gооd hоusе fоr him.

946
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:54,123
You hear that?
I think it's that leader guy talking.

947
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,207
I don't know, man.

948
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,667
Maybe it's just a contractor
or something.

949
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,336
Тhis is а gооd sрасе.
Тhеу'vе dоnе а wоndеrful jоb.

950
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,463
See, Ryan, he's just talking
about the house, that's all it is.

951
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,798
Vеry gооd еntry роint in hеre.

952
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,383
No. He said "entry point."

953
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,969
The fact that we moved
into this specific house

954
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,721
of all the houses we looked at...

955
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,806
It just doesn't seem like
a coincidence to me.

956
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:16,228
No, no, not Higgins.
Hubbard. H-U-B-B...

957
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,523
Right, Hubbard. Katie Hubbard.
That's what I've been...

958
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,649
That's impossible.

959
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:24,194
Because I'm looking at her card
and your number is on her card.

960
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,155
They're saying
they've never heard of her.

961
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,990
She never worked for them.

962
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,660
We weren't even looking in
this neighborhood, remember?

963
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,079
And we thought the deal
was too good to be true.

964
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,332
-Yeah.
-Remember that?

965
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,667
Where did she come from?
How did you meet her?

966
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,127
I called the agency today.

967
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,671
They have no record
that she ever worked there.

968
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,173
Nobody had ever heard of her.

969
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,884
What? But that's...

970
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,927
What if, like...

971
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:53,515
What if someone
placed us here on purpose?

972
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,144
If somebody conspired for us
to be in this house?

973
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,065
Do you think that could be possible?

974
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,150
Where did she come from?

975
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,028
-Sure you want to do this?
-Yeah.

976
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,571
You need some sleep, sweetie.

977
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,323
Wake me up if
anything happens. Okay?

978
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,035
All right. I left a message
with Father Todd.

979
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,745
Hopefully he calls us back.

980
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,509
What the fuck?

981
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,652
-Emily, wake up.
-What?

982
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,321
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

983
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,073
Something knocked the camera
over in the hallway.

984
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,700
-You didn't hear anything?
-No.

985
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,216
Hey, sweetie.

986
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,302
Sweetie, sorry. Go back to bed.

987
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,972
Sweetie, go back to sleep now,
all right?

988
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,893
Don't be scared, Mommy.

989
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,826
Stay here.

990
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,914
Ryan, what's going on up there, man?

991
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,667
-What was that noise?
-I'm not sure.

992
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,004
What do you see?

993
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,594
There's nothing here.

994
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,692
Mike.

995
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,111
I think I see something.

996
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,446
What?

997
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,491
-You see something?
-Don't move.

998
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,955
-Do you see...
-Stay still.

999
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,957
Is something here? Is something here?

1000
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,751
Mike, stay calm.
You heard what Father Todd said.

1001
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,878
Just don't move.

1002
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,882
Oh, fuck. Holy fuck.

1003
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,344
Mike, run, run!

1004
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,307
Something...
I felt something on my neck!

1005
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,517
I felt something!

1006
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,352
It was fucking huge, Mike.

1007
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:28,021
Holy fuck. I don't know where he went.

1008
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,690
Fuck!

1009
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,404
-What was that?
-Shit. What the fuck, dude?

1010
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,076
Wait, wait, wait. I see it.

1011
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,452
It's over by the tree.

1012
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,246
-What the fuck?
-I don't know.

1013
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,747
Dude!

1014
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,749
Oh, my God.

1015
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,461
Ryan, where is it? Do you see it?

1016
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,089
Emily, stay upstairs! Lock the door!

1017
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,508
In the kitchen!

1018
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,553
Shit! Fuck! What do you see?

1019
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,139
Fuck me, Ryan!

1020
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,515
Next time I'm just gonna stay at Mom's!

1021
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,353
God!

1022
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,980
-You all right?
-No!

1023
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,440
It fucking touched me, dude!

1024
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,525
Did you see the keyboard move, dude?

1025
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,943
What the fuck?

1026
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,862
I don't see anything.

1027
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,196
What the fuck?

1028
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,282
-What the fuck's going on?
-I don't know.

1029
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,340
Fuck, it's getting closer.

1030
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,633
It's in the doorway.

1031
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,885
-Where is it? What?
-The doorway to the kitchen.

1032
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:51,063
He came through the door!
He's in the room with us.

1033
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,067
What the fuck?

1034
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,911
Hey! Fuck, go!

1035
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,412
Jesus Christ!

1036
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,790
Go, Mike, go, go, go!

1037
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,917
Fuck! What the fuck? Shit!

1038
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,335
I don't see anything.

1039
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,588
What the fuck, man?
What the fuck was that?

1040
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:18,215
What the fuck
is wrong with your house?

1041
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:29,685
Skyler will be home soon.

1042
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,436
Mike and I will be as
quick as possible. All right?

1043
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,896
-Okay.
-Just stay with Leila.

1044
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:36,483
I love you. We'll be back
as soon as we can, all right?

1045
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,576
Would you like some tea?

1046
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,171
Hey.

1047
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,799
Let's go downstairs and play.

1048
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:04,803
Lee, come on. We have games
that we can play downstairs.

1049
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,139
No, I'm fine here.

1050
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,727
How about me and you
get out of the house?

1051
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,395
Come on, we can go outside.

1052
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,689
We can go on the seesaw,
your favorite thing.

1053
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,609
This is where I want to be now.

1054
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,194
Let's go downstairs.

1055
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,322
We can play down there.
It's just you and me, okay?

1056
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,993
I said I'm fine.

1057
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,252
I don't really want to be in this room,
so let's go downstairs.

1058
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,757
Mommy, I said I'm fine here.

1059
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,843
That's enough!
We're going downstairs right now.

1060
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,979
I'm fine here.

1061
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,693
-What are you looking for?
-I know I saw it somewhere.

1062
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,612
Just a tape, Mike. Just a tape.

1063
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:06,114
Skyler, how's Em? She need anything?

1064
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,450
She's in her room with Leila.
They're resting.

1065
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:09,826
What are you guys doing?

1066
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:11,578
I found this down at the police station.

1067
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:15,165
Leila and Hunter
have the same birthday?

1068
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:16,708
That has to be a coincidence.

1069
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,710
Yeah. One hell of a coincidence, right?

1070
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,629
June 6th, 2005.

1071
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,840
Kristi's son is born on
the exact same day as Leila.

1072
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,510
-They haven't found him yet?
-No. Katie is his aunt.

1073
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,553
She killed Kristi and the dad.

1074
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,472
They even think she killed
this family in Nevada.

1075
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,265
Cops have been looking for her
for years.

1076
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,391
Wait. Here it is.

1077
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,853
Look, there he is.
There he is, right there.

1078
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,189
I knew I'd seen this kid before.

1079
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,483
Look. Look.

1080
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,402
Tell me that's not him.

1081
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,656
This tape is from 1992, Skyler.

1082
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:49,908
So, the kid wasn't even born yet.

1083
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,160
-How did he get there?
-I can't explain it.

1084
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,329
He and Leila have
the exact same birthday.

1085
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:57,249
What if this is where
Tobi's gonna take Leila?

1086
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,586
I'm putting this camera
back in her room.

1087
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,840
We need to keep an eye on her.

1088
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:08,218
Look, Father Todd said
he would come back and help.

1089
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,511
We just need to stay calm.

1090
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,264
Come get some rest.

1091
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,103
Leila, come play with me.

1092
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,899
-Leila? Leila!
-Where is she?

1093
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,651
-Leila!
-Leila!

1094
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:30,902
Leila!

1095
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,529
Lee!

1096
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,614
Leila!

1097
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,535
-What's going on?
-We can't find Leila!

1098
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:39,619
What?

1099
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:44,207
I don't know where she went! Leila!

1100
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,044
-Leila!
-Leila!

1101
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,883
Ry! That was Leila's room!

1102
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,635
-Leila!
-Leila!

1103
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,764
-Lee? Baby.
-Leila!

1104
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:00,932
Leila!

1105
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,393
My baby, where were you, honey?

1106
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,687
Hey, sweetie. Hey.

1107
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,188
Where were you, baby?
Where were you?

1108
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:11,276
Cold. Talk to me.
Talk to Daddy. Are you okay?

1109
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,194
I'm going to set him free, Daddy.

1110
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,696
Let's go! We're leaving right now!

1111
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,114
No! I'm not going.

1112
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,659
Honey, stop it! We love you.
Stop screaming.

1113
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,329
I'm not going! I'm not going!

1114
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,963
Hello?

1115
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,301
Do you see anything?

1116
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,138
Clear.

1117
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,312
Let's make this quick.

1118
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,647
In here somewhere.

1119
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,109
Do you see anything?

1120
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,528
No, I'm not picking anything up.

1121
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,409
I'm not crazy, right?
It feels different in here.

1122
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,286
It doesn't feel as bad.

1123
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,790
Yeah, it does. It's like a different place.

1124
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,875
Should we call them at the hotel?

1125
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:13,088
No, let's let them sleep.
I bet they're exhausted.

1126
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,924
Em said make sure
to grab a jacket for Leila.

1127
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:17,217
Okay.

1128
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,178
Do you see anything?

1129
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,514
No.

1130
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,266
Wait. What's that?

1131
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,684
Did that happen last night?

1132
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,478
I don't remember seeing it before.

1133
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,689
I'm not seeing anything.

1134
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,527
You okay?

1135
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:38,279
-What is that?
-Don't know. Just found them.

1136
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,366
Okay, let's...

1137
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,576
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1138
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,162
-Ready to go?
-Just a sec.

1139
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,873
Come on. We should get back.
It's getting dark.

1140
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,334
Look at all this stuff.
Ryan's been going crazy.

1141
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:53,294
This is the research he was
talking about at the hotel.

1142
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,130
Look at this.

1143
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,800
Holy shit. That's like Leila's drawing.

1144
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,845
It looks like it. "Revelations 5:6."

1145
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,763
"The slain lamb
will be used against God,

1146
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,723
"for the blood of
the chosen ones will taint it

1147
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,017
"and help give life to one
of the seven princes of hell.

1148
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,602
"Each prince shall return
through the blood

1149
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,437
"of the two born of the same moon."

1150
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,858
That's Leila and Hunter. It's their blood.

1151
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,485
What if the witches are using
them in some kind of ritual

1152
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,612
to give Tobi a human body?

1153
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,614
What? Skyler, what does this mean?

1154
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,449
What was that?

1155
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,580
What is that? Is that the door?

1156
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,516
-What was that?
-The front door's open.

1157
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,768
-Did you lock it?
-Yes.

1158
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,312
Hello?

1159
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,315
Em? Ry?

1160
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,858
-Hello?
-Skyler...

1161
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,568
I'm just checking.

1162
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,613
Hello?

1163
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:26,888
What was that?

1164
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:30,850
It was Leila's room.

1165
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,564
Didn't we leave that door open?

1166
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,483
I don't remember.

1167
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,084
Leila? Leila?

1168
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:58,002
-What are you doing?
-What...

1169
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,506
You've got to stop, sweetie. Leila, stop.

1170
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:05,760
Leila. No, no, no, stop, sweetie.

1171
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:09,264
Answer me. Leila,
where's your mom and dad?

1172
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,723
Where's your mom and dad?

1173
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:14,435
Leila!

1174
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,729
I am the bringer of he.

1175
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,106
What?

1176
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:20,692
Who's "he"?

1177
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:25,154
Leila, no, honey. Leila, stop.
Stop. Leila, stop.

1178
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,324
Do you mind
if I touch your hands, honey?

1179
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:35,456
She just showed up here?

1180
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,668
Yeah. We were at a hotel,
six miles away.

1181
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,086
We went to sleep for two minutes.

1182
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,505
-I have no idea how she got here.
-She was gone.

1183
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:49,554
Can we have a chat in the kitchen?

1184
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:52,515
Yeah. Hey, Sky, could you take her?

1185
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,980
I've spoken to someone
outside the Church.

1186
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:01,566
There's only one way
to save your daughter.

1187
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,987
But I have serious reservations
about what they proposed.

1188
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,073
Father, you are the only one
who believes us.

1189
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,950
-You have to help us.
-We have to do something.

1190
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:14,078
If we don't, we'll end up like
Hunter Rey and his family.

1191
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,831
An exorcism is a remedy
for someone who's possessed.

1192
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:19,250
I do not think that's what's
happening right here.

1193
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,629
-What do we need?
-What's happening?

1194
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,382
We need an extermination.

1195
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,220
Emily, do you have them?

1196
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:33,556
We need to soak
those sheets in holy water.

1197
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,933
It'll subdue the demon
and protect us against him.

1198
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,772
Ryan, your daughter was born
on June 6th,

1199
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,732
2005. Right?

1200
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:45,068
It's the sixth day of the sixth month

1201
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:48,154
of the sixth year, 2005. 666.

1202
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,198
I believe this is no coincidence.

1203
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,033
She's part of the prophecy.

1204
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,202
The witches on those tapes,
the Midwives?

1205
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,371
I think theirjob is to give demons life,

1206
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,997
to allow them to walk the Earth.

1207
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,041
They targeted your daughter
to help them do so.

1208
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,209
You understand how serious this is?

1209
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:02,293
Yeah.

1210
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:06,005
So, we need to trap this thing
using your daughter as bait.

1211
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,383
Downstairs,
we'll draw the Key of Solomon.

1212
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,343
Once the demon is Iured
inside the trap, we're gonna

1213
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:12,678
cover it with sheets
and burn it back to hell.

1214
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,973
The blessing of the Father Almighty
be upon this Creature of Salt

1215
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,558
and let all malignity and hindrance

1216
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,812
be cast forth hence
and let all good enter.

1217
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,688
In the name of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

1218
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,440
I'll go check on Leila.

1219
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:28,111
The blessing of the Father Almighty
be upon this Creature of Salt...

1220
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,289
That's good. Skyler,
make sure the line is straight. Okay?

1221
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:42,458
Complete the Key
and make sure it's straight.

1222
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,043
How's Leila? She okay?

1223
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,253
She's doing okay. Emily's with her.

1224
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,921
That's perfect. Can you help? Please.

1225
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:50,299
Sheets and holy water.
Bring it over. Thank you.

1226
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,718
I'll try to lure the demon out
into the circle.

1227
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,178
We're gonna trap that thing.

1228
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,430
Scatter salt around the perimeter.

1229
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,556
All around the perimeter.

1230
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,267
St. Michael the Archangel,
defend us in battle.

1231
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:00,977
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray,

1232
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:03,271
and do thou as the Prince...

1233
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,565
-Tobi?
-I think so.

1234
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:08,651
Keep doing what you're doing.
We need to keep provoking him.

1235
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:10,445
Be our protection
against the wickedness

1236
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,572
and snares of the devil.

1237
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,074
Father, something's happening!

1238
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,368
St. Michael, the Archangel,
defend us in battle.

1239
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,082
Why is everything shaking?
What's happening?

1240
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,460
...and do thou, O Prince
of the heavenly host...

1241
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,004
Keep calm, everyone.

1242
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:29,255
By the power of God,

1243
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:32,508
cast into hell Satan
and all the evil spirits.

1244
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,427
Body of Christ... Cast into hell Satan

1245
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,679
and all the evil spirits.

1246
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,973
Water flowing from the side of Christ,

1247
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:40,683
wash me clean.

1248
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:49,650
Oh, my God! What is going on?

1249
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:52,528
Emily, go get Leila. It's time. It's time!

1250
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,155
-Get in the circle.
-Get in the circle.

1251
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,740
Everybody, get in the circle.

1252
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:56,908
Come with me.

1253
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:59,118
Everybody in the circle. Now!

1254
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,248
Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1255
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,959
Blessed art thou amongst women...

1256
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,961
Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1257
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,338
Blessed art thou among women

1258
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,423
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb. Jesus.

1259
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:13,966
Father, what happened to her eyes?

1260
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:15,885
-Why are they black?
-Leila!

1261
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:17,678
Leila! What's happening to her?

1262
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,263
He knows what you're doing.

1263
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,060
-Oh, my God!
-What happened?

1264
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,645
Ryan, what's going on?

1265
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,188
Father Todd!

1266
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,773
Stay in the circle!

1267
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,107
What do you see?

1268
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,027
What's happening?
Ryan, what do you see?

1269
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:35,071
Where's Father Todd? You see him?

1270
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:38,574
Where'd he go? What do you see?

1271
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,118
Father?

1272
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:43,412
No!

1273
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,957
Oh, my God! Where did he go?

1274
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,708
What are we gonna do?

1275
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,794
We need Father Todd
for this all to work!

1276
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,964
Hold on to Leila!

1277
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:57,593
Stay close! Hold on! Hold on to Leila!

1278
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,061
Get back! Get back into the circle!

1279
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,229
Where is it?

1280
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:09,605
Get back! I see it!

1281
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,275
Get back! Get in the circle! Get back!

1282
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:21,617
Mike! Get the sheets!
We got to get the sheets!

1283
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,953
Come on, we've got to put it on him!

1284
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,043
Emily, grab the camera.
What do you see?

1285
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,962
We got to say the prayers!
Get the book!

1286
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,463
Is it working?

1287
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,465
Skyler! The Bible!

1288
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,968
Hurry! We have to finish this!

1289
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,970
Here, I have it.

1290
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,930
"In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord,

1291
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,473
"Mary, Mother of God,

1292
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:46,058
"behold the Cross of the Lord,

1293
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:48,227
"flee bands of enemies.

1294
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,563
"We drive you from us.

1295
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,482
"Whoever you may be, unclean spirits..."

1296
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:59,238
"Pray, therefore, the God of Peace,
to crush Satan beneath our feet."

1297
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,743
Oh, my God, it worked!

1298
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:04,994
Lee! You okay?

1299
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:06,454
Mommy? Daddy?

1300
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:08,956
-Sweetie, are you back?
-What happened?

1301
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,917
You're back. She's back. It worked.

1302
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:14,003
-It worked?
-It worked!

1303
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,921
She okay?

1304
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:18,049
Yeah. Let's get out of here. Let's go.

1305
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,592
Skyler!

1306
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,386
Skyler!

1307
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,306
Mike, no! No!

1308
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:28,309
Leila!

1309
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:29,477
Leila!

1310
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:31,479
Leila, come back here! Come back!

1311
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:32,897
Leila!

1312
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,733
Lee! Lee, stop!

1313
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,570
Ryan, I dropped the camera!

1314
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:41,238
Just go get Leila!

1315
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:43,574
Leila, stop! Please!

1316
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,117
Leila!

1317
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,831
Ryan! Ryan!

1318
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:55,586
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

1319
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,588
Leila! Leila!

1320
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,216
Oh, God, what is this? What the fuck?

1321
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,717
What the fuck is that?

1322
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,177
What the fuck is that?

1323
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:05,388
Oh, God. Oh, no.

1324
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:06,806
Stay away!

1325
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:20,653
Oh, God, what is this?

1326
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,122
Lee?

1327
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,585
Leila!

1328
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:40,923
Leila, it's Mommy.

1329
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:53,978
Leila?

1330
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:09,785
Oh, fuck!

1331
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,500
Where is she?

1332
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:19,462
You're too late.

1333
01:19:19,796 --> 01:19:21,964
What have you done with her?

1334
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:25,009
The darkness. It's coming.

1335
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:26,343
What?

1336
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,053
Where is my daughter?

1337
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,080
Fuck!

1338
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:57,708
Where is it?

1339
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:03,255
Where is my daughter? Where is she?

1340
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,674
You're too late, Emily. It's done.

1341
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:06,801
He's real now.

1342
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,720
No. No, you tell me where she is.

1343
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,138
Tell me where she is!

1344
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:17,228
Where is she? Leila!

1345
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,571
Oh, my God.

1346
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,240
What is that?

1347
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:36,747
My God, what the... Oh, God.

1348
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,836
Oh, God...

1349
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:49,760
Oh, God. Leila!

1350
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,599
Oh, baby, hi. Are you okay?
Are you okay?

1351
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,434
Are you okay?

1352
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,686
I'm okay, Mommy.

1353
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,688
They just needed one drop of my blood.

1354
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:04,608
What? Where did they cut you?
What did they do to you?

1355
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,111
Oh, baby, your hand.

1356
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,446
He's alive now, Mommy.

1357
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,575
He's real, just like you and me.

1358
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,034
What are you talking about?

1359
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,786
What did they say to you, baby?

1360
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:22,126
Oh, God. Stay back.
Stay back, stay back.

1361
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:37,725
Stay away from us. Stay away from us!

1362
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:40,144
Go, Leila, go!

1363
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,437
Please, you've gotten what you wanted.

1364
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:44,815
You got what you wanted.
Please, leave us alone.

1365
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,093
Hi, Tobi.
