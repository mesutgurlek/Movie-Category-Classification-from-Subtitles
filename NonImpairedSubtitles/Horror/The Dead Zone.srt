00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:49,256
about my mother.

172
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:54,261
I got the number
from information.

173
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,162
It was in the phone book.

174
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,257
Did you talk to her?

175
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,504
No, I didn´t.

176
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,665
I, um--

177
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,175
She came to the phone,

178
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,440
but I just
couldn´t talk to her.

179
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:13,447
I hung up.

180
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:15,380
Why?

181
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,384
Why?

182
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:23,090
Because it wasn´t
meant to be.

183
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:25,508
It wasn´t meant to be.

184
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:29,544
Chug, chug, chug.
Come on. Keep it moving.

185
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:31,546
Weight down, knees up.

186
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:34,883
Keep it moving.

187
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:39,054
- That´s it.
- That´s it?

188
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:45,890
- That´s what I get, 8 lousy steps?
- I counted 1 0.

189
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:49,454
I´d like you to do
some serious chugging.

190
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:52,558
I´m going to run
around the building.

191
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:55,069
- Keep chugging?
- Okay.

192
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:57,072
See you.

193
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:04,238
Johnny.

194
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:09,516
They told me
you were outside.

195
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,554
I am.

196
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:16,081
I didn´t know
if I should come or not.

197
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,423
It´s all right.

198
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,604
You got your hair cut.

199
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:32,607
Yeah, a long time ago.

200
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:34,609
You lost weight.

201
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,872
They call it coma diet--

202
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:39,107
lose weight while you sleep.

203
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:45,119
You know I got married.

204
00:23:45,188 --> 00:23:47,452
I heard that.

205
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:50,625
You´d like him.

206
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:53,662
You still teach?

207
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,131
Uh-uh. Mothering´s
a full timejob.

208
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,896
Kids, too?
I didn´t know that.

209
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:02,369
I´m sorry.

210
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:06,340
I thought your father
would have told you.

211
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:12,413
He´s a wonderful little boy.
His name´s Denny.

212
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:16,009
- How old is he?
- Ten months.

213
00:24:23,993 --> 00:24:26,427
I´m glad foryou.

214
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:41,109
Don´t look at me
like that.

215
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:44,112
What am I going to do?

216
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,114
For you,
five years have passed.

217
00:24:46,182 --> 00:24:48,707
For me, it´s the next day.

218
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:52,414
My feelings
haven´t changed yet.

219
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:54,422
Oh,Johnny.

220
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:59,560
Why did it
have to happen?

221
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:02,120
Bad luck.

222
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:09,298
I never should have
let you go that night.

223
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:12,205
It was my idea,
remember?

224
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:14,743
What a jerk.

225
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:23,752
Everybody´s
talking about you.

226
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,755
You´re the talk
ofthe town.

227
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:29,553
´Cause I got
my head bashed in

228
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:31,560
and I´m alive?

229
00:25:31,628 --> 00:25:35,029
Because you have
the power of second sight.

230
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,089
Is it true,Johnny?

231
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:40,602
The papers
won´t let up about it.

232
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,332
I keep thinking
about a line

233
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:45,101
from The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow,

234
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:50,942
the last thing I gave my class
before the accident.

235
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:53,676
Ichabod Crane disappears.

236
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,617
The line goes,
"As he was a bachelor

237
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:58,620
and in nobody´s debt,

238
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:02,124
nobody troubled their head
about him anymore."

239
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:05,126
Is that what
you´re afraid of?

240
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:09,688
That´s what I want.
That´s what I want.

241
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,064
I don´t approve.

242
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:49,070
The press
has been hounding me.

243
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:51,572
I want it over with.

244
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:55,577
Once you´ve set something
like this in motion,

245
00:26:55,645 --> 00:27:00,082
it seems you never know
where it will lead.

246
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:02,083
It´s already in motion.

247
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:04,517
I want to stop it.

248
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:06,578
They put it out,

249
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,090
and that´s all there is.

250
00:27:09,158 --> 00:27:12,059
Clement Dardis,
WJGE-TV.

251
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:14,653
What happened to the girl?

252
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:17,325
I understand she´s fine.

253
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,334
Well, uh...

254
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:22,838
would you call this
a psychic experience?

255
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:26,966
- No, I would not.
- Ever had one before?

256
00:27:27,043 --> 00:27:28,977
No.

257
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:32,480
How about
a demonstration,John?

258
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:35,244
- A what?
- You know, a demonstration.

259
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:38,151
You got any predictions?

260
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:40,155
You think Greg Stillson

261
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:43,158
is going to unseat
Senator Proctor?

262
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:45,751
- Who?
- Greg Stillson.

263
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,458
Uh... thankyou, sir.

264
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:54,264
- No more.
- Wait, wait a minute!

265
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:56,271
How about the election?

266
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,105
I don´t even know
who you´re talking about.

267
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:04,237
Well, you didn´t know
anything about this nurse.

268
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:06,247
That was different.

269
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,212
Well, I--

270
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:14,313
I touched her hand.

271
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,791
Oh. All right.
All right!

272
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:22,556
Now, touch my hand.

273
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:26,898
Tell me,
is my house on fire,John?

274
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:29,938
- Shall I stop this?
- No.

275
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:35,911
You want to know
ifyou´re going to die?

276
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:41,416
We´ll all die. You want to know
ifyou´ll die tomorrow.

277
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:43,384
Is that right?

278
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:48,450
You want to know why
your sister killed herself.

279
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:50,458
All right.
Go on.

280
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:52,926
- It´s not all right.
- It´s okay.

281
00:28:52,995 --> 00:28:55,657
It´s not okay.

282
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:57,926
Okay.
I won´t talk about that!

283
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,130
- Let go, you fucking freak!
- Please stop it!

284
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:03,900
Leave him alone!

285
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:06,669
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

286
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:09,643
You´re hurting him!

bringing the boy.

Ohh...Johnny.

Leave your boots
outside the door.

Don´t go tracking snow
all over the house.

I won´t.

You know that,
don´t you?

Well, you never know, Frank.

It´s worth a try.

- Yeah, I´m Herb Smith.

Yeah, sure. Come in.

May I do something
foryou, Sheriff?

with what you
could call a proposal.

Maybe you should
give him--

Think about it,

but bear in mind
some decent young women

I was sorry to hear
about your mother´s death.

00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:27,430
Christian woman.

335
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,937
I´m not a religious man,
I´m sorry to say,

336
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:37,443
but if God has seen fit
to bless you with this gift,

337
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,444
you should use it.

338
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:44,549
Bless me?

339
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:47,950
You know
what God did for me?

340
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:50,956
He threw a truck at me,

341
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:54,289
bounced me into nowhere
for five years!

342
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,626
My girl was gone,
myjob was gone,

343
00:33:58,698 --> 00:34:00,791
my legs are useless.

344
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,801
Bless me?

345
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:05,531
God´s been a real sport to me.

346
00:34:14,714 --> 00:34:16,648
All right,John.

347
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:23,384
Ifyou change your mind,
you know where I am.

348
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,655
Merry Christmas to you.

349
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:46,478
Well?

350
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:50,181
Well what?

351
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,683
See? What did I tell you?

352
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,493
Them murders,
god-awful things.

353
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:14,699
Went on during the time
you were in that coma.

354
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:21,269
Don´t have the knack
for tinsel.

355
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:25,511
It was your mother who kept
the tree looking good.

356
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:30,278
I wish to God
she was here now

357
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:34,224
so she could talk to you
about this thing.

358
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:37,228
I´m not much help to you.

359
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:39,230
Sure you are.

360
00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:47,230
You, uh, want
to talk about it?

361
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:50,468
Not that much to say.

362
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:54,676
It don´t bring you
much happiness.

363
00:35:54,747 --> 00:35:56,681
When it happens...

364
00:35:58,751 --> 00:36:01,276
when the spells come,

365
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:04,915
it feels like--
I don´t know.

366
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:09,018
It feels like
I´m dying... inside.

367
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:21,639
No snow.

368
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:24,811
It should snow
for Christmas.

369
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,921
Hi.

370
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:15,155
I brought you a visitor.

371
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:18,163
I didn´t know
you were coming.

372
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,533
I wasn´t sure myself.

373
00:37:22,736 --> 00:37:25,637
If I´d known
you were coming,

374
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:27,639
I´d have cleaned up.

375
00:37:27,707 --> 00:37:29,766
You look wonderful.

376
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:34,179
You lost the crutches, I see.

377
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:37,114
Yeah.
I still got the limp.

378
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:41,447
Is your father home?

379
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:44,615
He won´t be back till later.

380
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:47,216
Is that who I think it is?

381
00:37:47,294 --> 00:37:49,922
His Majesty.

382
00:37:49,996 --> 00:37:52,863
- Danny?
- Denny.

383
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:54,662
Say hi.

384
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,668
Denny.

385
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:01,706
It´s cold.
Come on in.

386
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:27,166
He´s asleep.

387
00:38:34,574 --> 00:38:39,238
Last time
we were alone together,

388
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:42,543
you said some things
were worth waiting for.

389
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,909
Well...

390
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:48,284
haven´t we waited
long enough?

391
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:27,383
Charlene MacKenzie´s
got Dad building things.

392
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,794
Ifyou ask me, it´s the company
she wants more than the bookcases.

393
00:39:31,865 --> 00:39:33,799
I heard that.

394
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,874
That´s a boy.

395
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:48,080
There you are,
young fella.

396
00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:51,311
I made that when
John was born.

397
00:39:51,384 --> 00:39:53,318
It´s an excellent chair.

398
00:39:53,386 --> 00:39:57,755
What have you two
been up to all day?

399
00:39:57,824 --> 00:39:59,758
Making bookcases.

400
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:05,864
Sit down.
Dinner´s ready.

401
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,604
That smells good.
I´m starved.

402
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,911
- I hope you like it.
- He´s fed up with my cuisine.

403
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:30,122
For our bounty,

404
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:33,125
may the Lord make us grateful.
Amen.

405
00:40:41,868 --> 00:40:45,304
It feels good
to have a family

406
00:40:45,372 --> 00:40:47,806
eating around
this table again.

407
00:41:02,922 --> 00:41:05,550
Will I see you again?

408
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,025
Not like today.

409
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:13,199
Go inside,
you´re freezing.

410
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:17,032
- It doesn´t have to--
- Don´t say it.

411
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:19,401
Don´t say it,Johnny.

412
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:25,543
I´ll just say good night.

413
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:09,450
Guess I´ll hit the hay.

414
00:42:09,521 --> 00:42:12,081
I´m going to watch TV.

415
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,183
Good night, son.

416
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,592
Despite efforts
of police forces,

417
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:22,225
the killer i sat large,
and is likelyto remain so.

418
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:25,600
We spoke to
Sheriff Bannerman

419
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:27,605
outside the courthouse.

420
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:31,109
We have no newleads
at this time.

421
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:33,610
However, there is the hope

422
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,115
thatsome citizen might
havesome information

423
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,343
that wouldbe very helpful.

424
00:42:39,418 --> 00:42:41,352
My line is open.

425
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,821
I´d welcome anyhelp
we canget.

426
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,621
That´sallIhave to say.

427
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:51,128
Nine murders
have been attributed

428
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:55,326
to the Castle Rock Killer,
dating back almost 3 1/2years.

429
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,494
The most recent victim

430
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,164
was 15 year old
Debbie Linderman,

431
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,140
a sophomore at
Castle RockHigh School.

432
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:08,873
Her partially cladbody
wasfoundone month ago today.

433
00:43:08,947 --> 00:43:12,383
Asin the other
Castle Rockkillings,

434
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:15,887
cause of death was
multiple stab wounds.

435
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:18,989
Next on News Eight,

436
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:21,389
sportsand weather
with Ron,

437
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,394
afterthismessage.

438
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:27,193
I´m going to help.

439
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:30,291
What?

440
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,906
The sheriff
that came here...

441
00:43:34,973 --> 00:43:36,907
Bannerman.

442
00:43:39,478 --> 00:43:42,970
I´m going to help him.

443
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:44,982
We think the killer

444
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,419
hid down at the end
of the tunnel there.

445
00:43:49,488 --> 00:43:51,922
When the girl
came through,

446
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,925
the bastard was
waiting for her.

447
00:43:54,993 --> 00:43:57,427
Kids shouldn´t
come through here,

448
00:43:57,496 --> 00:44:02,433
but they use this
as a short cut to school.

449
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:08,939
He stood right here.

450
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:12,943
Found a lot ofcigarette butts,
same brand.

451
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,445
Eight or nine butts here.

452
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:17,448
This help you any?

453
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:20,952
I don´t know.
Have you got something

454
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:23,954
he might have touched
or worn?

455
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:26,456
Frank, give me
that package.

456
00:44:31,029 --> 00:44:33,463
It´s our only real evidence.

457
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:36,933
Found it in the bushes
back there.

458
00:44:37,002 --> 00:44:38,936
Same brand as the butts.

459
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:44,475
Here.

460
00:45:33,425 --> 00:45:35,393
Nothing.

461
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:42,533
I thought I´d
feel something, but--

462
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:45,035
Can´t say we didn´t try.

463
00:45:45,103 --> 00:45:47,071
Dispatch to
SheriffBannerman.

464
00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:52,543
Yeah, this is Bannerman.

465
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:54,545
Wegot anotherbody.

466
00:45:56,114 --> 00:45:57,547
Oh...

467
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:00,278
damn it!

468
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:02,286
What´s the word?

469
00:46:02,354 --> 00:46:06,552
- Is it the Castle Rock Killer?
- Hey, Sheriff!

470
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:09,560
What´s the word
about the robbery?

471
00:46:09,628 --> 00:46:12,062
That´s the psychic,
isn´t it?

472
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,064
Give us a break.

473
00:46:14,132 --> 00:46:17,568
We´re trying
to do a story here.

474
00:46:17,636 --> 00:46:20,070
You´ll just have to wait.

475
00:46:20,138 --> 00:46:22,572
Looks pretty grim to me.

476
00:46:28,146 --> 00:46:30,580
Anyone know who she is?

477
00:46:30,649 --> 00:46:33,174
Dodd?

478
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:50,925
I know her.
Alma Frechette.

479
00:46:51,002 --> 00:46:54,597
She works at
the Coffee Pot Cafe.

480
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:57,767
Was this psychic
your idea, George?

481
00:46:57,842 --> 00:47:00,606
Get these people out of here.

482
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:04,137
Move them back.
Move the people back.

483
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:08,447
Knock it offwith
those cameras. No more.

484
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,545
- Dodd!
- Yeah?

485
00:47:11,823 --> 00:47:15,224
- Nobody comes up here.
- You got it, Sheriff.

486
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:27,070
You want to try?

487
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,115
Hey, Alma!
Hi.

488
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:14,117
What are you doing?

489
00:48:14,185 --> 00:48:16,915
Waiting for
a smile from you.

490
00:48:16,988 --> 00:48:20,253
She knows him.

491
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:22,793
What?

492
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:30,092
She knows him.

493
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,145
Why waste a smile on you?

494
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:45,614
You want to see
the damndest thing?

495
00:48:45,684 --> 00:48:49,142
- What?
- Come up to the gazebo.

496
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,662
She knows him.

497
00:49:02,233 --> 00:49:04,742
Not scared.
She knows him.

498
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:10,647
All right.

499
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:23,661
What did you
want to show me?

500
00:49:25,363 --> 00:49:29,299
Gazebo.
You like that word, Alma?

501
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,301
Come here.

502
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,134
Look at this.

503
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:38,073
Jesus! Let go!

504
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:41,168
- Is this your idea ofa joke?
- Nojoke.

505
00:49:57,261 --> 00:49:58,990
No, no! Wait!

506
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:04,531
You all right?
Dodd, give me a hand.

507
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:07,127
I saw him.
I was there.

508
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:10,936
- I saw his face.
- Who?

509
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:15,206
I stood there and watched him
kill that girl. Dodd!

510
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:17,770
- What are you saying?
- I did nothing.

511
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,717
I stood there and watched him
kill that girl.

512
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:24,721
- What are you saying?
- Dodd!

513
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:30,021
I stood there.
I did nothing.

514
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:34,230
Dodd?

515
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:37,794
Dodd, get up here!

516
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,838
He took off in your car.

517
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:49,137
I saw his face.
I saw his face.

518
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,064
You stay there.

519
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:33,589
Sheriff.

520
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:37,651
I told you
to stay by the car.

521
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,457
Who´s there?

522
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:44,024
I want to talk
to your son, Mrs. Dodd.

523
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,228
He ain´t here.

524
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:49,296
His patrol car
is out here.

525
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:51,705
His car´s here.
He ain´t.

526
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,677
I saw him
in the window.

527
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:05,446
- He ain´t home!
- I´m coming in.

528
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:07,457
No!

529
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:19,897
Leave my boy alone!

530
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,269
You knew.

531
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,075
Didn´t you?

532
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,349
You knew.

533
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:36,011
You--

534
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:38,647
You´re a--

535
00:52:38,723 --> 00:52:40,953
You´re a devil...

536
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,959
sent from hell!

537
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:46,129
Yes.

538
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:52,028
Yes.

539
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:36,039
Frank?

540
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:32,152
- No!
- Aaah!

541
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:38,228
Ahhh!

542
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:46,472
Hello,John.

543
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:50,434
May I come in?

544
00:57:08,496 --> 00:57:10,930
How did you find me?

545
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:12,431
My father?

546
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,434
Stopped offto see him.

547
00:57:14,502 --> 00:57:17,938
He said you moved
to a new town.

548
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:20,030
He´s worried about you.

549
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:21,802
And so am I.

550
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:25,403
Don´t worry.
I´m taking care of myself.

551
00:57:25,479 --> 00:57:27,413
It´s about time.

552
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:29,449
I´m still your doctor.

553
00:57:29,517 --> 00:57:31,951
You´re still under my care.

554
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:35,887
We have to...
well, stay in touch.

555
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:38,117
Well--

556
00:57:38,192 --> 00:57:41,855
How´s the, uh--
All healed up now?

557
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:46,462
The bullet...

558
00:57:46,534 --> 00:57:48,468
went right through me.

559
00:57:48,536 --> 00:57:50,970
- It´s nothing.
- Good.

560
00:57:53,874 --> 00:57:56,308
Nice place you have here.

561
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:02,315
It´s home.

562
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:11,082
Those headaches
are getting worse, aren´t they?

563
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:14,457
Three, four times
a day sometimes.

564
00:58:16,564 --> 00:58:18,725
I brought you
some new medication.

565
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,563
No! No more pills.

566
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:25,731
It takes time to recover.
The healing process is slow.

567
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:29,367
I´m not getting better.
I´m getting worse.

568
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:33,970
Isn´t that right?

569
00:58:40,487 --> 00:58:42,421
All right.

570
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:49,928
Now listen.
I´ve done some research

571
00:58:49,997 --> 00:58:52,932
into the area
of psychic phenomena.

572
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,664
Several cases, such as yours,
have been documented.

573
00:58:57,738 --> 00:58:59,672
I was surprised
to discover.

574
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,176
And the pattern
is always the same.

575
00:59:03,244 --> 00:59:06,611
As the spells,
the visions,

576
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,444
grow stronger
and more powerful,

577
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:11,507
the body weakens.

578
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:14,952
I don´t need any research
or documentation

579
00:59:15,022 --> 00:59:20,460
to see this thing is
sucking the life out ofyou.

580
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:23,257
One look tells me that.

581
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:26,299
You mean I´m going to die?

582
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:29,560
How long?

583
00:59:29,637 --> 00:59:32,970
I think we can
arrest the process,

584
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,008
reverse it even.

585
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:37,270
- How?
- Come back with me.

586
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:39,972
- Where?
- To the clinic.

587
00:59:40,047 --> 00:59:42,982
No. Absolutely no.

588
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,984
John, please.
You must!

589
00:59:45,052 --> 00:59:47,282
So you can study me?

590
00:59:47,354 --> 00:59:50,482
No. So I can
protect you.

591
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:55,256
You need to be in
a controlled environment,John.

592
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:59,123
I want to
show you something.

593
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,735
Come with me.

594
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:06,839
Cards and letters
keep pouring in.

595
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:10,343
What is all this?

596
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:14,643
It´s people with lost dogs,
lost children, lost lives.

597
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:17,513
You haven´t
even opened them.

598
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:19,518
I don´t have to.

599
01:00:19,586 --> 01:00:22,521
They all want reassurance,
help, love...

600
01:00:22,589 --> 01:00:24,989
things I can´t give them.

601
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:28,893
Father sends it.
I let it pile up.

602
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:31,396
Why do you keep it?

603
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:34,298
This is why
I can´t go out...

604
01:00:34,368 --> 01:00:36,393
live my life,

605
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:39,405
why I stay
locked up here.

606
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:43,409
I´m already living in
a controlled environment, Sam.

607
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:47,913
Nothing can touch me here.

608
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:51,842
I´m alone.

609
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,120
I´m safe.

610
01:00:56,924 --> 01:01:00,416
"But instead of dying,

611
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:05,431
she shall only
fall into...

612
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:07,933
a profound sleep

613
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:13,769
which shall last
a hundred years."

614
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:17,538
- [Horn Honks]
- That´s my mom.

615
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:22,038
Okay.

616
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,716
- Bye.
- Bye.

617
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:27,344
John Smith?

618
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:33,891
Hi. I´m Roger Stuart.

619
01:01:33,961 --> 01:01:36,589
I´d like to talk to you.

620
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:46,972
Sit down.

621
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:54,570
What can I do foryou?

622
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:58,584
Um... it´s, uh--

623
01:01:58,652 --> 01:02:01,587
It´s my boy,
my son, Chris.

624
01:02:01,655 --> 01:02:04,590
He needs help.

625
01:02:04,658 --> 01:02:06,592
I´ve inquired around.

626
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,094
You come highly recommended.

627
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,798
What´s the matter with him?

628
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:15,266
I wish I knew.

629
01:02:15,335 --> 01:02:17,599
He´s bright,
I know he is,

630
01:02:17,671 --> 01:02:21,107
but he won´t
take part in school.

631
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:23,336
He won´t join in.
He won´t learn.

632
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:26,538
God! He´s so shy.

633
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:32,209
You thinkyou
could help him?

634
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:35,414
I wouldn´t know
unless I met him.

635
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:38,458
He wouldn´t
come with me today.

636
01:02:38,525 --> 01:02:42,461
You´d have to come out
to the house.

637
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:45,123
No. That´s out
ofthe question.

638
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:48,635
It´s just not
the way I do it.

639
01:02:48,702 --> 01:02:51,466
It won´t work otherwise.

640
01:02:51,538 --> 01:02:53,563
Please.

641
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,131
He´ll get to know you,

642
01:02:56,210 --> 01:03:00,271
then you can bring
him here for the lessons.

643
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:02,281
Please.

644
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,181
Okay.

645
01:03:05,252 --> 01:03:07,550
Great. Tomorrow
morning´s Saturday.

646
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:10,556
I´ll send a car
to pickyou up.

647
01:03:12,526 --> 01:03:14,897
Thankyou.

648
01:04:10,286 --> 01:04:15,588
That reminds me ofwhen
I ran for the senate.

649
01:04:15,658 --> 01:04:18,593
My opponent
went to the ghetto

650
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:23,098
and handed out dollar bills
trying to buy votes.

651
01:04:23,165 --> 01:04:26,601
I said,
"You folks keep that money

652
01:04:26,669 --> 01:04:28,603
´cause times is rough.

653
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:33,608
But I want you to vote
for whoeveryou please."

654
01:04:33,676 --> 01:04:36,611
- We won by... what?
- 29.

655
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:39,773
29 percentage points.
Those people spent that money

656
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:41,817
with a clear conscience.

657
01:04:44,687 --> 01:04:48,123
John, good morning.
Nice to see you.

658
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:51,819
Gentlemen, meet my son´s tutor,
John Smith.

659
01:04:51,894 --> 01:04:54,454
- This is Greg Stillson.
- Hello.

660
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:57,465
- This gentleman is--
- Sonny Elliman.

661
01:04:57,533 --> 01:05:00,969
Well, Greg,
you got some good ideas.

662
01:05:01,037 --> 01:05:03,335
Let me think about them.

663
01:05:03,406 --> 01:05:07,399
Roger, I want you
to be part ofthis.

664
01:05:07,476 --> 01:05:12,140
I need your support,
your expertise, your input.

665
01:05:12,214 --> 01:05:15,047
And most importantly,
I need your money.

666
01:05:15,117 --> 01:05:19,019
- God bless, Roger.
- Thanks for dropping by.

667
01:05:19,088 --> 01:05:21,352
See you. Bye-bye.

668
01:05:21,424 --> 01:05:24,393
My God!
What a glorious day!

669
01:05:25,628 --> 01:05:27,562
Amen.

670
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:34,569
Sorry about that.

671
01:05:34,637 --> 01:05:36,969
Well, let´s go see Chris.

672
01:05:40,142 --> 01:05:43,339
Chris.
This is Johnny.

673
01:05:43,412 --> 01:05:47,212
Remember I said
he was coming?

674
01:05:48,484 --> 01:05:51,920
I´ll leave you alone
to get acquainted.

675
01:06:18,681 --> 01:06:20,615
Your father wants me

676
01:06:20,683 --> 01:06:24,119
to bring you
out of your shell.

677
01:06:25,187 --> 01:06:28,122
I don´t know what to do.

678
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:31,125
You don´t have
to do anything.

679
01:06:31,193 --> 01:06:35,061
My dad lives in a shell,
not me.

680
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,498
Chris has really
taken to you,John.

681
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:24,569
- You made progress.
- We just talked.

682
01:07:24,647 --> 01:07:27,582
Well, with Chris,
that´s an achievement.

683
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:29,550
You want a drink?

684
01:07:29,618 --> 01:07:32,086
- No.
- Want a beer?

685
01:07:32,154 --> 01:07:35,021
- Okay.
- Get him a beer.

686
01:07:46,168 --> 01:07:48,159
Let´s listen to this.

687
01:07:48,237 --> 01:07:49,761
99...

688
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,773
100!

689
01:07:54,176 --> 01:07:55,609
I´m Greg Stillson,

690
01:07:55,678 --> 01:08:00,615
just stopping by
on my wayto the U.S. Senate.

691
01:08:00,683 --> 01:08:02,617
Greg Stillson.

692
01:08:02,685 --> 01:08:05,119
Remember you met him
this morning?

693
01:08:05,187 --> 01:08:07,621
...you got to be
in good shape

694
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:13,390
togo the full distance
with those boys in Washington.

695
01:08:13,462 --> 01:08:17,364
What the hell is happening
to this country?

696
01:08:17,433 --> 01:08:19,628
Can anybody tell me?

697
01:08:19,702 --> 01:08:22,364
I read in a local paper--

698
01:08:22,438 --> 01:08:24,906
Do you believe this guy?

699
01:08:24,974 --> 01:08:28,273
He´s just getting
warmed up.

700
01:08:28,344 --> 01:08:30,278
You voting for him?

701
01:08:32,648 --> 01:08:34,582
I´m not even registered.

702
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:37,380
- Not registered?
- No.

703
01:08:37,453 --> 01:08:40,752
Get registered, pal,
and vote against this turkey.

704
01:08:40,823 --> 01:08:42,814
He´s dangerous.

705
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:45,087
...I see so many unemployed.

706
01:08:45,161 --> 01:08:50,098
Why are you people here
in the middle of the day?

707
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:52,100
Look at each other!

708
01:08:52,168 --> 01:08:54,102
How do you feel?

709
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:58,607
Would you send your friend
to the U.S. Senate?

710
01:08:58,674 --> 01:09:01,609
A real man of the people.

711
01:09:01,677 --> 01:09:04,703
Jesus, what an act.

712
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:07,613
Can´t they see
through this guy?

713
01:09:07,683 --> 01:09:10,151
You acted like friends
this morning.

714
01:09:10,219 --> 01:09:12,619
With guys like Stillson,

715
01:09:12,688 --> 01:09:15,122
you walk a thin line.

716
01:09:15,191 --> 01:09:18,627
If they lose,
they´ll drag you down.

717
01:09:18,694 --> 01:09:23,131
But if he wins,
and this turkey just might,

718
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:27,465
you make sure you´re thought of
as a good friend.

719
01:09:27,536 --> 01:09:30,699
Know what I mean?

720
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:33,640
...I´vegot ajob foreveryone

721
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:37,145
anda challenge for all of you!

722
01:09:37,213 --> 01:09:40,148
I´m challenging you
to join me,

723
01:09:40,216 --> 01:09:42,650
to join a growing army

724
01:09:42,718 --> 01:09:46,386
of volunteer workers
on my campaign.

725
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,614
Let´s send Greg Stillson
to the U.S. Senate

726
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,624
and mediocrity to hell!

727
01:10:17,918 --> 01:10:20,716
What can I do foryou boys?

728
01:10:20,787 --> 01:10:24,985
You work late.
That´s admirable.

729
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:27,253
I´m Greg Stillson.

730
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:31,661
I know who you are,
Mr. Stillson.

731
01:10:31,732 --> 01:10:35,168
Take your paid gorilla
and get out.

732
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:41,697
We´ve got a little problem here.

733
01:10:41,775 --> 01:10:44,403
Get to the point,
Mr. Stillson.

734
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:47,641
I´m damned near even
in the polls.

735
01:10:47,714 --> 01:10:49,648
The people need me.

736
01:10:49,716 --> 01:10:52,048
I´m going to win big.

737
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:54,053
I´ve had a vision

738
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:59,058
that I´m going to be President
ofthe United States someday.

739
01:10:59,126 --> 01:11:01,060
I´ve accepted
that responsibility,

740
01:11:01,128 --> 01:11:03,255
and nobody,

741
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,764
will stop me.

742
01:11:09,136 --> 01:11:11,070
Imagine how I felt

743
01:11:11,138 --> 01:11:13,572
when I read your editorial

744
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,074
that´s hitting
the streets tomorrow.

745
01:11:16,143 --> 01:11:19,078
You don´t seem
to like me, Brenner.

746
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:21,080
But that´s okay.

747
01:11:21,148 --> 01:11:23,582
I don´t like you either.

748
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:26,414
How did you get that?

749
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:31,719
I´m not at liberty
to reveal my sources.

750
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,090
It doesn´t make
any difference.

751
01:11:34,161 --> 01:11:37,892
That editorial is hitting
the streets tomorrow morning.

752
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:40,398
Not if we make a deal.

753
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:42,958
What´s that mean?

754
01:11:43,036 --> 01:11:46,597
You staying out of
the campaign business,

755
01:11:46,673 --> 01:11:50,609
and me staying out
of the publishing business.

756
01:11:50,677 --> 01:11:54,113
Show him what
we´ve got to publish.

757
01:11:59,686 --> 01:12:02,849
That´s your best shot.

758
01:12:02,923 --> 01:12:06,791
I got many loyal people
on my side--

759
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:09,988
Like that lady in
the photograph with you.

760
01:12:10,063 --> 01:12:12,998
I never met Mrs. Brenner,

761
01:12:13,066 --> 01:12:15,466
but I´m sure
that ain´t her.

762
01:12:15,535 --> 01:12:18,436
What do you think, Sonny?

763
01:12:25,378 --> 01:12:27,312
Is this Mrs. Brenner?

764
01:12:34,721 --> 01:12:37,815
- Doesn´t look like her.
- You son ofa bitch!

765
01:12:37,891 --> 01:12:40,485
Who you calling
a son of a bitch?

766
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,656
Let´s give
Mr. Brenner a chance

767
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:47,666
to think about
his wife, kids,

768
01:12:47,734 --> 01:12:50,168
his position
in the community.

769
01:12:59,246 --> 01:13:02,477
What if I don´t make a deal?

770
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:04,517
You´ll make a deal.

771
01:13:04,584 --> 01:13:08,384
Otherwise Sonny
will take your head off.

772
01:13:11,758 --> 01:13:14,693
Good idea.

773
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:18,697
I told you he was
a reasonable man.

774
01:13:18,765 --> 01:13:20,699
He´s a nice man.

775
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:22,701
I like your wife too.

776
01:13:29,643 --> 01:13:32,043
"Prophets, said I,
thing ofevil.

777
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:34,546
Prophets still
of bird or devil,

778
01:13:34,614 --> 01:13:37,549
by that heaven
that bends above us,

779
01:13:37,617 --> 01:13:40,051
by that God
we both adore,

780
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,554
tell this soul
with sorrow laden,

781

ifwithin
the distant Aden,

782
01:13:44,624 --> 01:13:46,717
it shall clasp
a sainted maiden

783
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:49,091
whom the angels
named Lenore."

784
01:13:49,162 --> 01:13:51,858
Skip to the part
where he talks about,

785
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:54,332
"Will I ever
see her again?"

786
01:13:56,102 --> 01:13:58,400
"Eagerly I wish the morrow.

787
01:13:58,471 --> 01:14:00,735
Vainly I had sought
to borrow

788
01:14:00,807 --> 01:14:03,241
from my books,
surcease of sorrow,

789
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:05,244
sorrow for
the lost Lenore.

790
01:14:05,312 --> 01:14:07,746
For the rare
and radiant maiden

791
01:14:07,814 --> 01:14:09,748
whom the angels
named Lenore,

792
01:14:09,816 --> 01:14:11,750
nameless here forevermore."

793
01:14:11,818 --> 01:14:14,048
[Doorbell Buzzes]

794
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,021
Stop. I´ll be right back.

795
01:14:25,832 --> 01:14:27,766
Good afternoon, sir.

796
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:30,769
We´re out talking
about Greg Stillson.

797
01:14:30,837 --> 01:14:33,271
You´re familiar
with our candidate?

798
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,774
What do you think?

799
01:14:37,244 --> 01:14:39,269
Yeah, right.

800
01:14:39,346 --> 01:14:43,646
Are you aware ofwhat
Greg Stillson stands for?

801
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:47,778
Greg Stillson´s mounting
a successful third party movement.

802
01:14:47,854 --> 01:14:51,790
Stillson represents
both the poor and the well-off.

803
01:14:51,858 --> 01:14:55,794
Could you come back?
I have a student.

804
01:14:55,862 --> 01:14:59,025
Sure. You´re busy.
Can I leave some literature?

805
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:01,158
Honey, bring some brochures!

806
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:20,812
Hello,Johnny.

807
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:27,392
Hi.

808
01:15:28,628 --> 01:15:31,188
You live here?

809
01:15:31,264 --> 01:15:34,062
Yeah. I´m back to teaching.

810
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:36,659
This is my husband Walt.

811
01:15:36,736 --> 01:15:39,671
Nice to meet you
finally,John.

812
01:15:39,739 --> 01:15:42,674
Sarah´s talked
about you often.

813
01:15:46,246 --> 01:15:48,339
Come on back,Johnny.

814
01:15:48,415 --> 01:15:50,679
It´s no fun reading alone.

815
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:53,446
Chris,
Walt and Sarah.

816
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,488
Hi.

817
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:00,526
We´ll let you
get back to work.

818
01:16:02,462 --> 01:16:04,589
Nice to meet you.

819
01:16:04,664 --> 01:16:07,224
Don´t forget
who to vote for.

820
01:16:15,008 --> 01:16:16,976
Bye.

821
01:16:25,285 --> 01:16:26,718
Who was that?

822
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:33,725
Hey.

823
01:16:33,793 --> 01:16:35,727
You okay?

824
01:16:40,133 --> 01:16:42,567
Why are you crying,
Johnny?

825
01:16:45,805 --> 01:16:47,739
Johnny?

826
