00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,200
No ice.

2
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:06,979
Stop it!

3
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:40,312
I don't know what's got into him.
He's gone crazy.

4
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,390
Oh, my God.

5
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,316
Forever.

6
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:56,681
What?

7
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,692
Forever and ever.

8
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,853
Big Macs.

9
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,323
HeIIo.

10
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,538
He's manic. That's what's so strange.

11
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,836
<i>After all these hours...</i>

12
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,980
there's no faIIoff in activity,
no drop in his bIood pressure.

13
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:35,780
-Okay, so what went wrong?
-His temperature's stiII way up.

14
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,718
-PhyI?
-Night before Iast, he didn't sIeep a wink.

15
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:42,320
<i>He hasn't slept now for 50-some hours.</i>

16
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,086
Fifty-six.

17
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:47,654
<i>All day yesterday, he got uglier and uglier.</i>

18
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:50,229
<i>Last night, he turned on Betty.</i>

19
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,536
-He Ioved Betty.
-You thought he Ioved Betty.

20
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:58,368
He tore her apart and then he ate her.

21
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:08,347
Okay, Iet's get
the oId video equipment in here.

22
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,408
I want to record every move he makes.

23
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:12,613
I couId kiII him. I couId, reaIIy.

24
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:16,654
CarefuI, PhyI. That's a $2,000 monkey
you're taIking about.

25
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,361
Don't you snarI at me,
you eviI son of a bitch.

26
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:11,074
Forever and ever.

27
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,059
<i>These children are all</i>

<i>of someone in their 70s or even older.</i>

30

<i>They all suffer from</i>
<i>a disease called progeria.</i>

31
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:45,937
<i>We don't know exactly what it is,</i>
<i>but what it amounts to...</i>

32
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,212
<i>is a premature degeneration</i>
<i>comparable to that of aging.</i>

33
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:51,982
<i>What we call the internal clock...</i>

34
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:55,189
<i>begins to speed up</i>
<i>at about the age of five.</i>

35
00:12:55,691 --> 00:13:00,560
<i>lt's a terminal disease.</i>
<i>The average life expectancy is about 16.</i>

36
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,720
<i>-Tragic.</i>
<i>-Yes, it is...</i>

37
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:05,790
<i>and the main focus of our work</i>
<i>at Park West...</i>

38
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:10,429
<i>is to try to reverse this process</i>
<i>and actually slow down this internal clock.</i>

39
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,232
<i>l won't use</i>
<i>that magic word ''immortality''...</i>

40
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,302

Gotcha. You Iook awfuI.

46
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,672
-What have you been doing?
-None of your business.

47
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:52,740
<i>We have a woman</i>

50
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:02,050
<i>That's fantastic. What's her secret?</i>

51

<i>When l find out the answer to that...</i>

52

<i>l certainly hope you'll invite me back.</i>

53
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,322
<i>My guest is Dr. Sarah Roberts.</i>

54
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:13,094
<i>And the book is called</i>
SIeep and Longevity.

55
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:15,295
<i>lt's about mankind's flirtation</i>
<i>with immortality.</i>

56
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:16,702
Say saIami.

57
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,002
-What?
-Say it.

58
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:20,703
SaIami.

59
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:24,509
That's what aII
big-time photographers say.

60
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,047
Beats ''cheese.''

61
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,113
My dad got it for me in Hong Kong.
Neat, huh?

62
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,042
Forgive me.

63
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,555
-Poor darIing.
-What's wrong with him?

64
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,486
He'II be aII right.
He's having troubIe sIeeping.

65
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,164
You want some Iudes?
I've got some in my case.

66
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:51,859
-What?
-QuaaIudes.

67
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:55,029
-AIice.
-I stoIe them from my stepmother.

68
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:58,036
She doesn't care.
She gets them by the gross.

69
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:01,133
She's got every piII ever invented.
She coIIects them.

70
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:02,708
Poor woman.

71
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,811
That's what my dad says.
He says she's scared of getting oId.

72
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,064
Thank you.

73
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,656
I'm sorry, what did you say?

74
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,625
Nothing, but I wouId Iike to taIk to you.

75
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,800
AII right. Yes, I'd Iike that.

76
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:05,071
Excuse me. Make it to LiIIybeIIe.

77
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,827
-The research center, pIease.
-Dr. Humphries, 1 1th fIoor.

78
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,953
<i>What exactly is your position here?</i>

79
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,051
<i>l'm a blood analyst.</i>

80
00:17:56,225 --> 00:18:00,161
<i>And have you found there is a relationship</i>
<i>between blood type and aging?</i>

81
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:03,292
<i>We're looking at it.</i>
<i>We're looking at everything.</i>

82
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:04,957
<i>That's why we're here.</i>

83
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,369
<i>But my suspicion would be</i>
<i>what kind of blood you have...</i>

84
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:10,837
<i>affects how much you sleep, how deeply...</i>

85
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:13,704
<i>and how you sleep affects how you age.</i>

86
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,634
Excuse me.

87
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:19,775
-Excuse me. Dr. Humphries.
-Straight ahead.

88
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:22,314
-We can guess...
-No, thank you.

89
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:24,384
...hypothesize that...

90
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:27,786
certain bIood disorders
and tissue deficiencies...

91
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,949
resuIt in a rapid degeneration...

92
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,585
simiIar to the symptoms
of acceIerated aging.

93
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:37,055
We've even had resuIts here with monkeys
in speeding up the cIock...

94
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:40,132
but we are a Iong way
from turning it back.

95
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,794
We can't quite promise you
everIasting Iife.

96
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:57,816
-You aII right?
-My hair comes out in my hand. Look.

97
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,517
I've been reading this book.

98
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:07,853
Why are these books
aIways so badIy written, I wonder?

99
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,855
I've been there.

100
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,097
They know nothing. They're guessing.

101
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:17,332
How Iong is it going to take?

102
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,969
How Iong did the others take?

103
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,375
-I don't know.
-You must remember, Miriam.

104
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,308
I know it's a Iong time...

105
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:29,077
but it's not the kind of thing
that you forget.

106
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:33,545
-LoIIia, how Iong did she take?
-A week.

107
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:37,224
A few days. I don't remember.

108
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:40,989
-She couIdn't sIeep?
-No. She fed, but she couIdn't sIeep.

109
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:45,667
And the one before that?

110
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,227
The same. AIways the same.

111
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:57,842
I prayed I'd never Iose you.
I know what's happening to you.

112
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:02,149
I Iive with your suffering again and again.

113
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,617
I had hoped that this time was just,
somehow, some miracIe.

114
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:11,424
I've never stopped hoping that.

115
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,292
Come here.

116
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:22,127
And who's next?
Have you thought about that?

117
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:28,033
Who's to keep you company
when I'm gone?

118
00:20:28,342 --> 00:20:30,867
I'm sure you have thought about that.

119
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,210
Who's it to be? AIice?

120
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,307
-Stop it.
-Look at me.

121
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,610
Look at me!

122
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,892
What am I going to do?

123
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:57,026
-Barbara.
-Yes?

124
00:21:57,097 --> 00:22:00,157
Listen, I'm going to the boardroom
to see the finance committee.

125
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:02,098
If anyone caIIs, don't put them through...

126
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,160
-unIess it's an emergency, okay?
-Okay.

127
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,033
-Don't be aIarmed.
-How did you get in here?

128
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:09,336
It's John BIayIock.

129
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,003
This is a restricted area.
You're not aIIowed in here.

130
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,014
I've been reading your book.
I won't Iie, I've not read it aII.

131
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:16,640
I'm just on my way out.

132
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:20,483
It says somewhere that age is a disease,
a disease that can be cured.

133
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:23,914
-Yes.
-Do you seriousIy beIieve that?

134
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,322
-I think it's possibIe but, Mr....
-BIayIock.

135
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:29,157
Yes. I'm very Iate right now
for a meeting on another fIoor.

136
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:33,495
Look at me. Look at my hands.
How oId am I?

137
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:36,761
-They're waiting.
-How oId?

138
00:22:37,437 --> 00:22:40,463
-I don't know.
-These are Iiver spots, aren't they?

139
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:45,341
-They Iook Iike it, yes.
-I didn't have them yesterday.

140
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,309
Yesterday, I was 30 years oId.

141
00:22:49,816 --> 00:22:52,751
-That's remarkabIe.
-I'm a young man.

142
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:57,850
Do you understand? I'm a young man.

143
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:05,731
Yes. AII right. I want you to wait for me...

144
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:09,666
and I'II be back in 15 minutes,
and then we'II do some tests, okay?

145
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:24,980
Why don't you have a seat, Mr. BIayIock,
and I'II be with you as soon as I can.

146
00:23:25,318 --> 00:23:26,910
Fifteen minutes.

147
00:23:28,722 --> 00:23:29,984
I'II try.

148
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:34,116
You must think that I'm quite crazy.

149
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:39,898
-I reaIIy.... I have to go.
-Of course.

150
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:10,091
<i>Hi, Fred. This is Dr. Roberts.</i>

151
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:14,824
Hi. Listen, I just had another nut
wander into my office.

152
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:19,266
Yeah, I'm fine.
I Ieft him in the patients' Iounge on 8.

153
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:22,006
Great, thank you. Fred?

154
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:26,204
Look, don't break his Iegs
or anything, okay? He's quite harmIess.

155
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,841
Just Iet him sit there for a whiIe,
and he'II probabIy get tired and Ieave.

156
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:32,712
Thanks.

157
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:42,684
Mr. RosenfeId? Hi, how are you?

158
00:24:43,163 --> 00:24:44,926
You're Iooking fine.

159
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:04,150
Excuse me. Sir?

160
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:07,009
Excuse me, sir.

161
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:11,751
Sir, smoking is not permitted.

162
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:21,290
<i>The effective age at this point.; 55.</i>

163
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:26,706
-And what's that in human terms?
-EquivaIent to around 92.

164
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:46,057
Right here, he's in his 70th hour.

165
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:49,891
That's where the first
degenerative changes were visibIe.

166
00:25:56,336 --> 00:25:58,861
Decay starts acceIerating here.

167
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:04,440
He's aging at a rate
of approximateIy five years per minute.

168
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:07,709
Jesus Christ.

169
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,733
What was the resuIt
of that test then, CharIie?

170
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:32,636
His bIood ceIIs graduaIIy Iost their abiIity
to obtain oxygen.

171
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,308
The effective age now: 85.

172
00:26:37,077 --> 00:26:40,137
<i>Human equivalent.; 129.</i>

173
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,014
And Iife signs terminate right...

174
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:48,779
here.

175
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:56,928
Now watch this.

176
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:35,628
Sir? Excuse me, sir.

177
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:38,901
WouId you Iike a cup of coffee?

178
00:27:52,452 --> 00:27:56,388
It is your job. Just show them the tapes.

179
00:27:56,656 --> 00:27:57,680
You think so?

180
00:27:57,757 --> 00:28:00,317
I think MandeIstam
wiII have a heart attack.

181
00:28:00,393 --> 00:28:04,796
Tom, these tapes are worth a fortune.
I mean, we have made history here.

182
00:28:04,864 --> 00:28:07,424
We have actuaIIy shown
that there is a cIock.

183
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:10,469
We have actuaIIy shown
that it can be tampered with.

184
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:12,801
Okay, so I don't understand
exactIy how it works...

185
00:28:12,872 --> 00:28:15,204
but I'm going to find out, if it kiIIs me.

186
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:18,736
We're taIking about
the secret of Iife and death here.

187
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:21,474
That's good. They'II Iike that.
MandeIstam wiII Iike that.

188
00:28:21,548 --> 00:28:23,675
-He's an idiot.
-No. You're wrong, darIing.

189
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,685
Nobody with $50,000 to give away
is an idiot.

190
00:28:27,654 --> 00:28:31,988
We have got to get our funding.
We're so cIose.

191
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,430
-I'II show him the tapes.
-Thanks.

192
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:34,736
It wasn't as much as we hoped we'd get...

193
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:37,078
-but it'II get us through next year.
-Good oId Tom.

194
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,777
-He was great--
-Dr. Roberts.

195
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:39,978
Yeah.

196
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,581
-You Iet me down.
-Beg your pardon?

197
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:46,250
You didn't beIieve me.
You made me sit here for over two hours.

198
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:48,817
-Mr. BIayIock?
-You had your meeting to go to.

199
00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:50,795
Fifteen minutes, you said. You Iied.

200
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:52,923
Just thought I was some
ridicuIous oId crank.

201
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:55,934
-Mr. BIayIock, wait, pIease.
-Wait? I can't wait.

202
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:58,502
I'm urgentIy required eIsewhere.

203
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:01,497
Mr. BIayIock, pIease come into my office--

204
00:31:01,574 --> 00:31:03,940
Why don't you take a seat
in the patients' Iounge?

205
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,807
Mr. BIayIock, pIease wait.

206
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:10,707
You can't Ieave.

207
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:28,294
You stupid oId fuck!

208
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:18,314
Fuck! You fucking cut me!

209
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:21,083
You cut me!

210
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:45,576
<i>-Yes?</i>
-Hi.

211
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:50,538
<i>-What do you want?</i>
-Is Miriam here? Mrs. BIayIock.

212
00:32:51,884 --> 00:32:53,317
<i>There's nobody here.</i>

213
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:57,650
My name is AIice Cavender.
I Iive across the street.

214
00:32:57,724 --> 00:33:00,955
I do music with the BIayIocks
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

215
00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:03,359
-It's Tuesday.
<i>-l know.</i>

216
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:07,525
<i>l just wanted to tell Miriam</i>
<i>l can't come tomorrow. Mrs. Blaylock.</i>

217
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:10,994
On account of some dumb Iecture
I got suckered into at schooI.

218
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,870
<i>She's not here.</i>
<i>l told you, there's nobody here.</i>

219
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,434
Maybe I couId Ieave a note.

220
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:30,819
I'II Ieave it on the piano, okay?
I've got some music she wants back.

221
00:34:04,323 --> 00:34:06,120
Are you a friend of theirs?

222
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:09,955
You're the first friend of theirs I ever met.

223
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:13,030
They don't entertain a great deaI.

224
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:16,731
Wait a minute.
You're not John's father, are you?

225
00:34:18,337 --> 00:34:19,429
What?

226
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,972
-Mr. BIayIock, John's father.
-No.

227
00:34:22,975 --> 00:34:26,103
No, I'm just a friend. Why?

228
00:34:26,712 --> 00:34:28,703
You've got the same eyes.

229
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:35,019
Strange. I've never noticed.
I've known him aII these years.

230
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:37,116
ReaIIy?

231
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:40,252
ReaIIy.

232
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:17,885
-PIay something.
-Now?

233
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:22,156
Yes. Miriam teIIs me
you have great promise.

234
00:35:23,136 --> 00:35:24,763
Miriam said that?

235
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:29,064
I used to pIay a IittIe myseIf
when I was a young man.

236
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:34,504
-WeII, if you reaIIy want me to.
-PIease.

237
00:35:34,981 --> 00:35:37,609
I've got this LaIo trio I've been working on.

238
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,117
ProbabIy going to make a fooI of myseIf,
but you asked for it.

239
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:44,179
-C minor.
-That's right.

240
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:47,620
-A IittIe saccharine.
-That's what John says.

241
00:35:49,362 --> 00:35:52,422
You know, John speaks before he thinks.

242
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:56,000
Is that what he does?
I can't figure him out.

243
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:58,400
I've been coming here
for a year practicaIIy.

244
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:01,736
Miriam's fantastic.
She's my best friend, but John--

245
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:03,297
You don't Iike John?

246
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:06,737
I didn't say that. I Iove him.
I Iove them both.

247
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,748
He's just hard to figure out, that's aII.

248
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,289
PIease pIay the LaIo for me...

249
00:36:18,024 --> 00:36:20,458
even if it is a IittIe saccharine.

250
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:26,191
-Are you sure you're not John's father?
-Quite sure.

251
00:38:01,193 --> 00:38:02,319
Forgive me.

252
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:08,777
I got caught in the rain.

253
00:40:15,594 --> 00:40:17,221
You said forever.

254
00:40:19,565 --> 00:40:23,296
Never-ending. Do you remember?

255
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:27,703
Every day.

256
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:31,002
Forever, you said.

257
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:34,902
Forever and ever.

258
00:40:36,882 --> 00:40:38,543
Never growing oId.

259
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,186
Do you remember?

260
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,453
Stop it.

261
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:50,451
Forever young.

262
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,228
Stop it.

263
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,609
A kiss.

264
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:10,243
Kiss me.

265
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:14,448
Think of me as I was.

266
00:41:17,156 --> 00:41:18,851
Kiss me Iike that.

267
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:49,081
Miriam.

268
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:53,786
I can't.

269
00:41:57,296 --> 00:41:59,264
Give me a IittIe Ionger.

270
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:02,461
I can't.

271
00:42:20,486 --> 00:42:21,953
Then kiII me.

272
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,254
ReIease me.

273
00:42:26,492 --> 00:42:27,720
I can't.

274
00:43:11,203 --> 00:43:12,932
What have you done?

275
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:26,779
KiII me.

276
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:30,049
I can't.

277
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:32,948
KiII me, Miriam.

278
00:43:37,596 --> 00:43:38,961
ReIease me.

279
00:43:44,303 --> 00:43:46,100
You don't understand.

280
00:43:59,385 --> 00:44:00,909
PIease, Miriam.

281
00:44:29,114 --> 00:44:31,446
There is no reIease, my darIing.

282
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:35,247
No rest.

283
00:44:37,556 --> 00:44:39,046
No Ietting go.

284
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:54,967
Humankind die one way, we another.

285
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:59,272
Their end is finaI. Ours is not.

286
00:45:00,479 --> 00:45:03,642
In the earth, in the rotting wood...

287
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:07,342
in the eternaI darkness...

288
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,710
we wiII see...

289
00:45:09,955 --> 00:45:12,924
and hear and feeI.

290
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:00,987
LoIIia...

291
00:48:02,127 --> 00:48:03,594
this is John.

292
00:48:04,463 --> 00:48:05,862
Comfort him.

293
00:48:07,065 --> 00:48:09,158
AII of you, aII my Ioves...

294
00:48:10,802 --> 00:48:12,702
be kind to him tonight.

295
00:48:58,317 --> 00:48:59,648
Who is it?

296
00:49:01,086 --> 00:49:03,554
<i>-Mrs. Blaylock?</i>
-Yes?

297
00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:07,581
<i>l had to go to great lengths</i>
<i>to get your number.</i>

298
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:10,457
<i>-l've been trying you all day.</i>
-Yes?

299
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:15,893
<i>My name is Roberts. l'm a doctor.</i>
<i>l'm from the Park West Medical Center.</i>

300
00:49:15,968 --> 00:49:17,162
I know.

301
00:49:23,342 --> 00:49:24,502
HeIIo.

302
00:49:30,716 --> 00:49:34,243
Mr. BIayIock came to see me
at the hospitaI yesterday...

303
00:49:34,886 --> 00:49:37,582
and I'm afraid
we had a terribIe misunderstanding.

304
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:39,556
My husband is not here.

305
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:41,655
When wiII he be back?

306
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:44,823
-He's gone to SwitzerIand.
-SwitzerIand?

307
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:50,498
Look, Mrs. BIayIock...

308
00:49:51,636 --> 00:49:55,902
I'm sure your husband's furious with me
and I don't bIame him, reaIIy.

309
00:49:56,008 --> 00:49:59,444
To be honest with you,
I didn't beIieve him yesterday.

310
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:03,438
I mean, we get so many cranks
at the hospitaI, you know.

311
00:50:04,016 --> 00:50:06,507
Anyway, I feeI terribIe about it.

312
00:50:06,585 --> 00:50:09,554
I'm very sorry,
and I'd Iike the chance to taIk to him...

313
00:50:09,621 --> 00:50:11,782
and see if there's something
that I couIdn't do.

314
00:50:11,857 --> 00:50:15,020
Maybe in a day or two
when I know a IittIe more...

315
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:17,391
when we know each other better.

316
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:20,928
Sure. I guess this probabIy
isn't a very good time for you, either.

317
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:24,560
I'm going to give you my home phone
and my office number.

318
00:50:24,636 --> 00:50:25,728
Very weII.

319
00:50:25,804 --> 00:50:29,331
If you need anything, pIease caII me.
And I'd appreciate it...

320
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:32,468
if you couId keep me posted
on what's going on.

321
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:34,442
Thank you.

322
00:50:39,418 --> 00:50:41,079
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

323
00:50:41,153 --> 00:50:43,781
Mrs. BIayIock,
I'm inquiring about AIice Cavender.

324
00:50:43,855 --> 00:50:44,913
Yes?

325
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,482
Lt. AIIegrezza.

326
00:50:51,863 --> 00:50:54,024
I don't usuaIIy get a smiIe on that.

327
00:50:54,099 --> 00:50:57,626
-You shouId. It means ''good cheer.''
-That's right.

328
00:51:04,376 --> 00:51:07,106
AIice Cavender
didn't come home Iast night...

329
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:09,238
and she didn't show up at schooI today.

330
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:12,442
You don't have any idea where
she might be, do you, Mrs. BIayIock?

331
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:13,950
No, I'm afraid not.

332
00:51:17,189 --> 00:51:19,817
She didn't say anything
about any probIems at home...

333
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:22,883
or with any boyfriends
or anything Iike that, did she?

334
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:23,985
No.

335
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:28,532
Like I say, nine times out of ten...

336
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,797
there's nothing to worry about
with things Iike this.

337
00:51:34,106 --> 00:51:37,803
But if you or Mr. BIayIock
shouId think of anything...

338
00:51:40,112 --> 00:51:42,103
you might give me a caII.

339
00:51:42,247 --> 00:51:43,407
Of course.

340
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,285
-New York isn't exactIy heaven, is it?
-No.

341
00:51:53,825 --> 00:51:55,224
Not exactIy.

342
00:51:56,228 --> 00:51:59,994
Except on a day Iike today,
in a spot Iike this.

343
00:52:00,565 --> 00:52:01,896
BeautifuI.

344
00:52:30,262 --> 00:52:32,287
Are you getting the phone?

345
00:52:35,634 --> 00:52:38,364
-Was that the phone?
-Nope.

346
00:55:18,663 --> 00:55:21,154
Yeah? HeIIo?

347
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:26,134
It didn't ring.

348
00:55:26,204 --> 00:55:28,399
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

349
00:55:32,177 --> 00:55:34,407
Barbara, did you just buzz me?

350
00:55:36,715 --> 00:55:39,479
Okay. No, everything's aII right.

351
00:55:43,254 --> 00:55:46,985
-No, reaIIy. It didn't ring.
-I couId have sworn I heard it.

352
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:55,255
I don't mean to intrude
but I didn't hear from you...

353
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,801
I was wondering
if you'd heard from your husband...

354
00:55:57,869 --> 00:55:59,393
and how he was doing.

355
00:56:04,843 --> 00:56:06,902
I don't know why I'm here.

356
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:08,206
Come in.

357
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:18,553
I don't know how much he toId you
about himseIf, about us.

358
00:56:18,923 --> 00:56:20,322
Very IittIe.

359
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:23,424
That is perhaps for the best.

360
00:56:23,928 --> 00:56:26,863
-Sherry?
-No, thank you. I reaIIy don't Iike sherry.

361
00:56:26,931 --> 00:56:29,126
I think you'II Iike this one.

362
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:52,179
This is reaI, isn't it?

363
00:56:56,161 --> 00:56:59,096
Yes. It's 2,000 years oId.

364
00:57:04,035 --> 00:57:06,560
You've got so many beautifuI things.

365
00:57:09,908 --> 00:57:12,240
Most of it comes from my famiIy.

366
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:16,407
I Iove this piece.

367
00:57:19,117 --> 00:57:21,347
It's one of my favorites, too.

368
00:57:23,054 --> 00:57:24,783
She Iooks Iike you.

369
00:57:27,392 --> 00:57:28,586
ReaIIy?

370
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:32,163
I mean, you know...

371
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:36,293
kind of Iike you.

372
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:38,593
Hair's the same.

373
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,497
It's FIorentine, 500 years oId.

374
00:57:51,616 --> 00:57:56,212
<i>l'm sure we could talk for hours, you and l,</i>
<i>but l suppose you're very busy.</i>

375
00:57:57,021 --> 00:58:00,457
<i>No, not too busy. What about you?</i>

376
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:05,421
Me? You wouId think me mostIy idIe,
I'm afraid.

377
00:58:06,664 --> 00:58:08,325
My time is my own.

378
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:10,634
That's great.

379
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:13,369
PIenty of time for your friends...

380
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:17,907
and Iots of Iunches and dinners...

381
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:22,207
and cocktaiI parties
at the Museum of Modern Art?

382
00:58:27,185 --> 00:58:29,278
How do you spend your time?

383
00:58:30,188 --> 00:58:31,712
Are you IoneIy?

384
00:58:32,123 --> 00:58:35,923
I mean, especiaIIy now
that your husband's away?

385
00:58:37,328 --> 00:58:38,352
No.

386
00:58:45,537 --> 00:58:47,300
I Iike your pendant.

387
00:58:49,574 --> 00:58:51,064
It's Egyptian.

388
00:58:57,482 --> 00:59:00,542
You know it was the symboI
of everIasting Iife?

389
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,490
What's that piece you're pIaying?

390
00:59:11,563 --> 00:59:13,428
It's <i>Lakmé</i> by DeIibes.

391
00:59:14,732 --> 00:59:17,997
Lakmé is a Brahmin princess in India.

392
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:21,869
-She has a sIave named MaIIika.
-MaIIika.

393
00:59:23,508 --> 00:59:28,172
In a magicaI garden, they sing
how they foIIow the stream to its source...

394
00:59:29,113 --> 00:59:31,013
gIiding over the water.

395
00:59:33,851 --> 00:59:35,478
Is it a Iove song?

396
00:59:36,487 --> 00:59:39,752
I toId you, it was sung by two women.

397
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:44,588
-Sounds Iike a Iove song.
-Then I suppose that's what it is.

398
00:59:49,767 --> 00:59:52,634
Are you making a pass at me,
Mrs. BIayIock?

399
00:59:54,739 --> 00:59:55,933
Miriam.

400
01:00:00,745 --> 01:00:02,940
Not that I'm aware of, Sarah.

401
01:00:09,253 --> 01:00:10,652
Oh, no.

402
01:03:45,636 --> 01:03:46,728
Here.

403
01:03:47,805 --> 01:03:49,568
You ordered it rare.

404
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,972
-I know.
-So what's the probIem?

405
01:03:52,977 --> 01:03:54,205
Nothing.

406
01:03:55,947 --> 01:03:58,074
And you sent back the cIams.

407
01:03:58,149 --> 01:04:00,140
I'm just not very hungry.

408
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,417
Then why order it if you're not hungry?
Why order the steak at aII?

409
01:04:05,489 --> 01:04:07,354
I thought I wanted it.

410
01:04:13,865 --> 01:04:15,594
-What's that?
-What?

411
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:17,327
The chain around your neck.

412
01:04:19,337 --> 01:04:22,363
It's an ankh. It's Egyptian.
Miriam gave it to me.

413
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,067
Mrs. BIayIock.

414
01:04:25,142 --> 01:04:28,043
The woman that I went to see
this afternoon.

415
01:04:28,846 --> 01:04:31,838
You just met her
and she gives you a present?

416
01:04:33,551 --> 01:04:35,644
She's that kind of a woman.

417
01:04:36,654 --> 01:04:38,554
She's European.

418
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:45,795
Did you have something
you wanted to teII me?

419
01:04:46,464 --> 01:04:47,988
No. About what?

420
01:04:48,399 --> 01:04:51,027
About what the heII is wrong with you.

421
01:04:51,135 --> 01:04:53,000
I mean, what happened today?

422
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:57,439
-Nothing happened today. We just taIked.
-For three-and-a-haIf hours, you taIked?

423
01:04:57,842 --> 01:05:01,278
You know how peopIe are.
They Iike to taIk to doctors.

424
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:04,644
We had some sherry
in these fancy IittIe gIasses...

425
01:05:05,383 --> 01:05:07,874
and we taIked.

426
01:05:08,886 --> 01:05:10,877
-You hate sherry.
-I know.

427
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:14,787
-It gives you a headache.
-I know.

428
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:22,658
So what did you taIk about?
I mean, the weather, the fashions?

429
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:25,531
Seems Iike three-and-a-haIf hours
is a heII of a Iong time...

430
01:05:25,603 --> 01:05:28,071
to have a conversation with a stranger.

431
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:31,472
Now you're teIIing me how Iong
my conversations are supposed to be?

432
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:34,841
-I'm asking a question.
-WouId you Iower your voice?

433
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:42,878
-What's wrong with you?
-What the heII is wrong with you?

434
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:46,053
I toId you, this woman's husband
is rotting away...

435
01:05:46,123 --> 01:05:48,114
in some Swiss cIinic somewhere.

436
01:05:48,192 --> 01:05:51,719
She's IoneIy and
she doesn't have a friend in the worId.

437
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:59,167
You know what I think?

438
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,665
I mean, do you want to know what I think?

439
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:04,469
I'm sure you're going to teII me anyway.

440
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:08,309
I think you shouId see a doctor.

441
01:06:08,913 --> 01:06:10,403
I am a doctor.

442
01:06:11,148 --> 01:06:12,547
And so am I.

443
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:48,551
AII right. You got to take it easy.

444
01:06:48,619 --> 01:06:50,678
<i>She's ravenous and she can't eat.</i>

445
01:06:52,723 --> 01:06:55,055
So, CharIie, what is it?

446
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:58,754
It's as if two entireIy different strains
of bIood were not onIy present...

447
01:06:58,829 --> 01:07:01,297
but fighting it out for dominance.

448
01:07:04,602 --> 01:07:06,331
I need a cigarette.

449
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:14,636
The foreign strain,
were you abIe to isoIate it?

450
01:07:14,879 --> 01:07:17,370
-It's on another sIide.
-And?

451
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:20,679
The spooky part is...

452
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:23,482
it isn't human bIood.

453
01:07:26,957 --> 01:07:28,481
It's not human.

454
01:07:32,063 --> 01:07:34,623
It's stronger bIood than ours.

455
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:38,396
Very simiIar but more disease-resistant.

456
01:07:38,602 --> 01:07:40,661
-What species?
-I have no idea.

457
01:07:40,738 --> 01:07:43,263
How the heII did it get in Sarah's veins?

458
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,103
-Beats me.
-Now, wait a minute!

459
01:07:45,176 --> 01:07:48,873
-Tom, caIm down.
-CaIm down. Just Iet me....

460
01:07:49,613 --> 01:07:50,773
ExpIain this to me.

461
01:07:50,848 --> 01:07:54,875
You're teIIing us that Sarah has
some weird bIood fouIing up her veins?

462
01:07:54,985 --> 01:07:57,681
-Some inhuman bIood?
-RoII up your sIeeve.

463
01:07:58,456 --> 01:08:01,482
-What?
-RoII up your sIeeve.

464
01:08:04,562 --> 01:08:06,689
-What's that?
-I don't know.

465
01:08:08,065 --> 01:08:09,555
How Iong have you had that?

466
01:08:11,068 --> 01:08:12,057
I don't know.

467
01:08:12,136 --> 01:08:15,435
-You have no idea where you got that?
-None. Look...

468
01:08:16,507 --> 01:08:18,498
CharIie, you said that...

469
01:08:20,177 --> 01:08:22,805
there's a fight between the two strains
for dominance.

470
01:08:22,947 --> 01:08:23,936
Right.

471
01:08:26,851 --> 01:08:28,751
Who's winning, CharIie?

472
01:08:34,525 --> 01:08:37,585
At this moment, my coIIeagues think
that I'm in the office...

473
01:08:37,661 --> 01:08:40,789
of a Ieading bIood speciaIist,
but I decided instead to come here.

474
01:08:40,865 --> 01:08:43,231
-Yes.
-Don't you touch me.

475
01:08:44,135 --> 01:08:46,535
-Sarah?
-What have you done to me?

476
01:08:46,904 --> 01:08:49,737
There's some aIien strain
consuming my bIood.

477
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:51,672
-That's right.
-I know that's right.

478
01:08:51,742 --> 01:08:55,303
What I want to know is, what is it?
Why have you done it?

479
01:08:56,647 --> 01:08:58,114
You're frightened.

480
01:08:58,182 --> 01:08:59,945
You're damn right I'm frightened.

481
01:09:00,017 --> 01:09:02,542
It's naturaI.
You don't know what's happening to you.

482
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:07,080
But there's nothing to be frightened of
as Iong as you put your faith in me...

483
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:09,592
give me time, trust me.

484
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:11,391
Trust you?

485
01:09:12,163 --> 01:09:14,791
I did trust you, and Iook what happened.

486
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:16,992
It's a bruise. It wiII fade.

487
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:21,103
I know it's a bruise.
Look, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

488
01:09:21,205 --> 01:09:23,105
What have you done to me?

489
01:09:23,174 --> 01:09:26,041
I've given you something
you never dared dream of.

490
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:28,442
-What?
-EverIasting Iife.

491
01:09:30,247 --> 01:09:33,683
-If I'd known that, I wouIdn't--
-The bIood in your veins is mine.

492
01:09:33,751 --> 01:09:35,514
-Yours?
-Yes.

493
01:09:37,121 --> 01:09:39,146
Look, I am tired of aII your buIIshit!

494
01:09:39,223 --> 01:09:41,714
I want a straight answer from you.
Do you hear me?

495
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:42,986
Enough!

496
01:10:04,215 --> 01:10:06,206
I made a simpIe incision.

497
01:10:06,283 --> 01:10:09,081
I drew your bIood,
and then you took mine.

498
01:10:10,254 --> 01:10:11,721
You're crazy.

499
01:10:12,122 --> 01:10:14,920
You beIong to me.
We beIong to each other.

500
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,428
I'm getting out of here.

501
01:10:18,696 --> 01:10:20,220
You'II be back.

502
01:10:22,066 --> 01:10:24,398
When the hunger hurts so much
you've Iost reason...

503
01:10:24,468 --> 01:10:28,268
then you'II have to feed,
and then you'II need me to show you how.

504
01:10:28,906 --> 01:10:30,373
You're crazy.

505
01:11:27,097 --> 01:11:29,895
Yes. May I speak
to Dr. Tom Haver, pIease?

506
01:11:35,339 --> 01:11:37,739
What do you mean he's gone home?

507
01:11:39,677 --> 01:11:43,135
No, but he's not there.
I aIready caIIed the apartment.

508
01:11:50,688 --> 01:11:53,555
No, he can't caII me. I'm in a booth.

509
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,287
Yeah, weII....

510
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:03,796
I'II try him Iater or.... Never mind.

511
01:12:14,011 --> 01:12:15,774
Lady, how about it?

512
01:12:22,453 --> 01:12:24,580
Come on, Iady. How about it?

513
01:12:31,428 --> 01:12:33,225
Crazy fucking junkie.

514
01:13:03,894 --> 01:13:06,328
I'm going to bring someone to you.

515
01:13:07,164 --> 01:13:09,564
Someone who can feed your hunger.

516
01:13:15,372 --> 01:13:19,103
<i>This is Dr. Schrader.</i>
<i>l'm unable to take your call just now.</i>

517
01:13:23,547 --> 01:13:27,108
<i>lf you care to leave a message,</i>
<i>kindly wait for the tone.</i>

518
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:32,785
Dr. Schrader, heIIo.

519
01:13:32,856 --> 01:13:36,019
It's Tom Haver caIIing again
about Sarah Roberts.

520
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:41,360
I stiII haven't heard from her.

521
01:13:41,465 --> 01:13:44,559
If you couId give me a caII
when you get in, I'd appreciate it.

522
01:13:44,635 --> 01:13:46,626
I Ieft the number before.

523
01:13:47,938 --> 01:13:50,463
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

524
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:56,602
HeIp yourseIf to a drink.

525
01:15:06,984 --> 01:15:08,849
HeIIo?

526
01:17:42,139 --> 01:17:43,629
Mrs. BIayIock?

527
01:17:43,774 --> 01:17:46,072
<i>-Who is it?</i>
-It's Tom Haver.

528
01:17:46,943 --> 01:17:50,208
<i>-Tom?</i>
-Haver. I'm a friend of Sarah Roberts'.

529
01:17:51,448 --> 01:17:53,780
I'm sorry to disturb you so Iate...

530
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:57,377
<i>but she didn't come home tonight,</i>
<i>and l'm worried.</i>

531
01:17:58,188 --> 01:18:01,817
<i>l just spoke to a doctor that she had</i>
<i>an appointment with this afternoon...</i>

532
01:18:01,892 --> 01:18:03,689
<i>and she never showed.</i>

533
01:18:05,195 --> 01:18:08,426
<i>l know that she was here yesterday,</i>
<i>and l just thought maybe--</i>

534
01:18:08,498 --> 01:18:09,965
Yes, come in.

535
01:18:15,172 --> 01:18:17,037
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

536
01:18:18,909 --> 01:18:21,469
So, I know she was here yesterday...

537
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:24,777
and I just wondered
if you'd heard from her.

538
01:18:24,848 --> 01:18:26,611
Yes. She's upstairs.

539
01:18:29,853 --> 01:18:31,377
She's upstairs?

540
01:18:32,155 --> 01:18:34,180
Dr. Haver, she's not weII.

541
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:35,781
Where upstairs?

542
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:38,419
On the second fIoor, in the bedroom.

543
01:18:43,133 --> 01:18:44,600
What is this?

544
01:18:47,404 --> 01:18:49,201
Come on. Look, Sarah.

545
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:52,837
CaIm down, it's Tom.

546
01:18:54,177 --> 01:18:57,169
You're going to be aII right now.
Come on up on the bed.

547
01:18:58,014 --> 01:19:01,040
That's a girI. Jesus, you're burning up.

548
01:19:01,752 --> 01:19:04,653
You're coId? I'II get you a robe.

549
01:19:10,927 --> 01:19:13,191
Put this around you. Come here.

550
01:19:13,263 --> 01:19:17,063
It's aII right, baby. I'm here.
No, hang on. No.

551
01:19:18,335 --> 01:19:20,030
Wait a minute.

552
01:19:28,411 --> 01:19:29,435
Go!

553
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,174
-What are you taIking about?
-Get out! Go!

554
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:36,447
What the fucking heII? Come here!

555
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,709
Out!

556
01:19:38,088 --> 01:19:41,524
I've got you now.
Where are you going? I got you.

557
01:19:48,598 --> 01:19:52,090
Come on. It's Tom. You're aII right.

558
01:19:52,169 --> 01:19:55,627
I got you. You're aII right now.

559
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,502
You're okay. I got you.

560
01:20:01,745 --> 01:20:03,906
AII right?

561
01:20:07,851 --> 01:20:10,376
I got you. I Iove you.

562
01:20:15,692 --> 01:20:17,057
I Iove you.

563
01:20:22,732 --> 01:20:24,632
You're aII right, baby.

564
01:21:50,687 --> 01:21:53,986
It's not nearIy as difficuIt
as you imagined, is it?

565
01:21:59,996 --> 01:22:03,056
You wiII sIeep six hours in every 24...

566
01:22:03,133 --> 01:22:05,067
you wiII feed one day in seven...

567
01:22:05,135 --> 01:22:07,729
and from this moment,
you wiII never grow oId.

568
01:22:07,804 --> 01:22:09,271
Not a minute.

569
01:22:10,874 --> 01:22:12,842
You'II be young forever.

570
01:22:16,579 --> 01:22:20,174
You're part of me now,
and I cannot Iet you go.

571
01:22:25,855 --> 01:22:28,153
We're damned to Iive forever...

572
01:22:28,658 --> 01:22:31,320
with no reIease, no end.

573
01:22:32,996 --> 01:22:35,487
And I need you to share it with me.

574
01:22:38,435 --> 01:22:41,871
After a IittIe whiIe,
you wiII forget what you were...

575
01:22:42,272 --> 01:22:45,173
and you wiII begin to Iove me
as I Iove you.

576
01:23:04,561 --> 01:23:05,789
Forever.

577
01:23:06,796 --> 01:23:08,423
Forever and ever.

578
01:24:03,787 --> 01:24:04,947
Sarah.

579
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,327
Stay with me.

580
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:15,258
I can't.

581
01:25:52,562 --> 01:25:53,654
John?

582
01:26:39,676 --> 01:26:42,736
I Iove you! I Iove you aII!

583
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,813
-Miriam?
-No!

584
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,504
HeIIo?

585
01:30:15,024 --> 01:30:17,458
-HeIIo?
-Yes?

586
01:30:18,327 --> 01:30:21,296
Lt. AIIegrezza to see Mrs. BIayIock, pIease.

587
01:30:21,497 --> 01:30:22,987
Mrs. BIayIock?

588
01:30:23,766 --> 01:30:25,063
Yeah, she'II remember.

589
01:30:25,134 --> 01:30:27,602
TeII her the gentIeman
about the missing person.

590
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:32,334
I reaIIy don't know what to teII you.
I'm just the agent.

591
01:30:34,143 --> 01:30:36,270
-The agent?
-Arthur JeIinek.

592
01:30:37,113 --> 01:30:40,879
JeIinek ReaIty.
We are handIing the saIe of this house.

593
01:30:43,753 --> 01:30:45,812
-The saIe?
-Yes.

594
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:50,848
I have some cIients upstairs
Iooking the pIace over...

595
01:30:51,661 --> 01:30:54,095
and it aII happened very suddenIy.

596
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,029
It's an estate case.

597
01:30:59,101 --> 01:31:01,797
The whoIe thing was handIed
by a Iaw firm.

598
01:31:01,871 --> 01:31:06,240
My understanding is
that the owners are deceased...

599
01:31:08,144 --> 01:31:10,078
and whatever profits are Ieft over...

600
01:31:10,146 --> 01:31:13,775
are going to some kind of research center
or cIinic in town.

601
01:31:16,219 --> 01:31:17,652
WouId you mind very much?

602
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,188
I don't want my cIients to think
I've deserted them.

603
01:31:20,256 --> 01:31:21,951
WouId you excuse me?

604
01:31:22,024 --> 01:31:23,548
Take your time.

605
01:31:25,161 --> 01:31:26,492
Thank you.

606
