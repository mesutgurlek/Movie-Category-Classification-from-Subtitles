1
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:27,837
- Hi, glad to see you.
- Me too.

2
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:29,246
- Are you okay?
- Super.

3
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,859
Luke, that's my girlfriend, Suzie.

4
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:33,570
Pleased to meet you.

5
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:36,035
You know my sister, Kate.

6
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,671
- You look fit.
- Thanks.

7
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:43,227
- I take it.
- Thanks.

8
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:44,494
Way.

9
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:53,675
You bought a car!

10
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:54,786
No.

11
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:59,230
I was the ready
against travel to Indonesia.

12
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:01,831
We prevent you from working?

13
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:03,346
Good.

14
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,169
It's great to be paid
to navigate around.

15
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,252
Go see Wazza.

16
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,826
The type scruffy on a yacht.

17
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:28,920
- Okay.
- At any hour.

18
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:34,284
- How are you?
- Good.

19
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,829
- And you?
- Okay.

20
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:40,037
- I have stuff to make you come?
- Okay.

21
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:47,776
- Lou is there?
- Yes, back.

22
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:51,241
Lou?

23
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,423
I'm coming.

24
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:00,103
- Impressive, eh?
- Yes.

25
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:02,943
A mako, tiger shark,
a hammerhead shark.

26
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,748
And a great white shark.

27
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,096
- It is from where?
- By.

28
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:10,312
- Here?
- Yes.

29
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:13,776
The white shark is rarely
also north.

30
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,042
No worries.

31
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:18,539
The shark attacks are rare.

32
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,043
Kate, that's Warren.

33
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:29,006
Hello.

34
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,935
- Are you okay?
- Good.

35
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:33,397
- Welcome aboard.
- Not bad.

36
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:37,884
A little messy but that's okay.
I show you the berths.

37
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,895
It brought back memories.

38
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:47,064
That's yours.

39
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:50,819
I brought you something.

40
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:55,639
I wonder what it is.

41
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,432
Thank you.

42
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:08,145
I've missed you.

43
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:13,587
- Sorry.
- It's nothing.

44
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:16,652
- You have someone else?
- No, that's not it ...

45
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:19,810
You wanted to take a break.

46
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,676
Matt wanted me to come.
The idea appealed to me.

47
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:25,060
So it's a holiday?

48
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:27,539
Yes, that's right, vacation.

49
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,271
Okay. That's good.

50
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,612
I must go up.
We will follow the tide.

51
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:37,048
Okay.

52
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:46,623
You just catch it?

53
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:48,929
Yes, there are plenty here.

54
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,082
Cool.

55
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,581
- Are you in Sydney?
- Yes.

56
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,744
My brother and his girlfriend
come from London.

57
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:57,511
- You go in Indonesia?
- Yes.

58
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:02,482
- You work with Luke?
- No, I am a fisherman.

59
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:04,344
That is changing.

60
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:06,886
You already support.

61
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,388
How do you know?

62
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:09,882
He told me about you.

63
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:14,860
We sailed
in the Mediterranean together.

64
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:17,964
That's it, it starts.

65
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:27,601
- Where are we going?
- To Cygnet.

66
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:29,750
It will be this afternoon.

67
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,201
Awesome. How is it?

68
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:34,282
You'll see.

69
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:09,738
It is.

70
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,883
Have fun!

71
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,684
Over.

72
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:03,087
Sorry.

73
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,167
Okay?

74
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:06,310
Yes.

75
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:08,378
Follow me.

76
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:56,810
- So?
- Great.

77
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:03,621
- It's your favorite spot?
- I never came.

78
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,286
- We explore a little?
- Okay.

79
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,613
I found this.

80
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,548
Magnificent.

81
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:24,182
What?

82
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:26,756
I know.

83
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,809
It's purely sexual?

84
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,417
I know.

85
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:35,940
You know what I think?

86
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:37,912
You're afraid.

87
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:39,237
Fear?

88
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,821
What?

89
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:43,359
Me.

90
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,276
You.

91
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,469
Us.

92
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:51,802
No, not you.

93
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,267
What then?

94
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:56,436
I dunno.

95
00:11:57,697 --> 00:11:59,168
I know!

96
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:01,341
Just enjoy the moment.

97
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,053
- That's what I think.
- I do not care what you think.

98
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:09,357
Warren beckons.

99
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:20,194
The tide quickly.

100
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,695
It touches the bottom.

101
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:45,747
Kate, you cast an eye?

102
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,260
The boat sank.

103
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:09,143
- We will be stuck.
- The water recedes quickly.

104
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:11,434
The engine will not start.

105
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:19,236
- It works?
- No.

106
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:22,430
- And there?
- Nothing.

107
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,506
Must weigh anchor.
Kate, you hoist the sail?

108
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:51,137
The way is clear.

109
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:57,131
We went out of business.

110
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:00,013
Thank you, guys.

111
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,016
Wazza, will see the engine.

112
00:14:05,113 --> 00:14:07,874
- Katie, you want the bar?
- Okay.

113
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:09,492
Go straight.

114
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:12,176
That's all right.

115
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:15,239
Who wants to try?

116
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:18,949
Suze?

117
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:20,828
Me?

118
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:22,053
Come.

119
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:23,494
This is an opportunity.

120
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:27,304
Two hands.

121
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:29,027
Good.

122
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:31,403
You maneuvers.

123
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,198
I wanted to see the sun rise.

124
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:15,179
It is superb.

125
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:25,137
I'm sorry for yesterday.

126
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:26,475
Yeah.

127
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:29,248
Me too.

128
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:31,935
It's complicated.

129
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:33,130
Yes.

130
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:36,783
You have no doubts?

131
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:39,221
If full.

132
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:44,906
I've missed you.

133
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,940
I've missed you too.

134
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:54,583
- You hungry?
- I'm hungry.

135
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,315
- Buffet breakfast '?
- Please.

136
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:33,149
Matt! Warren!

137
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:43,636
Okay?

138
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,674
Go out, poured.

139
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:47,776
Where is Matt?

140
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:06,773
Mattie? Warren?

141
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:12,421
Okay?
Go out, I'll get Matt.

142
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:14,285
Get out.

143
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:18,680
Follow me.
Breathe deeply.

144
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,199
Where is Matt?

145
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,251
Here!

146
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:40,836
I'm here.

147
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:44,890
It stuck.

148
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:04,079
Matt here.

149
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,566
- Okay.
- Follow me.

150
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,146
- You okay?
- Yes.

151
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,335
Okay?

152
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,567
Out of the water.

153
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:27,918
Okay.

154
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,620
Must be pushed.

155
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:41,761
Climbs.

156
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,751
Who's next?

157
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:49,542
You hold me?

158
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:55,346
Monte.

159
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,419
- Okay, Suze?
- Yes.

160
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,130
Damn.

161
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,770
Look.
The hull is torn.

162
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:20,376
Okay?

163
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:25,391
- What happened?
- I know.

164
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:26,737
It hit something.

165
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,921
A reef. A whale.

166
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:40,137
The boat is finished.

167
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,711
We should not stop there.

168
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,865
Because of the current.

169
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,267
It moves us away from shore.

170
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:09,590
The boat is finished.

171
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:11,972
It will not float long.

172
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:15,136
When it will sink,

173
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,522
we will even further.

174
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:21,244
- It will not sink.
- There was no EPIRB?

175
00:20:21,364 --> 00:20:24,485
- What is it?
- The distress beacon.

176
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:26,310
It is old.

177
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:29,973
No plane will capture
the signal.

178
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:31,387
How do you know?

179
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,785
You saw planes go?

180
00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:59,840
I speak not to join
the continent.

181
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,988
An island will do.

182
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:05,863
No.

183
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,071
- What are you doing?
- I orient myself with the sun.

184
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:15,107
It uses the dial.

185
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,331
The North is there.

186
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:23,625
There.

187
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:27,993
It's here.
Turtle Island is here.

188
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:31,179
We will not go straight
due to a reef here.

189
00:21:31,886 --> 00:21:34,898
Going north
the course will lead us to the island.

190
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:39,821
We must swim on what distance?

191
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:42,952
15 or 20 km.

192
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:45,043
Good luck.

193
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:49,343
I know this corner.
Not go into the water.

194
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:53,879
You think it's safer here?
We do not know what he has in the water.

195
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:56,135
I intend to discuss it.

196
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:59,930
Not go into the water.

197
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,616
Yes, there may be
sharks.

198
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,734
I dunno.

199
00:22:09,854 --> 00:22:12,173
But there
of land there.

200
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:14,257
The longer you stay, the more it recedes.

201
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:18,856
Can swim
to save our skin.

202
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:21,300
While we are a force.

203
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:24,361
Or stay here
and hope does not sink.

204
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:26,889
Count on for help.

205
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:29,871
They must come quickly.

206
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,824
Or we die dehydrated.

207
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:44,377
I swim too well,
I do not do it.

208
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,027
Me either.

209
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,943
Okay.

210
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:49,532
Very good.

211
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:52,052
I'll find something
help us.

212
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:58,598
A helping hand?

213
00:22:58,718 --> 00:23:00,853
I'll pass what I think.

214
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:12,322
Okay?

215
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:14,593
Yes.

216
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:34,149
We saw something.
There.

217
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:36,826
- What?
- I dunno, it was big.

218
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,942
Well, gotta find the EPIRB.

219
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,964
At least one large shark,
do not tell me.

220
00:26:06,327 --> 00:26:07,764
At right away.

221
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,115
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

222
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:47,226
You know the trigger?

223
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:49,595
Good.

224
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:51,447
Super.

225
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,096
Try this.

226
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:04,363
- For you.
- Thanks.

227
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:07,934
What?

228
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:11,346
It's like a seal.

229
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:13,848
Sharks love it.

230
00:29:16,114 --> 00:29:18,436
If you want to come,
it looks at you.

231
00:29:19,143 --> 00:29:21,282
But does not frighten the others.

232
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:27,997
We should wait.

233
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:33,572
As you see.

234
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,597
Look, it's a difficult decision.

235
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:42,292
Was unlikely to be found.

236
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,169
The boat will sink.

237
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,896
Very soon.

238
00:29:47,747 --> 00:29:50,662
There is an island.
We should go.

239
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,141
I'm going with Luke.

240
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:27,410
Me too.

241
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:36,491
This is for you.

242
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:54,225
Want. Take that.

243
00:30:54,757 --> 00:30:56,467
And for you.

244
00:30:59,347 --> 00:31:00,692
I'm not.

245
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:04,932
I stay here.

246
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:06,930
It's better than staying.

247
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:09,561
Go on an island
you can not see?

248
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,031
Okay.

249
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:38,983
This is for you.

250
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:40,275
Thank you.

251
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:42,068
Are you sure?

252
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,483
Okay.

253
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,989
We will send relief.

254
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:00,901
- Okay.
- Ira?

255
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,669
See you soon.

256
00:32:05,703 --> 00:32:07,112
See you soon.

257
00:32:10,818 --> 00:32:12,717
- See you there.
- Okay.

258
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:18,514
What are you doing?

259
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:22,131
He knows the ocean
better than all of us.

260
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,852
Come with us.

261
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:26,249
I can not.

262
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,288
I really can not.

263
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,162
Goodbye, Sis.

264
00:32:47,114 --> 00:32:48,617
Let's go.

265
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:52,052
- Sleep on it.
- Promised not worry.

266
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:23,693
Okay?

267
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,546
Well, it is grouped.

268
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:29,141
It promises to be lengthy.

269
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,220
We must find our rhythm.

270
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,162
And we will succeed.

271
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:37,109
Afterwards we can relax.

272
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,848
It will deserve.

273
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,501
Let's go.

274
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:37,950
Listen!

275
00:34:39,427 --> 00:34:42,023
- You make too many waves.
- Did you see anything?

276
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:42,946
No.

277
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:45,346
Wait!

278
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:47,034
I come with you!

279
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:02,398
Come with us.

280
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:05,551
No.

281
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,647
Are you sure?

282
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:10,183
C'mon, that's okay.

283
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:44,656
It's crazy.

284
00:35:45,363 --> 00:35:48,106
- I hope you're right.
- You're not alone.

285
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:52,603
Do not worry, we will get there.

286
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,308
We will succeed.

287
00:35:57,853 --> 00:35:58,855
Take that.

288
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:02,170
- You sure?
- Yes, we share that.

289
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:03,918
Thank you.

290
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,917
We all tired.

291
00:37:05,888 --> 00:37:07,961
Let us focus on our goal.

292
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:13,858
Imagine a luxury yacht
waiting for us on the island.

293
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:16,382
Or that I find my bed.

294
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:23,038
I always my last resort.

295
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:23,948
What?

296
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:29,568
When I'm at the gym,

297
00:37:29,688 --> 00:37:32,323
I'm trying to beat the pain

298
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:36,579
I guess I make love.

299
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:44,136
You think about kissing
when you lift free weights?

300
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:47,657
Not only to kiss.
Also the preliminaries.

301
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,724
I forget them?

302
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:53,523
It is not common.

303
00:37:55,337 --> 00:37:56,933
Stop!

304
00:37:57,586 --> 00:37:58,944
The not listen!

305
00:38:02,516 --> 00:38:03,769
What's that?

306
00:38:04,837 --> 00:38:05,734
What?

307
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,039
What's this?

308
00:38:47,963 --> 00:38:49,282
I see nothing.

309
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:53,553
It must be a school of fish.

310
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,933
- What are they doing?
- I know.

311
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:05,111
Continue.

312
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:10,871
Come on.

313
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:09,944
What is it?

314
00:40:11,012 --> 00:40:12,449
It looks like a shell.

315
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:16,805
- A turtle's shell.
- You're right.

316
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:18,743
A turtle?

317
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,176
Are we here.

318
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,209
Come on, Suze.

319
00:42:04,462 --> 00:42:06,292
We can not stay there.

320
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:10,589
Come.

321
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:13,527
No question of extending the legs.

322
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,929
I can not.

323
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:17,405
I understand.

324
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:19,044
Listen.

325
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:22,627
We must go.
I'll stay behind you.

326
00:42:22,747 --> 00:42:24,046
Okay?

327
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,155
I stay near you.

328
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:31,685
You okay?

329
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:45,955
It was huge.

330
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:47,837
You amaze me!

331
00:45:30,505 --> 00:45:31,494
What is it?

332
00:45:34,092 --> 00:45:35,002
What?

333
00:45:35,122 --> 00:45:37,459
I saw something there.

334
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:40,347
I see nothing.

335
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:43,934
You make me mad scared.

336
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:45,534
What has he?

337
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:47,777
- There is something.
- We gotta go.

338
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:50,506
- Something is following us.
- We are in the ocean.

339
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:53,328
It teems with life
but we must go.

340
00:45:54,673 --> 00:45:56,506
We need to go.

341
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:58,004
Go.

342
00:45:58,124 --> 00:46:00,377
Here we go. All is well.

343
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:01,314
There!

344
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,278
- Listen ...
- I saw a big thing!

345
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,994
- What do you see?
- I know!

346
00:46:10,377 --> 00:46:11,339
Look.

347
00:46:23,023 --> 00:46:24,883
I see nothing.

348
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,450
There.

349
00:47:06,482 --> 00:47:09,136
- Did you see anything?
- Possibly.

350
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:11,143
I told you so!

351
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,378
- A shark?
- I know.

352
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:17,194
Continue to advance.

353
00:48:24,904 --> 00:48:26,526
It's a shark.

354
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:27,990
- Major?
- Yes.

355
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,797
Remain grouped.

356
00:48:50,892 --> 00:48:52,450
I see it.

357
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:57,307
Stay together.

358
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,841
You see?

359
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:19,243
He had to leave.
I see more.

360
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:30,750
Let's go.

361
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:32,741
Must go there.

362
00:50:33,901 --> 00:50:35,260
This way.

363
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:08,248
Good.

364
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:10,557
I see more.
He's gone.

365
00:51:11,203 --> 00:51:13,128
It's gone.

366
00:51:13,248 --> 00:51:14,824
Calm down.

367
00:51:14,944 --> 00:51:16,681
It's over.

368
00:51:16,953 --> 00:51:18,493
You must stay calm.

369
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:21,211
Calm down. All is well.

370
00:52:15,144 --> 00:52:16,608
Breathe with me.

371
00:52:17,215 --> 00:52:18,771
Breathe.

372
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,917
It's right, left,
you fear nothing.

373
00:52:23,497 --> 00:52:25,093
Breathes well.

374
00:52:30,423 --> 00:52:33,061
It's good like that.

375
00:53:53,178 --> 00:53:54,471
There he is!

376
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:59,950
Go!

377
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:05,307
He ate my leg!
Go!

378
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:08,063
Understood?
I lost a leg.

379
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:11,109
You understand?
You have to leave.

380
00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:12,521
Go.

381
00:54:13,312 --> 00:54:16,226
Swim, I'm done.
You have to leave.

382
00:54:16,346 --> 00:54:17,411
I'll be fine.

383
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:20,678
- He'll be back!
- Look at me.

384
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:25,165
Soon he will return.

385
00:54:40,669 --> 00:54:42,581
Come on, wake up.

386
00:54:42,976 --> 00:54:45,732
I beg you, wake up!

387
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:54,393
Wake up! Pity!

388
00:55:04,815 --> 00:55:06,754
Not stop there!

389
00:55:08,567 --> 00:55:10,268
I love you ...

390
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,832
Come!

391
00:56:04,073 --> 00:56:05,563
Come on.

392
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,267
Advance.

393
00:56:48,642 --> 00:56:50,185
You said something?

394
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,988
You said something?

395
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:09,146
He'll be back, eh?

396
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:14,787
Is not it?

397
00:57:17,069 --> 00:57:19,416
You said that there would
in three hours.

398
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:24,439
What next?
It is in the middle of the ocean!

399
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,576
At night!

400
00:57:27,697 --> 00:57:29,441
We should not have to listen to you.

401
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:31,933
We should have stayed with Warren.

402
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:34,162
Now Matt is dead!

403
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:36,348
And soon we!

404
00:57:36,468 --> 00:57:38,699
It is damn!
Completely fucked!

405
00:57:46,409 --> 00:57:48,440
I'm sorry for Matt.

406
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,731
And sorry for everything.

407
00:57:57,977 --> 00:57:59,921
Luke is not your fault.

408
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,559
You're there for nothing!

409
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:05,397
We chose to come.

410
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:12,007
I'll be fine.

411
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,502
I'll be fine.

412
00:58:23,705 --> 00:58:25,142
What was that?

413
00:58:43,762 --> 00:58:45,252
Regroup.

414
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:56,320
I want to die. Pity!

415
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:02,092
Save us!

416
01:00:13,532 --> 01:00:14,524
Look.

417
01:00:25,396 --> 01:00:27,189
Look.

418
01:01:04,643 --> 01:01:07,544
Be careful.
It is very sharp.

419
01:01:37,852 --> 01:01:40,208
It's good to get out of the water.

420
01:01:47,056 --> 01:01:49,519
Turtle Island is not.

421
01:01:50,284 --> 01:01:52,341
But it's mainland.

422
01:02:02,272 --> 01:02:04,277
Leave.

423
01:03:23,976 --> 01:03:25,480
I hurt everywhere.

424
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:27,735
Me too.

425
01:03:59,282 --> 01:04:00,126
What?

426
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:02,776
I know.

427
01:04:22,473 --> 01:04:23,792
Stand back.

428
01:04:33,441 --> 01:04:34,773
It's a dolphin!

429
01:04:57,656 --> 01:05:01,315
It is moving fast.
The current must carry us.

430
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:03,860
The current helps us finally.

431
01:05:17,686 --> 01:05:18,979
This is the dolphin?

432
01:07:07,448 --> 01:07:08,965
Damn ...

433
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:16,253
It's good, come on.

434
01:07:44,822 --> 01:07:46,009
Lord ...

435
01:07:49,147 --> 01:07:50,838
Poor Suzie.

436
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,826
This is the same, eh?

437
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:12,492
I think so.

438
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:14,933
That's him.

439
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,644
There is another reef.

440
01:08:34,317 --> 01:08:35,939
We should go.

441
01:09:57,677 --> 01:09:59,510
Go!

442
01:10:24,848 --> 01:10:25,982
Come.

443
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:30,136
- Let's go.
- I can not ...

444
01:11:43,206 --> 01:11:44,987
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

445
01:12:00,186 --> 01:12:02,005
My foot is bleeding.

446
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:07,554
Shit.

447
01:12:23,344 --> 01:12:24,372
Sorry.

448
01:12:36,008 --> 01:12:36,984
Thank you.

449
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,044
It's nothing.

450
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:44,055
I love you, Luke.

451
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:51,958
Me too, I love you.

452
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:15,563
Ready?

453
01:13:15,972 --> 01:13:17,172
No.

454
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,192
Me either.

455
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:24,867
Let's go.

456
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:25,117
Swim!

457
01:16:25,355 --> 01:16:26,410
Hurry!

458
01:17:13,143 --> 01:17:14,818
Climb!

459
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:17,125
Go!

460
01:17:19,345 --> 01:17:20,281
Hurry!

461
01:17:20,743 --> 01:17:22,141
I can not do!

462
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:34,264
Shoot!

463
01:17:35,253 --> 01:17:36,453
Hoisted me!

464
01:17:37,204 --> 01:17:38,932
Back me!

465
01:17:39,215 --> 01:17:40,335
Shoot!

466
01:18:23,837 --> 01:18:24,905
Come back!

467
01:18:25,025 --> 01:18:26,790
I beg you!
