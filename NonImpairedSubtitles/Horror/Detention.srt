1
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,670
I'm Taylor Fisher and I'm a bitch.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,143
Beauty, intelligence, talent,
charisma, Hoobastank.

3
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,247
What? They're good.

4
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,016
Indie rock trends do move fast.

5
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,055
Today, my alarm is set
to the Drunges.

6
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,695
But by the time
you actually watch this...

7
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,661
...they'll be headlining a toilet
in Toledo with mops.

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,391
Hey, bitch, that's not cool.

9
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,168
Eat cock!

10
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,342
Hello, Taylor.
It's Don. Don Waters, again.

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,343
We made out behind the Pizza Pitt.
You tasted the deep dish.

12
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,345
Not deep enough.

13
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,444
Get out of the bathroom.

14
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:56,611
You're ruining my life, you **** ****
**** **** fucking Ecstasy baby!

15
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,917
-I'm peeing.
-Taylor, hi, Singe Gupta.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,458
I very much liked our calculus date
at Pizza Pitt.

17
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:06,996
Loser. Your parabolic graph was bent
and I only got a B.

18
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,867
French toast?

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,038
Mom, I'm on a no-bread diet.

20
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,069
-Since when?
-Since now!

21
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,243
Oh, I hate you! I hope you die!

22
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,969
Taylor, what we did at Pizza Pitt....

23
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,581
Word of advice,
there's always new toothpaste.

24
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,944
Don't swallow. Spit.

25
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,427
Cinderhella II: Beauty Scream opened
this week at the Galaxy Pines Mall.

26
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,756
If you're anyone who's anyone
in Grizzly Lake, you'll go see it.

27
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,762
Moscow Hyatt is my idol.

28
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,458
This brings me to something I call:

29
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,796
Taylor Fisher's Guide
to Not Being a Total Reject.

30
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,101
One, go see Cinderhella II
on Friday night, loser.

31
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,609
Taylor, honey, I'm leaving.
Hurry or we'll be late.

32
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,008
Mom, I'm doing something important!

33
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,911
You're a monster!

34
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,142
I'll be in the car.

35
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,479
Fuck a duck!

36
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,816
Let me montage this
to speed things up.

37
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,708
What now?

38
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,187
Love Pizza Pitt.

39
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,447
Who are you?

40
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,557
Your biggest fan.

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,783
Rad.

42
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,690
Bitch, going to kill you.

43
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,694
-Okay.
-Okay....

44
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,129
Stalkers are so 201 1.

45
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,201
Get out of my room, you pedophile!

46
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,810
Where is she?

47
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,216
The girl gets away with everything.

48
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,402
Life sucks.

49
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,548
Nice. That's just awesome.

50
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,744
I try to remember
I'm only the second-biggest loser...

51
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,253
...to walk Grizzly Lake High.

52
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:48,689
First place goes to the drunk slut who
screwed the dead mascot in 1 992.

53
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,922
But the '90s are history. So am l.

54
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,317
Oh, my God, I love this song.

55
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,950
Shit!

56
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,694
No, no, no, no.

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,233
Shit.

58
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,798
This is the fifth sighting of
mysterious objects over Grizzly Lake.

59
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,636
Authorities speculate an elaborate
hoax perpetuated by high-school....

60
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,010
Dad, I forgot the bus leaves early
on Wednesdays. Can you drive me?

61
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,717
Sure, hon.

62
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,451
Nope, still drunk.

63
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,863
Yo, Heather Mills.

64
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,440
You're robbing me?
I didn't even know lceland had crime.

65
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,804
Stop generalizing. I stole this shirt.

66
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,480
-And the leather shoes?
-Vegetarian?

67
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,845
"Vegetarianism is the taproot
of humanitarianism." Tolstoy.

68
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,384
Give me your iPod, salad eater.

69
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,688
-It's a fucking shuffle.
-I make 6.55 an hour.

70
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,384
Yeah. Thanks, anyway.

71
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,620
I'm too old for this shit.

72
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,191
It's not my fault majoring
in lnuit Literature and Hipster Rock...

73
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,996
-...doesn't replenish your trust fund.
-I listen to Aerosmith.

74
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,009
-Hey, Clapton.
-Hey, Clapton.

75
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,916
-Hey.
-Go left.

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,087
Where is Clapton Davis?

77
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,933
Other way.

78
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,221
Who gave Riley the permission
to have the hots for Clapton?

79
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,086
Did falling off the ugly tree
knock a dream into her head?

80
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:12,590
Why doom a win like Clapton Davis
to a life of missionary sex?

81
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,903
Nice save, Truman.

82
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,134
Think you can hook me up
with Alexis at prom?

83
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,971
Yeah, no problem!

84
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,512
This bear's been deceased
since the Nixon Administration...

85
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,383
...yet exerts
an extraordinary magnetic field.

86
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,495
Toshiba, you're either the smartest kid
in school or the weirdest.

87
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,098
Mimi, wait. Wait, Mimi. No.

88
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,235
I know it looks like
such a lighthearted...

89
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,337
...feel-good comedy
being an expecting teenage mom.

90
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,771
Let me tell you something. I've been
principal at this school for five years.

91
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,707
Let me tell both of you something.

92
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:05,410
Pregnant teenagers
are never funny. Ever.

93
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,919
I'm not pregnant.

94
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,144
Cut the carbs.

95
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,854
Attention, Grizzly Lake High.

96
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,285
-Hey, Kayla.
-Hey, Vicky.

97
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,520
Skank ho.

98
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,166
Your vote for prom king and queen
is now due.

99
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,894
Winners win a Pizza Pitt coupon.
Go Grizzly.

100
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:31,543
Tomorrow, the Grizzly Lake Bears will
play the Town Creek Beavers at pub.

101
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,211
Hey, Clapton.

102
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,850
Ione, did you tell Billy about us?

103
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,855
Clapton, the small guy always beats
the invincible killing machine.

104
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,649
You're my Pat Morita.

105
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,554
Isn't he dead?

106
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,323
Duck.

107
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,366
Verge.

108
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,539
Get a life, punk.

109
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,231
This is ugly.

110
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,724
Three o'clock. Parking lot.

111
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,422
Winner wins lone. Loser wins....

112
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,099
-lone?
-Shut up!

113
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,899
Just make sure your dumb ass
is there, dumb-ass!

114
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,244
Really, Clapton? If you're gonna get
your limbs ripped off...

115
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,387
...find a more worthy charity
than lone.

116
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,088
Ione likes Sting.

117
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,418
Clapton Davis,
you are more concept than reality.

118
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,161
I just mean that it looks like
Clapton's gonna ask out Ione...

119
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,737
...which makes about as much sense
as that stupid movie Torque.

120
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,805
So, what do you think
about you and me?

121
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,239
Have you even thought about prom?

122
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,312
Hey, Sander. I saw your dad's dick
on Chatroulette last night.

123
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,175
Yes, Sander, I'm a girl.

124
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,079
Forget about genocide,
poverty and political corruption.

125
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,914
What could possibly be on
my girl mind other than prom?

126
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,487
Totally right, lone.

127
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,353
-Sting is the Bruno Mars of 1 992.
-You're so funny.

128
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,688
-Why do you think I'd go with him?
-No reason.

129
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:36,432
Have you ever noticed that
we have compatible facial features?

130
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,330
Riley, don't delay the inevitable.

131
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,366
You know in three days,
we're gonna be prom dates...

132
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,771
...and the sex and shame
will be fleeting.

133
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,469
Look, get off my nuts, all right?

134
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,778
Hey, Riley, I don't wanna hear
about your testicles.

135
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,452
The assignment is simple.
You're a smart girl.

136
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,851
Use what you've learned this semester
about quantum physics...

137
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,322
...and build me a time machine
so I can get out of here.

138
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,690
-So hot.
-Sander, we have to finish this.

139
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,663
Then stop messing
with that bear claw.

140
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,666
I took it from the mascot. Strange.

141
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,533
Someone wired this with organic,
super-conduction Mimis--

142
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,708
-MagMimis-- Magnets.
-God.

143
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,309
Come on.
Toshiba, I mean, look at Clapton's.

144
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,671
It's got a clock-looking thing, okay?
I wanna pass this course.

145
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,182
Then do something. If I fail science,
I'm stuck with you next year...

146
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,479
...in the Remedial History
of the Jelly Bean.

147
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,554
-I love jelly beans.
-Slacker.

148
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,557
That's hilarious. What is it?

149
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,161
I don't know. It looks like a bong.

150
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,066
Well, Clapton...

151
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,229
...I'm wet.

152
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,592
I get it.

153
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,926
Listening to your loud music.
Tripping out to Fraggle Rock.

154
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:22,301
But the question is,
what does the future hold...

155
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,772
...for Clapton Davis?

156
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,775
Well, I am starting
my own music site.

157
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,315
It'll list new releases
and review albums...

158
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,279
...from bands
that nobody has heard of.

159
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,249
If they have, I'll dismiss them
with scathing comparisons...

160
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,217
...to avant-garde folk rockers.

161
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,414
Everything is graded on
a 1 00-point scale.

162
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,217
-No place for feedback.
-Excellent.

163
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,625
Readers can bitch on their Twitters.
Good taste is not a democracy.

164
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,996
And this pays what, 1 3.5 a year?

165
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,264
Free Costello tickets.

166
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:04,772
Do you think that I am
teaching students out of love?

167
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,144
I'm not.

168
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:12,654
It's your senior year
and your GPA is....

169
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,758
It's a disgrace.

170
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,353
But I'd rather not see you
back here next fall.

171
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,761
Give me an excuse to graduate you.

172
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,764
Impress me.

173
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,671
Get an A. Save a small country.
Something.

174
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,204
Anything.

175
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,706
Otherwise, get expelled...

176
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:36,473
...with the lowest grades
in Grizzly Lake history.

177
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,878
Does Home Ec count?

178
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,850
Get your shit together, son.

179
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,526
I make 40 g's a year plus dental.
You may not have a Skittle.

180
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,636
Thanks, Mr. Kendall.

181
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
Princess?

182
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,376
-lone.
-Looks like Taylor's absent.

183
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,914
You'll be head cheerleader for
the Grizzly Lake Bear playoff game.

184
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,385
Don't do that.

185
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,986
You there!

186
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,213
-Riley.
-Sure you are, Crutches.

187
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,324
You'll have to be
the Grizzly Lake bear.

188
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,517
Mascot?

189
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:26,323
Wearing the bear suit is a privilege
enjoyed by a few. Put it on.

190
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,295
Time to get serious, dude.

191
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,336
-ls this real fur?
-That goes for you too.

192
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,904
-Don't you mess this up!
-I won't, Mr. Cooper.

193
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,200
You're as funny
as Bronson Pinchot.

194
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,742
Let me hear you growl!

195
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,914
Attack!

196
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,408
Typecast.

197
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,765
One and two! Feel it, whoo!

198
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,369
That's the spirit, lone.

199
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,939
I was wondering when Freedom
Williams would make a comeback!

200
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,616
-F in dodgeball too.
-You suck!

201
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,450
Road House?

202
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,991
Patrick Swayze didn't get Kelly Lynch
without ripping some throats first.

203
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:33,460
-I need to study if I'm gonna fight Billy.
-You can't be planning on fighting him.

204
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,659
Three o'clock, Clapton!
You're fucking dead!

205
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,929
Well, I guess he still likes lone.

206
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,938
Never underestimate the appeal
of stupid, cute things.

207
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,905
The girl's a moron. But you don't--?
You don't have a thing for her, do you?

208
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:53,312
Sander, lone's an old soul trapped in
a very painfully hot cheerleader body.

209
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,011
She knows the "Fields of Gold" lyrics.
Every little thing she does is magic.

210
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,190
-Believe it.
-I believe in things I can see.

211
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,484
I believe in violence.

212
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:06,256
I believe in trees,
mortgages and albinos.

213
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,265
Wet T-shirt.

214
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,029
Patrick Swayze was only
an action star for three years.

215
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,368
Steven Seagal is a lifelong Buddhist
and a deadly master of aikido.

216
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,136
Wrong. Mullet beats ponytails.

217
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,547
Red shirt.

218
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,689
What if that innocent cow
was your son?

219
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,189
Or your daughter?

220
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,457
Now, scientists don't know
whether fish feel pain...

221
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,226
...so some vegetarians
still eat salmon and stuff.

222
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:48,702
But do you know how much pigs
or, like, veal suffer?

223
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,707
Is the only reason they live
just to be killed?

224
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,469
Meat is murder.

225
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,083
Nice work, Riley.

226
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:04,085
Now, for the counter-argument,
we turn to Gord.

227
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,382
Gord is our Canadian
exchange student...

228
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,890
...from Lunenburg, Nova Scotia...

229
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,222
...where I hear the salmon
is delicious.

230
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,420
Gord?

231
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:17,898
Yes, I'd like to start off by saying
that this girl's argument is ridiculous.

232
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,936
Vegetarians who eat fish
are hypocrites.

233
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,576
She thinks because fish may feel
no pain, they don't value their lives.

234
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:29,111
Absurd. And notice how she expresses
almost no sympathy for chickens.

235
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,782
That's because Americans
hate chickens.

236
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,918
For example,
KFC serves popcorn chicken...

237
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,612
...to assure the customers
that the chicken was blown to bits...

238
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:42,419
...yet the meatball sub at Subway
isn't called "popcorn cow."

239
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,096
Americans want chickens to die.

240
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,289
Lame! Personally,
I do feel sympathy for animals...

241
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,435
...which is why I choose
to only eat baby animals.

242
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,538
They have not lived as long
and are not leaving as much behind.

243
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:59,137
Baby clams, chicken wings,
baby seals, no big loss.

244
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,443
If we don't eat meat,
we lose our place in the food chain.

245
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,242
Eating animals gives us confidence
as humans.

246
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,987
Vegetarians like this girl,
who is only wearing one shoe...

247
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,281
...have less confidence
than everybody else.

248
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,549
Thank you, class. Ms. Maclntire.

249
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,920
Very well researched, Gord.

250
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,459
And, yes, it's true.

251
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,430
Teenagers need self-confidence.

252
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:35,479
Clamato: the only animal-mammal
beverage at the grocery store.

253
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,110
Which is too bad, because I could
really go for some carbonated dolphin.

254
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,980
Why must you interrupt
my solitude...

255
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,247
...in the worst day of the worst life
in Grizzly Lake history?

256
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,324
-You're not the girl who fucked a bear.
-That was 20 years ago.

257
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,324
And she was a pervert.
I'm a mascot.

258
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,157
It's one rank lower
on the social ladder.

259
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,959
It's true.
I've been thinking about stuff.

260
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,635
Nudity, mostly.

261
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,360
You know, we don't talk much...

262
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,870
...but I like to believe we've been
sort of friends for a while.

263
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,076
Arguable, but not outlandish.

264
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,346
Okay, this human-conversation thing
is not working for you. Let's text.

265
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,349
You better not sext me.

266
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,815
Not interested in the rules.

267
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,180
Yeah, I figured.

268
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,323
Courtship, social ethics,
what people think.

269
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,992
Very true. You're right.

270
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,855
-Sorry, that was for Clapton.
-What the frig!

271
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,759
You know what?
Let's get it over with.

272
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,059
-Let's have sex.
-I'm only gonna say this once.

273
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,033
Do not become the bad guy
in the pregnancy-scare video.

274
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:37,197
Playful banter is just a sign of
a healthy, caring communi-- Hold on.

275
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:43,206
If you go sit somewhere else, we can
maybe go back to being sort of friends.

276
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,819
-Mind if I sit here?
-Free country.

277
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,772
Every day, you and I stand in
this hallway and no one notices.

278
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:21,011
We're just hollow and useless...

279
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,386
...and stuffed full of crap
nobody will ever see.

280
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,722
I know who you are.

281
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,922
You're me.

282
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,357
Well, let's go.

283
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,969
I mean, "Gonna Make You Sweat"?

284
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,470
They let her get away
with making that look cool?

285
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,769
And then I'm beaten by a Canadian
on the ethics of eating animals...

286
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,540
...which makes no sense because
Canadians are supposed to be nice.

287
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,277
See you, Clapton Davis.

288
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,453
Hope my soundtrack
comes out on vinyl.

289
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:30,044
Little dudes like you get worked.

290
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,648
Let's see your teeth.
For dental records.

291
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,082
Yeah, the next time you go
to the dentist and look at an x-ray...

292
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:40,189
...it will be a picture
of your head flying off.

293
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,720
-Shit. Get that molar.
-Somebody's trying to kill me!

294
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,487
Join the club.

295
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,562
Get out of my face, dude.

296
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,224
Leave him alone, Nolan. We get it.
Your dick is bigger, all right?

297
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,562
Wait, how do you know?

298
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,501
Clapton, you're my Ralph Macchio.
Do the crane thing.

299
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,072
I like you, lone,
but you're really weird.

300
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,211
If your face hurts my fist...

301
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,915
...I will punch you again harder.

302
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,385
-Everyone take a step back.
-Hang on! I was here first.

303
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,188
Listen up, folks.

304
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,451
Your classmate Taylor Fisher...

305
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,753
...was murdered in her bedroom
this morning.

306
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,898
-What?
-I know this comes as a shock.

307
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,329
We're gonna need to speak
to some of you in turn.

308
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:27,266
-I was just attacked!
-Sure you were, honey.

309
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,042
The violent death of 17-year-old
Taylor Fisher...

310
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,049
...has shaken the town
of Grizzly Lake.

311
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,949
Fisher, a beloved
Bears cheerleader...

312
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,823
... was getting ready for school
when an intruder stabbed--

313
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,460
Jason Lawrence said
he saw blue lights in the sky...

314
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,688
...and then mysteriously was
compelled to eat three cans of tuna...

315
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,560
...a food he typically hates.

316
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,269
Fuck everybody.

317
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:16,201
-You ever do any rave drugs?
-A rave? What is this, 1 996?

318
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,433
This attacker you're describing,
Ms. Jones...

319
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,009
-...sounds just like that horror film.
-Cinderhella.

320
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:22,645
Scream.

321
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,974
Cinderhella is only a movie.
It can't hurt you.

322
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,549
-You know that?
-I don't know. See the first one?

323
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,721
You're under the belief that
she attacked you? Cinderhella?

324
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,117
Look, I am not a retarded
Neve Campbell, okay?

325
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,259
Obviously, it was someone
dressed like her.

326
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,952
-You nuked the fridge with that one.
-I'm sorry. I don't speak fanboy.

327
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:43,100
Call if anything else comes to mind
or happens to you.

328
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,963
Yeppers, I'll be sure to call you
when I'm murdered.

329
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:50,232
Hey. A girl at your school is dead,
for real.

330
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,966
Think about that.

331
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,311
Iron Man. Now, that's a movie.

332
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,572
Iron Man was fucking PG-1 3.

333
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,808
Does this sound fucking PG-1 3
to you?

334
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,816
Worst motive ever.

335
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,093
What, you think I'm making this up?

336
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,595
Come on, Riley,
there's nobody else here.

337
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,870
Show me.

338
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,671
Whoever's trying to kill me knows
that Cinderhella is a huge cliché.

339
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,937
They know I know
nobody would believe me.

340
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,679
It's a conspiracy
to get everyone to think...

341
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,649
...I'm a total loser making preemptive,
mid-'90s pop references.

342
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,879
Yeah, it's all coming
to an end anyways.

343
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,819
-Translation?
-Our lives.

344
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,790
This summer everyone in
Grizzly Lake is going to college...

345
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,828
...to incubate their degrees,
get knocked up at a kegger...

346
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,523
...and come back here to populate
one of these homes...

347
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:53,295
...with tiny little versions of themselves.
These are our final days.

348
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,036
Turn.

349
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,536
What about your whole
music-criticism thing?

350
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:03,976
You'll beat the odds.
You always do, Clapton Davis.

351
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,379
Billy wants to eBay pieces of my face
and Verge is gonna fail me...

352
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,485
...unless I get an A
or save the universe.

353
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,248
Both equally improbable scenarios.

354
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,846
Duck.

355
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,154
You know, the whole cynic act
doesn't really fit on you.

356
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,728
Can't change anything.

357
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:23,230
Now is all we got. It's not cynicism.
I think now is pretty rad.

358
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:27,166
Except one girl's dead and the other's
waiting for the noose to tighten.

359
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,238
No.

360
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,337
I'm talking about now, me and you.

361
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,777
Look around. What don't you see?

362
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,649
Cinderhella?

363
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,277
Ione.

364
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,916
Get over yourself. Seriously.

365
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,218
My cast comes off tomorrow.

366
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,195
-Wanna take me dancing?
-Clapton don't dance.

367
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,128
Right, unless lone's playing Oasis.

368
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,495
More Grizzly Lake kids
were conceived to Oasis...

369
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:02,161
...than any other Beatles cover band.
Definitely Maybe is British Rohypnol.

370
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,165
Eyes glazing.

371
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:09,408
I made plans to see a movie
with lone tomorrow night.

372
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,749
Make room for a third wheel.

373
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,129
Cinderhella, please. No.

374
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,891
Why are you crying?

375
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,461
This is the happiest night of your life.
You're prom queen.

376
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,731
It didn't mean anything, okay?
I swear. It was just sex.

377
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:41,002
Oh, no, Wendy.
It was the worst kind of sex.

378
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,304
Premarital.

379
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,846
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
Just let me go.

380
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,984
I'll let you go,
but only if the glass slipper fits.

381
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,178
It's deep inside
your lower abdomen.

382
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,857
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

383
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:57,994
If you take longer than two minutes,
it'll be a whole new crown of thorns.

384
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,165
Start digging.

385
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,232
Clock's ticking.

386
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,198
Oh, God!

387
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,341
Say cheese.

388
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,947
If you wanted to take pictures,
you should have stayed at home.

389
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,118
-Eat my shorts, jerk.
-I'll murder you, bitch.

390
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,343
"Eat my shorts"?

391
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,648
There's always some dickweed
trying to spoil people's fun.

392
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,823
-This film is gnarly.
-Gnarly.

393
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,325
It's not fair. I've been doing
Pilates all senior year.

394
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,829
My stomach muscles
are too tight to dig through.

395
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,128
Oh, Wendy,
why didn't you think about that...

396
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:43,467
...before you offered Scott
your after-school special?

397
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,802
Cinderhella is a moralist.

398
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,501
This is probably the best movie
since Volcano.

399
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:52,308
And the award for most vapid
film review of the century goes to....

400
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,712
-Can you try being nice?
-Clapton's with me.

401
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,649
-Quit being a space cadet.
-I don't like Clapton.

402
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,951
-I don't care.
-White people, shut it!

403
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,820
But you know he's my own
Michael Keaton, right?

404
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,222
Will you give it up
with your '90s obsession?

405
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,591
1 992 was, like, the coolest year ever.

406
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,029
Speaking of which, nice plagiarism
on your debate with the Canadian.

407
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,567
"Meat is murder"?

408
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,364
Everyone knows Morrissey's
Kill Uncle was better.

409
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,097
-ls it?
-You're such a nimrod.

410
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,741
Will you stop talking?

411
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,275
We have rules of conduct.
Your ticket's a contract.

412
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,606
-Shut up, lumberjack!
-What is the contract?

413
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,749
There's to be no illegal photography
inside of Galaxy Cinemas.

414
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,442
That is not the way
a capitalist society functions.

415
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,747
When you take photography
inside of cinemas...

416
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,221
...you take money from carpenters
trying to feed their families.

417
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,018
Closing statement?

418
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,252
Silence is compliance.

419
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,539
Do the math, baby. Taylor was hot.

420
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,805
I was watching Smurfs.

421
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,983
Neve Campbell was hot.
Jamie Lee Curtis?

422
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,651
-I just BitTorrented Avatar.
-I'd get jiggy with it.

423
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:05,151
Rephrase this for me, lone.
Your glamazon logic is too advanced.

424
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,824
-They look nothing like Smurfs.
-Riley. As if.

425
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,891
You're not banging enough
to be murdered.

426
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,289
-They're blue.
-Plus, you live in a bungalow.

427
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,556
Slasher-film heroines
live in McMansions.

428
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,131
They don't look alike.

429
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,997
Wow, that was 70 percent appalling
and 30 percent really perceptive.

430
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:24,236
-BT-dubs, Cinderhella is my stalker.
-Definition, "stalker":

431
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,775
Stalker, noun. Someone who is not
hot enough to be seen with you.

432
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,477
Ione makes a compelling case.

433
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,776
If someone were to be
slashed and killed, I'd vote for her.

434
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,976
You're all that and a bag of chips,
Clapton.

435
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,917
It's not like Taylor Fisher
won a popularity contest.

436
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,422
She was murdered. You guys are
watching bimbos-get-tortured porn...

437
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,391
...to feed some music-video director's
coke habit.

438
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,324
Taylor died because she had it all.

439
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,830
She was the most popular girl.
Nobody hated her.

440
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,127
I'd hide in a sporting-goods store
if zombies attacked.

441
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,670
Correction: She was the most
popular girl. Everybody hated her.

442
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,273
-Costco.
-FYl, lone, you can't be the hero.

443
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,808
-No zombie memberships.
-Scream queens are virgins.

444
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,778
Riley does have superhero
impenetrability on her side.

445
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,110
Donald Waters.

446
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,111
He said "an anaconda"
and "ice cube."

447
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,186
I thought he was asking me to...

448
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,858
...watch a movie.

449
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:19,223
-Waters? That's gross.
-Cuts virginity out of the equation.

450
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,728
Cinderhella wants to kill me more.

451
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:25,129
I'm hot. Your house sucks. You lose.

452
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,708
Do you think Clapton would say yes
if I asked him out?

453
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,343
Riley, you have to do it.

454
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,638
You two have been
best friends forever.

455
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,941
-Hey, Clapton.
-Hey, Clapton.

456
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:44,251
He can ride me like that unicycle.

457
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,147
You!

458
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,382
Fartknocker!

459
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,760
Taylor Fisher was a paradigm
of human excellence.

460
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,500
Terrible shame this has to happen.

461
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,033
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

462
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,898
Problem with kids today, they don't
know how to channel aggression.

463
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:06,076
Football! That's the way.

464
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,245
Otherwise,
they're dreaming of girls...

465
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,279
...and end up in prison
on rape charges.

466
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:12,840
Yeah.

467
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:17,283
They close the school to let us grieve,
and everyone shows up at the mall.

468
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,217
These people make me sick.

469
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,416
Remember, there's a costume party
later at my place.

470
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,096
Ready for the big game tonight,
coach?

471
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,595
Always ready for football!

472
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,761
You're dead, Clapton.

473
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,034
Gotta fled.

474
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,137
I gotta pick up prom tickets.

475
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,640
But what about Taylor?

476
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,574
Run, blond gal, run!

477
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,408
Hotel for Dogs is on cable soon.

478
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,991
I guess the rumors
that you don't trim are true.

479
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,257
Taking nude photographs
with little kids is sick.

480
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,466
Here we go! Let's play some football!
Bust some heads!

481
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,971
Let's break some hands!
Break a claw!

482
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,836
Take it in!

483
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,742
Watch 32. Set. Hut!

484
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,358
Nolan, I'm open. What the fuck?

485
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,063
Let go of the goddamn ball!
What the--?

486
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,622
What the hell do you think--?

487
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,470
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

488
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,664
-Booger! Get off!
-Come on, Nolan.

489
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,343
-Get in the game!
-I'm trying!

490
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,773
-What is that?
-Get off the bear!

491
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,311
You saw nothing.

492
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,147
Nothing! Shut up!

493
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,347
Nolan, you all right?

494
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,726
What the hell do you think--?

495
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,625
What is that? Goddamn it!

496
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,065
Get out of here!

497
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,292
Billy, hold on a sec.

498
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,167
You resolve all your boy troubles
in the men's room?

499
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,534
Why are you gonna fight Clapton?
So junior high.

500
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,869
All that juicing is freaking you out.

501
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,408
Juicing?

502
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:25,377
Does this look like steroids to you?

503
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,415
Yeah, nice biceps. You're a freak!

504
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,746
You wanna know the story
of the real Billy Nolan?

505
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,223
Your eyes are bloodshot,
you vomit acid...

506
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,055
...and your brain is scrambled
from all the football hits.

507
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,254
Sure, lay it on me.

508
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:47,170
I have fly blood in my veins.

509
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,271
I'm a freak.

510
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,536
Robot dog.

511
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,673
Billy, I told you 1 00 damn times.

512
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,251
Get that dog out of here
when I'm watching the set.

513
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,183
He's blocking the game.

514
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,756
Why does he hate me?

515
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,951
All I have in the world is my TV set.

516
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,386
Never take this off, boy.

517
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,458
No one can know
that my son's a freak.

518
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,801
TV hand! TV hand! TV hand!

519
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,604
Hike!

520
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:01,500
TV hand! TV hand! TV hand!

521
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,799
And that's exactly
how I remember it.

522
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,371
You have got to cut down
on the protein shakes.

523
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:34,135
-Get lost! You don't know shit!
-lf you fight Clapton, I'll tell everyone.

524
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,279
You think they give trophies
to larvas?

525
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,479
-My hand.
-Come on!

526
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,311
I'm trying....

527
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,884
Billy, we really need to talk.

528
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,889
Is this when I'm supposed to say,
"How could you?"

529
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,652
Am I supposed to say,
"It's not what it looks like"?

530
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,692
What, are you two fucking?

531
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,566
Welcome to the Sandersons'.
Don't speak more loudly...

532
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:10,178
...than you would at your home. If you
have to go number one, go outside.

533
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,282
If it's number two, you go home.

534
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,747
Why'd you tell me
this was a costume party?

535
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,893
Because it is.

536
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,790
Fag.

537
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,861
Who are you supposed to be,
Super Mario?

538
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,829
Angela Chase.

539
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,934
She of the So-Called Life,
Claire Danes?

540
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,230
If it wasn't on men's curling,
I probably haven't seen it.

541
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:39,439
-We're the least cool people here.
-No, speak for yourself.

542
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,508
I'm dressed as
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

543
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,237
Setting off some pheromones.

544
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,712
I thought you were an ice skater.

545
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:49,882
-Do you like fish sticks?
-Oh, my God!

546
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,487
In Canada, people drink
what they bring to the party.

547
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,251
This whole Marxist alcohol
partition thing is new to me.

548
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,088
I like to mooch the good stuff.

549
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:03,727
So Canada, eh?

550
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,597
Is it true you guys
never lock your doors?

551
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,557
Suck it, bitches.

552
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,363
Gag.

553
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:54,011
I have no witty retort to that.

554
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,846
Just kiss me and make sure Clapton
sees that shit.

555
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,522
Engage.

556
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,425
I am fever!

557
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:07,186
I hope you're having
as much fun as us, Clapton.

558
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,921
As much fun as Billy had?

559
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,836
If your mind is being controlled
by Wrath of Khan slugs...

560
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,496
...I just want you to know
that I am cool with it.

561
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,878
Let's dance, Sander...

562
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:29,041
...because Clapton don't dance.

563
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,663
Not awesome.

564
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,240
I think I'm gonna barf.

565
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,649
Your bra hooked my ring.

566
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,048
Don't stretch my suspenders.
These overalls are vintage 1 994.

567
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,224
This is a limited-edition
LeVar Burton Starfleet pinkie ring.

568
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,018
I had to eat Whole Wheat Crackles
for a year to get one.

569
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,218
-Creeper. Beam off!
-Trust me.

570
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,857
That dude has tits.

571
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,530
Finally happened for me.

572
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,165
Clapton Davis!

573
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,842
Tonight will prove my theory...

574
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,614
...that lone won't go to prom...

575
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,274
...with someone
who has been murdered!

576
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,613
Go on, Clapton. I believe in you.

577
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,121
How about you use that motivational
speech to talk Billy out of it?

578
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,294
He's not gonna stop
until you step up.

579
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,787
You just have to lay down the law.

580
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,954
What if I lay down in pain?

581
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,727
Remember, Clapton,
pain don't hurt.

582
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,504
Red shirt. Damn.

583
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,631
All right, Billy.

584
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:01,944
Clapton Davis.

585
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,274
You are not as much of a pussy
as I thought.

586
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,451
-Do you wanna do this the easy way?
-What's the easy way?

587
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:13,385
Stop being so smart, all right?
You're dead either way.

588
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,287
Well, thank you
for explaining my op--

589
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,256
Thank God that's not me.

590
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,660
Goal!

591
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,328
It's go time, Clapton.

592
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,463
Shut up, lone!

593
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,427
It's no wonder I broke up with you.

594
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,432
Clapton Davis is a genius!

595
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:04,131
Would you go back in time to punch
Benjamin Franklin and Spike Lee too?

596
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,541
Get out of my face, ho!

597
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:12,705
And you lied to me. It is not normal
for people's semen to glow in the dark.

598
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,181
Billy, she never saw my semen,
I swear to God.

599
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:24,286
I cannot believe you just said that
in front of all these people.

600
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,587
Did I win?

601
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,187
What the--?

602
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,995
Why don't you take a picture, homo?

603
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:14,233
Stop messing with my buzz!

604
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,759
This shocking footage was recorded
by a witness earlier today.

605
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,053
Be warned,
the images here are disturbing.

606
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,244
How you feeling?

607
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,613
Well, my vision's diagonal...

608
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,112
...I can't breathe
without thinking about it...

609
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,751
...I can hear
other people's thoughts...

610
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,921
...and it looks like
you're eating meat.

611
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:01,285
Other than that, tip-top shape.

612
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:06,118
Not only do I eat meat,
but I am now a porno star.

613
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,462
Parties are so full of self-discovery.

614
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:10,963
Moo-licious.

615
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,619
Being a mascot is a proud tradition.

616
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:36,315
You represent the honor
of Grizzly Lake High.

617
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,358
When you take off
that bear costume...

618
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:41,497
...you should walk like your body
is still covered in fur.

619
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:45,691
The video of your mammary gland...

620
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:50,340
...was viewed 20,000 times
on the lnternet.

621
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,838
-YouTube?
-National Zoology.

622
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,442
-Can I throw up?
-It's also in the news.

623
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,136
Billy Nolan is killed
in the same video.

624
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,713
Who taught you how to make
a snuff porno? Lady Gaga?

625
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:03,646
Wait. Are you guys
accusing me of something?

626
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,655
Your nipple was exposed
for seven whole seconds.

627
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,853
Is that why two of my brightest
students were killed?

628
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,361
For seven seconds of video?

629
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,193
-Did you all watch it?
-I didn't.

630
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,130
Why not?

631
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:23,033
I am giving everybody implicated
as being anywhere near Billy Nolan...

632
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,834
...on that tape Saturday detention.

633
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,201
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow.

634
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,642
-Tomorrow is prom.
-This is murder.

635
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,039
And porn.
There's a killer in Grizzly Lake...

636
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,219
...who is affiliated
with people at my school.

637
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,481
Detention is in the library.
It goes from 1 0 a.m. to 1 0 p.m.

638
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,489
That's right through prom.

639
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,821
I thought Saturday detention
was a myth.

640
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,792
So was ice-skater porn.

641
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,314
Riley, don't ever degrade yourself.

642
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,107
Don't let them make you think
that you're not valuable.

643
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,744
-Mr. Kendall--
-Respect your body.

644
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,747
This is just a big misunderstanding.

645
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,129
A wise man once said that we're all
a bunch of big misunderstandings.

646
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,097
His name was Deepak Chopra.

647
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,733
What difference does it make now?
I'm just....

648
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,277
I'm just a stupid porn star.

649
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,772
No, Riley.

650
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:43,851
You're a beautiful girl
whose voice just needs to be heard.

651
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,671
I'm a porn star.

652
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,507
Young.

653
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,178
Hot.

654
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:15,882
Porn.

655
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,112
We just need to take a moment...

656
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:25,489
...to look into each other's eyes
and center our chakra.

657
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,190
You're looking for
something deeper.

658
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:32,334
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I like older guys.

659
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,471
Like age 36...

660
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:38,664
...or 39 or 35 or something.

661
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,501
Riley.

662
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,840
That's right.

663
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,685
There's always a new way
of looking at each other.

664
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,919
Okay, suspects.

665
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,488
Tell me who the killer is,
and I'll let you go home...

666
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,056
...and go to your little prom.

667
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:10,917
Taylor Fisher.

668
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,686
I don't believe you.

669
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:16,161
We have rights.
You can't lock us up without evidence.

670
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:20,325
This isn't jail.

671
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,667
It's detention.

672
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:41,457
Well, we can rule out Gord.

673
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,819
Canadians don't kill
outside their home country.

674
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,858
Yeah, well,
we can count Sander out too.

675
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,463
Nolan was chopped up with an ax.
Ever seen Sander try to swing a bat?

676
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,724
I was sick that day.

677
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,870
You have the arms of an anemic
spider monkey. Definitely not you.

678
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,039
Well, Mimi probably
isn't the killer either.

679
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,231
Her only death comes
from a makeup kit.

680
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,103
We can take Toshiba off the list.

681
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,877
-Why?
-Because you're you.

682
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,410
And it's definitely not Claptonia.

683
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,551
Those two couldn't be apart
long enough to coordinate a killing.

684
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:11,744
That with lone
gnawing through boyfriends...

685
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:15,152
...Iike an unfed piranha
makes me think you're both innocent.

686
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,347
Thanks?

687
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,529
You've gone out with, what?
Five guys these past three years?

688
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,789
'90s makeover aside, you're not
reflexive enough to hold a grudge.

689
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,229
And crippling gimpitude
saves your ass.

690
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,699
Having a broken leg is for losers,
you idiot.

691
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,368
All right, then that settles it.
It's Toby T.

692
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,132
-Why is it me?
-Just fess up, Toby.

693
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,573
So I can get out of here, and won't
have to listen to this windbag.

694
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,373
-Take one for the team.
-You guys barely even know me.

695
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:39,947
That's kind of the problem.

696
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,583
It writes psychotic killer
all over your face.

697
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:46,747
Mimi is just too obvious
with the rebellious clown makeup...

698
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:50,256
-...her hippie parents hate.
-My parents aren't hippies.

699
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,553
-Are you all assholes?
-I'm not.

700
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,595
Look, guys, it's obvious
I have no ties to Billy and Taylor.

701
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,266
Same school, same food chain.

702
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,799
How could you,
strange, unknown quiet guy?

703
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,937
I'm not a killer, I'm just boring.

704
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,605
Toby, you're right.

705
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:07,265
It can't be any of us.
We're not anguished enough.

706
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,741
Our generation has had
no major struggles.

707
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,538
-What about 9/1 1?
-Afghanistan?

708
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,772
-lraq.
-Katrina.

709
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,883
Heath Ledger. What?

710
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,074
Too soon?

711
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:19,247
The hell do Katrina & the Waves
have to do with it?

712
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:22,152
Katrina the hurricane.
Wikipedia it, bitch.

713
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:26,557
It's spelled "encyclopedia," slutbag.

714
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,294
Who's the guy in the hoodie?

715
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:33,464
My name is Elliot Fink.

716
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,796
I didn't see you.

717
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,974
Nobody really sees me.

718
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:42,402
I've had detention every day
for the last 1 9 years.

719
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,477
Nineteen years?
The hell did you do?

720
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:48,777
I.... I don't remember.

721
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,341
Took a dump on the windshield
of Woodruff's Cadillac.

722
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,243
Only got a week.

723
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,079
You must be the baddest motherfucker
in school.

724
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,721
Now, Elliot Fink,
you're gonna sit here...

725
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,754
...and think about
what you've done.

726
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:39,622
You'll have detention every day
until I tell you you're reformed.

727
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:44,357
My school will not be a training ground
for budding pornographers.

728
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,576
Don't look at me, perv.

729
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,583
Can I get a Wi-Fi connection here?

730
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,453
'Nam flashback?

731
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,295
Did you go to this school in 1 992?

732
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:18,490
Yeah, she'll be 65 next week.
It's a surgical wonder.

733
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,938
Apparently, a perfect body
and eyeliner aren't enough...

734
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:32,580
...to win the school dance-off.

735
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:36,878
You need, like, moves and things.
God!

736
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:42,280
I used to know how to break it down
like C+C Music Factory.

737
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,618
Yeah, right!

738
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,022
Mom, the dance-off is in two days.

739
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:49,426
All you need to do is swap minds
with my 1 8-year-old self.

740
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:53,659
My mind will go into your mind,
into your body...

741
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,428
...and win you the dance-off.

742
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:59,335
Meanwhile, your mind
will travel to 1 992.

743
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,272
That way people won't wonder
why there's two of you...

744
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,003
...or us, hanging around now.

745
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:08,207
A couple of things I need to tell you
about boys in 1 992.

746
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:11,477
Christian Slater, Frank Whaley...

747
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:15,021
...oh, and Richard Grieco
are all foxes.

748
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,954
Donnie Wahlberg is bordering sexy.

749
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,995
Oh, and Kevin Costner is slamming
in Prince of Thieves.

750
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:24,928
Kevin Costner is a douche.
And one other thing...

751
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:26,526
...are you insane?

752
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,967
It's what I always sang to you
when you were a baby.

753
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,164
When you wish--

754
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:33,637
Shit!

755
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:38,676
I wish my mother
would go to another planet...

756
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:43,046
...instead of being a drunken has-been
who's full of shit.

757
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:25,925
So that's how my mind ended up
in my mother's body in 1 992.

758
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:30,566
And how I ended up
in my daughter lone in the present.

759
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,562
But that's all technical science stuff.

760
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:44,275
Wow, lone really did her research.

761
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,584
Next up, doing ballet...

762
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,084
...we have Ripley Jones.

763
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:53,277
Riley!

764
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:56,583
Whatever, dude.
You have like three minutes.

765
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,173
You taste like Luke Perry.

766
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:24,018
-She's a gimp.
-FML!

767
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,121
Every student donating a food item
to help the war victims...

768
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,587
...will receive a free pass
to Lethal Weapon 3.

769
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,693
What the heck is so retro
about Kris Kross, dumbass?

770
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:36,490
This week the Science Olympiad
took place in Town Creek.

771
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,930
I am never leaving this place.

772
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,333
This move is sick.

773
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,130
Tighten up that defense line

774
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,433
Said hold that line

775
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,667
This one is....

776
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,845
Oh, hey, Verge,
are you coming out tonight?

777
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,514
We're gonna watch Freejack
on laser disc.

778
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:03,188
Dear God, please give me the strength
to ask Sloan to prom.

779
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:08,126
We're meant to be
and she sees the future.

780
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:12,299
And give some food to those Ethiopian
kids hanging out with Sally Struthers...

781
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,470
...because seeing them
really bums me out...

782
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,606
...during Star Trek: Next Generation.
Amen.

783
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,677
Lose your seat?

784
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:26,711
No, I was just sitting
right over there.

785
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:31,216
I saw you in cheerleader practice
in the gym yesterday...

786
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:34,857
...and I was thinking about it again
in bed last night.

787
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:39,321
I was just gonna ask you to prom.

788
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:45,363
I can smell bologna packed
in your lunch. It makes me gag.

789
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,033
You look like a girl!

790
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,947
Sloan probably only likes guys
that look like C. Thomas Howell.

791
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,084
Well, that's just
racial discrimination.

792
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,847
If I can't be part of her future,
there will be no future.

793
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,959
Damn it.

794
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,530
Well, if I'm gonna die, at least I know
I've lived twice as long as Riley.

795
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,438
Just because you're a bitch
doesn't give you dog years.

796
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:30,942
Says the baby with the stuffed toys.

797
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,584
I think it's Taylor's.

798
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:44,589
Verge is right.
The killer's right here.

799
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:49,631
We gotta find out what happens
after the Cinderhella murders.

800
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,460
-Cinderhella dies.
-Yeah, after that.

801
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,636
What happens in
Cinderhella III: Blood Ball?

802
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:57,328
-Movie's not out yet.
-I'll BitTorrent the work print.

803
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,666
Three, two-- Got it!

804
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,309
Damn. The review
by Sherlock Moriarty...

805
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,479
...compares it unfavorably
to Hellboy II...

806
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,510
...calling it a "craptasterpiece."

807
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,238
That's it.

808
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,282
If Mr. Pain's giving us detention
on a Saturday...

809
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,826
...the least we can do is download
Slashing Beauty 4 for free...

810
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,158
...and watch it illegally on the Internet
before it's released.

811
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,335
I wanna have unprotected sex.

812
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,505
How can they make a movie worse
than Cinderhella II?

813
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,508
They say the Beauty Beast
only kills virgins.

814
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,013
I'm saving myself for marriage.

815
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,488
I avoid teenage pregnancy.

816
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:53,456
Madison. We're gonna die.

817
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,187
If it's life or death....

818
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,197
-What is this, Canadian?
-Canada invented the slasher film...

819
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:02,701
...as well as the "animal plays a sport"
genre, motherfucker.

820
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,266
I'm a virgin.

821
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,748
Take me, Beauty Beast!

822
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,975
Your teeth are so hard!

823
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,546
Suck it!

824
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:20,346
Goddamn it!

825
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,388
Greg, you asshole.

826
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:27,529
Now we really do have to use
this time to think about our futures.

827
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,000
This movie is so stupid.

828
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,932
Let's go back to class
and fall asleep.

829
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:40,571
None of you felons...

830
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:45,509
... will ever graduate!

831
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:56,017
What is this commotion?

832
01:04:56,225 --> 01:05:01,390
-We're about to get murdered.
-Someday you will be old, kids.

833
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:04,725
Do you believe that our president,
Barack Obama, murdered anyone...

834
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,027
...when he was in high school?

835
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,704
O.J. maybe. Not Obama.

836
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,705
-I think that's racist, sir.
-What is? It is not.

837
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,812
Why did you go from Obama to O.J.
instead of to Dahmer or someone?

838
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:22,314
I, Mimi, am the principal
of this school...

839
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,487
...and you have not even completed
your schooling.

840
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,612
Besides, I voted for McCain.

841
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:30,849
In conclusion, stop fucking around.

842
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,454
-Are we allowed to read?
-No, Hitachi.

843
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:34,820
Toshiba.

844
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:37,158
Ione. Sorry, baby.

845
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,799
-"Baby"?
-Weird.

846
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,933
Who is that?

847
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,831
My name's Elliot Fink.

848
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,768
Nobody say a word.
Nobody sneeze.

849
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:49,440
Nobody look at anything
except your own eyeballs.

850
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,113
There's a killer amongst us.

851
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:55,643
You've read Brave New World.

852
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:58,285
Like Big Brother, I'm watching you.

853
01:05:58,487 --> 01:05:59,681
Big Brother was in 1984.

854
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:05,155
You have no future in my opinion.

855
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:10,957
What now?

856
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:14,159
These kids should be happy to be
away from their Yu-Gi-Oh.

857
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,168
What the hell are you doing
out of detention?

858
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:29,851
I solved the equation.

859
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:33,385
Cool. You passed Trig. In other news,
somebody's murdering us.

860
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:34,613
None of that matters.

861
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,952
If these numbers are correct,
the world is ending in 1 0 minutes.

862
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,186
-The whole world?
-Yeah, all of Grizzly Lake.

863
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:44,161
-That's not the whole world.
-You been outside Grizzly Lake?

864
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,732
-No.
-What's the difference?

865
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:46,957
Whoa-kay.

866
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,228
Nobody knows who you are.
Why believe you?

867
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,531
In 9.4 minutes,
everyone you know...

868
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,135
...your friends, your parents...

869
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:58,507
...your extensions, goes bye-bye.

870
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,477
This destruction is man-made.

871
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,479
If it's man-made, we can kill it.

872
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,555
Score one for Captain 9021 -Obvious.
How do we stop it?

873
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:12,390
That's the catch. I said it was
happening in nine minutes...

874
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,655
...but it's happening in nine minutes
in the year 1 992.

875
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:16,854
What the hell?

876
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,396
Somebody must have
gone back to 1 992.

877
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:24,369
In nine minutes, they're changing
history by blowing everything up.

878
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,234
None of you will have
even been born.

879
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,672
-The end of the world's coming?
-Yeah.

880
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,675
-ln 1 992?
-Yes!

881
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,905
-1 992.
-We're talking time travel?

882
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:36,084
-There's no such thing.
-Technically it's a temporal wormhole...

883
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:39,618
...based on an 1 1 -dimensional string
model of the holographic universe.

884
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,382
It'd require a highly advanced
mathematical construct...

885
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:43,956
...far beyond M-theory...

886
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,526
...probably alien in origin.

887
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:49,529
What?

888
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:53,065
I've been building the school bear
into a time machine for science class.

889
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,534
So you're telling me it works? Cool.

890
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,138
I hate this school.

891
01:07:58,474 --> 01:07:59,771
Where's Sander?

892
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,499
And Clapton.

893
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:04,946
He's terrified of the future.
Nobody hated Verge like Clapton.

894
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,707
Clapton doesn't hate anyone
except Billy Nolan.

895
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,214
Also dead.

896
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,749
Oh, shit.

897
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:14,614
I'll drop my extreme skepticism due to
the potential urgency of the situation.

898
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:18,123
-How do we use your time machine?
-You'll break it.

899
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,955
-I haven't been graded yet.
-You won't be graded at all...

900
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:24,326
...if you haven't been born.
Show me how it works.

901
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,764
No, show me.
I don't trust anyone right now.

902
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,301
Maybe we don't trust you.

903
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:33,498
It's personal.
I have to stop Clapton from killing us.

904
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:36,644
Someone took this claw
from my locker.

905
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,366
I'm sorry. But this is so cool.

906
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,006
How much did those cost?

907
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,003
A hundred dollars.

908
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,609
For overalls?

909
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:13,213
Did your parents sell out
to an evil corporate conglomerate?

910
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,615
I'm never leaving this place.

911
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,711
-Schwing!
-Schwing!

912
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,881
That's why Mom left you.

913
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:02,595
Okay, class, we talked last week
about quantum states.

914
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:08,236
Now, can anybody tell me
what describes a mixed state?

915
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:10,905
-New Mexico.
-No, Clapton.

916
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:14,405
You already received your 1 5 percent
for participation mark.

917
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,443
You don't have to give
the wrong answers anymore.

918
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,342
But nice work on your essay
on the Heisenberg principle.

919
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,416
It was incorrect but it had heart.

920
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,382
I gave you an A.

921
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:28,089
He's a killer!

922
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,081
I don't know this person.

923
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:33,523
My class time will not be spent
on practical jokes.

924
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,027
Clapton Davis is
my brightest student.

925
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:39,599
Brightest?
He never does his homework.

926
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:42,930
We figured it out, Clapton.
All this death is just a game to you.

927
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:46,232
Why would I kill people? I chased
Sander through the time machine...

928
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:49,275
...after he got Gord, lost him.
Been stuck here for six weeks.

929
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:52,447
-But I'm on the honor roll.
-So then why does the world go away?

930
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,582
Wait, is that why Verge
is building a bomb?

931
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,614
-A bomb?
-Thought he was extra-crediting.

932
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,582
In Osama bin Ladinism?

933
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,550
I bet Sander's helping him.

934
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,314
Unbelievable. You let
a mass murderer feel your bosom.

935
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:06,460
Oh, my God.
We have to kill Sander.

936
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,927
What are we, monsters?
Let's just kidnap him.

937
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,468
And scene. Thank you.

938
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:16,899
Shit!

939
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,772
If time travel were to happen,
it would probably require...

940
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:26,471
...a huge electrical force
of around 1.21, 1.22 gigawatts.

941
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:30,948
See how crossing the nodes of your flux
capacitor generates a tachyon blast?

942
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:33,587
I don't know who you are
or what you're trying--

943
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,257
The way this is set up,
it's gonna blow your face off.

944
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,925
Yeah, I'd like to see that.

945
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,324
You defy death and turn into
a douche bag like Spock.

946
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,825
Here, I made you a mix tape.

947
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,295
That's so awesome.

948
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:50,798
-Are you from, like, the year 2000?
-Yes, I come from the time where...

949
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:53,406
...computers and machines
have overtaken the world...

950
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,976
...and enslaved human bodies
as sources of infinite electrical power.

951
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,977
That's stupid.
The food it would take--

952
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,776
If you're not careful,
you'll create a chain of events...

953
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,852
...Ieading to the complete annihilation
of the human race.

954
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:09,957
Now make that bomb go off.

955
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,851
I wanna kill everyone because
they snubbed me for prom.

956
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,962
-That works.
-I like how you think, Mr...?

957
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,394
Keanu.

958
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,899
Excuse me.
Where is your hall pass?

959
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:23,367
-Gosh-fucking-darn it.
-You get his legs.

960
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,408
-Oh, my face!
-lt didn't work.

961
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:32,971
Don't be so sure.

962
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,008
Come on!

963
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,918
Riley, get back in the time machine.

964
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,401
We've been sent back
six minutes before doomsday.

965
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,039
We should have grabbed Verge.

966
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,937
He had enough info to know
how to make the bomb go off.

967
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:36,441
-New strategy.
-What?

968
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:38,943
I don't know.
I'm saying we need one.

969
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:48,812
I got nothing.

970
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:56,453
If we weren't all dead in two minutes,
I would masturbate so hard...

971
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:59,725
-...to lone tonight.
-lone? You mean Sloan.

972
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:04,567
Girls like Sloan will learn what happens
when they pass up guys like me.

973
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:08,473
Let me see your bomb.

974
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:10,509
-That's it.
-What's what?

975
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:14,808
Verge is doing this because she broke
his heart. We force lone to go with him.

976
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,076
Ione's going to prom with me.
Forget it.

977
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,813
She'll go to prom with you in 201 1
and with him in 1 992.

978
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,253
Yeah, I still don't think
I'm okay with that.

979
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,085
Ione!

980
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:30,828
You'll blow this for me.
I traded places with my mom.

981
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,295
My name here is Sloan.

982
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:36,970
Don't I get a kiss?

983
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:38,968
No.

984
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:41,108
Damn, I knew Sting
was too good to be true.

985
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,608
-Your mom's a bitch.
-lt was to win the contest.

986
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,474
-I was gonna come back but--
-Being cool is that important?

987
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,310
How hard is it to be cool in 1 992?

988
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:52,976
Plus, my mom's body fits great,
except...

989
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:55,816
...I think I may be pregnant.

990
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,126
Ione's giving birth to herself?

991
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,693
I failed that class.

992
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:04,457
You know how cool people
always refer to guacamole as "guac"?

993
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,396
-I invented that.
-lone, you have to ask Verge to prom.

994
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:09,696
Waiting for the punch line.

995
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:13,238
People are getting killed. He's gonna
blow up Grizzly Lake in 56 seconds.

996
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:15,409
You can keep living in 1 992
if you want...

997
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:18,239
...but the fate of everyone
you've ever known goes away...

998
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,380
...unless you ask Verge to prom
right now.

999
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:24,074
Screw that! I can't be forced
to go to prom with someone.

1000
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,379
That's like date rape.

1001
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:28,579
You heard of
the Dead Cheerleader Nationals?

1002
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:30,687
They don't exist.

1003
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,884
Verge, I was wondering....

1004
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,057
What are you guys working on?

1005
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,993
Now, lone. Eighteen seconds!

1006
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,168
-Will you be my prom date?
-Your hair can look like Sharon Stone?

1007
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,358
-What?
-What are you doing?

1008
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,832
-Fine!
-Nine seconds.

1009
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,063
-You go full tongue?
-Okay.

1010
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:46,536
Cowabunga.

1011
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,334
We can use my
Pizza Pitt coupons first.

1012
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,691
Weren't we able to jump through
last time?

1013
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,384
We surpassed the spatial
temporal limit of time travel.

1014
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,257
What is that?
You just made that up.

1015
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:11,523
Toshiba must have put
an on-off switch here.

1016
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,894
Let's see.

1017
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:17,905
Found it.

1018
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,438
Come on!

1019
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:27,114
That girl is going down on that bear.

1020
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:30,285
-Come on!
-I knew that ass looked familiar.

1021
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,220
-Come on, you bitch!
-Nice.

1022
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:37,718
Who's her prom date?

1023
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,721
All his parts are still working.

1024
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,829
-Yeah, we gotta go.
-Come on.

1025
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:48,627
Not so fast.

1026
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:49,826
Oh, crap.

1027
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:15,261
So everyone left detention
after Verge and Gord got killed?

1028
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,831
Our band may not be the Drunges,
but I wouldn't say we got killed.

1029
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,662
Oh, Principal Pimping,
don't listen to the haters.

1030
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,804
You are my freakasaurus.

1031
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,833
Since our lead vocalist is too busy
getting molested by Mrs. Verge....

1032
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:31,478
I quit, I quit, I'm too wasted.

1033
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,511
Verge! Verge! Verge!

1034
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:37,515
I guess I'll sing the next song.
This one goes out to lone.

1035
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:41,678
Because, lone,
you are my field of gold.

1036
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,585
Hit it, Gord.

1037
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:50,787
Toby T knows every
post-Police Sting album.

1038
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,102
We changed the fabric
of space-time.

1039
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:59,501
That or the bear fumes
have gotten me delusional.

1040
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:07,212
-An A. That should do it.
-Verge!

1041
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,348
Nineteen years ago today...

1042
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:13,521
...I met the kindest man
I could ever imagine.

1043
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:16,088
Who gave you the right to get
so much older than me?

1044
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:19,317
Strange things happen
when you're young.

1045
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,895
No! The punch bowl has been spiked.
You will not drink that, young lady.

1046
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:25,623
Don't talk to me that way,
young lady.

1047
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:30,136
All right, lovebirds. I'm gonna steal
my hottie and grab some guac.

1048
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:32,399
Guac.

1049
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,075
And the world just threw up a little.

1050
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:38,246
-"Lovebirds"? Are we dating now?
-You got a problem with that?

1051
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:39,744
Students.

1052
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:44,749
I hate to interrupt but it is now time to
announce your prom king and queen.

1053
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:46,921
Oh, you all know what the deal is.

1054
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,680
Riley, Clapton...

1055
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,153
...come on up here and dance.

1056
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:55,626
-Clapton don't da--
-Shut up.

1057
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:58,800
If you don't dance with me,
I will murder every last inch of you.

1058
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:02,264
Well, in that case,
hold on a second.

1059
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:06,931
Clapton don't dance.

1060
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:09,868
So they say.
But when studying Road House...

1061
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:12,569
...I got hooked on the rest
of Patrick Swayze's oeuvre.

1062
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:14,942
If he can look cool dirty dancing....

1063
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:06,553
Is everything really back to normal?

1064
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:12,326
I guess if me getting an A and saving
the universe is considered normal.

1065
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:18,168
Well, maybe normal's
not all it's cracked up to be.

1066
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:34,952
We didn't change everything.

1067
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:58,707
I mean, look at how tight
his jeans are.

1068
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,711
-He's totally gay.
-Oh, you piece of shit!

1069
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,784
You should have fucked me.

1070
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,119
Think you can kill people
because you're a virgin?

1071
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:12,384
That's the douchiest thing
I've ever heard.

1072
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,961
Sander, I want my fish sticks.

1073
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:17,757
Hey!

1074
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:19,729
I stopped wearing Ed Hardy
junior year.

1075
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:24,065
I'm sorry that you're all too busy
playing Sims Grizzly Lake to notice!

1076
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:28,003
-Christian Audigier is the same shit.
-Really? Whatever.

1077
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:30,803
-You're all Gossip Girls with Corollas!
-I take the bus.

1078
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:34,914
And like wearing a movie mask
is so original.

1079
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,515
Read a book.

1080
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:39,312
It's called post-irony!

1081
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:42,649
I used to think you were just some
middle-class chump with no game.

1082
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:44,449
But those pity points ran out.

1083
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:50,830
Oh, pity me from the wrist-slitting
herbivore over here?

1084
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:54,829
"Clapton Davis doesn't love me.

1085
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:57,630
Please kill me, God!"

1086
01:22:57,839 --> 01:22:59,932
You are pathetic!

1087
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:03,201
All of your Grizzly Lake friends
are pathetic!

1088
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:07,147
Except me. I'm all right.

1089
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:09,715
God, why wasn't I born
someplace cool, like Orlando?

1090
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,209
God, you're a dick.

1091
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:15,011
It breaks my spirit to see that bra size
wasted on someone like you.

1092
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:26,196
You're about to be spanked
by the power of Swayze.

1093
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,369
All Road House had were his fists.

1094
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:31,801
In Under Siege,
Steven Seagal was a master chef.

1095
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,490
Your fighting style is so obnoxious.

1096
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:59,530
Seagal in On Deadly Ground.
Impenetrable defense.

1097
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,500
Oh, God!

1098
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,110
I got you.

1099
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,914
You got yourself.

1100
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:31,617
Just another dead teenager
in Grizzly Lake.

1101
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:34,993
I think he'll be the last.

1102
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:55,705
Once upon a time,
the planet didn't burst into flames...

1103
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:59,045
...everybody didn't die,
and life kept on...

1104
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:02,655
...even though Sander thought that
he was the only one who mattered.

1105
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,654
But every one of us was...

1106
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:09,196
...a prince...

1107
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:16,330
...a princess...

1108
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:24,040
...a child...

1109
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:30,673
...a grown-up...

1110
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:36,514
...someone cool.

1111
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:41,418
If you and Verge can't get home
at a reasonable hour...

1112
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:43,654
...there's no Twitter for a month.

1113
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,425
Oh, that's so unfair.

1114
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:49,660
You're gonna let your daughter
ground you like that?

1115
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:51,896
Yeah, good luck with that.

1116
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,746
Sander saw no future for us
because he lived in the past.

1117
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,211
So his experiment
was to end time itself.

1118
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,556
But we now know
the greatest experiment...

1119
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:12,089
...isn't traveling through time
or making bombs.

1120
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:20,062
The only way to change the past...

1121
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:24,266
...is to change the present.

1122
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:29,671
So Sander was wrong. Even if
Grizzly Lake is lame, it's just a start.

1123
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:32,242
A beginning, not an end.

1124
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:36,406
And.... And....

1125
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:39,883
I can't think to this song.

1126
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:51,160
We're live in Grizzly Lake
where what appears to be a UFO...

1127
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:53,960
...is descending
on a suburban commun--

1128
01:27:54,502 --> 01:27:57,630
I am a spokesman for the race alien
to your planet Earth.

1129
01:27:57,839 --> 01:28:01,969
First, we assimilated Canada and I
took the exact form of a Canadian.

1130
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:04,144
I am part of a vegetable species.

1131
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:06,472
You stupid humans
eat our sons and daughters...

1132
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,444
...because you have
no self-confidence.

1133
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:12,942
It's just high school.
It's not the end of the world.
