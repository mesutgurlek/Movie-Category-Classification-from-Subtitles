1
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:47,553
The tank itself...

2
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:49,751
...was unusual in that it was vertical...

3
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,286
...and looked like an old boiler.

4
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,160
Inside the tank the subject wore
a heavy glass bubble...

5
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:58,894
...and you would have thought the whole
contraption uncomfortable to say the least.

6
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,435
It was, however, effective.

7
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,867
Of the 23 students tested,
only two found the experience unpleasant.

8
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,466
Some even called it exhilarating.

9
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,739
A number of students hallucinated.

10
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,243
Dr. Jessup found the encephalographic
evidence especially interesting.

11
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,578
And one Saturday afternoon, in April 1967...

12
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,350
...he decided to try the experience
for himself.

13
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:51,169
Arthur. Hey, Arthur.

14
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,443
Are you there?

15
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,683
Can you hear me, Arthur?

16
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,287
Arthur, answer me.

17
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,457
Is that it? You want me
to come in and get you out?

18
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,391
I want to get a look at those EEG tracings.

19
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,511
How do you feel?

20
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,146
Not bad.

21
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,510
I hallucinated like a son of a bitch.

22
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:08,684
A variety of dream states, mystical states...

23
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,520
...a lot of religious allegory,
mostly out of Revelation.

24
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,755
You were in there close to five hours.

25
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:15,021
It felt like an hour.

26
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:16,759
I'd like to try that myself sometime.

27
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,357
You should. You'll like it.

28
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,834
Did we have any communication?

29
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:26,801
Sure. I kept checking you out
like you told me to.

30
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,874
How did I respond?

31
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,270
Very orderly.
At one point you were crying.

32
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:33,910
You mean, actually crying?

33
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,417
You were sobbing.
There were tears on your face.

34
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,814
When I asked you what was going on,
you said you were...

35
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,016
...re-experiencing your father's death.

36
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,620
Did you make notes?

37
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,223
It's all there.

38
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:52,100
I'd like to try this again next week. Do you
think you could make it again next week?

39
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:53,969
What are we looking for?

40
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,429
I don't know, yet.

41
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:02,375
There's really very little literature
on this kind of research.

42
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,437
There are some good people in the field:
Tart, Ornstein and Deikman...

43
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,746
...but most of it is radical-hip stuff,
drug-culture apologias.

44
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:12,685
Obviously, the first thing to do is
set up some sensible methodology...

45
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:15,781
...study these experiences
under controlled laboratory conditions.

46
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,190
It won't interfere with the work
we're doing with Hobart.

47
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,662
What are we getting into?
Sensory deprivation? Isolation studies?

48
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:24,165
I mean, where will we be going
with the tank stuff?

49
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,031
We're not writing up a grant.
Strictly bootlegging, just for kicks.

50
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,162
We've got the use of this tank.
Let's play with it.

51
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:31,138
Let's find out where it takes us.

52
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,103
It's fascinating stuff.
I think we ought to get into it.

53
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,908
I didn't even know they had one of those
isolation tanks at New York Hospital.

54
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,951
Must be some guy
in the Psychology Department...

55
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,850
...doing sensory deprivation studies.

56
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,856
What's Jessup doing with it?

57
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:52,426
You've got me. He's been taking students
out of his classes and testing them.

58
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,725
He's been doing this for three, four months.

59
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Did you know...

60
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,664
...Jessup was into this kind of stuff?

61
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,326
Not until you just told me.

62
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:01,961
What do you want?

63
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,097
How long are you going to let it ring?

64
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,368
It's okay, I'll get it.

65
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:08,334
He's the last guy in the world I figured...

66
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:12,541
...to be screwing around with anything
as flaky as altered states of consciousness.

67
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,778
Let's face it. Jessup is pretty flaky himself.

68
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,413
That's him.

69
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,103
Arthur says you're very shy.
He wants me to draw you out.

70
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,077
Draw me out?
That doesn't sound like Arthur.

71
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,985
Well, what he actually said was
you were a high-handed, arrogant prick.

72
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,114
A little nuts, but brilliant...

73
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:55,720
...and that if I ever got you talking,
I would find you fascinating.

74
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,720
That sounds more like Arthur.

75
00:07:57,793 --> 00:08:01,058
He says you're doing some work with him
and Alan Hobart at Payne-Whitney.

76
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,290
What sort of work?

77
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,392
Toxic metabolite stuff.

78
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,594
We're replicating Heath's
and Friedhoff's strategies...

79
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,331
...trying to find maverick substances
specific to schizophrenia.

80
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,669
I think we're chasing our tails.
What do you do?

81
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,437
I'm a physical anthropologist.
I'm sweating out my dissertation.

82
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,340
Where?

83
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:16,577
Columbia.

84
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:18,546
Holloway, and that bunch.

85
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,572
You're kind of young for a Ph.D.,
aren't you?

86
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm 24.

87
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,111
That's still pretty good.

88
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:28,419
I didn't get my Ph.D. until I was 25.
I'm supposed to be a whiz kid.

89
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,992
I'm a whiz kid, too.

90
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:39,434
Anthropology seems to attract
good-looking women.

91
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:46,068
So you don't think schizophrenia can be
reduced to a single etiological agent?

92
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,909
I'm not even sure it's a disease.

93
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,145
You think madness is simply
another state of consciousness?

94
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,615
There's a body of evidence to support that.

95
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:58,919
You don't Iike to talk
about your work, do you?

96
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,114
As a rule, no.

97
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:09,597
I'm interested in interior experiences,
especially the religious experience.

98
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,963
The only reason I'm working
with schizophrenics now...

99
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:15,629
...is the religious experience is
so significant in schizophrenia.

100
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,963
There's only so much
you can do with animals.

101
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,098
I worked with monkeys...

102
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,575
...but they can't tell you what goes on
in their consciousness.

103
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,544
You need human beings for that.

104
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:27,407
You can't ablate human beings,
nor stick electrodes in their skulls...

105
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,815
...so I have to use
a trance-inducing technique...

106
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:32,718
...and the isolation tank seemed
the least risky.

107
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:36,554
And I'd like to go home with you tonight.
Would that be all right with you?

108
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:40,623
I've got a roommate.
We'll be confined to the living-room couch.

109
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,124
What's wrong with the living-room couch?

110
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,164
You tend to slip off a lot.

111
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:48,935
I'm sure we'll manage.

112
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:50,834
I'm sure we will.

113
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:57,340
So, whenever you want to go there,
you let me know.

114
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,645
How about right now?

115
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,929
What are you thinking about?

116
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:19,223
God...

117
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,868
...Jesus, crucifixions.

118
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:31,603
As a rule, do you usually think about
Christ and crucifixions under sexual stress?

119
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,312
When I was nine years old,
I used to see visions...

120
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,518
...visions of saints and angels,
even Christ himself.

121
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,832
Of course I don't do that anymore...

122
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,296
...not since I was 16.

123
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,031
Were your parents religious?

124
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,977
Anything but.

125
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:06,745
My father was an aeronautical engineer.
My mother, a clinical psychologist.

126
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,075
What happened?

127
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:12,678
I mean, how did a little kid who saw
visions of Christ turn into a physiologist...

128
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,019
...teaching at the Cornell Medical College?

129
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,755
I stopped believing.

130
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,050
It was very dramatic.

131
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:22,257
My father died a protracted
and painful death of cancer.

132
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:27,092
I was 16 years old
and very fond of my father.

133
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,933
I used to race to the hospital
every day after school...

134
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:33,200
...and sit in his room doing my homework.

135
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,610
He was very heavily sedated.

136
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,875
The last few weeks he was in coma.

137
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,283
One day I thought
I heard him say something.

138
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:47,283
I got up and leaned over him...

139
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,984
...my ear an inch away from his lips.

140
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,991
''Did you say something, Pop?''

141
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,696
Then I heard the word he was desperately
trying to say, a soft hiss of a word.

142
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,100
He was saying...

143
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:05,765
''...terrible...''

144
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,441
''...terrible.''

145
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:21,948
So the end was terrible,
even for the good people like my father.

146
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:25,016
So the purpose of all our suffering
was just more suffering.

147
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:32,594
By dinner time, I had dispensed with God
altogether. I never saw another vision.

148
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,506
I haven't told anybody
about this in 10 years.

149
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,305
I'm telling you now
because I want you to know...

150
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,676
...what sort of a nut
you might be getting mixed up with.

151
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,681
Arthur was right.

152
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,254
You are a fascinating bastard.

153
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:28,302
Well, it's settled.

154
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:32,143
Metcalfe spoke to Spencer again this
morning and it's definite. The job's mine.

155
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,876
I'll be in Nairobi doing
my post-doc work July and August...

156
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,145
...and in September,
I'll be teaching at Harvard.

157
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:38,277
Terrific.

158
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:42,450
It looks like we'll both be teaching
at Harvard in September.

159
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,991
Looks that way.

160
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,756
You can't get any tidier than that, can you?

161
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:55,498
We're going to be together in Boston
and I think we should get married.

162
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,673
You know, of course,
I'm supposed to be at least a little bit nuts.

163
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:01,903
A little bit?

164
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,842
You're an unmitigated madman!

165
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:10,010
You don't have to tell me how weird
you are. I know how weird you are!

166
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,281
I'm the girl in your bed
the past two months.

167
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:15,118
Even sex is a mystical experience for you.

168
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,418
You carry on like a flagellant,
which can be very nice...

169
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:21,054
...but I sometimes wonder
if it's me that's being made love to.

170
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,998
I feel like I'm being harpooned by some
raging monk in the act of receiving God.

171
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:34,670
And you are a Faust freak, Eddie.
You'd sell your soul to find the great Truth.

172
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:38,336
Well, human life doesn't have great truths.

173
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:42,510
We're born in doubt. We spend our lives
persuading ourselves we're alive.

174
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,712
And one way we do that is
we love each other, like I love you.

175
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,181
I can't imagine living without you.

176
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,782
So let's get married.

177
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,359
If it turns out to be a disaster,
it'll be a disaster.

178
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,329
We'll shake hands and say goodbye.

179
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,565
He's giving her dimethyltryptamine.

180
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,599
It takes effect in about a minute
and she'll trip out for about half an hour.

181
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:16,544
Do you feel different now?

182
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:19,613
Less anxious?

183
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:21,688
Much less.

184
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,924
Do you have any special feelings?

185
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:25,285
I feel...

186
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:28,891
...like my heart is being touched by Christ.

187
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,077
There's a lot of religious delusion
among acute schizophrenics.

188
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,544
Some guys say schizophrenics are
physically different from the rest of us.

189
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,181
It's almost as if they were trying
to change their physical selves to...

190
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,918
...adapt to their schizophrenic image
of themselves.

191
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,228
All right, we'll get married,
since it's that important to you.

192
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,799
I'm not comfortable with women...

193
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:15,742
...and I'm not likely to find anyone
half as remarkable as you again.

194
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,111
I think I can make
a reasonably good husband.

195
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,480
I don't want to lose you, you see.

196
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:30,154
I suppose that's the closest thing to
a declaration of love I'll ever get out of you.

197
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:43,968
Am I really that weird in bed?

198
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:45,403
Sometimes.

199
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,276
Shall I try to change?

200
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,243
No, I kind of like it.

201
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:18,064
-Daddy, I'm tired.
-We'll give the little lady a ride!

202
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,505
Hey, Mason, be careful.

203
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,201
How you doin', Eddie?

204
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:23,904
Hi, Mason. How about a beer?

205
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:33,585
-If I didn't see this, I wouldn't believe it!
-You were supposed to come next week!

206
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,304
Look at the family man!
Oh, Eddie, you look so good!

207
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:50,360
I don't believe it.

208
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,600
Not again? When did this happen?

209
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,198
Well, it's a long story.

210
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,344
Have you found a place yet?

211
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:59,105
We got a nice little place
near Huntington Field.

212
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,510
We moved to San Francisco
seven years ago.

213
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,414
Arthur is going to teach at Boston U.

214
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:04,984
I can't believe it's been seven years.

215
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:07,180
I hear you just got associate professor.

216
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:09,013
You guys must be loaded!

217
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:11,992
We've got a place in Maine
you can use for the summer.

218
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,551
I'm going to Africa again in June.
Eddie will be in Mexico.

219
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,258
Do you know a guy named Eccheverria,
University of Mexico?

220
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:18,560
Says he worked with you.

221
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,033
Sure. A very bright young guy.

222
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:22,866
He's here at the Botanical Museum.
We'll all have to get together.

223
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:25,338
I'm going back to Mexico with him in June.

224
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:26,396
What's in Mexico?

225
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,774
Eccheverria's got this witch doctor
down there, the Hinchi Indians.

226
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,672
They're an isolated tribe in Central Mexico
who still practice...

227
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:36,411
...the ancient Toltec rituals, sacred
mushroom ceremonies, that kind of thing.

228
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:39,186
Apparently they use some kind
of hallucinatory drug...

229
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:42,451
...that is supposed to evoke
a common experience in all users.

230
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,620
Maggie has fallen asleep on the couch.
Will you take care of her?

231
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,364
Did you ever get into an isolation tank
since New York?

232
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,763
No. Did you?

233
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,631
No, but I just found out
there's one here at the Medical School.

234
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,570
I didn't think anybody was doing
those kind of studies anymore.

235
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,630
We did some interesting stuff in that tank...

236
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,233
...in New York for the few months
we played around with it.

237
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,280
Maybe when I get back from Mexico
we'll get into it again.

238
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,541
Why not?

239
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,154
A terrific housekeeper she's not.

240
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:21,294
They're getting a divorce, you know.

241
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:24,698
-I don't know if they're getting--
-What are you talking about?

242
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,927
She and the kids are moving to Cambridge.

243
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:28,401
That's why this place is such a mess.

244
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,904
They're moving her stuff
into storage tomorrow.

245
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,011
Then she's going off to Africa
for a year with the kids.

246
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,842
And he's going to Mexico.

247
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:42,472
When she comes back, she's going
to live in Cambridge and he's staying here.

248
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,212
It's he who wants the divorce, not her.

249
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:46,652
I'm surprised they stayed together
this long.

250
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,321
When did all this happen?

251
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,324
She just told me five minutes ago.

252
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:54,026
What about the letters she kept writing us
about how happy they were?

253
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:57,327
Don't ask me. She's still crazy about him.
He's still crazy.

254
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:11,502
Sylvia just told me
you're getting a divorce.

255
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,142
We're getting separated.

256
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,242
We probably won't get around
to the divorce until next year.

257
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,415
I know it's none of my business, but why?

258
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:23,947
You're married to a great woman
who adores you.

259
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,290
My God, if anybody has it made, you have.

260
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,355
You're a respected and admired figure...

261
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,628
...a full professor on the faculty
of the Harvard Medical School.

262
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:37,294
For God's sake, is that how you imagine
me? A respected and admired figure?

263
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,967
A devoted father? A loving husband?

264
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:43,808
Well, I've also published nearly two papers
a year for the last seven years...

265
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:46,473
...and not a fundamental piece of work
in the lot.

266
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:50,550
I sit around the living rooms
of other young married faculty members...

267
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,248
...talking infantile masturbation, who's
sucking up to the head of the department...

268
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:56,654
...whose tenure is hanging by a thread.

269
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,520
Emily is content to go on with this life.

270
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:02,221
She insists she's in love with me,
whatever that is.

271
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:05,226
What she means is
she prefers the senseless pain...

272
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,858
...we inflict on each other to the pain...

273
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:09,301
...we would otherwise inflict on ourselves...

274
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,470
...but I'm not afraid of that solitary pain.

275
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:18,170
If I don't strip myself of all this clatter
and clutter and ridiculous ritual...

276
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,741
...I shall go out of my fucking mind!

277
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,044
Does that answer your question, Arthur?

278
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,518
What question was that?

279
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,519
You asked me why I was getting divorced.

280
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,318
Listen, it's your life.

281
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,156
I'm sorry I even asked.

282
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:37,156
Why don't I call Eccheverria
and we'll all go out and have some dinner?

283
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:42,660
As a matter of fact, Eduardo,
my year in India was disappointing.

284
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:44,204
No matter how you slice it...

285
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:46,866
...yoga's a state-specific technology
operating in the service of...

286
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,341
...an a piori belief system....

287
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,403
We scientists have a moral obligation to
the public as well as to our own research.

288
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,009
It just never occurred to baboons...

289
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:57,848
...that they could shorten that time
to five minutes if they used a stick.

290
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:03,181
Originally, man was just another
savanna-living primate like the baboon.

291
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:08,194
What dignifies the yogic practices is the
belief system itself is not truly religious.

292
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:11,963
There is no Buddhist god, per se.

293
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:16,800
It is the Self, the individual Mind, that
contains immortality and ultimate Truth.

294
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:18,800
What is not religious about that?

295
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,104
You've simply replaced God
with the original Self.

296
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:22,370
Yes, but we've localized it.

297
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:24,503
Now I know where the Self is.
It's in our own minds.

298
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:27,912
It's a form of human energy.
Our atoms are six billion years old.

299
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:31,475
We've got six billion years
of memory in our minds.

300
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:34,615
Memory is energy! It doesn't disappear!
It's still in there!

301
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:37,556
There's a physiological pathway
to our earlier consciousnesses.

302
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:40,652
There has to be.
It's in the goddamned limbic system.

303
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,390
Jessup, you're a whacko!

304
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,599
What's whacko about it?
I'm a man in search of his true Self.

305
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,999
How archetypically American can you get?

306
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:50,762
Everybody's looking for their true selves.

307
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,330
We're all trying to fulfill ourselves...

308
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:56,310
...understand ourselves,
get in touch with ourselves...

309
00:24:56,378 --> 00:25:00,678
...face the reality of ourselves,
explore ourselves, expand ourselves.

310
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,473
Ever since we dispensed with God...

311
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:06,681
...we've got nothing but ourselves
to explain this meaningless horror of life.

312
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:07,981
You're whacko.

313
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,420
Well, I think that the true Self...

314
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:17,724
...that original Self, that first Self,
is a real, mensurate, quantifiable thing...

315
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:20,830
...tangible and incarnate...

316
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,038
...and I'm going to find the fucker.

317
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:50,296
What are their chemical properties?

318
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,122
Are they safe?

319
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:56,762
The mushrooms are almost
certainly amanita muscaria...

320
00:25:57,172 --> 00:26:00,699
...a very powerful psychedelic
and a little dangerous.

321
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:04,573
It contains belladonna, alkaloids...

322
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:07,005
...atropine, scopolamine.

323
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:10,582
The sinicuiche plant is highly regarded...

324
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,485
...among a number of Indian tribes.

325
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,580
I've seen it as far north as Chihuahua.

326
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:18,591
The Indians say it evokes old memories...

327
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:21,154
...event ancient ones...

328
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:25,260
...and the Hinchis call it The First Flower.

329
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,227
The first in the sense of primordial?

330
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:30,497
Yes.

331
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,807
In the sense of the most ancient.

332
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:35,139
I'd like to try it.

333
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:39,707
Do you think they would
let me join in their ritual?

334
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:43,179
Well, they seem like agreeable people.

335
00:26:56,665 --> 00:27:00,226
Est todo bien para ti
participar en la ceremonia.

336
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,968
He says it's all right for you
to participate in their ceremony.

337
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:07,798
Ask him what kind of an experience
I can expect.

338
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,542
Are they gathering these mushrooms
for the ritual?

339
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:12,807
No, they're being harvested for next year.

340
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,911
Qué clase de experiencia
puede esperar mi amigo?

341
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:24,216
Su alma regresar a su primera alma.

342
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,157
Your soul will return to the First Soul.

343
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,554
Ask him what this First Soul will look like.

344
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,429
_Cómo es la primera alma?

345
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,169
Es la Materia Increada.

346
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,204
It is Unborn Stuff.

347
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:43,734
Entonces, usted se lanzará en el vacío....

348
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:47,137
Then you will propel into the void.

349
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,349
Usted verá una mancha.

350
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:51,308
You will see a spot.

351
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,551
La mancha se convertiráen una grieta.

352
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,220
The spot will become a crack.

353
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:00,219
Esta es la Grieta Entre la Nada...

354
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,729
This is the Crack Between the Nothing...

355
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:06,265
De esta Nada saldr su Alma Increada.

356
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:09,628
...and out of this Nothing will come
your Unborn Soul.

357
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,203
Dígale que extienda la palma de la mano.

358
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,743
He wants you to hold the root.
Put out your hand with your palm up.

359
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:42,486
Are you all right?

360
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,331
We only have their word I killed a lizard.

361
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,364
You didn't see it
and I have no recollection of it!

362
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,731
This whole hideous business is
just a joke...

363
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,868
...the Indians have played on me
to make the gringo look like a fool!

364
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:13,880
Look, you asked me what happened
and I told you!

365
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:16,812
You drank the mixture
and you went outside.

366
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,846
After a while there was a scream
and some dogs were barking.

367
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,411
I shouted after you.

368
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:24,216
The screaming stopped.
The brujo yelled at me to come back.

369
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:25,316
Oh, bullshit!

370
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,922
Then why did you ask the brujo to give you
the mixture to take back to Boston?

371
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,023
I thought I'd like Arthur to analyze,
maybe synthesize, it.

372
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:37,661
The noise is stupefying.

373
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:01,986
The sun became black...

374
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:04,124
...as sack cloth.

375
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:12,364
The full moon became like blood.

376
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,369
Then a great mountain burning with fire...

377
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:22,979
...was thrown into the sea.

378
00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:33,254
Then the beast ascends
from the bottomless pit.

379
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:37,659
The angel of the bottomless pit.
His name is...

380
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,164
...Abaddon.

381
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,667
He's off the wall!

382
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:49,832
Are you okay?

383
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,935
Get this stuff! It's new!

384
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,946
It's deafening! The noise is deafening!

385
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,048
Can you hear me above this noise?

386
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:01,686
The most unbelievable thing I've seen!

387
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,621
I'm watching the birth agony
of a mountain!

388
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,386
Oh, my God.

389
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:08,826
Are you okay?

390
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:13,528
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

391
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,702
Do you want me to bring you down now?

392
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,229
What happens now?

393
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:23,538
He's blacked out.
These blackouts can get pretty freaky.

394
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,545
Sometimes they last as long as four hours.

395
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,174
When he comes out of it, he's as chipper
as a bird, but he doesn't remember a thing.

396
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,242
Just how dangerous is this stuff
he brought back from Mexico?

397
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:34,310
I didn't say dangerous,
just said it was weird.

398
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:35,480
It hangs around too long...

399
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:38,684
...and what's really screwy is
it heads straight for the brain.

400
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,851
Well, I don't believe this.

401
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:45,062
You guys are shooting up with an untested
drug that stacks up in the brain...

402
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,226
...and works in the nucleus of the cell
and you don't call that dangerous?

403
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,294
For the record, we don't actually shoot up.

404
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:54,003
-Eddie drinks a 10-milligram....
-It will stop now!

405
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:56,236
You guys are supposed to be
reputable scientists...

406
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,507
...not two kids in the dorm freaking out
on Mexican mushrooms!

407
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,882
Why do you think I called you for?
Let's see you stop him.

408
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:12,583
This ain't LSD, goddamnit!

409
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:15,253
This is no serotonin antagonist
you're drinking!

410
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,427
How many grams of that stuff
you think you've got in you?

411
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,023
Two? Three?

412
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:23,293
You could be working up
one hell of a case of cancer...

413
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,133
...with all the antimetabolites in you.

414
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:28,801
The Hinchis have been drinking that stuff
for centuries with no incidence of cancer.

415
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:30,207
Fuck the Hinchi Indians!

416
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:32,142
You don't know anything
about those mushrooms!

417
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:33,976
They seem to have
fantastic staying powers!

418
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,948
We've shot up at least 30 rats
with that stuff.

419
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,950
Some of them have
a whopping load in them...

420
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,486
...and none of them have been
noticeably affected.

421
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:43,146
Where are we going?
We were going to get something to eat.

422
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:44,657
Eddie wants to show me an isolation tank.

423
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:48,456
Isolation tank! You guys get flakier
every time I talk to you!

424
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:51,427
I thought all that isolation tank stuff
went out in the '60s...

425
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,626
...with Timothy Leary
and all them other gurus!

426
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,727
Will you shut up for a minute
and let somebody else say something?

427
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,601
What happens during
these blackout periods is...

428
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:00,731
...you get the feeling
of phenomenal acceleration...

429
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:03,936
...Iike you're being shot out over millions,
billions of years.

430
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:05,603
Time simply obliterates.

431
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:08,846
You sense the hallucination is going on,
but you get no images.

432
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,713
I want to break through
that blackout barrier.

433
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:14,618
I want to know what those images are
that I know are going on but I can't see.

434
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:18,124
We can't raise the dosage of the drug
because we're close to toxic levels now.

435
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:20,524
The only way to intensify
the experience is...

436
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:22,528
...to take the 200 milligrams
along with the tank.

437
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:25,326
There's more I'd like to do to that drug
before you take it again.

438
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,866
I'd like to do a half-life determination.

439
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:28,697
-That would take us a year!
-I'd like to know the transport system.

440
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:30,361
I'd like to find some analogues.

441
00:41:30,437 --> 00:41:33,065
This Mexican stuff
is an extraordinary substance...

442
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,337
...and every instinct I have tells me
I'm onto something hot here...

443
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,402
...and another 200 milligrams
isn't going to kill anybody.

444
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:42,808
There it is.

445
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:47,981
Oh, it's horizontal.

446
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:52,287
It's smaller than the one
we had in New York.

447
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,458
If they're doing sleep studies, it must be....

448
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:59,124
I don't think anybody's used it in years,
but I checked it out yesterday and it works.

449
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,633
It won't take a week
to get this place cleaned.

450
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:01,668
You could get your ass in a sling...

451
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:04,465
...if it ever gets out you're using
an untested drug on human subjects.

452
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:06,631
Don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to me.

453
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:07,865
Let's get a quick hamburger.

454
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,341
I'm seeing one of my students tonight.

455
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,342
All right!

456
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:15,081
Do what you want to do.
I think you're both irresponsible as hell!

457
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:19,317
Don't call me and tell me you're worried
about Eddie putting all this shit into him!

458
00:42:19,386 --> 00:42:22,446
I'm telling you, don't you put
any more of that shit into him...

459
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:24,616
...until you know a hell of a lot more
about it!

460
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:27,718
I've offered you the use of my lab
and all the rats you can cut!

461
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,628
That's as much as I want to be implicated
in your dumb experiments!

462
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:31,824
Go get your own dumb hamburger.

463
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:34,663
I've already got my own date
I'm an hour late for!

464
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,772
I already did these first three.
You do the rest.

465
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:02,154
Couldn't resist, right?

466
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:05,232
Well, somebody's got to keep his eye
on you two sorcerers.

467
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,460
What have you got in there,
some kind of salt solution?

468
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:11,902
Ten percent magnesium sulfate,
for buoyancy.

469
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,968
Weird, man.

470
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,617
One, two, three, four.

471
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:27,113
One, two, three, four.

472
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,347
Okay, you're fine.

473
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:32,948
Wednesday, January 7th, 4:28 P. M.

474
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:35,962
Hey, this is terrific!

475
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,327
He went into theta like a shot.
No spindling, nothing.

476
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:43,964
Grasslands, savannas.

477
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:47,606
I feel...

478
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:50,773
...I am actually alive
and inside this landscape.

479
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:54,972
A density of woodlands about a mile away.

480
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,041
Beyond that,
mountains that seem to be smoking.

481
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:01,553
Newly born mountains,
Cenozoic, latter Tertiary.

482
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:05,251
I'm in an edge-area.

483
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:07,958
Utter tranquility, but alive.

484
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:10,553
Life in the trees. Life in the sedge.

485
00:44:11,498 --> 00:44:12,556
Oh, my God...

486
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,199
...the birth of man. That's got to be it!

487
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,136
My God! There it is...
