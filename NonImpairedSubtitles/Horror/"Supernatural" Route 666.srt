00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,961
Previously on Supernatural:

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,504
Sammy.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,298
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Go!

4
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,470
Dad's on a hunting trip.

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,389
And he hasn't been home
in a few days.

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,060
This is Dad's book.

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,062
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,189
You know, saving people,
hunting things.

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,983
The family business.

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,192
I gotta find Dad.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,111
It's the only thing I can think about.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,074
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

13
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,455
With temperatures hitting below zero...

14
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,833
...we've got an unseasonably cold front
setting throughout the county.

15
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,378
We've got some pretty rough going
reportedly on I-55...

16
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,840
...with winds out of the north
at 40 miles an hour--

17
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,315
What the...?

18
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,509
Republicans are
$1 0 billion away from a budget deal...

19
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:37,304
...fighting over what seems
like a ton of money....

20
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,385
I think I found a way we can bypass
that construction east of here.

21
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,763
We might even make Pennsylvania
faster than we thought.

22
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,348
Yeah.

23
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,018
The problem is, we're not
going to Pennsylvania.

24
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,853
We what?

25
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,772
I just got a call from an old friend.

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,317
Her father was killed,
might be our kind of thing.

27
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,944
-What?
-Yeah. Believe me...

28
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,240
...she never would've called, never,
if she didn't need us.

29
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,952
Come on. You coming or what?

30
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,591
By "old friend," you mean...?

31
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,593
A friend that's not new.

32
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,345
Yeah, thanks.

33
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,972
So her name's Cassie, huh?

34
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,099
You never mentioned her.

35
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,768
-Didn't I?
-No.

36
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,437
-Yeah, we went out.
-You mean you dated somebody?

37
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,981
For more than one night?

38
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,151
Am l speaking a language
you're not getting here?

39
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,278
Dad and l were working a job in Ohio.

40
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,782
She was finishing up college.
We went out for a couple of weeks.

41
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,201
And...?

42
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,538
Look, it's terrible about her dad...

43
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,124
...but kind of sounds
like a standard car accident.

44
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,460
I'm not seeing how it fits
with what we do.

45
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,714
Which, by the way,
how does she know what we do?

46
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,429
You told her.
You told her, the secret.

47
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,223
Our big family rule number one:

48
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,475
We do what we do
and we shut up about it.

49
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,727
For a year l do nothing
but lie to Jessica.

50
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,438
You go out with this chick
in Ohio a couple times...

51
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,857
...and you tell her everything?

52
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,111
-Dean.
-Yeah. Looks like.

53
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,577
lt's a newspaper we put out,
not a bulletin for the mayor's office.

54
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,707
Get off your soap box, Jimmy.
I'm urging a little discretion, is all.

55
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,293
I think you're telling us
what you want us to print...

56
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,712
...and what you want us to sit on.

57
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,463
I know you're upset, Cassie.

58
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,799
I liked your dad a lot...

59
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,510
...but l think your grief
is clouding your judgment.

60
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,262
Two black people were killed...

61
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,723
...on the road in the same way
in three weeks.

62
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,975
Jimmy, you're too close to this.

63
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,394
Those guys were friends of yours.

64
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,816
Again, l'm very sorry for your loss.

65
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,703
Dean.

66
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,330
Hey, Cassie.

67
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,464
This is my brother, Sam.

68
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,928
-l'm sorry about your dad.
-Yeah.

69
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,723
Me too.

70
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,105
My mother's in pretty bad shape.
I've been staying with her.

71
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:01,735
I wish she wouldn't go off by herself.
She's been so nervous and frightened.

72
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,030
-She was worried about Dad.
-Why?

73
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,991
-He was scared. He was seeing things.
-Like what?

74
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,995
He swore he saw an awful-looking
black truck following him.

75
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,373
A truck? Who was the driver?

76
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,876
He didn't talk about a driver.
Just the truck.

77
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,462
He said it would appear and disappear.

78
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,006
And, in the accident,
Dad's truck was dented...

79
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,551
...like it'd been slammed into
by something big.

80
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,430
Thanks. Now, you're sure
this dent wasn't there before?

81
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,600
He sold cars. Always drove a new one.

82
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,685
There wasn't a scratch on that thing.

83
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,772
It had rained hard that night.
There was mud everywhere.

84
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,858
There was a distinct set
of muddy tracks...

85
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,445
...from Dad's car leading right...

86
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,074
...to the edge where he went over.

87
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,870
One set of tracks. His.

88
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,958
-The first was a friend of your father's?
-Best friend. Clayton Soames.

89
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,419
They owned
the car dealership together.

90
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,588
Same thing. Dent. No tracks.

91
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,383
And the cops said exactly
what they said about Dad:

92
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,968
"He lost control of his car."

93
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,054
Any reason why your father
and his partner might be targets?

94
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,558
-No.
-This truck ran them off the road?

95
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,894
When you say it aloud like that....

96
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,650
Listen, l'm a little skeptical
about this ghost stuff...

97
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,903
...or whatever it is you guys are into.

98
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,240
Skeptical? lf I remember,
I think you said l was nuts.

99
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,034
-That was then.
-Hmm.

100
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,957
I just know l can't explain
what happened up there.

101
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,959
So l called you.

102
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,753
Mom.

103
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,464
Where have you been? l was....

104
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,134
I had no idea
you had invited friends over.

105
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,388
Mom, this is Dean,
a friend of mine from college.

106
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,850
And his brother, Sam.

107
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,020
Well, l won't interrupt you.

108
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,563
Mrs. Robinson.

109
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,774
We're sorry for your loss.

110
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,736
We'd like to talk to you for a minute,
if you don't mind.

111
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,656
I'm really not up to that just now.

112
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,422
Jimmy meant something to this town.

113
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,968
He was one of our best.
We won't be the same without him.

114
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,887
Our best seem to be dropping like flies.

115
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,765
Clayton, my father, Jimmy.

116
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,309
What is it exactly you want me to do?

117
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,646
How about closing
this section of road, for starters.

118
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,524
Close the main road,
the only road in and out of town?

119
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,487
Accidents do happen, Cassie.
That's what they are. Accidents.

120
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,740
Did the cops check for additional
denting? See if it was pushed?

121
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,451
-Who's this?
-Dean and Sam Winchester.

122
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,080
Family friends.
This is Mayor Harold Todd.

123
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,249
There's one set of tire tracks. One.

124
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,334
Doesn't point to foul play.

125
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,671
Mayor, the police and town
officials take their cues from you.

126
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,631
-lf you're indifferent--
-lndifferent?

127
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,509
Would you close the road
if the victims were white?

128
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,555
You suggesting l'm racist, Cassie.

129
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,932
I'm the last person
you should talk to like that.

130
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,642
And why is that?

131
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,103
Why don't you ask your mother?

132
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,236
I'll say this for her, she's fearless.

133
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,654
Mm-hm.

134
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,616
Bet she kicked your ass
a couple times.

135
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,662
What's interesting is, you guys never
look at each other at the same time.

136
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,081
You look at her
when she's not looking...

137
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,334
...she checks you out
when you look away.

138
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:34,215
It's just an interesting observation
in a, you know...

139
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,343
...observationally interesting way.

140
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,095
You think we might have
more pressing issues here?

141
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,389
Hey, if l'm hitting a nerve--

142
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,725
Let's go.

143
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,992
Excuse me, are you Ron Stubbins?

144
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,869
You were friends
with Jimmy Anderson?

145
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,580
-Who are you?
-Mr. Anderson's insurance company.

146
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,248
Here to dot l's and cross T's.

147
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,294
We were wondering, had the deceased
mentioned any unusual experiences?

148
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,548
-What do you mean, "unusual"?
-Well, visions, hallucinations.

149
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,968
It's all part of a medical examination
kind of thing. Very standard.

150
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,931
-What company you say you're with?
-All National Mutual.

151
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,394
Tell me, did he ever mention
seeing a truck? Big, black truck?

152
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,939
What the hell you talking about?
You even speaking English?

153
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,359
Son, this truck,
a big, scary monster-looking thing?

154
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,902
Yeah, actually, l think so.

155
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,113
Hmm.

156
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,449
-What?
-l have heard of a truck like that.

157
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,368
You have?

158
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,954
-Where?
-Not where, when.

159
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,332
Back in the '60s,
there was a string of deaths.

160
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,251
Black men.

161
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:56,047
Story goes, they disappeared
in a big, nasty black truck.

162
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,342
-They ever catch the guy who did it?
-Never found him.

163
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,304
Hell, not sure they even really looked.

164
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,515
See, there was a time...

165
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,771
...this town wasn't too friendly
to all its citizens.

166
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,609
Thank you.

167
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,032
-Truck.
-Keeps coming up, doesn't it?

168
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,785
I was thinking.
You heard of the Flying Dutchman?

169
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,998
Yeah, a ghost ship, infused with
the captain's spirit. It was part of him.

170
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,751
So, what if we're dealing
with a phantom truck?

171
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,920
The extension of some bastard ghost
re-enacting past crimes.

172
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,089
The victims have all been black men.

173
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,551
I think it's more than that.
They all seem connected to Cassie.

174
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,012
All right. Well, you work that angle.

175
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,805
-Go talk to her.
-Yeah, I will.

176
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,683
Oh, and, you might also
want to mention that other thing.

177
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,604
-What other thing?
-The serious unfinished business.

178
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,650
Dean, what is going on
between you two?

179
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,862
We were a little bit
more involved than l said.

180
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,781
Oh, okay.

181
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,408
Okay, a lot more. Maybe.

182
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,453
I told her the secret about what we do
and l shouldn't have.

183
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,456
Look, man, everybody's gotta
open up to someone sometime.

184
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,999
Yeah, l don't.

185
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,085
It was stupid to get that close.
I mean, look how it ended.

186
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,839
Would you stop?

187
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,134
Blink or something.

188
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,303
You loved her.

189
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,472
Oh, God.

190
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,308
You were in love with her,
but you dumped her?

191
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,979
Oh, wow.

192
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,108
She dumped you.

193
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:43,279
Get in the car.

194
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,129
Dean.
-Hey.

195
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,508
Hey. Come on in.

196
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,888
So you busy or...?

197
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,890
The paper's doing a tribute to Jimmy.

198
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,477
Uh, I was just going
through his stuff...

199
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,563
...his awards.

200
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,023
Trying to find the words.

201
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,320
-That's gotta be tough.
-This family owned the paper.

202
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,115
The Dorians?
They had a whites-only staff policy.

203
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,243
After they sold it,
Jimmy became the first black reporter.

204
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,413
He didn't stop until he became editor.

205
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,040
He taught me everything.

206
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,542
Where's your brother?

207
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,963
Not here.

208
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,340
All right. So, what brings you here?

209
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,426
Trying to find the connection.

210
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,762
By the way, did you talk to your mom
about Todd not being racist?

211
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,264
I did.

212
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,475
-She didn't wanna talk about it.
-Right.

213
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,690
So just then,
why'd you ask where my brother was?

214
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,152
-Nothing. Not important.
-Because without him here...

215
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,321
...it's you and me,
not you, me and Sam...

216
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,032
-...which would be easier?
-lt's not easier.

217
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,451
-Look, I--
-No. Forget it. It's fine.

218
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,454
We'll keep it strictly business.

219
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,000
I forgot you do that.

220
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,710
Do what?

221
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,211
Oh...

222
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,715
...whenever we get--
What's the word, "close"?

223
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,344
Anywhere in the neighborhood
of emotional vulnerability, you back off.

224
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,805
Or make some joke. Or find
any way to shut the door on me.

225
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,475
Oh, that's hilarious.

226
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,478
-l'm not the one who took that door.
-Wait a minute.

227
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,648
-Who took the key and buried it.
-We done with this metaphor?

228
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,567
I was totally up-front with you
and you nailed me with it.

229
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,654
The guy l'm with, the guy
I'm hoping might be in my future...

230
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,657
-...tells me he pops ghosts.
-Those aren't the words I used.

231
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,368
-He has to leave to work with his father.
-l did.

232
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,579
If you want out, fine,
don't tell me this insane story.

233
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,416
It was the truth. It didn't sound insane
the minute you thought l could help.

234
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,502
I thought you just wanted to dump me.

235
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,756
Whoa, let's not forget
who dumped who, okay?

236
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,300
-l thought it's what you wanted.
-Well, it wasn't.

237
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,469
-l didn't mean to hurt you.
-Well, you did.

238
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,429
-l'm sorry.
-Yeah, me too.

239
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,637
We should fight more often.

240
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,931
Absolutely.

241
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,559
Actually, we were always pretty
good at fighting.

242
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,938
This we were good at.

243
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,483
It's all the other stuff, not so much.

244
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,610
Hey, I tried.

245
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,780
I told you who l really was.

246
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,281
That was a big first for me.

247
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,325
Why'd you tell me?

248
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,494
I don't know.

249
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,581
I....

250
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,959
I guess I couldn't lie to you.

251
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,713
Dean.

252
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,134
You told me that story...

253
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,638
...it scared the hell out of me.
I thought you were nuts.

254
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,849
Dangerous even.

255
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,726
Actually...

256
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,773
...maybe l was looking
for a reason to walk away.

257
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,985
In my work...

258
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,280
...l see some horrible things.

259
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,323
Things that can't be explained.

260
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,367
I deal with them.

261
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,120
But working things out with you?

262
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,165
-l'm a scary one, all right.
-Hmm.

263
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,967
Well, usually things get worked out...

264
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,970
...when you really want them to.

265
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:49,437
Yeah, but l'm still really involved
with my dad's work.

266
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,108
No more excuses, okay?

267
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,611
From you or me.

268
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,363
Okay.

269
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,173
Yeah?

270
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,885
You're kidding.

271
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,017
He's with me.

272
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,145
Where were you last night?

273
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,816
-You didn't make it back to the motel.
-Well....

274
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,443
You guys worked things out?

275
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,779
We'll be working things out
when we're 90.

276
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,864
-So, what happened?
-Every bone crushed.

277
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,699
Internal organs turned to pudding.

278
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,494
The cops are stumped.
It's like something ran him over.

279
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,204
-Something like a truck?
-Yep.

280
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,581
-Tracks?
-Nope.

281
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,459
-What was the mayor doing here?
-He owned the property.

282
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,171
-Bought it a few weeks ago.
-But he's white, doesn't fit the pattern.

283
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,883
Killings didn't happen up on the road.
That doesn't fit, either.

284
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,225
-Here.
-Thanks.

285
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,186
I'm trying to find some link
between the '60s and now.

286
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,522
There wasn't a lot about it
in the paper.

287
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,984
Not surprising.
Probably minimal police work too.

288
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:22,280
Back then, equal justice under the law
wasn't too literal around here.

289
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,493
-- Yeah?
- The records...

290
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,454
...show that Mr. Mayor
bought an abandoned property.

291
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,708
The previous owner was the Dorian
family for, like, 150 years.

292
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,376
-Dorian?
-Yeah.

293
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,045
Didn't the Dorian family
used to own this paper?

294
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,257
Along with most everything else.
Real pillars of the town.

295
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,301
Right, right.

296
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,680
-That's interesting.
-What?

297
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,265
This Cyrus Dorian.

298
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,351
He vanished in April of '63.

299
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,354
The case was investigated,
but never solved.

300
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,732
That's the time the murders
were going on.

301
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,068
I pulled paper up on the Dorian place.
Must've been in bad shape...

302
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,611
-...when the mayor bought it.
-Why?

303
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:07,033
-The first thing he did was bulldoze.
-Mayor Todd knocked down the place?

304
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:12,663
It was a big deal. One of the oldest local
houses left. He made the front page.

305
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,332
You got a date?

306
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,960
Uh, the 3rd of last month.

307
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,383
Mayor Todd bulldozed
the Dorian family home on the 3rd.

308
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,428
The first killing was
the very next day.

309
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,680
Dean. Dean!

310
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,189
Maybe you could throw
a couple shots in that.

311
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,733
You didn't see who was
driving the truck?

312
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,363
It seemed to be no one.

313
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,325
Everything was moving so fast.

314
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,705
And then it was just gone.

315
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,541
Why didn't it kill us?

316
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,419
Whatever's controlling the truck
wants you afraid first.

317
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,381
Mrs. Robinson, Cassie said that...

318
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,551
...your husband saw the truck
before he died.

319
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,930
-Mom?
-Mm-hm.

320
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,726
Oh, Martin was under a lot of stress.

321
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,437
You can't be sure about
what he was seeing.

322
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,606
After tonight,
we can be reasonably sure...

323
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,399
...that he was seeing a truck.

324
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,777
What happened tonight,
you and Cassie are marked.

325
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,239
Okay? Your daughter could die.
So if you know something...

326
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,241
...now would be a good time to tell.

327
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,076
Dean--
- -Yes.

328
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,040
-Yes. He said he saw a truck.
-Did he know who it belonged to?

329
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,417
-He thought he did.
-Who was that?

330
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,422
Cyrus.

331
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,758
A man named Cyrus.

332
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,390
Is this Cyrus?

333
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:23,187
Cyrus Dorian died more
than 40 years ago.

334
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,233
How do you know he died,
Mrs. Robinson?

335
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,070
The paper said he went missing.

336
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,657
How do you know he died?

337
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,284
We were all very young.

338
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,622
I dated Cyrus a while.

339
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,582
I was also seeing Martin.

340
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,210
In secret, of course...

341
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:51,340
...because interracial couples
didn't go over too well then.

342
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:56,804
When I broke it off with Cyrus
and when he found out about Martin...

343
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,309
...l don't know, he changed.

344
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,729
His hatred.

345
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,148
His hatred was frightening.

346
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,443
-The string of murders.
-There were rumors.

347
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:15,656
People of color disappearing
into some kind of a truck.

348
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,120
Nothing was ever done.

349
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,377
Martin and....

350
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:36,552
Martin and l, we were gonna be married
in that little church near here.

351
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:42,349
But last minute, we decided to elope
because we didn't want the attention.

352
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,351
And Cyrus...?

353
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:56,572
The day we set for the wedding...

354
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,784
...was the day someone
set fire to the church.

355
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,378
There was a children's choir...

356
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,048
...practicing in there.

357
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,887
They all died.

358
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,600
-Did the attacks stop after that?
-No.

359
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,686
There was one more.

360
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:34,902
One night, that truck came for Martin.

361
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,030
Cyrus beat him something terrible.

362
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,372
But Martin, you see, Martin got loose.

363
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,751
And he started hitting Cyrus...

364
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,421
...and he just kept hitting him
and hitting him and....

365
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,351
Why didn't he call the cops?

366
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,775
This was 40 years ago.

367
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,445
He called on his friends...

368
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,115
...Clayton Soames
and Jimmy Anderson.

369
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,744
And they put Cyrus' body
into the truck...

370
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:29,123
...and rolled it into the swamp
at the edge of his land...

371
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:35,796
...and all three of them kept that secret
all these years.

372
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,259
-And now all three are gone.
-So is Mayor Todd.

373
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,640
Now, he said that you of all people
would know he's not a racist.

374
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,184
-Why would he say that?
-He was a good man.

375
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,479
He was a young deputy back then...

376
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,315
...investigating Cyrus' disappearance.

377
00:28:55,483 --> 00:29:00,821
Once he figured out what Martin
and the others had done...

378
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,909
...he did nothing.

379
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,457
Because he also knew
what Cyrus had done.

380
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:18,172
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l thought l was protecting them.

381
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:25,220
And now there's no one
left to protect.

382
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,723
Yes, there is.

383
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,816
Ah, my life was so simple.

384
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:42,529
Just school, exams...

385
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:47,534
...papers on polycentric cultural norms.

386
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,037
I guess I saved you
from a boring existence.

387
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,581
Yeah. Occasionally, l miss boring.

388
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,709
So this killer truck....

389
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,713
I miss conversations that didn't
start with "this killer truck."

390
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,343
-All right, so this Cyrus guy.
-Yeah.

391
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,387
Evil on a level that infected
even his truck.

392
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,057
When he died,
the swamp became his tomb...

393
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,226
...and his spirit was dormant
for 40 years.

394
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,062
-So, what woke it up?
-The construction on his house.

395
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,939
-Or the destruction.
-Right.

396
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:20,943
Demolition or remodeling can
awaken spirits, make them restless.

397
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,194
Mm-hm.

398
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,447
-Like that theater in lllinois?
-Yup.

399
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,742
And the guy who tears down
the family homestead, Harold Todd...

400
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,913
...is the same guy that kept
Cyrus' murder quiet and unsolved.

401
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,874
So now his spirit is awakened
and out for blood.

402
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,210
I guess. Who knows what
ghosts are thinking.

403
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,588
You know we're gonna have to dredge
that body up from the swamp.

404
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,258
-Man.
-You said it.

405
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,759
Yeah.

406
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,594
-Hey.
-Hey.

407
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,638
She's asleep.

408
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,267
-Now what?
-Well, you stay put and look after her...

409
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,602
...and we'll be back.
Don't leave the house.

410
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,939
Don't go getting all authoritative on me.
I hate it.

411
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,236
Don't leave the house, please?

412
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,791
You coming or what?

413
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,966
All right. Let's get her up.

414
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,262
All right.

415
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,097
Little more. Little more.

416
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,559
Little more.

417
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,853
All right, stop.

418
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,655
-Nice.
-Hell, yeah.

419
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,199
-Now l know what she sees in you.
-What?

420
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,368
Come on, admit it.
You're still in love with her.

421
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,997
-Aw, could we focus, please?
-l'm just saying, Dean.

422
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,667
Hold that.
-All right. What am l getting?

423
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,169
-Gas, flashlight.
-Got it.

424
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,004
-Let's get this done.
-All right.

425
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,839
Got it.

426
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,984
All right, let's get to it.

427
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,126
Think that'll do it?

428
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,134
I guess not.

429
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,935
-So burning the body had no effect?
-Sure it did.

430
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,980
-Now it's really pissed.
-But Cyrus' ghost is gone, right?

431
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,065
Not the part
that's fused with the truck.

432
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,651
-Where are you going?
-For a little ride.

433
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,319
-What?
-Lead that thing away.

434
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,154
That piece of crap, burn it.

435
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,490
-How am l supposed to burn it?
-l don't know.

436
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,867
Figure something out.

437
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,369
Figure something...?

438
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,702
-Give me a minute.
-l don't have a minute.

439
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,414
-What are we doing?
-Uh, let me get back to you.

440
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,334
Hey, Cassie? Hey, it's Sam.

441
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,463
Okay, l need some information
and it has to be exactly right.

442
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,384
All right.
-This better be good.

443
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,595
-Where are you?
-The middle of nowhere...

444
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,015
...with a killer truck on my ass.
It knows l put the torch to Cyrus.

445
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,101
Listen. lt's important.
I have to know exactly where you are.

446
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,479
Decatur Road, about two miles
off the highway.

447
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,314
-Okay. Headed east?
-Yes!

448
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,698
-You son of a bitch.
-Okay, turn right.

449
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,408
Up ahead, turn right.

450
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,333
-- You make the turn?
- I made it.

451
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,711
-Move this thing along a little faster.
-You see a road up ahead?

452
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,713
No. Wait.

453
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,590
-Yes. I see it.
-Okay, turn left.

454
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,550
What?

455
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,601
-All right. Now what?
-Go seven-tenths of a mile...

456
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,186
-...and stop.
-Stop?

457
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,105
Exactly seven-tenths, Dean.

458
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,524
Seven-tenths, seven-tenths.

459
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,473
-Dean, you still there?
-Yeah.

460
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,600
-What's happening?
-lt's staring at me.

461
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,519
-What do I do?
-What you are doing.

462
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,021
-Bringing it to you.
-Yeah.

463
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,623
Come on. Come on.

464
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,564
Dean? You still there?

465
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,192
Dean.

466
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:41,072
-Where did it go?
-Dean, you're where the church was.

467
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,242
-What church?
-The place Cyrus burned down.

468
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,578
-Murdered those kids.
-There's not a lot left.

469
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,789
Church ground is hallowed,
whether the church is there or not.

470
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,585
Evil spirits cross over hallowed ground,
sometimes they're destroyed.

471
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:57,923
So l figured maybe
that would get rid of it.

472
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,884
Maybe? Maybe?

473
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,638
-What if you were wrong?
-Huh.

474
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,099
Honestly, that thought
hadn't occurred to me.

475
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,606
"Well, it honestly didn't occur to me."

476
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,322
I'm gonna kill him.

477
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:35,168
My mother says to tell you
thanks again.

478
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,467
This is a better goodbye
than last time.

479
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,512
Yeah, well, maybe this time
it'll be a little less permanent.

480
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,765
You know what?

481
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,060
I'm a realist.

482
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,146
I don't see much hope for us, Dean.

483
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,194
Well, l've seen stranger things happen.

484
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,363
Hell of a lot stranger.

485
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,869
Goodbye, Dean.

486
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,915
I'll see you, Cassie.

487
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,917
I will.

488
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,931
-l like her.
-Yeah.

489
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,855
You meet someone like her,
ever make you wonder if it's worth it...

490
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,984
...putting everything else on hold,
doing what we do?

491
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,793
Why don't you wake me up
when it's my turn to drive?

492
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,073
