3
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,432
Hey, babe, what's up?

4
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:52,507
- What is that?
- Hello, baby.

5
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,983
Hi.

6
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,654
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yes.

7
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,657
I don't know what you think it is,
but whatever it is, it's sweet.

8
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:04,854
I think it's a giant-ass camera.
What happened to the Little hand held?

9
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:06,760
Easy to move around, versatile?

10
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,868
Are you going to park the car or you
going to stand there looking at me?

11
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,400
This is... big and impressive.

12
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:16,303
And it has a really bright Light on it.

13
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:19,002
- Kiss the camera, please.
- lama not kissing the camera.

14
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,306
How much did this cost you?

15
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:24,075
How much did...?
I値l kiss you, not the camera.

16
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,043
Turn that thing...

17
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,286
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, see.

18
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,488
You think this値l work?

19
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,857
I think we're going to have
a very interesting time,

20
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:41,057
capturing whatever paranormal
phenomena is occurring or not occurring.

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,828
Seriously, what'd you
throw down for that?

22
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,700
Well, about half as much
as I made today.

23
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,599
Good thing you're cute. Dinner?

24
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,544
- Just keep going up the stairs.
- Oh, my God.

25
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,541
- AlIright, l'Il make dinner.
- Good.

26
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:02,913
No. We're just going to film
whatever happens to us,

27
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:06,513
and then when any weird shit goes on,

28
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,323
we will be in a perfect position
to capture it for posterity.

29
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,661
Oh, so we can always, Like,
look back and remember fondly?

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,268
Well, you know, hopefully,
once we get it on camera,

31
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,871
- we can figure out what's going on.
- OK.

32
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,840
Once we know what's going on,
we can react appropriately.

33
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:29,011
- And...
- Take it from there.

34
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,815
Take care of it, whatever it is.
If it's one of those neighbours,

35
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,818
one of those kids
who's obsessed with you

36
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,549
and is trying to peep through a window
or something at night,

37
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,488
that will take care of them.

38
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:44,426
Unless that kid has been following me
since I was eight years old.

39
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,725
- Something pretty creepy.
- I don't think that's the thing.

40
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:47,855
You're telling me.

41
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:51,498
- You know, I realize that you're...
- Are you all right? Are you OK?

42
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:53,867
Are you doing OK?

43
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,469
- Are you talking to them...?
- Are you happy?

44
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,510
Do you have enough batteries?

45
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,705
You're supposed to be in love with me,
not the machine.

46
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,412
We are going to be sleeping
with this camera.

47
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,576
- We're going to what?
- Put it in the bed room.

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,085
All night?

49
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:11,947
You're cute.

50
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,688
Yeah.

51
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,295
That was shy. You looked away.

52
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,134
Dinny time.

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,674
- Test, audio test.
- This is the last test, right?

54
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,006
Yeah. Can you just please talk, please?

55
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:38,014
Hello, Micah. You're the
best boyfriend in the whole world,

56
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,345
- except for your strange fascination
- Video's good.

57
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,455
- with electronics.
- Katie, say something.

58
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:46,717
- What do you want me to say?
- Something really quiet.

59
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,417
What do you want me to say?

60
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,426
- Whisper.
- I am whispering.

61
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,690
- Can you hear me?
- Whisper.

62
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,891
- I am whispering.
- You're not whispering.

63
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,899
I am whispering now.

64
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,061
That's a whisper,
and I think we caught it on camera.

65
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,470
All right, sweet,
this microphone is worth the cash.

66
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,508
All right, we're operational, babe.

67
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:06,704
Sweet!

68
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:12,577
Do you know of any tricks
to make this stuff happen?

69
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:16,484
I don't want to make...
them, it, whatever...

70
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:18,283
I don't want it to happen at all.

71
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,984
So I don't want to force it to happen.

72
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:25,254
You know, if it catches something,
great, but lama not going to Like...

73
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,196
OK. I mean, lama just saying 'cause
you know, have it on camera

74
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,497
would be pretty cool
for a lot of reasons, sweetie.

75
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:32,831
- It would...
- I know.

76
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,736
-...substantiate your claims.
- You believe me, right?

77
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,399
Yeah, of course.

78
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:44,672
Hey.

79
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,093
What is that?

80
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,526
Let's investigate it.

81
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,967
We're hearing a weird sound.

82
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,442
You hear it?

83
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,009
Is it the fridge?

84
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,046
It's the icemaker.

85
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,215
Damn it!

86
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,627
It will only come out
when we sleep here.

87
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,495
I'd Like to take this moment

88
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:35,623
to illustrate the beauty
of this fine instrument.

89
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,796
I meant her. This is just my guitar.

90
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,132
You're sweet.

91
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,445
- What is this?
- I just Like your feet. They're sexy.

92
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,514
I need to repaint my toenails.

93
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,445
You shouldn't film my feet.

94
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,246
Sex type thing.
Can I get a Little striptease?

95
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,718
Please? Just a half of one.

96
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,018
Just bra and panties.

97
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,822
- No.
- All right. I値l do anything you want.

98
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:04,952
No.

99
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,587
BuIlshit.

100
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,735
Yeah, the Venus.
Hey, go back in your Venus pose.

101
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,601
No. So where are we going to put it?

102
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,638
You've got the bathroom or the hallway.

103
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,269
I think it should point down the hall,
that's where we heard its footsteps.

104
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,675
It's kind of dark.

105
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,608
You can't see me here?

106
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:29,585
- Not at all.
- What if I turn this one on?

107
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:32,155
Yeah, that's good.

108
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,488
- That's cool? Need more Light?
- No, I think you're fine.

109
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,687
- All right.
- Come check it out.

110
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,598
What happened with
putting the camera out here?

111
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,201
- We could get...
- It's got to get old, right?

112
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,434
Careful. You're about
to run into the shower.

113
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,340
We could get extracurricular with this.

114
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,844
I mentioned it before.

115
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,177
- We could... but no.
- OK.

116
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,784
Nice try, though.

117
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,717
I just want you to know
lama crying inside.

118
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,387
I'm putting this thing back.

119
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:10,393
OK, now hook up the FireWire.
Going off.

120
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,334
- Is it working?
- It is, or isn't?

121
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,128
Yeah, I think it's good.

122
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,375
Oh, God.

123
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,844
How am I supposed to
sleep with that?

124
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,614
It値l be fine.

125
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,172
It's looking at me.

126
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,812
This is what Katie looks Like
in the morning.

127
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,842
She is so pretty.

128
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,852
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Whatever. What the hell...

129
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:49,085
"Whatever" isn't an answer.
How about scrambled eggs?

130
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,493
- Sounds pretty good.
- Yeah? Good.

131
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,094
- Hey, babe?
- What?

132
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,000
Did you drop my keys on the floor?

133
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:01,895
Hold on.

134
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,872
My keys are in the middle of the floor.

135
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,034
I just... Look where I found my keys.

136
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,741
- Where did you leave them?
- I left them on the counter.

137
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,544
Are you sure?

138
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,620
Yes. I always leave them in
the same spot, next to your wallet.

139
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,482
Obviously, this is
incontrovertible evidence

140
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,618
that evil forces came from beyond
the grave to move your keys.

141
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,491
Make your breakfast.

142
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:31,630
That would be a 3.0 on the splash scale.

143
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,240
- What are you doing up there?
- lama filming you.

144
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,363
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

145
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:46,384
Very, very mature. I think that's my...

146
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:47,712
I got a big one!

147
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,187
I think that's my favourite quality
in you, it's your maturity.

148
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,622
Big day. It's the day of the psychic,
he's coming.

149
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,696
He should be here within the hour.

150
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,595
We're going to go find Micah
and see how he's feeling about it.

151
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,361
My guess? Very excited.

152
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:09,099
All right, tell me how excited
you are to meet our psychic.

153
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,905
- Who will be here within the hour.
- The doctor will be here? Great.

154
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,879
So excited, I can't contain myself.

155
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,985
Can't contain yourself?
Let it all out. Don't be shy.

156
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:26,024
I got something quite appropriate
for your psychic, though, I think.

157
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,150
- What?
- I just, you know, stumbled upon it.

158
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,591
Show me.

159
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:33,960
Maybe I値l play this when he gets here.
I think it値l make him feel at home.

160
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:41,672
You are totally not taking
this seriously, are you?

161
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,967
Don't you want to make him feel at home
and welcome in his own environment?

162
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:47,305
I mean, this way...

163
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:51,780
This is not going to make him feel at home.
This is going to make him leave.

164
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,044
We're not going to insult...
You, not me. You.

165
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,349
Don't you smile Like
you're so happy with yourself.

166
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:59,719
How 'bout less music?

167
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,348
That was good.

168
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:04,394
Is the psychic going to give me some
stock tips while he's here?

169
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,228
Haven't bet on the horses in awhile.

170
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,893
- Maybe if you're good.
- An opinion on the hundred-to-one shot?

171
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,367
- Stock?
- lama done with you.

172
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:15,439
So you'd think a psychic
would be on time.

173
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:20,211
You know, Like he could foretell
if the traffic was going to be bad?

174
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:21,676
You're clever.

175
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,875
Wait, let me get my music.

176
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,814
Don't you even think about
turning that on.

177
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,914
- Hi. Dr. Fredric痴?
- Yes. Hi.

178
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,115
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Come on in.

179
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:34,748
- This is Micah.
- Oh, hi. Micah.

180
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:36,087
I'm sorry for the camera.

181
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,594
So can you see ahead of, Like,
that kind of thing?

182
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,858
- Like know when traffic's going to be bad?
- Cut.

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,231
Oh, usually it depends on the day
of the week, or the time of the day.

184
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,632
- You know.
- Like all of us.

185
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,673
I never hesitate when somebody
says, "Wile you come to San Diego?"

186
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:51,332
I'm always ready to do that.

187
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,140
I'm certainly glad you could make the
trip today. We really do appreciate it.

188
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,305
I'd Like to spend time
getting to know you,

189
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:00,577
getting a bit more information
than what we shared over the phone.

190
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,914
Getting to know both of you,
what's your Life Like,

191
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,989
what's your relationship Like...

192
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,557
It's good.

193
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,718
- it痴 good? That's one good step.
- Straight to the point there.

194
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,420
How long have the two of you
been together?

195
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,928
- Three years.
- Three years?

196
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,556
We're engaged to be engaged
after she graduates.

197
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,433
- And your jobs? Both your jobs?
- I'm a student.

198
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,597
I'm an English major,
hoping to be a teacher soon.

199
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:27,405
I don't know where yet.
Micah is a day trader.

200
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,275
- Yeah.
- How about your health?

201
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,710
- We're in good health.
- And no medications involved?

202
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:35,012
- No.
- OK.

203
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,146
More often than not,
things that you've shared with me

204
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,990
can be explained away by simple things,
Like squeaky houses or rattling pipes

205
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,621
or you know,
some normal thing that's going on

206
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:52,169
that has people more freaked because
they're under a high degree of stress.

207
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:56,866
So... So this...
Let痴 call it a haunting,

208
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,443
has happened to you
before moving into this house.

209
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,709
Yes. It started when I was eight.

210
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,217
I, you know,
l Ivied with my family, of course,

211
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:12,084
and shared a room with my
younger sister, Christi. She was five.

212
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:18,185
And at that time we both, you know,
experienced whatever it was.

213
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,197
W e had... I would feel the breathing
and it would wake me up,

214
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,927
and I would wake her up.
And I would see the...

215
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:31,204
I guess you'd call it Like the, Like
just a mass, Like the shadowy figure

216
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,935
that would be at the foot of my bed.

217
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,478
It was always at the foot of my bed,
never at the foot of her bed.

218
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,844
- But she did see it.
- She saw it also?

219
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,419
Absolutely. And we were
both absolutely terrified.

220
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,989
- OK.
- I mean, you know, couldn't even move.

221
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:48,820
You know, you just...
It was just... It was horrifying.

222
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:52,089
And we would just pray.
Please, please let it just go away.

223
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,892
And then, eventually, it would.

224
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,728
So this happened for a while
in our first house.

225
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:00,497
And then we...
There was a fire. We managed...

226
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,405
Everyone got out, no one was hurt,
thank God... Thank goodness.

227
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,104
But we lost everything.
So we moved.

228
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,106
Was it ever determined
what caused the fire?

229
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,945
- No.
- OK.

230
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:17,715
And l... You know, lama not saying
it had to do with the haunting stuff.

231
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,450
I'm not saying that at all.
I don't know what it was.

232
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:24,028
Did the fire department do any
investigation of the causes of the fire?

233
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:26,460
I don't know if there was
a criminal investigation,

234
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:30,728
but I know that they tried to figure out
what was the cause, and they couldn't.

235
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,030
- OK.
- It wasn't electrical or anything,

236
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:35,036
you know, simple Like that.

237
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:38,472
So then, from the time you were
eight years old until now,

238
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,704
have you experienced this periodically
over the ensuing years?

239
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,510
Yes. From 13 on it's happened,
it's happened periodically.

240
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,087
Over the past few weeks
things have started happening again.

241
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,790
So when you tell me that it's moved
from where you were Living

242
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:55,188
when you were eight,
again when you were Living

243
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,887
someplace else when you were 13,
and now here,

244
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,021
it seems to me that's what
we're dealing with.

245
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,362
Something that's
basically connected to you.

246
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,532
These Lights have been flickering,
these ones that are in the ceiling.

247
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,734
We've had water from the faucets
turn on and off unexplainably.

248
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,242
- OK.
- Or we値l come down.

249
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,437
Not turn on and off,
but we値l come down and it値l be on.

250
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,311
We've heard banging on the walls,
scratching sounds,

251
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,285
Like, you know, Like dragging down
the walI kind of scratches.

252
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,515
Most of the activity is in here,
isn't it?

253
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,318
Yes. The vast majority of it.

254
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:29,753
I've heard whispering.

255
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:35,128
Sometimes I can't understand it,
sometimes it's saying my name.

256
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,928
Oh, so it specifically
calls to your name?

257
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,264
- It has before.
- You've heard this too, Micah?

258
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:41,872
Well, I've heard weird noises.

259
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,033
I haven't really heard anyone
say Katie's name, except for me.

260
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,735
That might've been me in my sleep.

261
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:50,678
I can tell the difference between you
saying "Katie" from over there in bed

262
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,150
and something right here
whispering distinctly in my ear.

263
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,951
Yeah, so, look. And I got Like a
FireWire going into my laptop, you know,

264
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,617
we can record all night what...
You want to take this?

265
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,821
Got the tripod, wide angle lens,
get the whole room

266
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,422
EVP recorder, just to catch any sounds.

267
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,627
So you値l go to bed
and have the Light on

268
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,068
and have the camera going
as you're going to bed.

269
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,074
- Is this, do you do this all the time?
- We've just started with the camera.

270
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,110
Our extra bathroom right there.

271
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:23,372
Guest bedrooms.
Lights flickering in here.

272
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,245
Is there something we can do
to make the stuff happen?

273
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,785
- To get it on tape?
- I've told him I don't want to

274
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,354
mess with that. I didn't
want him to get the camera.

275
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,958
These haunting,
they feed off of negative energy.

276
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:36,424
So if there is something negative
going on here,

277
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:39,223
it will help spur on the haunting.

278
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,855
You know the entity
may feed off of that.

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,629
You shouldn't let your mother come
over anymore. She's really mean.

280
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,033
Stop joking, Micah.

281
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,806
My area of expertise
is dealing with ghosts.

282
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,710
That's what I've built my career on,

283
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,784
helping people get in touch
with people who have died.

284
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,819
Communicating with ghosts.

285
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,320
The spirits of dead human beings.

286
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,448
A demon is something different.

287
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:11,050
That's an entity that relates
to something that is non-human.

288
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,185
OK.

289
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,128
A lot of debate and discussion
about what that could be,

290
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,700
but it's not a person.

291
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,359
- OK.
- OK?

292
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:21,196
Dealing with demons is not my area.

293
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,672
I'm very uncomfortable with it,
and l'Il tell you, quite frankly,

294
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,573
I sense there's something going on
in this house.

295
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:30,169
You cannot run from this.
It値l follow you.

296
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,647
It may lay dormant for years.

297
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,480
Something may trigger it to get...
become more active,

298
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,886
and it will, over time,
reach out to communicate with you.

299
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,550
OK, I want to give you the name
of Dr. Johann Aviaries.

300
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,721
He's a colleague. He's a demonologist,
he specializes in this sort of thing.

301
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,025
- He's in Los Angeles.
- OK.

302
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:52,068
All right, check this out. What if
we just get this Ouija board, right?

303
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:56,106
We find out what it wants, then we
give it what it wants and then... gone.

304
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,108
Because what it probably wants is Katie.

305
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,441
And if you do pick up a board
and try to play games with it,

306
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,675
the entity will sense that
you're trying to communicate with it,

307
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:08,615
and that's opening the door,
inviting it in.

308
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,688
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, I'm with you.

309
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:17,121
I hope so. You're going to be fine. OK?

310
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,093
Glad to hear you say that.

311
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,098
Thank you so much for coming.

312
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,931
I will definitely give
Dr. Aviaries a call.

313
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,097
- Have a very safe trip back.
- I will. Bye-bye, both of you.

314
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,210
- Nice to meet you, bye.
- Later. What a fruit!

315
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,108
Do you think you could try not to be
completely rude to him?

316
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,876
I feel Like it was good information,
Like I'm not nuts.

317
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,383
I feel Like at least
we're doing something.

318
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,283
I'm going to call that guy tomorrow.

319
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,581
What guy?

320
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:48,557
- Dr. Johann Aviaries?
- That demon guy?

321
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,320
- Don't laugh at him.
- No, don't.

322
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,987
Seriously, don't call the guy, OK?
That's insane.

323
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,430
- He said to call him tomorrow.
- Babe. Don't call the guy.

324
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,298
No, promise me you're not going to
call that guy. Please?

325
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,302
- Want me to promise?
- I talked with the one dude,

326
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,907
I'm not putting up with Like a team,
a legion of...

327
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,202
- OK.
-...Jesus freaks.

328
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,005
- If it gets worse lama going to call him.
- All right.

329
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:12,014
Yeah. You sound way better
when you're brushing your teeth.

330
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:16,218
Have a Little extracurricular
activity with this camera?

331
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,878
Not with this camera on us, no.

332
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,082
OK, taking the camera off
for ten minutes.

333
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,317
Ten minutes, huh?

334
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,586
That's all l need.
I don't know about you.

335
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,560
Let's go to bed. Turn it off.

336
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,360
All right. I値l set up
in the bed room.

337
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,629
- Turn it off!
- Katie is in the bathroom.

338
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:37,035
- Turn it off. Turn it off!
- Hi, Katie.

339
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,972
I want to pee! Turn it off.

340
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,238
Dr. Johann. I am Dr. Johann.

341
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,575
- OK, I'm about to pee.
- I'm a demonologist.

342
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,775
Go away. I can't hear you,
can't hear you.

343
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:49,887
I'm here to save you from the demons.

344
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,121
Come to bed.

345
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:58,321
I will! Just let me turn
this off... Play time?

346
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,525
Wait!

347
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,569
- Excuse me.
- What?

348
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,366
- The camera's not off.
- It's off. That's the standby Light.

349
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:11,100
That's not the standby Light.
That's the record Light.

350
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:13,267
- Don't Lie to me.
- All right.

351
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,206
I think that probably was illegal
in Kentucky and another 12 states.

352
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,916
This girl is a wild animal.

353
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,790
What time you
getting up?

354
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,950
Don't know,
six o'clock or so.

355
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,221
Did you set
your alarm?

356
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,895
Sleep good?

357
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,290
Is that the video?

358
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,233
I was looking at the footage
from last night.

359
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,703
Check it out.
This is about 2:10 in the morning.

360
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,970
- The doors...
- A minute.

361
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,167
You got it?

362
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,973
The doors and windows all over the
house are closed. I just checked them.

363
00:21:56,114 --> 00:22:00,107
The flowers are not moving.
But something else is.

364
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,918
- The door's fricking moving by itself.
- Oh, my God.

365
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,992
And it's not over. Check it out.
It moves again.

366
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,622
- Oh, Micah, that is...
- That's impossible.

367
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,998
- I told you this was a good idea.
- Wow.

368
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,273
You think you can get that ghost back?

369
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,399
- think I can do what?
- Get the ghost back.

370
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,704
Get us some more interesting...
you know.

371
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,138
I'm not interested in that.
I just want him to go away.

372
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:44,256
Oh, Micah!
Oh, my God.

373
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,731
What are you doing?
Come here! Come here right now!

374
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,856
What?

375
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,969
It's right there.
It's right there! Get it!

376
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,236
Get rid of it. Please.

377
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,841
You scream Like that for a spider?

378
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,945
- Oh, God.
- Jesus.

379
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,139
- Did you go get the camera first?
- Yeah.

380
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,944
I thought it was a ghost
or something Like real scary...

381
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,713
I'm nearly losing my mind
and you grab the camera.

382
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:12,584
Hey, Little friend! What's your name?

383
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,820
Can I turn the camera off?
OK. I need to not be around you.

384
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:20,829
- All right. We're going.
- Straight outside. OK.

385
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,198
Hey, you out here?

386
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,975
Hey, tell me what the point of this was.

387
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,283
Was part of your master plan
just to move the door?

388
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,584
Or are you just doing random shit?

389
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:53,028
Well. Basically, it could be two things:

390
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:56,463
It could be a ghost,
or it could be a demon.

391
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,429
Dr. Fredric痴 said
that it wasn't a ghost.

392
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,198
- And whatever it is...
- lama going by the evidence.

393
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,399
I'm doing my research
and lama going to find out what it is.

394
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:07,636
Well, whatever it is that's
following me, it doesn't feel...

395
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,047
It doesn't feel human.

396
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:16,119
It feels Like a monster.
I mean, Like it wants to hurt me.

397
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,620
Well, that sounds
actually Like a demon.

398
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:22,351
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- Ghosts are spirits of human beings.

399
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:24,120
Yeah. It's definitely not human.

400
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:28,028
Then maybe you're right,
which is bad, 'cause demons suck!

401
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,397
Basically, they're these
malevolent, evil spirits

402
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:37,304
that only exist to cause pain and
commit evil for their own amusement.

403
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:41,936
It's pretty creepy. I mean, they
stalk people for years, Like decades.

404
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,176
They're sometimes really intelligent in
the way they do things to freak you out.

405
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:49,381
So this could be
a really rare phenomenon,

406
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,112
and it's cool we got it on tape.

407
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,054
I'm surprisingly not as excited as you,

408
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,592
considering lama the one
that's being terrified.

409
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,696
It's all good. We値l take care of it.

410
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,762
I understand that
this stuff is new to you,

411
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,634
and exciting in some ways,
so I get your whole filming thing.

412
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,399
But it isn't new to me,

413
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:17,071
and I think this thing
could be very dangerous.

414
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,776
So I just... I just want you
to know that as things get...

415
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,080
...things progress
or get worse in any way,

416
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,985
I don't want to mess with the camera.
Don't want to make it mad.

417
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,786
I understand where you're
coming from, just remember

418
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,225
you didn't exactly warn me
about this stuff

419
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:33,262
- before we moved in together.
- I know.

420
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,390
So I think I have
a Little bit of say in what we do.

421
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,900
I get that, honestly.
But what was I supposed to say?

422
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,335
On our first date,
"There's a demon that has been foIl..."

423
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:44,669
No, but maybe on our
15th date or our 30th date

424
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,868
or when we decided to Live together,

425
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:49,673
that might've been
a good thing to bring up.

426
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,617
Here.

427
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:09,194
All right. The windows are locked,
doors are locked, alarm is on.

428
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,434
Anything gets in here,
we're going to know about it.

429
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,971
I don't think it cares about
alarms and locked doors.

430
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:19,970
It can go wherever it wants,
it can do whatever it wants.

431
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,442
How do you know?

432
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,173
Whatever's happening, it's already here.

433
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,477
All right.

434
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,948
What is this?

435
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,714
What's the matter?

436
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:09,526
I just...
I just had a nightmare.

437
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,030
I'm sorry,
did I scare you?

438
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,898
It's all right,
don't worry about it.

439
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:21,799
- Oh, my God.
- You OK?

440
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:23,031
- Yeah.
- You sure?

441
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,074
My head.

442
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,338
Did you hear that?

443
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,839
- lama going down.
- No, no, no, Micah!

444
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,973
Micah, no!

445
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:37,354
Micah,
don't leave me here.

446
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:38,477
Don't leave me here.

447
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,386
Take this.

448
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,993
Where do you think that came from?

449
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,664
- Micah!
- Is anyone down here?

450
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:11,981
- This all you got?
- Oh, Micah, stop!

451
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,615
Please don't do that.
Oh, baby, come on.

452
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,737
You OK, baby?

453
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,205
I'm OK.

454
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,334
- You sure?
- lama still creped out.

455
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,075
- Hey, girls?
- No, but you know what?

456
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,616
- If you can just show me...
- Hello! Excuse me!

457
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:42,184
I know it's bead time,

458
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,788
but I have a Little something
I want to show you guys.

459
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:48,016
Can it wait? We're having
very intense girl time right now,

460
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,889
and we cannot be interrupted
by Micah and his camera.

461
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:54,054
- Thank you, OK. I understand.
- I need a Little break from...

462
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,189
What the fuck!
I'm trying to show you guys something.

463
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,358
Hey! You be sweet.

464
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:01,905
All right. This is the tape
from the digital audio recorder

465
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,199
I set up in the bed room.

466
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:07,737
This is the tape from about
ten seconds before we woke up.

467
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:17,579
What the hell was that?

468
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:21,453
I Listened to it 50 times.
It's not saying anything.

469
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:26,052
It's not a language that I recognize,
it's not a dog, it's not, Like,

470
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,631
noise from the street,
it's not any kind of

471
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:31,132
electrical Interference
that I recognize, so...

472
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,032
- Oh, God!
- What I figure it is...

473
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,139
I think the thing is
right in the bedroom.

474
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,902
This thing wants to communicate.

475
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:42,240
So, I figure I'm going to go out
and get a Ouija board...

476
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,642
No!

477
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,806
I don't want to know
what this thing has to say.

478
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,612
- I want it to leave us alone.
- Trust me. Bad idea.

479
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,722
He specifically said,
" Don't do anything to antagonize or..."

480
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,017
- Whatever it is.
- Sorry I told you about it.

481
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,558
You're going to use a Ouija
board and invite whatever it is in,

482
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,094
- and it's not going to go away.
- Let me do my thing.

483
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,564
The camera is your thing.
You do a Ouija board, there's no more.

484
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,898
Nothing. Promise me.
Micah, promise me, please!

485
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,007
Fine! I promise you
I won't buy a Ouija board.

486
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,130
- OK?
- Thank you.

487
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:13,800
Hey, Micah, smile.

488
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:21,547
Hey, we haven't had anything
interesting happen in a while!

489
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,578
- Micah?
- You scared?

490
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,580
What you got?

491
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,693
Put the camera away,
we're going to bed.

492
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,454
- Go back to sleep.
- Come on.

493
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,760
- Hey! Don't antagonize...
- What you got? I'm calling you out!

494
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,700
Hey! Hey, that's enough! Micah! Come on.

495
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,700
Your demon's worthless.
You're worthless!

496
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,536
You got nothing.

497
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:48,042
- Put the camera away.
- OK.

498
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,437
What's up?

499
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,271
I just thought
I heard something.

500
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,641
What?
What'd you hear?

501
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,114
Just a thud.

502
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:36,259
- A thud? Where?
- Maybe downstairs.

503
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,940
Fuck.

504
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,879
Where are you going?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

505
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,154
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

506
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,668
Micah, wait, wait, wait, please.

507
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,035
Where'd you go?

508
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:29,238
I'm right here. I'm over here, babe.
I'm over here. Over here.

509
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:36,042
Oh, my God.

510
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,121
Hear that?

511
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,122
Oh, God.

512
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,766
- You OK, baby?
- Yeah.

513
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,632
Oh, God.

514
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,743
It looks Like it's gone now,
whatever it was.

515
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,003
OK, come on.

516
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,972
That's video proof
of that noise, though.

517
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,699
Do you hear that?

518
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:40,310
Hold on.

519
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,308
You hear that?

520
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,570
Yeah, I do.
I don't know what that is.

521
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,314
This is really
good stuff, Katie.

522
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,681
I'm telling you. This is, this is the...

523
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,281
I hope that guy... it, whatever,
shows us a Little more action.

524
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,291
- This is grade-A shit.
- I don't think we should be

525
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:28,797
messing with this. This is why it
scares me, you don't take it seriously.

526
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,424
I take it seriously.
I think it's pretty...

527
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,628
You have a camera in my face
in the bathroom.

528
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,103
You look beautiful
in the morning, by the way.

529
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,105
Maybe we shouldn't have the camera.

530
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:43,941
Hello. This is really
golden shit. Come on.

531
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:49,951
Not an option, at this point,
with all that cool stuff going on.

532
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,952
- Cool?
- Or disturbing.

533
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:55,581
- Are you not scared?
- It's... it's a Little bizarre.

534
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,423
But we have it documented,
it's going to be fine, OK?

535
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:04,591
Sounded Like it was, Like, sounds coming
from the walI or ceiling or something.

536
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,664
- Or the floor.
- Floor? Y'think?

537
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:13,299
Well, whatever it was... Oh, God!

538
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:17,510
Like if someone were to drop
something really, really big and heavy.

539
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,845
Like what? Like someone
picked the couch up or something?

540
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:25,778
You know, that kind of stuff
didn't happen to me before the camera.

541
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:29,485
- Before what?
- Before the camera.

542
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,658
- That has nothing to do with it.
- It's getting worse.

543
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:35,264
It wasn't that bad.
It was Like a Little loud.

544
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,833
That was my inner child being scared.

545
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:42,195
I'm fine, thanks. All right?

546
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:48,234
EVP Experiment Number One.

547
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,705
Is there anyone here?

548
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,774
Where did you come from?

549
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:01,057
You have something to say?
In English, this time?

550
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:07,393
Would you be happier
talking with the Ouija board?

551
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:15,202
What is your quest?
What is your favourite colour?

552
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,607
Where did you come from?

553
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,507
You have something to say?
In English, this time?

554
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:29,685
It's got nothing to say, huh?

555
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,618
Would you be happier
talking with the Ouija board?

556
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:35,817
Whoa, what the hell.

557
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,852
Is that you grunting?

558
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:46,498
Was it Like one for "Yes", two for "No"?

559
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,473
Yeah? Nice.

560
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,607
Yeah. Let's watch a movie.
I don't want to go to sleep yet.

561
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,477
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm scared.

562
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:03,713
- Yeah.
- Come on, put the camera off.

563
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:52,788
Katie.

564
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,672
Katie!

565
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,176
You down here? Babe?

566
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,556
Fuck.

567
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,177
Katie?

568
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,353
Babe!

569
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,155
What are you doing out here?

570
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,594
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

571
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,432
It's freezing out here.
What are you doing with no clothes on?

572
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:12,008
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

573
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:14,406
No. I don't want to go in.

574
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,240
Just Leave me alone.

575
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,712
- Are you OK, baby?
- I'm fine.

576
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,950
- Come on.
- No.

577
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,714
You just want to sit out here
in the swing in the middle of the night,

578
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:32,454
- while it's freezing?
- Yes. Go away.

579
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:37,889
I値l stay out here with you.
I'm going to get some blankets, OK?

580
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:44,630
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is going on?

581
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,407
Ridiculous.

582
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,807
Sitting out in the cold.

583
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,576
Fuck is that?

584
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,054
Hey! W who痴 there?

585
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,352
Katie, come inside!

586
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:15,533
What the fuck is going on? Come out!

587
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,324
Fuck!

588
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:40,259
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

589
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,763
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What do you mean?

590
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,996
I just heard noises up here
and I came in to get a blanket

591
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,935
- 'cause you're on the swing...
- What?

592
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:52,837
...for some reason.
There's aIl this stomping up here...

593
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:55,638
- Come back to bed. You woke me up.
- And the TV is on.

594
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,373
Jesus. I don't know
what the fuck is going on anymore.

595
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,451
- I'm cold.
- Why are you crazy Like this?

596
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,422
So you don't remember any of this?

597
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,293
No. I mean...

598
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,420
You don't remember getting out of bed?

599
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:17,533
You don't remember standing there
Like a total weirdo?

600
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:18,760
Hey.

601
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:20,699
I'm saying, Like...

602
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,399
- Oh, my goodness.
- And this? You don't...

603
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,872
Were you sleepwalking?

604
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:29,467
- What was going through your mind?
- I don't know! I wasn't... I...

605
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,274
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

606
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,942
What do you remember from this?

607
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,247
- Were you dreaming?
- I don't remember anything.

608
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:41,789
I remember standing in the doorway
and you pointing a camera at me.

609
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:45,656
And you were all freaked out.
I don't, I don't remember standing here.

610
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,627
You went downstairs, sat in the swing.

611
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:50,392
I went to get you a blanket
'cause you refused to come back.

612
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,468
Fast forward it
to where I go downstairs.

613
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,161
I'm freaking leaving the room. Where...

614
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,638
You went outside and sat on the swing.

615
00:42:59,776 --> 00:43:02,176
And I went inside to bring you a blanket

616
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:06,874
'cause you refused to leave in this
catatonic, weird state you were in.

617
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,383
- I don't know...
- Wait, wait. Did I talk to you?

618
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,214
I wouldn't call it talking.

619
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:16,019
But I come upstairs and there's
Like footsteps, and the TV's on.

620
00:43:17,694 --> 00:43:18,991
So that's...

621
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:23,828
Well, maybe this kind of thing's
been happening for a long time

622
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,992
and you just never knew about it.

623
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:31,570
I don't remember anything. I know that
I had nightmares all night and that...

624
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:32,732
What?

625
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,608
I didn't want to talk about it.

626
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,942
They were gruesome.
Let's leave it at that.

627
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,676
It's trying to scare us.
It scared you and me...

628
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:44,582
- It's working! I'm scared!
- Just got to stay strong.

629
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,717
And not let it get to you,
not let it get to us.

630
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:55,389
Look, bringing in somebody else,
some exorcist or whatever,

631
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,626
Iot of times it just gets worse.
You don't want it to get worse.

632
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:03,832
- No, I don't.
- No. Me neither.

633
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,382
Yeah, all right,
you Little fucker.

634
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:13,007
Yeah, all right,
you Little fucker.

635
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,642
Got something to say?
Now's your chance.

636
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,690
Katie! Where are you?

637
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,291
I値l be down.
Hang on a second.

638
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,798
I can't wait to
get out of this house,

639
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,838
go out and hang out
with my boyfriend.

640
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,366
All right, we got,
Like, ten minutes.

641
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,008
What in the hell
are you doing, Micah?

642
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:45,410
- Come on, help me.
- What are you doing?

643
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,210
- lama going to talk to it.
- Look at me!

644
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,339
I told you I was...

645
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,385
You promised me
you weren't going to...

646
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,886
Don't you look at me Like that.
You promised me

647
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,456
you weren't going to mess
with that.

648
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,286
No! I promised you

649
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:58,189
I wasn't going to buy
a Ouija board.

650
00:44:58,328 --> 00:44:59,317
I didn't buy
a Ouija board.

651
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,260
You knew exactly
what I meant!

652
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,524
I borrowed
a Ouija board.

653
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,896
How dare you? You knew
exactly what I meant!

654
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,900
I said don't mess with that
because it scared me,

655
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,561
and what do you do?
You go out and get

656
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,366
the best looking fucking
Ouija board I've ever seen,

657
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,168
and you put it in the middle
of our Living room?

658
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,436
- Explain that to me!
- I borrowed it.

659
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,136
You know, I don't care
what you did.

660
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:18,406
You're going to throw it away.
We're going to leave.

661
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:19,776
- Katie...
- There's no more camera,

662
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,816
there's no more nothing.
I don't want to hear it.

663
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,681
- I don't even want to hear it.
- Katie.

664
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,344
No, don't "Katie" me.
I'm leaving

665
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,923
and you're either coming
with me or you're not.

666
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,384
- Chill it, babe!
- I don't want to hear it.

667
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,869
Take your shoes off
and go to bed...

668
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:48,834
What?

669
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,667
What'd you do?
What'd you do, Micah?

670
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,604
Look at me!
What'd you do?

671
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:54,937
I didn't do shit, babe.
Look...

672
00:46:58,014 --> 00:47:00,039
I cannot fucking
believe you, Micah.

673
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:05,820
I am finished. No more
fucking camera, nothing.

674
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:06,945
I値l take care of this.

675
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,024
If you're not going to do it,
then I will.

676
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:17,199
Looks Like someone drew something on it.

677
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,569
I don't know. Hey, Katie?

678
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,105
What?

679
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:27,705
Can you come down here
and help me figure this out, please?

680
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,471
Sorry?

681
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,447
I think this thing left a message.
On the Ouija board.

682
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,148
I don't give a fuck what that thing
says on the Ouija board!

683
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:43,957
Babe...

684
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:47,987
Katie! Look...

685
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:54,294
- Kate. Hello. Hey.
- Micah, get the fuck out!

686
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,304
- I don't want to look at that!
- Chill!

687
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:02,900
- Look, this is not the time for this.
- Get out!

688
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,078
Get out!

689
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,251
I think she's pissed. That's not good.

690
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:21,089
Hey, Katie? Katie? Hello?

691
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,860
- Look, I know you're pissed, but...
- Do we have any lemon?

692
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:32,400
What do I have to do?
Just tell me what I have to do.

693
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,772
You have to turn off the fucking camera.

694
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,038
The camera's... Fuck.
Forget the camera, OK?

695
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:49,051
I swear to abide
by Katie's

696
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:53,253
rules and regulations
of camera use...

697
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,498
...and other things.
Whatever.

698
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:58,828
Is that good enough
for you?

699
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:01,300
I think it needs to be
a Little more sincere.

700
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,132
I...

701
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,134
I swear to abide
by Katie's

702
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,476
rules and regulations
of camera use

703
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:15,914
and to not
offend this entity,

704
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:18,043
or whatever it is,
in any way,

705
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,588
shape, or form,
so help me God.

706
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:24,125
And I promise not to
betray Katie's trust.

707
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,820
And I promise not to
betray Katie's trust.

708
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,931
- Is there anything else?
- That値l be it.

709
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,500
Good.

710
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,396
Fuck.

711
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:39,074
Can I at least get
a kiss for that? Please?

712
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:43,607
Good night.

713
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,627
Katie.
Do you want to know

714
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,532
what happened to
the Ouija board?

715
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:11,333
I saw the tape,
you know.

716
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,477
I just want to
forget about it, OK?

717
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,920
Let's go to sleep.

718
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,135
I think I found something pretty cool,

719
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,763
and I'd Like you to help me
figure it out.

720
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:49,504
So, sit down. No? Or stand up.

721
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:52,581
I caught on camera everything
that happened after we left.

722
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:56,344
- When the cursor was moving by itself.
- OK.

723
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,716
I'm trying to figure out what it said.

724
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,550
I couldn't figure out
exactly what it said,

725
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,684
but there's a lot of possibilities.

726
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,926
Do you know anyone
named Edina or Diane?

727
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:14,093
could be Nadine, without two N's... No.

728
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:19,003
- No.
- All right. Well, l'Il work on it.

729
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,640
You know, it may...

730
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:24,110
It could be this thing's fucking
with us and it doesn't mean anything.

731
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,683
Or it could be... so many possibilities,
I mean, I could be wrong.

732
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:28,977
I don't know.

733
00:51:29,118 --> 00:51:31,712
I don't really...
I don't really care what it means.

734
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,483
You're done playing with it.
I want it out of the house.

735
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:38,550
We haven't gone a week
without something happening.

736
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,686
- That's crazy.
- I can't...

737
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,924
- What're you guys talking about?
- lama at my... Just everything.

738
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,929
- Come stay with me.
- You remember, it's not the house.

739
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:50,130
It's me. You know,
wherever I go, it goes.

740
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,037
What am I going to do, go to your house,
mess things up for you?

741
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:56,612
- I got a plan. Don't worry about it.
- Micah, what's your plan?

742
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,806
- I got a plan.
- What? What're you going to do?

743
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:02,213
- You know what...
- Don't worry about it, OK?

744
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,780
- All right? So
- OK, here's the compromise...

745
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:07,912
What?

746
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:11,026
You can have your powder,
you can do your Little experiment.

747
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,458
If it doesn't work,
if it doesn't help us,

748
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:16,827
I'm calling the demonologist
and we're getting this taken care of.

749
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:20,060
- Yeah. Deal.
- Can you look at me and not the camera?

750
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,797
No. Deal. All right, so.

751
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,998
- Happy, yeah?
- Yeah.

752
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,268
- Deal.
- All right.

753
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:29,500
Is that thing on?

754
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:33,844
Yes. And exactly
what is this going to prove?

755
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:37,475
Well, if anything walks through here,

756
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,349
it's going to leave
a pretty good footprint.

757
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,856
OK. I think we've pretty much
established something's happening.

758
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:45,552
All right. So tomorrow,
lama making the call.

759
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,459
You can have your powder.
You can clean it up tomorrow.

760
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:52,159
Take a deep breath,
pop a pill, it's fine.

761
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,600
- Excuse me?
- Figure out what we're dealing with.

762
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:56,068
- Micah!
- OK?

763
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:59,766
- Then we can go crazy.
- Pop a pill, my ass.

764
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,237
Does that look good to you?

765
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:04,005
It looks Like our floor
is covered with powder, yes.

766
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,342
- I値l clean it up.
- All right.

767
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:08,109
That's a thing of beauty.

768
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,515
- Hey.
- Yeah.

769
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:13,918
I've been doing my research.
I'm taking care of this.

770
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:18,255
Nobody comes in my house,
fucks with my girlfriend,

771
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:20,385
gets away with it. Here.

772
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,554
What do you want
to do about it?

773
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,824
Want to call in
the demon guy?

774
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,558
- Yes! Exactly!
- call an exorcist?

775
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,690
I want to
take care of this!

776
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,234
Get a quack to tell us
what to do?

777
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,395
this is my house,
you're my girlfriend.

778
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,769
I'm going to fucking
solve the problem.

779
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,706
- OK?
- OK.

780
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:38,780
Babe. Just have
a Little faith, huh?

781
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,347
this is it.

782
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:45,445
What's it?

783
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:50,688
The powder is the last.
The last thing.

784
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,022
Tomorrow lama going to
make the call.

785
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:54,686
Too cute to be talking.

786
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,348
Did you hear that?

787
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:50,584
Oh, shit!

788
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,884
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

789
00:55:03,232 --> 00:55:04,392
You know what?

790
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:10,699
There's footsteps in,
but there's no footsteps out.

791
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,102
Oh, God!

792
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,445
- Don't leave me in here.
- Turn on the Light, baby.

793
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,350
Let's just get out and go downstairs.

794
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,010
It's still here. Let's go!

795
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:31,119
It finally can't run. Where is it?

796
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,284
What?

797
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,723
The prints stop over here.

798
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:40,131
Micah, this could be a trap.
Please, let's go!

799
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:45,969
Oh, my God!

800
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,503
Did you do that?

801
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,620
You didn't... You didn't, did you?
Tell me you opened that.

802
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:02,156
Of course not.
What the hell is that?

803
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:08,661
You're not going up...
You're not going up there.

804
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,629
Oh, you're not going up there.

805
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:15,170
I'm not going in there. Just going to...

806
00:56:15,304 --> 00:56:17,431
- Just going to look.
- No, you're not!

807
00:56:18,674 --> 00:56:21,199
I got to go check it out.
I'm getting the ladder.

808
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,040
OK. It's all set up.

809
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,947
Micah, I really don't want you
to go up there. Please.

810
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:32,384
I'm not going in there.
I'm just going to look.

811
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,286
You have no idea what's up there.
You've no idea!

812
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:36,789
I know.

813
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,163
Oh, Micah.

814
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,894
Give me the camera. Yeah.

815
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:51,632
- Be careful.
- All right, if something goes wrong,

816
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:54,072
I'm going to throw you the camera
and jump out, OK?

817
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,478
Do you see anything?

818
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,350
Micah, I don't want to
be down here by myself.

819
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:10,686
I値l be right back.

820
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,456
What the fuck is that?

821
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:21,367
There's something over there
stuck in the stuff.

822
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,529
Oh, my God, Micah,
come back down! Come on.

823
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,568
Micah, please, come on.

824
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,044
Now this...

825
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,713
Hold on. Here.

826
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,874
- What?
- Just take the camera.

827
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:36,348
OK. Come on.

828
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:42,888
- l'Il hold the ladder. Come down.
- Something up there, I got to look.

829
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:45,152
Micah! Oh, God.

830
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:49,796
Micah, please be careful.

831
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,191
Are you OK?

832
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:58,536
Micah, answer me! Micah. Micah!

833
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:01,404
- lama fine.
- lama com... Ah, thank God.

834
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:04,501
Fuck.

835
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:08,516
I found this up there.

836
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:14,285
No. No, no, no, no.
Let me see that.

837
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,295
- What're you talking about?
- this is our old house.

838
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:24,024
What in the hell is this
doing in the attic?

839
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:26,600
I thought all that stuff burned down.

840
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:30,467
There's no way. There is no way
you found that in our attic!

841
00:58:30,606 --> 00:58:32,665
There is no way that that even exists!

842
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:35,901
I haven't seen that picture
in 15 years.

843
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:41,383
That makes no sense.
That makes no sense at all.

844
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:52,753
You OK, babe?

845
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,661
Would you turn the Light off, please.

846
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,726
Sorry.

847
00:59:02,738 --> 00:59:04,729
Where was it when you found it?

848
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:08,501
It was over our bed.

849
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:19,248
- lama going to go clean up that stuff.
- OK.

850
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,450
I don't have any idea
if lama going to get to class today.

851
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:31,765
Oh, God, lama so tired.

852
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,267
Why are you filming me?
I'm just making coffee.

853
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:38,270
I'm actually sick of this.

854
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,837
I think we could both use
a Little more sleep.

855
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:48,542
I think I could use a new Life.
I'm so tired of this.

856
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,520
- Take a look at this.
- Take a look at what?

857
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:58,218
I Lightened up the footage
from last night.

858
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,158
You can see the footsteps.

859
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,592
Oh, my God.

860
01:00:09,071 --> 01:00:11,539
- So?
- What?

861
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:12,971
What are you going to do?

862
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,445
I don't know yet.

863
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,914
Well, I do. We're calling Dr. Aviaries.

864
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,918
You've had your camera work,
your powder on the floor,

865
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,885
and it's just gotten worse, OK?

866
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:32,086
We should've done this two weeks ago.
We're calling him. Today.

867
01:00:33,295 --> 01:00:36,560
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Let's talk about this first.

868
01:00:37,566 --> 01:00:40,262
Now, lama in control,
think lama making progress.

869
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:43,634
No, you haven't been having
progress and you're not in control!

870
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,934
It is in control.
If you think you're in control,

871
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,770
- you're an idiot!
- Hey! Stay cool.

872
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,343
Not a single thing
you've done has helped.

873
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:51,742
And lama sorry, I don't mean
to burst your bubble,

874
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,543
but the camera hasn't helped,
the footprints haven't helped.

875
01:00:54,683 --> 01:00:57,550
think that thing would've left
footprints if it didn't want to?

876
01:00:57,686 --> 01:01:00,587
No! It did it because it wanted to.
It wanted you to find my photo.

877
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,089
It can be anywhere.
It hears what we're saying now.

878
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:06,786
- Hey! How the fuck do you know?
- You are absolutely powerless!

879
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,159
That's not true at all and you know it.

880
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,765
Well, get over it!

881
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:19,470
Well, I called Dr. Aviaries
and he's gone.

882
01:01:19,608 --> 01:01:22,042
Didn't know what else to do,
so I called Dr. Fredric痴.

883
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,941
I know you don't love him, but I did.

884
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,073
And he's coming back tomorrow.
That was as soon as he could get here.

885
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,879
So maybe if we make it till then,
we could hold off...

886
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,454
- We値l make it till then!
- lama just saying that we could just...

887
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:37,355
- "Make it till then." God!
- We could hold out, we値l be OK,

888
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:43,363
- and maybe tomorrow he値l help us.
- Fucking people! Ridiculous.

889
01:02:21,737 --> 01:02:23,295
Fuck!

890
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:24,428
What happened?

891
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:26,666
What're you doing? Micah.

892
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,800
What're you doing? What'd you hear?

893
01:02:28,944 --> 01:02:30,673
Something out there.

894
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:34,215
- Fuck!
- Oh, God.

895
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,476
Goddamn it!

896
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:38,348
Baby, come here. Please don't go...

897
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:43,015
Please, just stay, please. Don't go.

898
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,160
I'm going out there and see...

899
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:49,822
Wait, Micah, don't go. Don't, please.

900
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:53,025
Please. Please don't open it.

901
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:57,962
Micah, come on. Come on.

902
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,167
Right now. Come on. Micah.

903
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:08,580
Who's there?

904
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,186
- Baby, come on!

01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,801
Come on, Micah. Let's go.
We've got to get out.

908
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:32,396
- Got a problem?
- Stop!

909
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:34,270
All right, hon., lama sorry.

Micah...

911
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,856
Please let go of it.

912
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:56,958
Oh, it's scaring us.

913
01:03:57,833 --> 01:03:59,391
Hey.

914
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:04,367

917
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,105
No, downstairs. Let's just... Please.

918
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,806
Babe. It's not going to make a difference.

919
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:17,612
- I can't...
- Come on.

920
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:20,187
I don't want to be in here.
I don't want to be even downstairs.

921
01:04:20,322 --> 01:04:22,882
Please, please...
Please, please. Please.

922
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,050
All right.

923
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,091
What the hell is in here now?

924
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:38,500
I don't know if down here
is going to be much better.

925
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:47,144
Micah. I don't want to be here.

926
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:03,395
I think we should go upstairs.
Again. Come here.

927
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:23,780
Katie?

928
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,688
Babe?

929
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:41,130
You know, got to get some sleep
once in a while.

930
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,263
I'm just scared.

931
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,976
I couldn't be in that room anymore.

932
01:05:53,615 --> 01:05:55,242
I understand.

933
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,676
I can't even be in this house, Micah.

934
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,018
We can't even be in our house.

935
01:06:22,978 --> 01:06:24,843
What the fuck is that?

936
01:06:33,355 --> 01:06:34,686
I値l check the mirrors.

937
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,222
Our picture!

938
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:48,769
- What picture?
- That one, look!

939
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:55,733
Fuck! What the hell?

940
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,369
How come my face is scratched
and yours isn't?

941
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,505
Something's here.

942
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:04,745
- This is buIlshit.
- It's here.

943
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:09,586
What's here? What?
What're you talking about?

944
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:14,662
I don't know. I feel it.
I feel it breathing on me.

945
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:20,596
Micah, come on! Come on! Please!

946
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,496
Fucking-A, man.

947
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,609
Fucking-A.

948
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:38,183
- Babe. Come downstairs.
- Jesus Christ.

949
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,651
Come on.

950
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:49,329
Has this shit happened
in the daytime before?

951
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,359
It's getting worse.

952
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:57,369
Fuck.

953
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:03,135
- Hey, baby, stop pacing, please.
- lama sorry.

954
01:08:03,278 --> 01:08:05,769
- It's making me nervous.
- Well, lama nervous.

955
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:11,041
Katie, hi.

956
01:08:11,186 --> 01:08:13,950
Hi, come in, please.
Thank you so much for coming back.

957
01:08:14,089 --> 01:08:15,954
Oh, we've got to follow up.
Micah, hi.

958
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,184
Yeah. W e called Dr. Aviaries,
but he's gone.

959
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:21,160
Yes, he's out of the country.
He値l be back. He値l be... Wow.

960
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:23,355
- We need your help.
- This is overpowering.

961
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,797
- It's worse.
- Yes. It doesn't Like that lama here.

962
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:27,265
- I cannot help you.
- What?

963
01:08:27,402 --> 01:08:30,064
I've got to get out of here. This thing
is aggravated by the fact that I'm here.

964
01:08:30,205 --> 01:08:31,570
You can't leave us alone here.

965
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,572
Everybody calm down.
We need your help.

966
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:37,008
Well, I've got to tell you, I am not the
person to help you in this situation.

967
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:39,113
This is not my area of expertise.

968
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,115
Now, I think lama doing more harm
being here than any good.

969
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,775
- What?
- Yes, I have got to leave.

970
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,682
Dr. Aviaries will be back in a few days.

971
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,051
When he gets here
he値l take care of your problems.

972
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,317
What should we do?
Should we leave?

973
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,790
Leaving won't help at all.

974
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:54,225
Let me see what I can do.
But I've got to leave this room now.

975
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,831
- This is no joke.
- I will help you.

976
01:08:56,965 --> 01:08:58,899
- But I can't do this now.
- No, no, no, no!

977
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,695
You serious?

978
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,133
We値l take care of this ourselves, OK?

979
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:08,937
Katie?

980
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,242
Fuck.

981
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,025
I'm so fucking tired of this.

982
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,731
I know you are.

983
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,398
I don't want it to be Like this.

984
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:11,364
- Micah! Micah, wake up.
- What's the matter?

985
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,367
I just...
I just felt him breathing.

986
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,270
Right there.
He was right there,

987
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:19,635
I felt him breathing.

988
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,481
What are you doing?

989
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,481
Where're you going?
Micah, come back!

990
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:34,611
I'm not going anywhere.

991
01:11:34,756 --> 01:11:37,725
Chill. There's
nothing happening.

992
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:40,760
I know, lama telling you.
I'm telling you.

993
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:41,885
I... Please.

994
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:45,591
OK, OK.
I won't leave you.

995
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,032
Don't you feel it?

996
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:52,135
I feel it, he's still here.

997
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:53,969
Something,
something's wrong.

998
01:11:55,877 --> 01:11:57,469
Take a deep breath,
OK?

999
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:14,685
I can feel it watching me.

1000
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:18,665
Right now.

1001
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,802
Fuck. You're freaking me out, babe.

1002
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:24,132
- We have to do something.
- What?

1003
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:27,036
I don't know.
We've got to figure something out.

1004
01:12:27,175 --> 01:12:30,611
- We have to...
- OK. OK, OK.

1005
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:31,735
I値l figure something out.

1006
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,815
I値l do some research.
There's got to be some other options.

1007
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:38,551
OK.

1008
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:45,421
- Jesus.
- This is creepy.

1009
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,358
I knew something happened last night.

1010
01:12:51,366 --> 01:12:53,561
Ah, shit.

1011
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:58,495
We've got to do something.
I can feel something's wrong.

1012
01:13:05,313 --> 01:13:08,544
So I was doing some research,
just trying to figure out our options.

1013
01:13:08,683 --> 01:13:11,413
- Right.
- I found this website.

1014
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,989
This chick, Diane, one of
the possibilities from the board?

1015
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:17,814
Yeah.

1016
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:21,395
All the same things happened to her
in the 60's that's happened to you.

1017
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,589
Wait. What do you mean
she has the same things?

1018
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:27,600
Like everything. You're eight years old
and Like you had a house burning down,

1019
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:33,697
seeing shadows and whatever.
God knows. And she called an exorcist.

1020
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,376
Is that her?

1021
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,911
You're telling me there's
some girl from the 60's

1022
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:42,039
who had the exact same things
happen to her.

1023
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:47,349
Yeah. Down to a T. You say...
Maybe this thing is the same thing.

1024
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:51,391
It just jumped to you instead.
And that's just its, or whatever.

1025
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:53,153
And he's trying to warn us,

1026
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:57,561
with this Ouija board, trying to tell us
to find this woman so we know...

1027
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:00,167
Wait. So what happened to her?
Is she OK?

1028
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:05,640
They tried to get rid of it,
sometimes that just pisses it off more.

1029
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:10,566
Before the exorcist got there,
she wasn't Like this.

1030
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:14,045
She was just hearing voices
and having bad dreams.

1031
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:16,808
I'm trying to find some kind of reason

1032
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,217
this thing would pick you
after haunting her.

1033
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,152
I can't find anything.

1034
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:24,918
From what I've been reading,
these things are totally random.

1035
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,620
- There's just no reason. Like...
- How did she die?

1036
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:32,226
She's pretty.

1037
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:35,495
Now she is. I think this
thing's trying to warn us

1038
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:39,403
not to fuck with it.
I don't want to take a chance.

1039
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,705
Oh, God!

1040
01:14:44,846 --> 01:14:46,711
There's no way that we're doing this.

1041
01:14:46,848 --> 01:14:49,476
It's gone away on its own before.

1042
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,677
This is not worth the risk.

1043
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:54,883
I'm going to go Lie down.

1044
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:04,424
Hey, Katie, I got a idea
about what we can do.

1045
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,363
Some more stuff. In fact...

1046
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:09,959
Would you please get away from me
with that camera? I'm trying to study.

1047
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:14,165
All right. I kind of want to talk
to you about this thing.

1048
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,506
Micah, please.
While you give me five minutes?

1049
01:15:18,813 --> 01:15:20,041
Go! Please!

1050
01:15:20,181 --> 01:15:23,673
Hey, chill out! All right?
I'm trying to help this situation here.

1051
01:15:23,818 --> 01:15:25,547
I have ideas I want to
talk to you about.

1052
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,121
OK, you and your
stupid camera are the problem.

1053
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:31,657
- What the fuck?!
- Just leave me alone.

1054
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,557
While you stop
following me with the camera!

1055
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:38,325
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I didn't bring that thing to the house.

1056
01:15:38,466 --> 01:15:40,593
- Well, don't do me any favours.
- You did!

1057
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:45,163
Thank you, Micah.
Thank you so much.

1058
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,470
Well, hang out with your
friend upstairs. I値l be down here.

1059
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,306
- S shut up!
- Whatever.

1060
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:01,611
Hey.

1061
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,888
- lama sorry.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

1062
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:11,723
You d id not do anything wrong.

1063
01:16:11,866 --> 01:16:14,835
It's not your fault.
Now Listen to me, it's not your fault.

1064
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,165
You haven't done anything wrong.

1065
01:16:17,305 --> 01:16:19,136
OK?

1066
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,929
Micah. Micah! Micah!

1067
01:16:51,072 --> 01:16:53,302
Micah! Micah!

1068
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:55,204
- Katie!
- Micah!

1069
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:03,010
Let her go!

1070
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,657
Micah! Micah!

1071
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,689
Micah, make it stop!

1072
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,948
I don't care, I just want to go.
I just want to go.

1073
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:46,890
I can't... I can't,
I can't be here. I can't.

1074
01:17:47,028 --> 01:17:49,121
Just, let's go. Please, let's go.

1075
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,994
Let's just go right now.
Let's get in the car and let's go.

1076
01:17:53,134 --> 01:17:57,594
Yeah. All right, we're leaving.
I値l get us a hotel.

1077
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:00,867
We値l stay there tonight,
until we figure out what we're doing.

1078
01:18:01,676 --> 01:18:03,610
We're not staying here another night.

1079
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,404
Here, let me get a shot of that thing
it made on your back.

1080
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,847
OK? Is that OK?

1081
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:20,324
Oh, Jesus!

1082
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:27,030
- Sorry. Looks Like something bit you!
- I know.

1083
01:18:30,438 --> 01:18:31,962
Let's go.

1084
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,965
Hey! Baby, you ready to go?

1085
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:39,074
Car's packed. Let's go. Hey, babe?

1086
01:18:41,816 --> 01:18:43,750
Babe, hey!

1087
01:18:48,389 --> 01:18:51,586
Babe. Let go of this thing.
Hey! Let go.

1088
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,352
Jesus Christ.

1089
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:02,395
Babe? Oh my God!

1090
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:07,031
Hey. Katie! Katie! Wake up.

1091
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:11,839
Jesus. I've had it with this shit!

1092
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,947
Babe! Come on, let's go.

1093
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:24,283
Let's get you up. Come on.
Hey. Come on. Come on.

1094
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,085
Let's get to the couch.

1095
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:30,955
Come on. I've had it with this shit.

1096
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,624
I'm taking care of this right now!

1097
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:52,653
Fuck this shit, lama done!

1098
01:19:58,993 --> 01:20:03,225
Katie. Ready to go?
Let's get out of here.

1099
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:05,688
Babe?

1100
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,357
I packed the car. Let's go.

1101
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:09,702
I don't want to go.

1102
01:20:09,837 --> 01:20:12,271
What're you talking about,
you don't want to go?

1103
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:14,204
Let's get the fuck

1104
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:18,005
I don't want to leave.
While you stay with me?

1105
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:23,675
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I think it'd be better if we stay.

1106
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:26,582
Please. Just...

1107
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:30,350
I don't want to go.
I don't want to leave. Just trust me.

1108
01:20:30,491 --> 01:20:32,652
You want to stay here
and sleep in this fucking bed

1109
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:34,955
and be dragged down the hall?
I don't think so.

1110
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:37,496
We値l be OK. We値l be OK.
It's better if we stay.

1111
01:20:38,566 --> 01:20:39,965
You fucking...

1112
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:46,637
I don't know what the hail痴 going on,
but this is insane. Fuck!

1113
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,407
I think we値l be OK now.

1114
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:06,747
- Micah!
- Katie!

1115
01:23:09,852 --> 01:23:11,786
What's the matter,

1116
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:15,217
Oh, my God!
