1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,080
Dead Calm (1989) - 25 fps

2
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,880
- Merry Christmas, Captain Ingram.
- Merry Christmas, Evans.

3
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,560
The police told you about the child?

4
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,640
Yes, they did.

5
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm very sorry, but we'll need
a formal identification.

6
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,560
Yes, of course.

7
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,360
I have to warn you...

8
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,840
...most of the injuries were to the face,
I'm afraid.

9
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,640
The police said...

10
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,640
...that my son died on impact.
Is that correct?

11
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
Not quite.

12
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,920
Just after the ambulance arrived.

13
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
- How long was that?
- He was unconscious.

14
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,040
He wasn't aware of any pain.

15
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,800
How long, Doctor?

16
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,080
Twenty minutes.

17
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,800
- Have you ordered x-rays?
- They're on their way.

18
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,080
She'll need an urgent CT scan.

19
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Decerebrate response?

20
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,360
It's her husband.

21
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,560
I want you to talk to her.

22
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,680
Rae, it's John.

23
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,320
Try it again.

24
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,440
Rae, it's me.

25
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,800
It's John, Rae.

26
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,640
"Down came the rain
And washed poor Wincy out

27
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,080
"Out came the sunshine

28
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,920
"And dried up all the rain

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,120
"And Incy-Wincy spider

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,480
"Crawled up the spout again"

31
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,160
That's a funny one.

32
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,280
Will you try it with Mummy now?

33
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,680
No.

34
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,520
Come on.

35
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,800
"Incy-Wincy spider

36
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,440

00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,240
- "Out came the sunshine"
- He fell down!

41
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,240
"And dried up all the rain"

42
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
- Danny, darling, get back in your seat.
- I've got him.

43
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,120
I saved him.

44
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,720
No!

45
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,840
No!

46
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
It's okay. It's all right.

47
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,240
I was holding him!

48
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,240
I know, I know.

49
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,880
John, I could smell his head.

50
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,240
Stop it, Rae. Stop it.

51
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
No, I can't!

52
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm so scared.

53
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm so scared.

54
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,880
He's gone. He's gone, baby.

55
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,040
We can never get him back.

56
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,520
It's gonna take a long time.

57
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,320
Now, you know that. They warned us.

58
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,400
Let's go home.

59
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,480
- Please?
- It'll be worse there.

60
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,440
- I don't think I can get rid of it.
- Yes, you can.

61
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,000
No, I can't.

62
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,040
Don't say that.

63
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,560
Now look.

64
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,320
We've got weeks and weeks.

65
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,080
Calm days, calm seas.

66
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,560
Now, we're gonna get strong.

67
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,880
And when you're strong...

68
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,080
...then we'll go home and we'll start again.

69
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,680
Won't we, Rae?

70
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,520
Say it, Rae. Won't we?

71
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,120
Say it, Rae. Won't we?

72
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,160
What's wrong, Ben?

73
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
Come on, mate.

74
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
What was it?

75
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,400
It's nothing. Just the dawn.

76
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,560
Is there any wind?

77
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
Not a whisper.

78
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,040
So...

79
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
...what day is it today?

80
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,040
Thursday or Friday.
One of those days with an "R" in it.

81
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,320
Look at that.

82
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,160
First boat in three weeks.

83
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,800
She's been through some weather,
that's for sure.

84
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,400
Is there anybody on deck?

85
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,360
Not that I can see.

86
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,720
I'll call them up.

87
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,200
Do you have to?

88
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,440
I like it like this.

89
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,560
Just the two of us.

90
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,280
So do I.

91
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
But look at her, Rae.

92
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,880
That boat's in trouble.

93
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,360
Black schooner to my east.

94
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,880
This is yacht Saracen, Victor Kilo 2-7-6-2.

95
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,680
Position 16-16 south, 176-47 west.

96
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
Do you read me? Over.

97
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,040
John!

98
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,200
John!

99
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,520
I thought I saw something
between here and the boat.

100
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
What is it? A turtle?

101
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
No. It's bigger.

102
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,120
- You see anything?
- Not yet. Hold on.

103
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,000
There it is.

104
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,720
It's a dinghy.

105
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,600
Adrift?

106
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,240
No, there's a man in it.

107
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,400
Save it! We'll drop down to you!

108
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,240
You hear me? Ship your oars!

109
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,080
Get the fender, darling.

110
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,720
Stand off!

111
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,080
Take it easy.

112
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,120
Get him some water, darling.
Not too much.

113
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,040
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

114
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,600
My name is Hughie Warriner.

115
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,440
John Ingram. My wife, Rae.

116
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm 32 days outward bound from Papeete.
I'm heading for Fiji.

117
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,640
I only bought her about three months ago.

118
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,560
My plan had been to cruise around
the Pacific, to sail around the Pacific.

119
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,800
Who would have thought, right?

120
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,360
What's your trouble?

121
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,000
Trouble is she's going down,
that's the trouble.

122
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,720
She's not gonna last the morning.

123
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,720
Are you sure?

124
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,880
Yeah, she opened up all over.

125
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,080
Has the water hit your engine?

126
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,320
My engine...

127
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,920
...the radio, the fucking bulkhead, galleys.

128
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,040
Everything.

129
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,000
My only chance was to try to reach you
in the dinghy.

130
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,160
See what Mr. Warriner needs, darling,
and get him to bed.

131
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,280
All right.

132
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,920
Where are you going?

133
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,920
Well, I ought to get over there.

134
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,320
How many people onboard?

135
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,840
Nobody. I'm alone. I'm it.

136
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,600
You tried to take her across the Pacific
on your own?

137
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,080
No.

138
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,200
There were six of us.

139
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,640
The others died 10 days ago.

140
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,760
One by one.

141
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,080
It all happened in a day.

142
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,640
What happened?

143
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,520
Have you ever thought about how life
can hinge on the smallest thing?

144
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,800
I mean, ever since I was a kid,
I thought salmon was for cats.

145
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,040
Was it canned salmon?

146
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,840
Yeah.

147
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,360
At first we thought
it was the tourist trots...

148
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
...until Chantal looked at her hand
and said...

149
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,960
...Picasso should have painted it.

150
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,520
It had seven fingers.

151
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,800
Double vision, huh?

152
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,240
Sounds like botulism.

153
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,960
What's that?

154
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,880
It's a lethal form of food poisoning.
It hits the nervous system.

155
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,640
Yeah, well, I tried everything.

156
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,560
There's no treatment.

157
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,240
Not on a small boat there's not.
Not 1,200 miles from land.

158
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,600
When you're ready, Mr. Warriner.

159
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,000
We better go and salvage your gear.

160
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,160
My gear? You're looking at it.

161
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,560
There's nothing to salvage.

162
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,280
Everything was ruined by the water.

163
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,920
There must be something.

164
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,760
Give me a break.
I mean, you know what I had to do?

165
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,520
I can guess.

166
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,520
They've been dead for days!
You know what that does to a body?

167
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,840
You've gotta try and stop thinking about it.

168
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,600
I mean, I...

169
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,120
Fuck, I can't go back. All right?
I can't go back there right now.

170
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,240
Ever.

171
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,480
That's all right. I understand.

172
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,240
Why don't you go to bed
and get as much sleep as you can?

173
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,840
Thank you.

174
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,520
Look, I'm really sorry to ruin your day.

175
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,400
- Here?
- Yeah, straight ahead.

176
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,160
You all right?

177
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,640
Yeah.

178
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm fine.

179
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,120
You sure?

180
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,640
Some interesting stuff here.

181
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,160
Listen to this.

182
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,560
"South Sea Island Cruise. Four young
women wanted for photo assignment.

183
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,360
"Must be attractive and broad-minded."

184
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,520
You don't like him, do you?

185
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,560
I hadn't thought about it.

186
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,200
John, imagine what he's been through.

187
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,720
I'm sorry, Rae, whichever way I turn it...

188
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,080
...I just can't swallow it.

189
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,680
Any reason?

190
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,440
Not really. Just 25 years at sea.

191
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm going onboard her.

192
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,120
You can't do that.

193
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
He's fast asleep. He won't even know.

194
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,000
He will. He'll hear the engine.

195
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,240
No, he won't. I'll take the dinghy.

196
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,760
Load the gun and keep it with you.

197
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,240
Are you serious?

198
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,400
Just do as I say, please.

199
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,400
Back soon.

200
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,600
'Bye.

201
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,560
Wait a sec.

202
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,440
Go on, take it.

203
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,160
One, two...

204
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,240
Okay.

205
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,080
Go!

206
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,560
Bring it back. Come on.

207
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,360
Rae!

208
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,200
Rae, I'm sick! I got to use the bathroom!

209
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,360
Rae, I'm nauseated! Please!

210
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,600
I don't want to throw up in here!

211
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,840
Rae!

212
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,680
Jump, Rae! Jump!

213
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,720
Jump!

214
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,040
No! What are you doing?

215
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,120
No!

216
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,120
Jump, Rae! Jump!

217
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,120
Get off, Rae!

218
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,880
Leave it!

219
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
Ben.

220
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,720
Where's John?

221
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,480
Now, what?

222
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,640
John, my husband.

223
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,400
Where is he?

224
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,880
He's gone.

225
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,760
What have you done to him?

226
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,120
Nothing.

227
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,440
He went onboard her.

228
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,360
We've gotta go back.

229
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,480
He's only got himself to blame, right?

230
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,560
I mean, he should've trusted me.

231
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,240
But that's always been my problem.

232
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,400
- Don't you understand?
- Please don't shout.

233
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,840
That's always been one of my problems.

234
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,160
I can never tell people's motives
until it's too late.

235
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,760
Let's just turn the boat around.

236
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,960
Where shall we go?

237
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,400
- Turn around!
- Look, you're being very aggressive.

238
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,840
That could be a problem on this small boat.

239
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,320
I've seen it happen before. It doesn't work.

240
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,600
I was watching you
when you were sleeping.

241
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,640
And I gotta tell you
that your face fascinates me.

242
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,400
Even when you're 80, Rae,
you'll still be a beautiful woman.

243
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,160
I studied art...

244
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,360
...for a time.

245
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,280
I found that painters,
when they approach their subjects...

246
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,360
...they always look at the face from behind.

247
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,120
From the back, to see what's holding it up.

248
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,400
And you've got magnificent bone structure.

249
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,920
"Magnificent."
Shit, that sounds like something...

250
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,840
...you'd say at a cocktail party.

251
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,840
Should have given you my card.

252
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,840
I just knew we'd get along, didn't you?

253
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,400
What's wrong?

254
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,240
Would you just tell me one thing?

255
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,280
Sure.

256
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,720
I just need to know if that boat is sinking.

257
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,080
Sinking?

258
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,040
Well, past tense would do.

259
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,040
But, yeah. Yes, it is.

260
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,320
Why? Don't you believe me?

261
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,400
Yeah, I believe you. Of course I do.

262
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,640
- That's why we've gotta go back.
- Back?

263
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,040
- To get John.
- You mean, back there?

264
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,200
Right now.

265
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,800
No, Rae, no. Okay? That's over.

266
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,680
That's over. So let's erase that one
from memory and start again.

267
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,560
There's no going back!

268
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,400
No, don't say that.

269
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,960
He's gonna drown!

270
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,120
There you go! You're ruining it again.

271
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,960
That boat is sinking!

272
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,560
That's not my fault!

273
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,160
What about those people?

274
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,480
There wasn't any food poisoning,
was there?

275
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,680
You want to do this now?

276
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,120
All right.

277
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,040
They tried to kill me, Rae.

278
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,920
They tried to suck the light out of me,
if you can grasp that concept.

279
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,800
Who were?

280
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,000
All of them!

281
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,680
Nobody wants to kill you...

282
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,680
What?

283
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,480
Repeat that.

284
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,640
- I said, nobody...
- Say the words. Come on!

285
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,320
You mean I just imagined it.

286
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,360
No.

287
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,600
I just meant it must be a mistake.

288
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,680
A mistake? Lady...

289
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,880
The mistake is that you think
I'm making this up!

290
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,120
No, I don't.

291
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,360
You sound so much like them it's scary!

292
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,360
Now, they were trying to kill me.
Do you understand?

293
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,640
Yeah, I understand.

294
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,080
Turn around. Don't look
at the bloody boat. Look at me!

295
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,240
Okay, I'm sorry.

296
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,120
What are you doing, Hughie? Go away!

297
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,240
- Okay, ladies, forget the home movie.
- Listen, ifyou turn around...

298
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,200
...you'll get these incredible silhouettes.

299
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,440
When I want your advice on how
to take photographs, I'll ask you.

300
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,160
Until then, keep your mouth shut!

301
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,680
I'll remember that, but for now,
Russell, please.

302
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,320
Lfyou move two steps to your left,
I can get you with the boat.

303
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,880
We'll look at this someday and laugh.

304
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,680
For God's sake, Hughie!
Get that bloody camera offme!

305
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,840
I take the pictures, Hughie, baby.
You dance, I shoot.

306
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,320
What the fuck is your problem?

307
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,360
This is stereo, Ben.

308
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,160
Low production...

309
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,760
...garage music.

310
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,640
Come on.

311
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,640
Saracen, Saracen, this is Orpheus.
Do you read me? Over.

312
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,280
Saracen, this is...

313
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,560
John?

314
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,160
Yes!

315
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,200
John?

316
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,520
Are you okay?

317
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,520
Are you there?

318
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,760
Yes, Rae, I'm here. Can you hear me?

319
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,440
Are you there?

320
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,960
Rae, it's me.

321
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,400
I'm not reading you.

322
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,840
Is that you, John?

323
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,360
Are you hurt?

324
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,800
What about the boat? It's sinking, isn't it?

325
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,440
So that's it.

326
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,920
No, you're not hurt and, no,
the boat isn't sinking. Is that right?

327
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,760
Are you following?

328
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,200
What should I do?

329
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,880
I can't make him turn around.
Hejust won't.

330
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,600
Do you want me to stop the boat?

331
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,880
I don't know how.

332
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,440
Come on.

333
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,480
Don't worry. I'll work it out.

334
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,600
You'll be here soon, won't you?

335
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,400
Score one for Mrs. Ingram.
She has a hell of a season ahead of her.

336
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,440
Ben, no!

337
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,720
Leave it!

338
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,000
Leave it there.

339
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,760
Fetch, Ben. Bring it here, boy.

340
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,680
- Bring it here.
- Stay, Ben.

341
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,000
- Come on.
- Tread right there.

342
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,400
Okay, drop it. Drop the key.

343
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,560
Hold the key.

344
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,080
- No, drop it!
- Keep it.

345
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,360
Over here. Come on.

346
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,720
Tread.

347
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,360
Backstroke.

348
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,120
Come on.

349
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,400
That's beautiful bone structure there.

350
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,120
Good boy! He's a champ, this one.

351
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,040
Jump, Ben. Up. Come on, climb.

352
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,200
Thank you.

353
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,440
Friends?

354
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,120
Friends.

355
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,720
- Talk to me, Russell.
- Come on. The camera's rolling.

356
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,280
Lose that! Talk to me, Russell.
Who are you?

357
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,680
Come on, drop the veil.

358
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,280
Drop the veil, sucker! Drop your guts!

359
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,560
I got the picture.

360
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,360
Vietnam, Castro, Cambodia!

361
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,480
Russell Bellows,
big, brave war photographer.

362
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,440
The man on the edge
capturing the face of death.

363
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,000
But now appearing
with his five new refugees.

364
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,680
Five suckers on a sinking boat.
The ultimate session.

365
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,240
Moral decay. What 60-minute wet dreams
are made of. Am I right?

366
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,040
Come on in, Russ. The water's great.

367
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,480
You got the bloated head.
How about the bloated belly?

368
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,000
Come out from behind that camera.

369
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,680
John, can you hear me?

370
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,840
Saracen to the black schooner.
Come in, please.

371
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,040
Come in, please.

372
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,680
John, it's me.

373
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,120
I got the key up onto the deck, but he...

374
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,280
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

375
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,760
Is it the boat?

376
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,760
Is it sinking?

377
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,200
How long?

378
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,800
Hours?

379
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,000
How many? Two?

380
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,680
Four?

381
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,240
Six?

382
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,600
I drained you ofyour power, Russell!
You've lost.

383
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,800
Good night! Good night!

384
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,760
Six?

385
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,960
I'm gonna be there by sunset.

386
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,440
I love you.

387
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,880
Answer me, please. Answer me.

388
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,160
Do you read me?

389
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,680
John, please.

390
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,520
I've just gotta go to the bathroom.

391
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,920
Sorry.

392
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,960
You gotta do what you gotta do.

393
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,360
Hello?

394
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,080
- For later.
- You read my mind.

395
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,840
Friends, Rae.

396
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,480
- I better put him up on the deck.
- Don't worry. Get out!

397
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,480
- I better put him up...
- Come on!

398
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,960
Go away.

399
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,680
Where are you going?

400
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,160
To get a drink.

401
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,360
Isn't this great?

402
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,760
- What?
- These lemons, they're just...

403
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,560
Cruising around the South Pacific,
just the two of us.

404
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,000
How do I look?

405
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,120
- Great.
- How do I smell?

406
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,720
Thank you for your honesty.

407
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:04,520
What's missing from my life at
this moment are the soothing sounds of...

408
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,320
...Julio Iglesias, Joni Mitchell
and the Broadway Album.

409
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,400
Did you get these tapes thrown in free
with the knives?

410
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,320
He finds it!

411
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,760
That looks good.

412
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,320
It is.

413
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,040
Do you want some?

414
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,640
Come on.

415
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,560
You do. Come on, have it.

416
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,600
Now, look...

417
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,080
Do you want it?

418
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,520
I want it.

419
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,720
Thank you.

420
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,240
I better go and get dressed.

421
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,400
Keep it. Make me another one.

422
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,440
Room service.

423
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,000
A squall's coming.
We better get the canopy down.

424
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,080
Oh, shit.

425
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,800
Friends, Rae.

426
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,600
Friends!

427
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,880
Don't make me.

428
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,720
No one's gonna make you.

429
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,640
Stay there!

430
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,080
I just want to talk!

431
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,120
I found you.

432
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,360
Fresh water.

433
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,000
That's extravagant.

434
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,880
No, you want to hear extravagant?

435
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,320
A steaming hot bath...

436
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,960
...that you can slip into up to your ears...

437
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,800
...with coffee and a croissant.

438
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,720
A croissant.

439
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,400
Covered...

440
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,400
...in bitter, dark marmalade.

441
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,760
And mango.

442
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,920
Really, really cold.

443
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,920
Now you're talking.

444
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,080
You know what I'd love for lunch?

445
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,640
Fresh asparagus.

446
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,520
Then pasta.

447
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,360
Angel-hair pasta.

448
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:18,720
With heaps of basil and garlic and olive oil.

449
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,440
And apple pie.

450
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,640
Have you got the towel?
