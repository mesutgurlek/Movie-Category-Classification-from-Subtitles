1
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,284
China-Hong Kong Border

2
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,531
Block 37? Down there

3
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,699
Thanks

4
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,430
Mrs. Lee, you're beautiful

5
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,762
They say your dumplings
are the most expensive

6
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,993
Of course, come in

7
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,668
You've come in the right time

8
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,738
The water is boiling, waiting for you

9
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,511
I know you

10
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,219
I watched you on TV,
when I first came to Hong Kong

11
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,346
You're a star!

12
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,192
I retired long ago

13
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,023
Please, sit

14
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,792
Guess how old I am

15
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,131
Sit here, please

16
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,146
Here

17
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,163
Guess, Mrs. Lee

18
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,532
Well...

19
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,569
You're in your thirties

20
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,778
I'm old, call me Aunt Mei

21
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,787
You don't have wrinkles

22
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,513
And I have good color

23
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,918
I'm my own best advertisement

24
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,687
Your skin is great

25
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,029
My dumplings are worth it

26
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,096
You get what you pay for

27
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,763
Mrs. Lee

28
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,128
Let me get you more cabbage

29
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,103
I bet you dislike chives with their strong flavor

30
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,902
This cabbage is great

31
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,671
I'll cut it smaller, squeeze it dry

32
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,782
I'll put more ginger in the filling

33
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,213
Up to you Okay

34
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,423
The Northerners always say...

35
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:19,265
Good feeling comes from a nap
Good taste comes from a dumpling

36
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,369
These have 1,400 years of history

37
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,404
But the Southerners still say

38
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,413
It's just meat-stuffed dough, nothing special

39
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,429
I use high-gluten flour

40
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,961
For texture and chewiness

41
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,261
I knead it fine

42
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,101
Until it is like a peeled egg

43
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,435
Smooth, translucent, and soft

44
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,674
There is a secret to keep the filling
from leaking out

45
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,167
So that the juicy flavor explodes in the mouth

46
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,408
Mrs. Lee

47
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,851
Eat while it's warm

48
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,079
Take your time

49
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,943
Behave, baby

50
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,511
I eat these often. They're nutritious

51
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,880
Sometimes in soup...

52
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,721
or minced and steamed with citrus peel

53
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,419
But the dumplings are best

54
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,989
They made me famous

55
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,765
Here, baby

56
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,477
It's shame to discard this

57
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,680
Wash it

58
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,723
Bury it with the flowers

59
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,122
They will bloom especially well

60
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,364
Let me tell you

61
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,295
Expensive cosmetics claim to contain...

62
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:44,272
bird's nest, longevity mushrooms
bee's pollen, pearls...

63
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,041
essence of hot springs

64
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,842
All lies!

65
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,613
For women to look younger,

66
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,250
you must start from inside...

67
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,250
for the best color

68
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,883
Only my secret formula can do this

69
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,434
Mrs. Lee...

70
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,571
think of the results, not what it was

71
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,984
Let me sing for you

72
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,814
After my customers eat...

73
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,890
I often sing songs from my youth...

74
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,891
for entertainment, listen:

75
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:20,130
Lake Hung waters are rough

76
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:28,178
At the shore is my home

77
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:36,116
At dawn, boats go out with nets

78
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:47,527
At dusk, they return loaded with fish

79
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,699
Wild ducks and lotus roots are here

80
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:56,501
Autumns are bountiful with rice

81
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:03,948
They say heaven is beautiful

82
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:16,961
How can it compare with Lake Hung?

83
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,547
The kitchen cabinets
will be delivered tomorrow

84
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,251
Bring soup the day after tomorrow

85
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,286
Excuse me, Mr. Lee, I have to go

86
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,052
deliver Mrs. Lee's soup now

87
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:57,626
Mr. Lee, you've stayed here for months

88
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,301
You don't want to leave

89
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,170
My home is being renovated

90
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,634
My dining set just arrived from Paris

91
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,643
It's too humid, my designer refuses to work

92
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,947
I'm fussy like him

93
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,518
If it doesn't feel good, I reject it

94
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,795
Please behave

95
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,220
Stop it...

96
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,289
I'll behave when I eat

97
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,171
You are naughty I can't break it

98
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,712
What is it?

99
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,283
Good for you

100
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,288
It looks horrible

101
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,163
Try some? No, thanks

102
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,615
Your soup, Madam

103
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,922
What did she say to Mr. Lee?

104
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,389
I don't know

105
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,973
Shenzhen, China

106
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:02,485
I went through so much to get these

107
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,661
It is hard to keep secret
I hear reporters want pictures

108
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,892
The problem is from Hong Kong
Don't come for the next two weeks

109
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,070
Even the locals can't get a hold of the stock

110
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,337
We'll see

111
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,035
This is for you Thank

112
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:23,274
You know him? Who?

113
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,350
S.N. Wang Oh, him

114
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,077
Why did you break up?

115
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,412
It was long ago

116
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,181
He disliked the one-child policy

117
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,758
But I was aborting over 10 fetuses a day...

118
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,487
or over 3,000 a year, over 30,000 for 10 years

119
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,756
Because I had done so many abortions

120
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,698
He was afraid we would be cursed

121
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,392
It was national policy Yes...

122
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,833
I was serving the people, Thanks

123
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,438
Thanks, bye

124
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,234
This way, Miss

125
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,781
China-Hong Kong Border

126
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,319
X-ray, please That one?

127
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,848
The lunchbox Okay

128
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,031
Open it

129
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,473
Ham and egg on rice?

130
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,675
Yes, lunch for my son:

131
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,410
Ham egg, plain rice

132
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,590
You may go Thanks

133
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:43,723
Thank you

134
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,563
I didn't lie to you, trust me

135
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,070
Stop it!

136
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,533
Anna!

137
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,302
Believe me, I didn't lie to you

138
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,311
Stop following me

139
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,575
You better stop or I'll beat you into pieces

140
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:12,414
I taped these for you

141
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,489
Enjoy!

142
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,275
Hello? Fung!

143
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,144
Yes

144
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,814
Is it raining in London?

145
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,221
Your mom said you maxed out your credit card

146
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,065
Who are you with? A girl?

147
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,292
Girlfriend?

148
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,565
You're dating?

149
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,605
Does your mom know?

150
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,008
And she tells me...

151
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,272
she hasn't seen your report card

152
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,246
You did well to choose me as your sponsor

153
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,320
I'll call you later

154
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,683
Okay? Bye!

155
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,918
Dating at thirteen!

156
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,286
Dating at thirteen?

157
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,461
Puppy love. Your son?

158
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,861
I look that old?

159
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,661
Do you have children?

160
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,838
We don't know whose fault it is

161
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,776
I'll bring back your youth...

162
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,472
and his heart

163
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,555
Do you have more potent stuff
for faster results?

164
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,927
It's best in the 5th or 6th month

165
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,606
Extract it by breaking the water sac
and slide it

166
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,209
It's covered by a layer of creamy fat

167
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,471
The colors are defined
and you can see the cranium

168
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,715
And the little hands and feet moving around

169
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,347
In the first trimester, they're this small

170
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,456
By the third trimester, they're too tough

171
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,087
The 5th month is perfect, kitten-like...

172
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,763
and most nutritious

173
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,664
Let me show you

174
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,997
Some say even if you're eighty

175
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,435
After eating them

176
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,441
You feel eighteen again

177
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,445
See

178
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,856
This is what I chopped up

179
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,920
You're still afraid?

180
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,062
I was a doctor

181
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,629
In China, only the best minds
could study medicine

182
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,405
My forte was surgery with no bleeding

183
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,836
Always bloodless

184
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,777
So you've saved many lives

185
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,313
Nothing is left after I'm done!

186
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,710
We must all face our fates

187
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,954
Our fates are all different

188
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:43,161
So we must treasure our time...

189
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,120
and live well

190
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,308
Honey?

191
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,111
I'm at your favorite bakery

192
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,853
Want some custard tarts?

193
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,284
I'm working Really?

194
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,716
I'm be home late

195
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,593
Remember your promise

196
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,257
Of course, our 15th anniversary

197
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,700
I'll keep you company tomorrow

198
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,829
Okay? Bye

199
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,249
You were just on a trip last week

200
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,459
You promised to be with me

201
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,986
I'm just going for a few days

202
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,168
I want to visit my nephew in London

203
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,205
Sure, if you like

204
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,374
And go shopping, too

205
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,648
So many zeroes?

206
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,151
You used to laugh a lot

207
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,193
Aren't you happy with all the zeroes?

208
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,257
Laughing doesn't equal happy

209
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,493
Plus, you're not coming

210
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,292
I'll be gone 4 or 5 days

211
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,068
And if not?

212
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,174
I'll write you another as a fine

213
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,141
Fines are for mistakes

214
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,607
Whatever

215
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,917
Hello? If you don't send that contract

216
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,654
I'll change my mind

217
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,857
Not more than 950 million

218
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,207
These are bland and crunchy

219
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:32,313
By the 2nd months
they have little hands and feet

220
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,475
And ears too! Those were bones?

221
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,081
Nah... their bones aren't hard

222
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,280
I'll chop them finer next time

223
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,289
Cook them in broth next time

224
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,857
It will enhance the flavor

225
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,663
Are you done?

226
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,448
This can't go on Why?

227
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,086
My skin is still flabby

228
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,792
It's much better!

229
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,057
I need your most potent stuff

230
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,203
I'll find it...

231
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,304
let me sing now

232
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,401
Sing as you wish, I must go

233
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,305
Bye, Mrs. Lee...

234
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,342
Mrs. Lee, this way please

235
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,183
I'll find it for you

236
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,354
Call me when you do Don't worry!

237
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,391
Aunt Mei?

238
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,654
You are...? Mrs. Kam recommended you

239
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,330
Come in, hello, Little girl

240
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,841
Beg Aunt Mei

241
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,776
Find someone else

242
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:47,177
Where? Mrs. Kam says you were
a great doctor in China

243
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,376
I believe her

244
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,314
It's too dangerous

245
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,953
Let me recommend a Shenzhen hospital

246
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,893
It's quite good, and it's legal

247
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,669
I know, but I can't afford the fees

248
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,203
Black market, then

249
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:10,798
You are the black market

250
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,636
No, I'm not!

251
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,892
Her feet are swollen

252
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,364
She's showing

253
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,335
I thought she gained weight

254
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,005
She's five months along

255
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,906
In the first trimester, I could scrape the vagina

256
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,537
But now it's all in place, I can't force it

257
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,908
The bones will pierce the vagina

258
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,251
It's too dangerous, no

259
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,021
I beg you, she's only fifteen

260
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,159
I'm retired, and it's illegal

261
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,690
How can she give birth to a baby?

262
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,159
She's too young to be a mother

263
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,546
Say something! Speak!

264
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,577
Speak up and beg Aunt Mei!

265
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,717
I must tell you

266
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,883
Her dad did it, we can't keep it

267
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,857
Please abort it for her

268
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,523
It's a monster

269
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,864
Once the baby is born...

270
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:49,405
Is it my child or grandchild?

271
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,371
Please

272
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,092
Quit your job today

273
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,492
Will you be my sugar daddy?
I can afford you

274
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,768
You don't eat that much

275
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,662
I do

276
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,696
You like to laugh, too

277
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:55,449
Your home is so grand!

278
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,261
What's the use? It's empty

279
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,057
It's a house, not a home

280
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,597
My husband is with some young girl

281
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,703
Did he notice the difference?

282
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,705
I can't wait, I need your best

283
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,718
For youth and beauty

284
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,953
Women must fight time

285
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:38,334
I used to always laugh

286
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,435
After high school, I went into a TV series

287
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,202
I became very popular

288
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,975
Mr. Lee was the sponsor of my show

289
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,240
I fell during a stunt

290
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:54,841
And he held me

291
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,280
So you married him?

292
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,988
I was just 20

293
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,521
Everyone wants to marry well

294
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,957
He was in his thirties, and he loved me

295
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,933
I thought it would be "happily ever after"

296
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,661
All men love 20-years-old gals

297
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,568
Yes, when they are in their thirties...

298
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,100
and in their 40's and 50's...

299
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,047
and in their 60's and 70's

300
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,312
I let it go

301
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:31,012
As long as he doesn't flaunt it

302
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,847
Men are all the same...

303
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,723
all they know is sex

304
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,064
What's so good about a 20-year-old?

305
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,062
And you?

306
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,297
So sad

307
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,935
I broke up with my first love...

308
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,443
and married an uncultured cook

309
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:56,671
a cook...

310
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,046
Times have changed

311
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,585
All Chinese wanted to come to HK at that time

312
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,951
Wanted a Hong Kong identity Card

313
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,190
And I...

314
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,752
After a hard struggle

315
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,723
I got mine and I grew up

316
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,959
But I also got divorced

317
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,700
I don't think you dare get a divorce

318
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,411
Women like you are everywhere

319
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,882
Be glad you know me

320
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,824
otherwise... Second Wife in 5 years...

321
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,893
Third Wife in 10 years...

322
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,265
and Fourth Wife in 15

323
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,893
and I am different from you

324
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,263
I rely on myself

325
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,004
You may be rich, but I am free

326
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:07,114
At the shore is my home

327
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:15,984
Mrs. Lee, go cast your net

328
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,421
Mrs. Lee!

329
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:28,403
Return loaded with fish

330
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,340
Thanks, Aunt Mei You're welcome, bye

331
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,376
Hello? Not yet, Mrs. Lee

332
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,114
Money can't buy it, just like love

333
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,225
The prime material is rare

334
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,986
All right, bye

335
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,111
What is this place?

336
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,907
Relax...

337
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:44,906
Almost done

338
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,145
Relax...

339
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,990
relax

340
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,498
I'll be done soon

341
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:56,910
It's been eighteen hours

342
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,449
Relax

343
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,750
You must relax, too

344
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,491
Will she be all right?

345
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:06,322
Don't worry

346
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,460
Relax

347
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,591
The vagina is not fully dilated yet

348
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,538
She still has the body of girl

349
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,205
We women must defend ourselves...

350
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,846
or they will bully us

351
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,544
Take care of your daughter...

352
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,343
so it doesn't happen again

353
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,319
The water broke

354
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,758
It's fine Don't be nervous

355
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:48,163
I swear it will be over in ten seconds

356
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,803
Deep breath

357
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:54,735
Work with me, relax... Hold on

358
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:03,181
Relax! Cry if you want to

359
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:07,088
It's fully dilated, don't worry

360
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,416
One, two, three

361
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,960
The head is out... wait!

362
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:18,499
Where are my tongs?

363
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:20,962
Relax...

364
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,274
relax

365
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,456
Beautiful

366
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,491
Don't be sad

367
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,063
The baby has no more life

368
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:52,930
So fresh

369
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,236
Little girl

370
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,573
Little girl, you'll be fine

371
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,509
You'll be fine

372
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,415
It's over. Little girl

373
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:18,622
Lie down on my couch

374
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:20,959
Easy

375
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,094
Thanks Take my shoes

376
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,400
Let me sing for you

377
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,599
She's so heavy

378
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,798
I can't hold her much longer

379
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,107
Wait

380
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,504
Mrs. Lee, help yourself

381
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,504
I will make steamed dumplings

382
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:12,577
Have more wine

383
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,261
It was a boy

384
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,997
A boy?

385
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:28,472
See, look at that

386
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,548
So beautiful and rare

387
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:37,676
In China, people only abort girls

388
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:42,148
I didn't use drugs, just a catheter

389
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,351
Drugs make it inedible

390
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,630
They will damage its nervous system

391
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:49,959
It is also a first-born, even more nutritious

392
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,568
It's the most nutritious thing in the world

393
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,967
You saw the mother, nice girl

394
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:58,904
Young, still in high school

395
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,144
Healthy

396
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:06,007
Well, what are you waiting for?
What are you cooking today?

397
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:35,558
You'll feel like a new woman

398
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,495
My husband broke his leg

399
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:17,330
Now you need me

400
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:24,237
Normally you wouldn't care. Where I go

401
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,264
You smell nice...

402
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,402
Iook nice

403
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,540
You haven't held me in ages

404
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,720
Thirsty?

405
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,919
I'll get water

406
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:12,685
It's so hot

407
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,698
And we must go to Mongkok next

408
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,232
I forgot about that

409
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,698
With two cases

410
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,065
Woe is me And they're huge

411
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,131
Oh?

412
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,010
What is it..."blood" What is it?

413
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,670
You're joking

414
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:36,879
Here's a tissue Whose is it, Driver?

415
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,653
Kay? How are you feeling?

416
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:46,456
Kay? Answer me

417
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:51,930
Kay? Are you all right?

418
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,596
I don't want to die

419
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:06,310
Don't die, Kay!

420
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:10,577
It's all my fault!

421
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,986
It's a reasonable amount

422
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:55,750
I'm busy, my assistant Emily will follow up

423
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,787
Don't worry, bye!

424
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:02,727
Sheep placentas or longevity mushrooms?

425
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,025
Otherwise, it must be the Snow Lotus

426
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,966
I say a major facelift

427
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,407
She's done something

428
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,372
Or eaten something

429
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,670
Mrs. Lee

430
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:20,141
You look great Thanks

431
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,073
Talking behind my back?

432
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:25,015
Of course not!
Just about how beautiful you look

433
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,345
Please wait for a moment

434
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,583
You're so late

435
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,190
Perhaps she finds herself a guru

436
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,729
I think "voodoo" is closer

437
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,328
What evil thoughts!

438
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,396
That's horrible

439
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,501
It is scary

440
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,542
Please sit, you're the host

441
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,813
You are the host

442
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,278
Please help yourselves Well

443
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:58,016
The food smells fishy

444
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:02,586
Is it the beef? The beef?

445
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,727
Fishy, I don't eat fish

446
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,889
Is it the fish?

447
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,925
I don't think so

448
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:12,733
There is a strange smell

449
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:15,966
I smell it, too What's wrong?

450
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:21,708
It's not the fish

451
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,878
But it really stinks

452
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:26,845
What's that?

453
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,914
It's coming from here

454
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,155
Excuse me

455
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,056
She's off again

456
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,061
Where is she going

457
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,828
The smell is gone You're right

458
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:45,787
Aunt Mei?

459
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,430
What is your "best stuff"

460
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,092
What did you feed me?

461
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,267
Was the fetus sick?

462
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,102
I smell fishy all over

463
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:58,330
What do you mean?

464
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:01,609
I've eaten so much and I'm fine

465
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:05,205
If anything happens to me
I hold you responsible!

466
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:06,576
I'll sue you!

467
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,608
You'll sue me?

468
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,780
You're the cannibal

469
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,151
Don't be silly, Mrs. Lee.

470
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,994
It smells because it works, you're too sensitive

471
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:24,560
Look at the mirror tomorrow, you'll be grateful

472
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:29,062
What do I do?

473
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:31,799
What do I do?

474
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:39,909
This baby was hard to find

475
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,585
It was a child of an incest

476
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,186
One in a million, you know

477
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,647
You mean a true bastard?

478
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,349
This is because of the incest?

479
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:55,190
Incest makes it extra potent

480
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,968
Hurry...

481
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:03,264
Turn your TV to Channel 2... it's your series

482
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:20,317
No Really?

483
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:22,549
The one you said looks like Alan

484
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,090
No way

485
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,391
Just admit it

486
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:37,163
No Really?

487
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:43,574
Sorry Never mind

488
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:53,114
Mrs. Lee, are you crying?

489
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:57,190
Don't cry, be strong

490
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,554
Have a good sleep

491
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:00,854
Take a hot bath

492
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,997
Sip some vinegar, you'll be fine

493
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,725
Good night, Mrs. Lee

494
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:56,934
Coming...

495
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,311
Aunt Mei?

496
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,778
Yes, Mr. Lee

497
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,057
You're breaking the law

498
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,356
How come?

499
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,200
This is just my dumpling shop

500
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,137
You advocate cannibalism

501
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,440
Does it really work?

502
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,251
Please sit

503
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,161
I will prove it to you

504
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,248
Please take a seat, Mr. Lee

505
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,663
We Chinese have had a long history

506
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,101
Who can tell if it is illegal to eat flesh?

507
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,972
About eating humans

508
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:35,370
Ancient medical texts say...

509
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:37,876
human flesh and organs...

510
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,709
can heal diseases

511
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,212
During famines

512
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,786
People could not bear to eat their own children

513
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,184
So they traded and ate other people's children

514
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:55,489
An ancient chef heard that...

515
01:08:56,132 --> 01:09:00,296
...his Emperor wanted to taste human flesh

516
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,165
To please his Emperor...

517
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:06,103
...he cooked and served his own son
to the monarch

518
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:12,177
Tales abound of caring sons and daughters...

519
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:16,375
...cutting off flesh for their parents' medicines

520
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,713
In the Water Margin

521
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:25,858
Heroes ate human organs with their wine

522
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,923
One even opened a bun shop
using flesh as filling

523
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:37,697
The Japanese ate the Chinese

524
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:43,534
China had civil unrest and famines

525
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,179
Did they avoid human flesh?

526
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,911
We hate people "whole-heartedly"

527
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,116
A patriotic poem describes...

528
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,486
"eating barbarian flesh...

529
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:01,521
drinking their blood"

530
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:07,261
We love people "with all our hearts"

531
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,630
We want to take bites...

532
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:13,335
and swallow them

533
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:18,441
We are inside each other

534
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,441
You were 20 in 1960?

535
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,642
You're in your sixties now

536
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:44,256
Age is just a number

537
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,328
But you're an old lady

538
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,906
My body is what's real

539
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,476
Feel it, harder

540
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,948
Is it young enough?

541
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:13,978
You can be the same...

542
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,321
...stay young forever

543
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:20,360
Stay young forever by eating my dumplings

544
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,507
This is Mrs. Lee

545
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:43,674
Do you have any supply?

546
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:48,085
Money is not a problem

547
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,324
I need supplies...

548
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,053
Mr. Lee, will you return?

549
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:27,389
Yes, to eat your flesh

550
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,889
That's a promise I must go

551
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,935
Goodbye

552
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:44,435
I'll wait for you

553
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,785
I'll wait for you

554
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:08,761
Aunt Mei!

555
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,166
Aunt Mei, it's me

556
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:35,379
Dizzy? And rashes?

557
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,081
It's just nerves!

558
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:40,586
You'll be fine after you move back home...

559
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,127
You'll be fine

560
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:47,101
I'll give you drugs to ease the itch

561
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:49,600
Hotel living is not for you

562
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:54,005
Nurse?

563
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:55,706
Yes, Dr. Wong

564
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:59,037
Mrs. Lee's driver will pick up her medication

565
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:01,248
Yes, how many days' prescription?

566
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,410
Give her a week Okay

567
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,879
Mr. Lee's secretary called and asked

568
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:40,316
Why you skipped your ultrasound yesterday

569
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:43,987
I'm here now Here's your report

570
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:46,060
Call us if your morning sickness continues

571
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,090
Thank you

572
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:48,354
Goodbye Bye

573
01:18:58,233 --> 01:18:59,393
Thank you

574
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,096
Aunt Mei

575
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:30,825
You scared me!

576
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,859
I was rude...

577
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:39,635
But as a woman
you know what I was going through

578
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,137
I really need your help

579
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:45,274
I've retired

580
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:47,214
Money is not a problem

581
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:52,216
That "best stuff" was a dream

582
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:02,295
Mrs. Lee, don't try that

583
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:05,531
I beg you, I really need you

584
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,792
Please help

585
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:22,207
Mr. Lee, I am fixing my hair now

586
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,681
I've been waiting for your call

587
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:28,019
I want to see you soon, too!

588
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,256
Okay, Bye!

589
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:13,734
Don't move

590
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:19,873
Dispatch, we're at 2103

591
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,874
Victim is male, badly cut up...
We need an ambulance

592
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,140
We have the female under control

593
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,155
Tell them to hurry

594
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,932
Please tell the ambulance to hurry

595
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:45,682
What are these?

596
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,724
Must you scream? So much stuff left

597
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:45,047
He's back with me

598
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:48,948
I won't let go again

599
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:50,648
Give up

600
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:56,226
I've thought about it

601
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,390
But you're pregnant

602
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:04,569
He said he wanted a son

603
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,570
And if it's a girl?

604
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:14,571
Then I charge less

605
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:17,042
You're having the child?

606
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:21,884
I'm five months along

607
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,790
I'm almost due

608
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:29,988
I'm young, the time is nothing

609
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,692
I can live on Mr. Lee's cheque...

610
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,604
...at least for a while

611
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:43,767
I want your baby

612
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:49,182
Why? Inheritance issues?

613
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:52,677
I want your baby now

614
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,522
Now?

615
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:03,560
Abort it, You don't have to carry it

616
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,461
And I don't have to worry

617
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,867
I'll double your price

618
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:18,537
How's that?

619
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:43,431
Doctor, she's in her second trimester

620
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,669
Don't let her miscarry

621
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:50,066
Do not use drugs to induce birth

622
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:53,436
I don't want drugs in its system

623
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:58,112
Use a catheter...

624
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:01,450
...and adrenaline to stimulate the vagina

625
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,521
Then the fetus will be perfect

626
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,089
Using this method will take longer

627
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,699
And cause pain to the mother

628
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,132
The pain only lasts for a while

629
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:23,142
You want...

630
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:24,936
to keep this fetus?

631
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:28,514
Yes, and in its pure form

632
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:33,346
Why do you want it?

633
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:38,324
Trophy, a souvenir

634
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:42,292
It's the world's most expensive trophy

635
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:46,331
Hurry, then

636
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:56,638
I want to watch

637
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:23,094
Shenzhen, China

638
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:39,439
Put three wishes...

639
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:41,578
...in the music box

640
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:42,874
Your first wish?

641
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:44,779
A man to love me all my life

642
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:47,248
And then?

643
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:48,716
Happiness always

644
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:52,288
What's the third? Hurry

645
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:53,255
Youth and beauty

646
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,562
Of course, beauty Hurry, it's our turn

647
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:03,693
Your wish of marriage is granted

648
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:06,240
Wait, greet my guests for me

649
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:09,875
I left something Hurry, then
