Yes?

00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,172
You should get some sleep.

[Sidgwick] Dr. Matheson!

10
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,190
Thanks for coming.

11
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,152
You can't imagine how
pleased I am to see you.

12
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,282
This is Dr. Matheson, actually.

13
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,863
Oh, I'm sorry.

14
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,698
Please, forgive me.

15
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,829
These last few days have
been a bit difficult.

16
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,127
Don't worry, I should have worn a lab coat.
That's Dr. Buckley.

17
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,078
Nice to meet you.

18
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,920
The pleasure's
all mine, really.

19
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:12,053
You can't begin to imagine what's
been going on here, really.

20
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,011
We haven't slept
a wink in weeks...

21
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,141
isn't that right, Sarah?

None of us have.</i>

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,197
It's starting.

[soft thudding]

29
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,081
[Traci] Did you hear him?

30
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,206
[odd intonation]
He is a bit angry today.

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,964
[Tom] Who's angry?

32
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,883
Traci's been
a real help, you know?

33
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,426
She's, uh... she's
been such a help.

34
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,879
[Margaret] I bet.

35
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,679
Can we see the rest
of the house?

36
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,553
Sure. This way, please.

37
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,226
It's an old house,
but the price was great.

38
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,976
We only moved in a while ago.
We're still settling in.

39
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,774
Hi, I'm Tom.
Uh, I'm a physicist.

40
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,602
- If you want to keep doing...
- I'm a physicist, too.

41
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,439
What did you think I was?
A housewife?

42
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,775
- A hairdresser?
- No, I...

43
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,201
- Oh, I... I didn't mean...
- Forget it.

44
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,198
Actually, I am a hairdresser.

45
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,449
Oh.

Traci. Traci Northrop.

47
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,118
[Margaret] Tom, enough mingling.
We're going upstairs.

48
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,924
I know, she's been a real help.

49
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,299
Since when?

50
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,926
I don't know, a few days.

51
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,803
Three or four, isn't
that right, Sarah?

52
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,305
You took so long. We
didn't know where to turn.

53
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,137
We're not a public
service, Mr. Sidgwick.

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,938
We do what we can.

55
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,311
Sure. Uh, excuse me a moment.

I told you not to play

the heating gets fixed.

60
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,830
We're still settling
in, you know?

61
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,329
We, uh... still have some
stuff to sort out.

62
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,001
But the price was great.

63
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,579
Stand up, sweetheart,
and say hello.

64
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,005
Say hi.

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,081
[Susan] Hi.

66
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,257
- Hi.
- Hi.

67
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,675
You said "the girls."

68
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,048
Julia is at her grandparents'.

69
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,424
She wasn't feeling so great,

70
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,096
so we thought we just as soon

71
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,015
send her back to Vermont
for a few days.

72
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,966
A few days.

[Traci] Everything's ready.

76
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,982
Sorry. I didn't
mean to butt in.

77
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,982
Whenever you want.

78
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,732
Too much light.

no matter what happens,

please don't break the circle.

have to speak louder.

What about your mom?

No, we don't have
to shake hands.

to do it again

I won't say
anything to your dad.

That's it.

thing with the table.

No, I know that, Susan. I
didn't ask you about a table.

- Why is that fair?
- It is.

You still didn't get
to the bottom of this!

Don't worry about it,
Mr. Sidgwick.

again, just call us.

00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,342
[Margaret] If you press down
hard on the top of the table

168
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,143
and draw your hands
toward your body,

169
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,846
the outer two table lengths

170
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,479
are going to go up like
a schoolgirl's dress.

171
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,185
You can even stick
the edge of your shoe

172
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,895
under one of the table legs

173
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,322
and, by pressing down
firmly with your hands

174
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,240
and lifting your foot
at the same time,

175
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,990
you can make the whole
table come off the ground.

176
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,242
It just takes
a little bit of muscle

177
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,039
and a whole lot of practice.

178
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,116
So, with the right
partner in crime,

179
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,669
you can put on quite a show.

180
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,372
The setting is important.
Keep it dark,

181
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,878
always, under
any pretext whatsoever.

182
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,679
The spirits demand it,
you need to concentrate...

183
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,223
I know what you are thinking.
It's not scientific.

184
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:42,225
But you need darkness to develop
a photograph, don't you?

185
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,055
Miss Owen?

186
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,936
So are you saying that
all paranormal phenomena

187
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,109
are frauds
without any exception?

188
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,857
Actually, no, I'm not.

189
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,655
The majority simply have
a natural explanation

190
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,779
or are the result
of subjective interpretation.

191
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,737
[male student] But how do you
establish proper controls?

192
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,788
It's not difficult.

193
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,491
In a case like this one, without
any special preparation,

194
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,668
we would sit the medium
against the wall

195
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,996
and place two cards
behind his elbows.

196
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,502
Then if he moves his
arms to shift the table,

197
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,424
the cards will fall.

198
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,173
If the cards remain in place,

199
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,721
only the spirit
of a very friendly stagehand

200
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,548
is going to be
moving that table.

201
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,053
That's the principle.

202
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,555
Or if you prefer,
you can mark out

203
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,103
a security perimeter
for the hands

204
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,055
to ensure that
no pressure is applied

205
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,233
outside the center of gravity.

206
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,731
For instance,
for the round table,

207
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,532
it will only move if pressure
is exerted here... or here.

208
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,200
[male student 2] Have you ever
come across a single case

209
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,949
that couldn't be explained?

210
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,201
Like the existence of
an anomalous ability?

211
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,203
An anomalous ability?

212
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,125
Like what?

213
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,545
Like running a hundred
meters in under ten seconds?

214
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,841
Like composing a masterpiece
when you're stone deaf?

215
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,045
Your brain may be
the exception, Ben,

216
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,051
but most brains carry out

217
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,350
a dazzling array of complex
mental processes every second.

218
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,896
100,000 million neurons in
constant synaptic communication

219
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,942
geared to generating and regulating
our sensations and perceptions.

220
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,940
How we reason, how we think,

221
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,942
our emotions,
our mental images,

222
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,695
our attention span,
learning, memory.

223
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,244
Are these not merits enough
for the brain

224
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,788
without it having
"special powers" as well?

225
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,616
[female student] So you're
saying the existence of any kind

226
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,623
of paranormal power
is impossible?

227
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,750
What I'm saying, Miss Owen,

228
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,584
is that after 30 years of
investigating all kinds of phenomena

229
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,294
with the right
controls in place,

230
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,632
I have yet to witness
a single miracle.

231
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,433
- Excellent table lifting.
- Thank you.

232
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,887
[Shackleton] I... I just
sat in on your class.

233
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,346
Dr. Shackleton.

234
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,431
Inspirational. Congratulations.

235
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,485
You know, I admire
your skepticism, Margaret,

236
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,813
but you can't deny reality just
because you can't explain it.

237
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,944
That's not exactly true.

238
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,151
I can't explain why your
department gets double our budget,

239
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,077
but I don't deny it's the case.

240
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,621
So let's talk, join forces.

241
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,825
We're making huge strides
forward in the SPRC.

242
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,832
A discerning vision like
yours could really help.

243
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,130
I don't do hocus
pocus, Shackleton.

244
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,673
I suggest you don't either.

245
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:20,424
[audience laughs and claps]

246
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,594
You didn't even touch that.

247
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,679
How do you do that?

248
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,355
Isn't that incredible?

249
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,058
Well, it doesn't
always work, Mike.

250
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,438
I got lucky today,

251
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,860
that's all.

252
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,063
The fact is, we can all do it.

253
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,365
Well, frankly, I knew
that, uh, blind people

254
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,363
had a more developed
sense of smell,

255
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,365
but after what we've
seen here tonight...

256
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,369
[laughs]

257
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,917
You're right. You're right.

258
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,292
<i>[commentator] Simon Silver became
popular at the end of the Sixties</i>

259
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,045

262
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,922
<i>Many linked his exit

263
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,680

00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,601
<i>a skeptical reporter</i>

00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,350

269
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,900

271

273
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,741

his last public appearance...</i>

274
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,917
Margaret, I was watching that.

275
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,994
[Sally] Sorry, I, uh...

276
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,877
I thought maybe you wouldn't
hear me, 'cause you... didn't.

277
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,880
[CHUCKLE]

278
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,132
Is Dr. Matheson around?

279
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,464
Uh...

280
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,672
[chuckles]

281
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,507
[Tom] No, she's not.

282
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,058
Mm.

283
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,976
Can I leave the
assignment with you?

284
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,106
Yeah.

285
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,566
Just watch the coin, okay?

286
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,455
- Where'd it go?
- Lift your glass, please.

287
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,626
Where did you learn to do that?

288
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,677
You can't always
trust your eyes.

289
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,098
You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.

290
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,846
Oh, now you're really
taking the fun out of it.

291
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,553
The simpler, the better.
That's the principle.

292
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,934
The only way to pull a
rabbit out of a hat

293
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,983
is by putting it there
in the first place.

294
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,435
Open it.

295
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,988
It's in your left hand.

296
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,815
Did you... Did you see that?

297
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,992
No, I got lucky.

298
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,865
The class is really
great, you know?

299
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,946
It makes you think.

300
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,497
So, right, um...

301
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,166
you been working
for Matheson long?

302
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,788
Or are you a psychologist too?

303
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,959
Or a magician?

304
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,287
Wha...? [CHUCKLE]

305
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,917
Uh, no, I'm not a magician.

306
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,499
Um, actually, I'm a physicist.

307
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,960
- So why do you do this?
- Do what?

308
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,261
Investigate fake
paranormal stuff.

309
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,634
Don't you think
it's a bit weird?

310
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,308
- I just try to help Margaret...
- I mean, what for?

311
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,182
If someone claims to have
powers and actually don't,

312
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,979
who cares? Why bother?

313
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,351
Why bother?

314
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,027
If your mom was one
of those people

315
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,855
who went to see a psychic

316
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,363
because, um... her stomach
was bothering her

317
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,787
and the psychic

318
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,866
told her that it was nothing,
that it was just a...

319
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,953
a touch of gastritis.

320
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,709
But then later on...

321
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,166
you find out
it was stomach cancer

322
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,592
and it's too late to treat.

323
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,007
Do you think then you'd
say "Why bother?"

324
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,227

The reason people
believe in ghosts is

was something... after death.

If David woke up now
and looked in the mirror,

know who the man was

00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,206
I think you're getting
everybody to talk about you

649
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,788
without even going
out there again.

650
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,338
Wouldn't that just
confirm my powers?

[all laugh]

652
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,500
You bet it would!

653
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,804
You know, Silver? I've been
wanting to do this for 30 years.

654
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:49,970
You know what I've
brought with me?

655
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,047
Let me guess.

00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,853
Is it something that I can...

658
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,430
bend?

659
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,890
Well, how did you know that?

660
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,771
Did you just read my mind?

661
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,103
No. The handle's been
sticking out of your pocket

662
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,108
for the last few minutes.

663
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,484

do you guys think?</i>

[Tom] Why does no one let
me watch TV in this place?

670
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,048
Because only housewives
watch that show. [Thud]

671
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,545
Come on!

672
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,719
I have nothing
against housewives.

673
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,295
My mom happens to be one.

<i>I'm sure your mom</i>

675

doesn't sit around all day doing
macramé and watching crap TV.

676
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,889
We should take
a shot at Silver.

677
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,561
Oh, come on. Forget about it.

678

There's nothing interesting
for us there.

Are there no real

684
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,371
Silver's a real challenge.

685
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,369
Silver's already
been investigated.

686
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,870
Yeah, like 30 years ago. We
should investigate him now.

687
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,872
He doesn't interest me.
Forget him.

688
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,749
He interests me. Come on! He's
gonna be here in 10 days.

00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,331
You are like a broken record.
I said no.

Are you afraid of him?

into a chart for me... Margaret!

693
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,180
Margaret, I heard about Palladino.
Everyone's talking about it.

694
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,936
I wanted to say thank you. People
like them give us a bad name.

695
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,517
I doubt it.

696
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,398
Come on, Margaret,
give us a break.

697
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,150
It's serious work
we're doing up there.

698
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,981
We started with scores of 2.1.

699
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,032
You know, nothing to write
home about, I know,

700
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:37,284
but in the last couple of
weeks we scored 3.4, 4, 4.6...

701
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,866
And the chances the difference are down
to coincidence is <i>2</i> in 100, Margaret.

702
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,747
- Paul.
- Two in a hundred!

All right...

All right.

Tom, go ahead and start
class without me.

Take this, this and that.

708
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:54,095
And, um, show them the photograph.
They'll enjoy that.

709
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,888
I won't be long.

710
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,387
So what is it this time?
Psychic photography?

711
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,889
- Retrocognition, remote vision?
- Telepathy.

712
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,846
- Drawings, sealed envelopes, cards?
- Zener cards.

713
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,272
Double blind, triple
blind, simple blind?

714
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,190
Simple blind. I did it myself.

715
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,234
I take it from your enthusiasm
you just did a test.

716
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,652
That's right.

717
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:10,695
Were you facing your subject?

718
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,522
Sure.

719
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,573
What about them?

720
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,276
Uh, they were in the control
booth, monitoring the subject.

721
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,077
Who was monitoring you?

722
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,576
Me? Why would anyone want
to be monitoring me?

723
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,407
It's a joke.

724
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,834
So were you at the same
eye level as the subject?

725
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,252
Approximately, yes.

726
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,374
- Under a light, I guess.
- Yes.

727

The way we are now?

00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,507
More or less, I guess.

Next time, try taking
them off first.

752
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,693
So why'd you hold the
card up to the light?

753
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,322
So you wouldn't think
about your glasses.

754
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,996
[Tom] So, these images were
made during the Cold War...

755
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:53,211
under conditions controlled
by the Soviet authorities,

756
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,792
so there was no
independent investigations.

757
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,101
Leningrad, 1970.

758
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,609
Here Katia Novikova carries out

759
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,441
one of her more
controversial experiments.

760
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,322
As you can see,

761
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,371
she concentrates intensely
on the heart of the frog,

762
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,289
at the beginning
making it beat faster,

763
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,413
then slower,

764
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:34,293
and then, stopping
it beating altogether.

765
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,798
Katia asserted that she had, she had
inherited her powers from her mother...

766
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,721
and that during her childhood,
she would see objects...

767
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,477
[Cohen] Only God is right
all the time, Dr. Matheson.

768
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,435
And yes, there are sensitives
who are impostors,

769
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,360
just like there are skeptics.

770
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,438
Uh, you know, even scientists
are wrong every day.

771
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,114
But you, the
professional skeptics,

772
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,736
you also seem to be
experts in rhetoric.

773
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,159
Don't... don't bite off
my finger, doctor.

774
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,077
Look where I'm pointing.

775
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,827
Scientists' mistakes are
usually random, Mr. Cohen.

776
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,829
Pseudo-scientists' mistakes
tend to be directional.

777
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,535
Dr. Matheson seems
to forget that she

778
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,541
set up her stall
on this over 30 years ago.

779
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,339
Most professionals are fully
aware of the dangers of fraud

780
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,009
and design their experiments with
every imaginable precaution.

781
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,178
We're believers, doctor,
not simply credulous.

782
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,176
Very smart people are
often the most credulous

783
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,349
and are taken in by all
kinds of phenomena.

784
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,098
They're easy victims of fraud
because they think logically,

785
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,475
and professional magicians
count on that.

786
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,307
Like your client, for instance.
He's certainly one of them.

787
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,108
You should've told me
she would be here.

788
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,731
Oh, you said you wouldn't
speak to my client.

789
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,938
Are you scared of me too?
[chuckles]

790
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,365
The question is why does every
parapsychological phenomenon vanish

791
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,738
when there's a qualified
skeptic in the room?

792
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,411
Three to four Americans say they've had
some kind of metaphysic experience

793
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,285
and an even
higher percentage say...

794
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,241
He's gotta be in on it.
He's in on it.

795
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,292
Doctor, this is a question for you.
Don't you think...?

796
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,372
Margaret, just
get out of there.

797
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,831
[Margaret]
And even my colleagues,

798
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,837
the experimental psychologists“.

799
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,634
They're just gonna box her in.
They're just boxing her in.

800
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,507
...about their approach
to strange occurrences.

801
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,803
This is just what I'm
saying, it's just rhetoric.

802
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,677
It's just pure rhetoric,

803
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,009
it's just talking the talk,
but to refute the role

804
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,639
that all crows are black you need
just one single white one. Actually...

805
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,810
I've never seen a
white crow, have you?

806
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,809
Look a bit harder.

807
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,014
Miss Hansen, I believe that
you're Simon Silver's agent,

808
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,066
are you not?

809
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,438
I guess that means you've
gotten to know him pretty well

810
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,566
over the years, is that true?

811
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,522
I'm privileged.
He's a constant inspiration.

812
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,699
Silver's comeback has turned
into an event.

813
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,903
His recent sell-out performances
in both Atlanta and Dallas

814
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,910
can only be described
as an unbelievable success.

815
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,617
Today he will be
performing in our city,

816
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,079
at the Columbus Theater, less than
500 yards away from this studio.

817
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,415
Now, Miss Hansen, is "perform"...?
That's a funny word.

818
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,717
Do you think that's the right word
to describe what's going on here?

819
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,011
I would say "share."

820
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,838
Simon has never been ashamed of
sharing his extraordinary abilities.

821
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,923
I think that "perform"
is exactly the right word.

822
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,350
I beg to disagree.

823
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,098
Why allow for a rigorous study

824
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,099
when the mass spectacle
is there to be embraced

825
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,555
and there's money to be made?

826
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,106
A lot of money,
I would imagine.

827
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,024
The word "choice."

828
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,148
- Excuse me, Simon Silver.
- Taking advantage of people.

829
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,820
Was subjected to rigorous studies
by at least two different...

830
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,397
Oh, come on!

831
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,902
Universities of
unquestionable renown.

832
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,609
But I guess
you know this, doctor,

833
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,490
since you were on one
of those committees.

834
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,866
<i>I never signed off
on the findings however.</i>

835
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,868
- Are you okay?
- Sh... sh... sh.

836
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,574
<i>[Margaret] The
experiments weren't done</i>

837
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,159
<i>under proper
controlled conditions</i>

838
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,119
[Cohen] Yeah,
controlled conditions.

839
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,749
Those of us born different
feel real safe.

840
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,672
Complete inspection
of all body orifices,

841
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,716
Faraday cages where we are
locked away like animals,

842
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,634
And... and you're
surprised that Silver

843
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,007
refused to subject
himself to that.

844
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,713
No, I'm not at all surprised

845
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,764
that he refused to
follow the one protocol

846
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,468
that would effectively eliminate
any possibility of fraud.

847
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,600
All this sounds very convincing,
doctor, but in actual fact,

848
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,397
telepathic experiments...

849
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,601
No, no, no, no, do not
go on the defensive.

850
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,560
Margaret, do not go
on the defensive!

851
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,190
She's going on the defensive.

852
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,238
Can you see this?
This is what she does.

853
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,531
She goes on the defensive and
then the whole thing just...

854
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,530
[Margaret]... in light of

855
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,906
my considerable experience
investigating these phenomena,

856
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,363
Aw, don't give 'em an edge.

857
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,198
<i>Of the existence
of paranormal powers...</i>

858
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,909
She's gonna mention the bone.

859
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,665
Just wait, she's gonna
mention the bone.

860
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,917
Do not mention the bone.

861
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,374
I've spoken to some
of those supposed victims

862
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,255
whose eyes you
claim to have opened,

863
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,836
and, believe me, they don't
have very nice things

864
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,921
to say about you.

865
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,722
Telling people they've been
victimized by these crazy ideas

866
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,516
and then trying to get
the ideas away from them

867
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,218
it's like trying to take
a bone away from a dog.

868
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,553
[MANY GROANS]

869
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,354
They don't want to let go.

870
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,931
<i>[man] Maybe I don't
know my place but...</i>

871
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,391
How did you know that?

872
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,691
Because I'm psychic.

873
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,565
[Cohen] Yes, she did,

874
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,567
that's exactly what we are to you.
We were animals.

875
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:27,989
What I'm saying is give me
proof that a photon of light

876
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,782
can pass through a human body

877
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,359
and I will start to
believe in invisibility.

878
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,365
Until that happens,

879
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,617
all we're talking about here
is simple subjective beliefs.

880
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,119
[Hansen] What do you
believe in, Dr. Matheson?

881
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,123
Do you have a transcendent
view of life?

882
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,499
[Margaret] A what?

883
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,956
Well, you talk about beliefs.

884
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,041
What do you believe in?

885
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,923
Well, I don't really see what
that has to do with anything.

886
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,719
Well, it's a very
simple question

887
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,547
that maybe you can answer.

888
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,598
I'm just asking you,
do you believe or don't you?

889
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,848
[Margaret] Well, I try to
understand, not believe.

890
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,726
So you accept that it's possible
there's something out there?

891
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,103
No, I didn't say that.

892
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,981
You're <i>a</i> religious person?

893
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,566
No. You know, once, long
ago, I suppose I was.

894
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,446
Long ago?

895
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:16,871
And you lost your faith.
What... what happened, what...

896
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,667
What happened to
turn you into this...

897
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:24,496
lost, lonely woman?

898
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,581
- It's just a simple question.
- We're done.

899
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,132
<i>[Cohen] Oh, so just
get up and walk away?</i>

900
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,131
<i>I didn't mean anything by it.</i>

901
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,962
<i>Sometimes things get
said, Dr. Matheson,</i>

902
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,888
<i>and it's not always
pure hyperbole...</i>

903
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,716
<i>It's always
the same with girls.</i>

904
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,018
<i>[host] I'm terribly
sorry about this.</i>

905
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,016
<i>We expected her to
follow through...</i>

906
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,189
<i>[Cohen] Animals!</i>

907
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,016
<i>[host] ...and I hope
she'll come back.</i>

908
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,772
<i>Meantime, thank
you to the panelists.</i>

909
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,528
[Tom] This is one
of the kinder ones.

910
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,535
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Tom.

911
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,708
Do you have any idea the
advantage he has over us now?

912
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,784
In one minute we've
gone back decades!

913
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,962
We gotta investigate Silver!
We gotta do it now!

914
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,789
Tom, I can see you're angry...

915
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,624
You've been keeping me
away from him for weeks.

916
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,300
I'm not stupid, Margaret,
so stop pretending I am.

917
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,298
I know you're not.
He is not worth your...

918
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,629
Enough!

919
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,259
We gotta investigate him,

920
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,966
and if you won't,
I'll do it on my own.

921
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,801
Look, I know they did
a job on you, okay?

922
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,682
I know it wasn't fair and
that stooge of Silver's

923
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,354
played dirty. But she did it.

924
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,181
They took you by
surprise, I understand.

925
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,937
I don't know what I would
have done in your place

926
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,235
but here's where we are:
We look like idiots.

927
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,857
It's been over two years

928
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,735
since we received
a lousy private dollar

929
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,781
and the department funding
is so ridiculously low,

930
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,076
the only way they can make it
clearer they want rid of us

931
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,744
is with a marching band.

932
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,741
It has nothing to do
with the university,

933
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,163
it's Silver.

934
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,491
But Silver wasn't even there!

935
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,450
Silver is always there.

936
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,910
Don't you get it?

937
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,210
No, we gotta
investigate Silver!

938
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,333
And we gotta do it now!

939
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,211
Tom, sit down.

940
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,837
Just sit down.

941
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:53,884
[deep sigh]

942
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,212
Please?

943
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,513
<i>[sighs]</i>

944
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,344
This is how he does it.

945
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,225
He did it to me, and now
he's doing it to you.

946
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,477
- What does that even mean?
- It's not the first time.

947
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,433
He knows what he's doing.

948
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:13,192
We're weak, Tom. We want to
be strong but we're not.

949
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,773
You're not angry with me.

950
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,201
Every time I close my eyes,
I see my son that day.

951
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,204
I see David playing
over there on the floor.

952
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:30,130
He was so small. He was sturdy.

953
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,127
And then he fell.

954
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,425
He just fell over.

955
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,377
I thought he was
playing, but he wasn't.

956
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,007
He was four years old.

957
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,340
- Margaret, I'm really...
- Shh.

958
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,050
Everything's all right.

959
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,510
I write to him, you know?

960
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,811
Because I know
he can't hear me.

961
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,433
"Dear David..."

962
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,111
Silver and I

963
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,565
were on a television show just
like the one yesterday...

964
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,241
and he was shouting.

965
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,990
I was shouting.

966
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,867
We were young.

967
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,324
And then he started staring.

968
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,000
Not at me.

969
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,874
He was staring at
something beside me,

970
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,001
as if he could see
someone beside me,

971
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,627
you know, the
way the mediums do

972
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,426
when they say they
can see an angel or...

973
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,254
or a dead relative next to you.

974
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,308
No. I wasn't surprised.

975
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,430
I was expecting theatrics,

976
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,932
so I was prepared.

977
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,266
"I see a boy by your side.

978
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,101
"I see a blond boy.

979
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,528
"Do you know who that
might be, Margaret?"

980
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,526
"Has a boy close to you died?"

981
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,490
I didn't answer.

982
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,537
I couldn't speak.

983
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,082
I was so frightened.

984
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,285
And he kept going.

985
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:55,841
"This boy is asking
you to let him go.

986
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:59,920
"He says you
have to let him go."

987
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:04,553
"It's his time and you
won't let him go."

988
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,476
Now, did I denounce him

989
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,804
<i>as</i> an unscrupulous fraud?

990
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,812
Did I tell him that my
son was still alive?

991
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,987
Did I say anything in front
of those millions of people

992
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,736
who were waiting for my answer?

993
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:24,035
No. I didn't say a thing.

994
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,865
And you know the one
thing I can't forgive?

995
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,291
And I hate myself
for feeling this.

996
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,915
I hate myself from the moment
I wake up in the morning

997
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,166
to when I close
my eyes at night.

998
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:39,501
What I can't forgive is not
that he dared to use my son,

999
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,927
my sleeping, sick son.

1000
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,302
What I can't forgive
is that for one second,

1001
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,681
and it only lasted a second,

1002
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,763
I thought it might be true.

1003
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:56,602
He made me doubt!

1004
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,106
And everyone could see it.

1005
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,489
He's dangerous, Tom.

01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:58,278
[Tom] You need to leave here.

1290
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,658
What's going on?

1291
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,114
Jesus, Tom, you're bleeding.

1292
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,699
You need to get
that cleaned up.

1293
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:10,169
What's going on?

1294
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:34,655
<i>University sources

1295

1300
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,083
<i>Yes, that's
the way it is, Dana.</i>

1301
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,127
<i>For two weeks, Simon Silver,</i>

<i>who had been ca/led into

1304
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,292

<i>designed by a committee
of experts from the SPRC.</i>

1306
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,764
<i>University sources confirm that
Dr. Matheson had been suffering</i>

1307
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,433
<i>from a rare and long-standing
vascular condition</i>

1308
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,431
<i>which could be the cause</i>

1309
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,308
<i>of her unexpected illness
and sudden death.</i>

1310
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:07,934
Why didn't you tell me?

1311
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,062
I don't understand
what you're talking...

1312
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:12,439
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why don't you step into my office?

1313
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,270
I want to be on that
committee, Shackleton.

1314
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,821
Whatever it takes,

1315
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,695
I don't care what,
I wanna be there.

1316
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,447
It's impossible. The team
has already been presented.

1317
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,402
There's nothing I can do.

1318
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:24,160
Don't give me your excuses,
Shackleton. Just do it.

1319
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,625
The committee was
approved by Silver!

1320
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,203
You know what that means?

1321
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,004
It's a once
in a lifetime opportunity!

1322
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,706
Whatever it takes, Shackleton!

1323
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,384
No more whining.
No more moaning.

1324
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:40,305
Ask for more observers. Make
up whatever story you want.

1325
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,848
Get that over-subsidized
brain of yours working.

1326
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:46,895
I wanna be there.

1327
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,222
I'll be waiting for your call.

1328
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,229
Don't leave me here.

1329
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,404
Let me at least
try and help you.

1330
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,902
I'm going to be fine.

1331
01:11:58,981 --> 01:11:59,982
It's just
for a little while, okay?

1332
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,909
Look at you, Tom.

1333
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,328
Margaret was right. Can't you see it?
Just let it go.

1334
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,996
- I need to know how he does it.
- What difference does it make how he does it?

1335
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,824
Forget about Silver, Tom.

1336
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,159
There are certain things
it's better not to know.

1337
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,494
Sally, I just need to know.

1338
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:18,005
<i>[male voice]
Meters have been installed</i>

1339
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,212

1349

<i>a number of his

1350
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,990
[boy] This just isn't fair.

1351
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,242
We've been waiting
in line for two days.

1352
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,698
Eating and sleeping here.

1353
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,328
Who's standing up
for our rights?

1354
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:52,581
[woman] It wasn't
just a show, for me.

1355
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:56,415
For me it was more
important. And now...

1356
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,090
[man] I don't care.
Hell, I really don't.

1357
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,133
If he thinks it's cool,
I think it's cool.

1358
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,758
I just hope he shows those
smart-ass college know-it-alls.

1359
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,839
Shit, what the hell are all
these people doing here anyway?

1360
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,391
Like, they put on the TV for 15
minutes and obey like sheep.

1361
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:09,594
What's this guy done
that's so incredible?

1362
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,554
Like, has nobody
heard of Criss Angel?

1363
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,935
[Silver] It's a matter
of absolute priority

1364
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,268
that science begins to learn
all it can about these forces.

1365
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,727
We can't wait any longer.

1366
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,437
The aim of my public
appearances

1367
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,942
is just to generate
the necessary conditions

1368
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,774
so that our blind
society will open

1369
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,360
its eyes to the existence
of other forms of energy.

1370
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,616
These forces can't
be ignored any longer.

1371
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:30,494
They have to be verified and accepted
once and for all. Thank you.

1372
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:32,951
[reporter] Is it true that you
canceled some of your shows?

1373
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:35,412
[Hansen] Nothing's been canceled.
We're just re-scheduling.

1374
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,792
Mr. Silver. One more question.

1375
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,374
<i>[Presenter] More than 100 journalists
have requested accreditation</i>

1376
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:41,459
<i>to cover the SPRC experiments</i>

1377
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,670
<i>more like the numbers we
expect at a political summit</i>

1378
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,471
<i>than scientific research.</i>

1379
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,640
<i>However, only a handful
of media outlets</i>

1380
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:50,184
<i>have been granted passes
to the inside of the building</i>

1381
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,852
<i>and none are allowed
to remain there</i>

1382
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,976
<i>while the tests
are taking place.</i>

1383
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:57,355
We're trying to guarantee control conditions.
We're scientists,

1384
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,653
and for the first time we could
just obtain conclusive results

1385
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,356
about the reality
of extrasensory perception,

1386
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,862
the power of the
mind over matter.

1387
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:10,038
Our priority has to be to ensure
the veracity of those results.

1388
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,285
Today's a great day,
ladies and gentlemen.

1389
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:15,539
We could just be about
to go beyond...

1390
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:18,167
beyond a point of no return.

1391
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,919
[reporter] And... cut!

1392
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,375
Great, we got it.

1393
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,926
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

1394
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,049
Thank you for coming.

1395
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,881
From now on, no cameras
except the university's

1396
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:33,562
will be allowed in the lab. Thank
you again for your cooperation.

1397
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,403
[Shackleton] Remember, Buckley,

1398
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,855
you don't form
a part of this committee.

1399
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,815
You're just an observer.

1400
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:48,196
You'll make no contribution
to the design of the tests

1401
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,403
or the control protocols.

1402
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,456
You can look, you can listen and
you can shut your goddamn mouth.

1403
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,704
Don't think I'm scared of you.

1404
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,753
If I'm putting up with you, it's
out of respect for Margaret.

1405
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,501
You try to honor her
in the same way.

1406
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,626
[door opens]

1407
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:04,710
[light applause]

1408
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,760
Mr. Silver!

1409
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,759
Mr. Silver, allow me to say

1410
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,511
thank you for
agreeing to do this.

1411
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:12,341
And let me apologize in advance

1412
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:15,019
for any inconvenience
we might cause.

1413
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:17,017
Science will be
very grateful to you.

1414
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:18,643
Well, that is
my sole objective.

1415
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,067
It's me who should
be grateful to you.

1416
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,816
Oh, you already
know Dr. Haynes.

1417
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,397
Doctor.

1418
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,777
Dr. Campbell.

1419
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,825
- Doctor.
- Hello, sir.

1420
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,278
Dr. Conrad Jennings, professor
of Biomedical Engineering,

1421
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,034
University of Leeds,

1422
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:36,662
- has been kind enough to join us.
- Doctor.

1423
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:38,960
And Professor Franklin,
Professor of Physics,

1424
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,378
Case Western University
of Ohio.

1425
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:41,670
Doctor.

1426
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,419
Now, if you don't mind...

1427
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:48,503
There's another guest
here, isn't that right?

1428
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,588
Yes, that... that is right.

1429
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,298
Excuse me, I... I didn't
introduce you formally.

1430
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,724
Have you met before?

1431
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,722
[Tom] I don't know. Have we?

1432
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,428
Dr. Buckley, of the University's
Psychology Department.

1433
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,479
He worked very
closely with Doctor...

1434
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,650
I have a great interest in the
figure of Doctor Buckley.

1435
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:08,027
I follow his
progress very closely.

1436
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,199
It's been a difficult
time for all of us, Tom.

1437
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,901
How are you getting along?

1438
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:15,534
I was so sorry to hear
about Dr. Matheson.

1439
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,615
Of course, uh...

1440
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:22,329
we can begin whenever
you feel ready.

1441
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,038
If you'd like to come this way.

1442
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,635
We know this isn't
an exact science.

1443
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,799
[Shackleton] Take your
time, whatever you need.

1444
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,805
We'll start with something
straightforward,

1445
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,682
you know, like an icebreaker.

1446
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,514
[Silver] Oh, oh, sure.
Psy... Psychic photography?

1447
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,224
Thoughtography.
How... How did you know?

1448
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,150
Oh, it's been a long
time since I did this,

1449
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,819
a very long time indeed.

1450
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:48,396
Digital, isn't it?

1451
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,573
Yeah, it is.
Exactly. Do you need...?

1452
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,275
I just need <i>a</i> simple
piece of cardboard.

1453
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,985
I don't want my fingers
smudging the lens.

1454
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,662
We opted to prepare
a plastic cylinder.

1455
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:01,413
I hope you don't mind. It's
a half inch in diameter.

1456
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:03,039
Is it okay, will it do?

1457
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,042
One never knows,
Dr. Shackleton.

1458
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:09,046
As you just said yourself,
this isn't an exact science.

1459
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,628
Do you mind?

1460
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,132
Go ahead.

1461
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,192
Please, be careful
with my watch.

1462
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,320
The <i>glass</i> top flips up.

1463
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,697
I don't want the hands
moved by mistake.

1464
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,133
From now on you'll
not be allowed

1465
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,059
to withdraw your hands
from the table,

1466
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:03,763
unless it is for the purpose
of another inspection.

1467
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:04,768
You understand that, don't you?

1468
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:05,769
Yes.

1469
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,270
If you do so,

1470
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,022
the test will
be declared invalid.

1471
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,819
Okay, thank you.

1472
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,381
Ready when you are.

1473
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,586

<i>[Shackleton] This film

1475
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,144
<i>of investigation carried out</i>

1476
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:49,317
<i>in the Scientific Paranormal
Research Center</i>

1477

<i>No scene has been recreated.</i>

<i>This is Simon Silver.</i>

1481
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,993
<i>For the following experiment,</i>

1482
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,420
<i>Silver received three different
models of still camera:</i>

1483
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,168
<i>A middle range digital camera</i>

1484
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,840
<i>with a fixed /ens
focused on infinity,</i>

1485
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:15,043
<i>a conventional
analogical camera</i>

1486
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,344
<i>with a 50 mm /ens
focused on infinity</i>

1487
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:21,094
<i>and an instant Polaroid camera,
also focused on infinity.</i>

1488
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,971
<i>Silver's attempts
with the digital camera</i>

1489
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,178
<i>did not produce
any positive result.</i>

1490
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,980
<i>The second camera registered
only partial results,</i>

1491
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:30,353
<i>insufficient for
a positive evaluation.</i>

1492
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,686
<i>Only the Polaroid camera allowed
the apparent projection</i>

1493
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,897
<i>of Silver's thoughts
onto the photographic plate.</i>

1494
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,984
<i>There is no scientific
explanation for these results.</i>

1495
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:42,286
<i>The cylinder or gizmo which
Silver was provided with</i>

1496
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:44,784
<i>in order to concentrate
the flow of his thoughts</i>

1497
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:48,163
<i>was carefully checked before
and after each experiment</i>

1498
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:51,416
<i>in order to rule out
any possible manipulation.</i>

1499
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:58,424
<i>Silver claims to be capable of
bending metal at a distance</i>

1500
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,379
<i>without needing to touch it.</i>

1501
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,260
<i>However, during the
course of these tests,</i>

1502
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,808
<i>this could not be
experimentally confirmed.</i>

1503
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,227
<i>Following a more
re/axed protocol,</i>

1504
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,271
<i>Silver was allowed
to touch the metal</i>

1505
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:11,519
<i>which, as can be seen
in the film, was indeed bent.</i>

1506
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,727
<i>Visual analysis of the film
is insufficient to determine</i>

1507
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,404
<i>whether Silver possesses
extremely strong fingers</i>

1508
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,403
<i>and great control of
micro-manipulation movements</i>

1509
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,031
<i>or whether the distortion
is in fact caused</i>

1510
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,579
<i>by a paranormal ability,
as he claims.</i>

1511
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,032
<i>Later, Simon Silver
held his hand out</i>

1512
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,493
<i>in the continuous flow
of a running tap.</i>

1513
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:33,876
<i>As the images show, the flow
of water was notably deviated</i>

1514
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:37,709
<i>by some kind of external
stimulus around Silver's hand.</i>

1515
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,668
<i>The difficulty in measuring
this distortion</i>

1516
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,004
<i>in a conclusive manner,</i>

1517
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,054
<i>means this demonstration</i>

1518
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,883

got it, Doctor.

01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,067
I was trying with
the second adapter

1522
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,022
but if I could just join...

1523

[explodes]

1524
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,904
Concentrate, Ben.

1525
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:04,735
I appreciate your help.
No more mistakes, okay?

1526
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,536
I'm sorry, Doctor, I promise...

1527
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:09,365
Don't promise anything.
Just plug it in. Good.

1528
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,041
[Ben] What, black and white?

1529
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,118
[Tom] It's fine. It doesn't matter.
Okay.

1530
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,749
Keep going, keep going, keep going...

1531
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:16,830
Stop! Stop there.

1532
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:20,293
[Tom] Okay, this was the last test.
Telepathy booths.

1533
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,094
During the whole two weeks,

1534
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:23,921
I wasn't able to get
within six feet of Silver,

1535
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,098
but you and I both know
the whole thing is a farce.

1536
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,892
- Actually, Dr. Buckley, I...
- A total fucking farce. Okay, rewind.

1537
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,685
Keep going, keep going.

1538
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:32,434
Okay, go over to the
other side of the gym.

1539
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,390
Stop, Ben! Stop there! Stop!

1540
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,942
You know, right now, Shackleton
is analyzing the data,

1541
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,486
getting ready to publish
his positive findings tonight,

1542
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,360
which just happens to coincide
with Silver's last show,

1543
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,066
which by some
strange coincidence,

1544
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,321
just happens to be taking place

1545
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,028
in this very city.

1546
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:48,738
It's the finale he's
been after all along.

1547
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,289
Well, why all this pressure?

1548
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:51,832
If we find out
something afterwards,

1549
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,625
they'll have to change
the findings.

1550
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,122
Ben, nothing that happens
afterwards will matter.

1551
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,330
Listen to me.
You are the only guy

1552
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:00,132
separating the world from stupidity
at this point in time. Okay?

1553
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:03,302
Okay? Now, you see this button?

1554
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:07,974
I've spent two days loading all
the images from all the cameras

1555
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:09,516
then synching them
frame by frame,

1556
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,059
with all the
angles in here, okay?

1557
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:12,512
[explodes]

1558
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:13,937
[TV turns on]

1559
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,855
[Tom] Okay? Okay, Ben?

1560
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,525
This is the reception booth.
Silver is the receiver.

1561
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,820
That's the instrument panel.
It's got ten luminous buttons.

1562
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,272
Normally they put
a playing card in each one,

1563
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,028
but given that Silver is blind

1564
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:26,484
they've just numbered
them one through ten.

1565
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:27,819
Okay, and what's
supposed to...?

1566
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:28,948
Quiet. Now, second booth.

1567
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,620
[smash]

1568
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,198
It doesn't matter.
It's just a dead bird.

1569
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,033
[Tom] This is the
transmission booth.

1570
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,709
Now, you see the monitor?
It's a closed circuit.

1571
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,377
[Ben] Is he seeing
his own panel?

1572
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,955
No. No, no, no.
He's seeing Silver's panel.

1573
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,710
It's supposed
to help him concentrate.

1574
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,008
So the computer randomly
turns on alight.

1575
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,551
Then the guy concentrates

1576
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,094
on the number he's
been given. Okay?

1577
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,422
When he thinks
he knows the number,

1578
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,097
he presses the red button,

1579
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,221
which sets off a signal
in Silver's booth.

1580
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,223
When Silver hears the signal,

1581
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,054
he clears his mind, he
concentrates, whatever the fuck,

1582
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:56,605
when he thinks
he knows the answer,

1583
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,932
he presses
the corresponding number

1584
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,517
he think the guy has sent.

1585
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,022
Is that clear?

1586
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,694
Okay. The experiment lasted

1587
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,817
a total of seven
hours, including breaks.

1588
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:08,151
It was repeated a total of
nine times, in blocks of ten.

1589
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,986
The results were spectacular,
with a deviation rate

1590
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,868
eight times higher than
can be explained by chance.

1591
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,073
Now, what does this mean?

1592

That Silver's powers...?

1593
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,415
No! It means that Silver
is pulling a fast one!

1594
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:22,499
Do you know how I know this?
Because telepathy does not exist!

1595
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,879
Because nobody
has special powers!

1596
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,256
No. The protocol,
in theory, is sound.

1597
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,930
It's just that Silver has
found a way of breaching it.

1598
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,099
Okay, don't look
for radio transmitters,

1599
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,847
because the booths work as Faraday chambers.
I've checked them.

They're isolated.

1601
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:36,971
What if he's not
pulling a fast one?

1602
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:38,522
Ben, you've got 41/2 hours

1603

from seven cameras.

- What am I looking for?

1605
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:43,944
An explanation, Ben,
just an explanation.

I suppose you've
realized that by now.

Only somebody who really wants
to get to me can do so.

I won't talk to

Maybe I'll do so tomorrow,

Maybe I won't ever again.

I don't always demand payment for
my services, did you know that?

1631
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:45,289
At least, not in money. There's
other ways of paying for things.

1632
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,495
But you know that already.

You do know that, don't you?

1634

To be or to appear to be,

1635
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:05,889
that is the question.
It always is.

1643
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,184
From the time of ancient
Greece to the present day,

1644
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,686
philosophers and scholars
have argued

1645
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,313
man is essentially rational.

01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,486
I don't happen to agree.

1647
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,859
If one observes and
studies another person

1648
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:59,157
without having first
studied oneself,

1649
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,282
how do we know whether our
instruments are appropriately set?

1650
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:06,114
How do we know we are reliable?
We have no proof.

1651
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,747
There's only one way

1652
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:11,374
of gaining access to the truth,

1653
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,046

Silver had come back to stay

more than four million dollars
in less than a month,

1672
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,559
a figure that would confirm...

01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,436

of what will be
his last appearance.

1679
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,363
It is impossible to predict
an outcome for this...

1680
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,447
...and it's with
great expectation

1681
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:33,331
the verdict from the Scientific
Paranormal Research Center,

1682

to be announced
officially tonight.

If the leaks get out...

1684
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,298
...maybe thereby silencing
more than one skeptical voice,

1685
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:40,671

once and for all

the area of mystification

Where is Tom? He's not home

Let me try with another camera.

[Sally] Can you
improve the quality?

Mm-hm. Sure. I can
amplify a single pixel,

- Are you sure they're synchronized?
- Yes.

- Completely.

don't have the same time.

What are the chances
that Silver and the sender

1828
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,542
are both wearing
analogical watches

1829
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,844
and that both are
synchronized second by second

1830
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,717
in millimetric precision?

1831
01:38:04,796 --> 01:38:06,594
Synchronized? Didn't you
hear what I just said?

1832
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:08,265
The watches don't tell
the same time.

1833
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:11,436
Second by second.

1834

They divide.

1837
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,837
They just have to divide the dial
of the watch into ten sections,

1838

one for each number.

the corresponding section...

1840
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,763
...the sender presses
the button.

1841
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,512
Silver just has to know
where the second hand is

1842
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,308
when he hears the signal

1843

to the position.

[Ben] They're in it together.

1845
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:56,647
Dr. Buckley was right.
It's a fraud.

1846
01:38:56,722 --> 01:38:57,939

is defective methodology,

1851
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,446
important data is
inadvertently included...

1852
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:10,324
...or improper controls
are in place.

somewhat out of sorts?

1875

[Tom] I wasn't able.

1876
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:17,808
In the end I just wasn't able.

1877

Don't believe everything

1896

[Tom] You'd be better

[Silver] Buckley, how dare you?

1898

Are you challenging me? Are
you questioning my power?

Stay where you are. Do
you want me to hurt you?

yourself forever.

And you think you have
all the time in the world,

1908
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:01,040
that nothing is final...

1909
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:02,788
But time goes on.

1910
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:04,494
Stay where you are.
Don't take another step.

1911
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:05,874
You're playing with fire,
I'm telling you.

1912
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,580
You're playing with fire!

1913
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:10,257
But in the end, so much
time has gone by...

1914
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:12,802
And you know you should
have done something,

1915
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,720
and then you wake up.

1916
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:17,093
Don't you know the kind of
force you're up against?

1917
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,766
It's already over.

1918
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:20,764
- Stay where you are!
- Margaret never knew.

1919
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:22,220
I don't think you don't know
what you're up against.

1920
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:24,146
I never told her.
She never knew.

1921
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:25,518
Don't come any closer.

1922
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,145
And now everything is a lie!

1923
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:29,352
Don't come any closer!
I'm warning you!

1924
01:42:29,435 --> 01:42:32,814
Did you know all along, Simon Silver?
Did you know?

1925
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:34,649
[SCREAMS] Buckley! Buckley!

1926
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:37,531
That's all I want to know.
Did you know all along?

1927
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,032

How did you do that?

Simon, come with me.

How did you do that?

How did you do that?

<i>without finding it.</i>

1953

<i>But I forgot
the most essential thing.</i>

1955
01:46:13,492 --> 01:46:15,995
How did you know that?

1956
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:18,297
Because I'm psychic.

1957
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:19,373

wasn't it, Margaret?

[Margaret] Where did
you spring from?

Why are you with me?

You can't deny
yourself forever.

01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:50,663
You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.

01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:54,792
I did what you'd have wanted.

1968
01:46:54,867 --> 01:47:02,867
But I'll never forgive myself
for not revealing myself,

1969
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:08,551
for not at least giving
you the consolation

1970

of knowing...

1971
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:16,601

Today you deserve everything.

You can't deny yourself.

You can't deny
