00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,460
<i>In related news,</i>
<i>local woman Becky Roberts... </i>

2
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,632
<i>has been missing now</i>
<i>for more than 24 hours... </i>

3
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,816
Is anyone there?

4
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,870
Hi.

5
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,168
Hi.

6
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,775
Where is everyone?
In the assembly.

7
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,879
So why aren't you?
Why aren't you?

8
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,418
I'm a transfer,
I just got here.
I know.

9
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,351
Is it that obvious?
It's a small school.

10
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,418
Word travels fast.

11
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,623
So what's the assembly for?
Major drama.

12
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,691
Some townie
was screwing the wrong guy
and she's gone missing.

13
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,295
So the police are here
to teach us
about personal safety.

14
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,536
Like, don't talk
to strangers.

15
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,372
I'm Owen.

16
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,845
Dodger.

17
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,212
That's unique.

18
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,747
Blame my mom,
she's a Dickens scholar.

19
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,880
And your dad?
Let's just say
he's not a scholar.

20
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,191
So where'd you come from?
England.

21
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,794
I meant
what was your last school?
Bradford.

22
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,061
Before that, Collegiate.
Webster before that.

23
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,761
So what'd you do?

24
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,736
I was dating this girl
who happened to be
the dean's daughter.

25
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,975
Miss Allen.
Miss McNally.

26
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,410
Since you seem
to have skipped the assembly,
perhaps detention...

27
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,246
I'm sorry,
Miss McNally, is it?
Uh-huh.

28
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,546
I'm Owen Matthews
and this is my fault.

29
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,952
It's my first day
and I asked Miss Allen here...

30
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,650
if she could show me
the way to my dorm.

31
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,124
Not that I would ever set foot
in the boys' dorm.

32
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,787
No, just to the dorm's
front entrance.

33
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,390
Fine, but as soon
as you finish
showing Mr. Matthews around...

34
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,162
make sure you contact
your RA and he'll help you...

35
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,828
I'll do just that.

36
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,099
Thank you for your help.

37
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,534
I guess
you're stuck with me.

38
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,205
<i>Mr. Matthews,</i>
<i>your son is on line 1.</i>

39
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,205
Send him to voicemail,
Cynthia.

40
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,268
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Charles Matthews... </i>

41
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,506
<i>I'm away from my desk</i>
<i>right now. </i>

42
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,811
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>and I will return</i>
<i>as soon as possible. </i>

43
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,543
Hey, Dad, just wanted
to let you know
that I'm all settled in.

44
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,646
The bus worked out fine...

45
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,350
though it would have been nice
to have seen you
before I left.

46
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,155
I got a great
work-study shift...

47
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,696
<i>as a teaching assistant</i>
<i>in the Physics Department. </i>

48
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,558
<i>And I signed up for classes. </i>

49
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,328
<i>Mostly hard sciences,</i>
<i>per your request. </i>

50
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,833
<i>And I just met my roommate,</i>
<i>Tom. </i>

51
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,667
I just beat off.

52
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,871
<i>Great guy. </i>

53
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,439
Well, I guess that's it, so...

54
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,808
you know, give me a call
if you have some time.

55
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,475
I hope
you washed that hand.

56
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,619
We're sneaking out.
Good for you.

57
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,384
Do you want to come?
Why would I want to do that?

58
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,258
Dodger asked me to bring you.

59
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,065
Where are we going?

60
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,039
The old chapel,
Westlake tradition.

61
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,707
To do what? Bible study?
To play a game.

62
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,386
What up!

63
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,258
Party's here.
Over here in the locker room.

64
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,762
No, I'm glad they're here.

65
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,264
What's going on, man?

66
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,732
I thought you were missing,
like that townie.

67
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,795
Tom, who's your
new boyfriend?

68
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,772
You'll have to excuse
Randall here.

69
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,469
He doesn't know the difference
between a roommate
and a cellmate.

70
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,674
Everybody, this is Owen.
Owen, this is everybody.

71
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,048
Jungle Fever,
you guys want to join us?

72
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,483
What's wrong, Graham?

73
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,248
Bad mood 'cause
you blew the physics test?

74
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,584
I don't know, Lewis.

75
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,419
Bad mood because
Mercedes blew
the lacrosse team?

76
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,686
Blow this.

77
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,159
I hate to be the bitch here,
but are we going
to play or what?

78
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,527
Come on, Regina,
you love to be the bitch.

79
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,192
All right,
everyone put your money in.

80
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,361
Is someone gonna tell me
how to play?

81
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,467
It's a lying game.

82
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,133
The object:
Avoid suspicion.

83
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,942
Manipulate your friends.
Eliminate your enemies.

84
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,281
Have a seat.

85
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,980
I'm going to secretly pick
one person in the group
to be a liar.

86
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,318
The wolf.

87
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,385
And everyone else
is a sheep.

88
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,597
If you can find the wolf...

89
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,699
and convince
the rest of the group
to vote him out...

90
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,864
then the money is yours.

91
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,905
The wolf survives,
the cash is theirs.

92
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,271
So how do we find the wolf?
Figure out who's lying.

93
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,072
Who's Dodger looking at?
I'm thinking Texas T!

94
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,237
What?

95
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,541
Dude, you will never borrow
my car again.

96
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,015
Then as much as I'm sure
I'm going to miss
the PT ragtop...

97
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,847
I thought that I heard
Tom move when Dodger...

98
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,353
was walking around
to mark the wolf.

99
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,389
All right, Randall,
that an official accusation?

100
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,718
And if it is?

101
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,191
Then you can only send home
the accused or the accuser...

102
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,727
but you can't win
if you don't play.

103
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,160
So let's vote.
That's right.

104
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,788
And the defense?
No, I'm not the wolf.

105
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,355
No, I swear to God
I'm not the wolf.

106
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,231
I swear on the Gold Star State
I'm not the wolf.

107
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,736
Come on,
are you gonna listen to me...

108
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,635
or are you gonna listen
to this chump here...

109
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,072
whose buddy list reads
like a sex-offenders registry?

110
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,166
What?
Come on!

111
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,268
Show of hands,
who thinks Tom's the wolf?

112
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,676
No!

113
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,873
You guys, come on.
No.

114
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,974
And Randall, our accuser?
Yes!

115
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,643
Yes!
All right.

116
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,517
Come on, we need one more
for the majority, guys.

117
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,557
One more for the majority.

118
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,421
O- Dog, help a brother out.

119
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,086
Listen, just 'cause
you're Tom's new bunk-buddy...

120
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,652
doesn't mean
you got to be his bitch.

121
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,823
You don't really think
the angry homophobe thing...

122
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,594
is fooling anyone, do you?

123
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,765
Come on, Randall,
you know the rules.

124
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,104
Show the group
if you've got the mark.

125
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,440
Tell me I'm rich.

126
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,105
No mark.

127
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,411
I guess
Randall's not the wolf.

128
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,575
Watch your back,
pretty boy.

129
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,616
Dude, you know
how gay you sound?

130
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,582
Blow me, Tom.

131
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,922
Have a nice walk.
Bye.

132
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,693
Nighty-night, sheep boy.

133
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,127
You guys all suck!

134
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,664
Poor baby.

135
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,190
The wolf has survived.
Who wants to start round two?

136
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,229
Dodger felt up
the new guy.

137
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,367
She did ask me
to bring him here.

138
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,308
What a whore. Let's vote.

139
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,403
Hey, I believe
I'm allowed a defense.

140
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,877
Whenever someone lies,
they normally have a tell.

141
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,745
Like my new friend,
Graham, over here.

142
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,182
That's the most retarded thing
I've ever heard.

143
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,483
And there it is.

144
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,753
Haven't you guys realized
he can't open his mouth...

145
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,124
without taking a swig?

146
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,595
So?
It's empty.

147
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,235
Graham, you can't convince us
if you can't
convince yourself.

148
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,999
You would've noticed it
if you didn't know
each other so well.

149
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,870
Are we voting or what?

150
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,603
One vote for Owen.
And the accuser?

151
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,215
The new guy gets to stay
and I have to go?

152
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,354
I cannot wait
to go to college.

153
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,089
Bare it and share it,
Graham.

154
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,394
Have fun
with your new recruit.

155
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,328
He's just pissed
'cause he's fat.
I can still hear you!

156
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,940
So was he the wolf?
Money's still on the floor.

157
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,375
Who wants to start
round three?

158
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,959
All right, this is it.
It's one vote for Owen.

159
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,155
Who's it going to be, Lewis?

160
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,991
Say good night, Mercedes.

161
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,169
Congratulations, baby.

162
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,707
Tonight, you could've
gotten laid. But instead...

163
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,538
you got fucked.

164
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,356
Not bad
for your first day.

165
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,154
Yeah, I guess it's one way
to pay for college.

166
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,129
You think
you're that good?

167
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,665
No, it's just bored rich kids
make it so easy.

168
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,098
They're like
bickering siblings.

169
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,534
They turn on each other
for no good reason.

170
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,129
Graham's tell, come on.

171
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,932
You're awfully quick
to judge.
No, it's just that...

172
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,877
Those bored rich kids
are my friends.

173
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,016
...over 38...

174
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,078
Is this journalism class?

175
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,023
Are you Owen Matthews?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was...

176
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,789
Sleeping in.
No, my alarm clock...

177
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,262
Relax, Owen.

178
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,931
If being late
is the worst thing...

179
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,365
that happens to you
in the first week,
you got off lucky.

180
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,131
Take a seat.
As I was saying...

181
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,466
does a reporter
just go for the story?

182
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,809
Or can we, as the media,
cover a tragedy like this...

183
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,779
with both sensitivity
and respect?

184
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,748
Morning, Randall.
Laura?

185
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,477
What does that mean?

186
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,247
That means, if I may...

187
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:19,184
that if you upon some
nasty pictures of the victim
on the Internet...

188
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,021
don't forward them
to the whole school.

189
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:25,427
A resounding no to sensitivity
and respect from Mr. Hodge.

190
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,657
Feet down.

191
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,594
You just now discovering
the Internet, Owen? Match. com?

192
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,044
Mr. Matthews...

193
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,082
you're making it very hard
for me to pretend
that I can't tell...

194
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,276
you're not paying attention.

195
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:03,023
I'm going to need
these articles by this Friday,
at the latest.

196
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,093
Now if any of you
are having a hard time...

197
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,161
thinking of something
to write about other than...

198
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,366
the most recent development
in this local tragedy...

199
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,239
I'd be willing
to meet with you privately.

200
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,443
And they only just found
that girl this morning...

201
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,113
because her body was dragged
through the woods by a wolf.

202
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,019
Yeah. Listen, the guy
blew her head off...

203
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,717
then let the wildlife
just go to town.

204
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,225
Why does it have to be
a guy?

205
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,818
Please.
Serial killers
are always men.

206
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,328
Just the ones
that get caught, baby.

207
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,126
Serial means
more than one, jackass.

208
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,326
You're not taking
your SAT book to my lake house
this weekend, are you?

209
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,030
Right, Owen, my dad...
The senator.

210
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,902
The senile drunk,
is sending a limo
to take us all...

211
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,373
to the lake house
on Friday.

212
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,376
Nobody ever stays here
on the weekends.

213
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,706
You in?
Yeah, sure.

214
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,804
I'm not going to be able
to make it, I got plans.

215
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,940
What?
By plans you mean
herpes, right?

216
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,541
Actually, by plans,
I mean I'm going...

217
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,349
to State tomorrow
to see the sweet Jenny Ryder.

218
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,117
It's Wednesday.
I know.

219
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,523
And I'm declaring my own
"Randall Gets Laid"
Holiday Weekend.

220
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,618
And I'm going to punch
Miss Ryder's v card...

221
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:05,889
Nice.
Thank you.

222
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,592
Can I borrow your car?

223
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,995
Yeah, man.

224
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,532
Yeah, just, you know,
leave the keys
on the tire and...

225
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,334
don't get any blood
on the back seat.

226
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,706
I wouldn't dream of it.

227
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:22,076
Actually, I would like this
to be special, you know.

228
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,211
Like, in the middle
of the woods,
up against a tree.

229
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,775
You're a pig.
You're a dyke.

230
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,343
Die a violent death.

231
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,480
Yeah well,
if that's your technique...

232
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,152
I weep for Jenny Ryder.
I bet you do.

233
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,019
So are we going
to play the game
before the weekend?

234
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,826
Not sure I want to.

235
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,200
Well, what else
are we going to do
around here, study?

236
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,538
Owen had a decent point
last night.

237
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,365
About us knowing each other
too well.

238
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,736
It's so incestuous.

239
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,778
So you just want to stop?
Because of the new guy.

240
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,871
Thank you.
Not necessarily.

241
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,540
Well then, what?

242
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,516
We'll play
with the whole school.

243
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:08,054
They're the sheep,
and we're the wolves.

244
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,089
I don't think they'll all fit
in the chapel.

245
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,259
Let me ask you a question.

246
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,166
What's the best way
to play the game?

247
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,728
Lie your ass off.
Defend your honor.

248
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,103
Accuse your neighbor.

249
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,005
Exactly.

250
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,645
Nobody knows
who killed that girl.

251
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,615
So why don't we
make an accusation?
So what are you suggesting?

252
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,220
Let's convince them
the murderer is on campus.

253
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,621
And he's just getting
started.

254
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,159
All right.

255
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,595
But how do we do that?

256
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,840
You guys
have no imagination.

257
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,749
It's like
you're playing checkers.

258
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,918
And I'm playing chess.

259
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,394
I had fun last night,
thanks for the invite.

260
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,400
Who said I invited you?
I thought Tom said.

261
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,871
Relax, I'm kidding.

262
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,936
I wanted to apologize, too.

263
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,806
I didn't mean to piss
on you guys with that bit
about the tells.

264
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,278
Sure, you were just trying
to impress me.

265
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,974
What makes you say that?

266
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,449
Well, I just...
Relax, I'm kidding.

267
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,218
So, I had an idea
on how to convince
the rest of the school...

268
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,052
there's a murderer on campus.

269
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,524
I'm listening.

270
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,318
What if this
isn't a random murder,
but a serial killer.

271
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,760
You already lost me.

272
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,424
Let's just say
someone forwarded us
an e-mail.

273
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,333
About not one,
but a series of murders
that happened before.

274
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,426
Go on.

275
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,996
And the first victim died
in identical fashion
to our townie.

276
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,666
So it's happening again.

277
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,438
Why else would the police
be investigating Westlake?

278
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,272
They're not.
Telling the student body.

279
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,016
It would be our duty
to warn them.

280
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,292
Meet me in the library.

281
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,662
We're going to create
a killer.

282
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,332
He needs a name.

283
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,101
The Wolf?
That works.

284
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,868
Okay. What else does every
good mass murderer have?

285
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,907
Something that he wears.

286
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,170
Something
that covers his face
but anyone can buy.

287
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,111
Pantyhose?
What? Is he robbing a bank?

288
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,912
My old roommate,
he used to go hunting.

289
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,718
He had one of those
neon ski masks.

290
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,881
Orange doesn't exactly
inspire fear.

291
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:55,085
Come on, it's the new black.
Okay.

292
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,919
There are plenty of
deer hunters around here.

293
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,123
Give him a camo jacket, too.

294
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,525
What's his weapon
of choice?

295
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,870
Well, the girl was shot.

296
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,232
Yeah, but a knife
would be scarier.

297
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,277
Don't get me wrong,
I love
the phallic imagery...

298
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,335
but serial killers
rarely change their M.O.

299
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,041
But don't you see?
This is his pattern.

300
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,118
Remember this is not
the first time
our boy has struck.

301
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,382
Of course, he goes
from campus to campus.

302
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,082
Following the exact
same plan.

303
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,088
The first death
is always a townie.
Which is just a warning shot.

304
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,388
Before he attacks
the school.

305
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,021
And the massacre begins.
On the full moon.

306
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,930
That's this weekend, right?
It's Halloween.

307
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,529
It's so obvious.
It's perfect.

308
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,339
So who were
the original victims?

309
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,732
So the first person killed
was obviously the town slut...

310
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,244
shot in the face
while lost in the woods.

311
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,542
Okay. Who's next?

312
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,175
What if the Wolf
waited for his prey
in the back seat of a car?

313
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,946
What if you were
any more cliché?

314
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,919
Like you can do better.

315
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,389
Dark hair, brown eyes.

316
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,815
<i>Killed while</i>
<i>looking in the mirror. </i>

317
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,087
<i>A victim of</i>
<i>her own narcissism. </i>

318
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,723
That means conceited.
Anyone else?

319
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:10,493
Self-mutilating de-virginizer,
eviscerated in the chapel.

320
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,628
No, it should be special
for him.

321
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,538
<i>Lock up the misogynist pig</i>
<i>and let him bleed to death. </i>

322
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,074
<i>Right after castrating him. </i>

323
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,935
<i>Very slowly. </i>

324
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,071
Can the Wolf do
microscopic surgery?

325
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,176
Laugh it up, drama boy.
You're next.

326
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,910
<i>Prima donna wannabe actor</i>
<i>trying to play</i>
<i>the big balcony scene... </i>

327
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,923
<i>gets his intestines</i>
<i>ripped out. </i>

328
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,252
Who else?
Let's not forget
the campus queen.

329
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,364
<i>Her sharp wit was dulled</i>
<i>when she choked... </i>

330
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,991
<i>on her own severed tongue. </i>

331
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,504
You people
are deeply unwell.

332
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,130
Four years in the same place
with the same people.

333
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,937
What do you expect?

334
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,272
Last but not least.

335
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,043
<i>The good guy that fell</i>
<i>for the bad girl. </i>

336
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,311
<i>Died of a broken heart. </i>

337
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,048
I didn't know you were
such a romantic, Randall.

338
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,285
I'm not.
But I do love the irony.

339
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,393
We'll get this out tonight,
leaving plenty of time...

340
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,800
for the rumors to spread.

341
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,428
Lights out.

342
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,803
If I get caught
in the boys' dorm again...

343
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,967
Yeah, that hasn't happened
since we hooked up, huh?

344
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,034
By hooking up,
you mean jerking off...

345
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,909
to my yearbook photo, right?

346
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,005
Dude, don't you want
to use an anonymous account?

347
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:36,111
Why? I'm just
forwarding it along.
With sensitivity and respect.

348
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,757
Owen, Tom,
I said lights out!

349
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,457
Hey, did you guys hear
what I said? Go to bed.

350
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,369
Do you think anyone
will believe it?

351
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,256
I'm telling you,
I read the e-mail.
It's happening.

352
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,417
Just like it did
at that other school.

353
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,654
The first girl,
she was shot
in the face.

354
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,525
I forwarded it...
To my brother.

355
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,497
He sent it to everyone
he knows.

356
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,432
He told me to get off-campus
this weekend
if I didn't wanna get gutted.

357
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,367
He said the second girl...

358
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,645
Owen, just the man
I want to see.

359
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,849
You got a minute?
Sure.

360
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,988
What's in the box?
Antique chess set.

361
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,453
Got to love eBay.
Just now
discovering the Internet?

362
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,271
So I read your e-mail.

363
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,643
Someone forwarded that to you?
Sure did.

364
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,351
Someone also sent it
to the victim's mother.

365
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,352
Who forwarded it
to her attorney.

366
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,615
He called
the Headmaster's office
this morning.

367
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,326
She assumes it originated
off-campus. Don't worry.

368
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,462
I'm not inclined
to inform her otherwise.

369
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,196
Why would I worry?

370
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,570
I glanced at your records
this afternoon.

371
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:41,567
I see your father
pulled some strings
to get you in here.

372
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,670
Dear old dad.

373
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,910
I also saw that your status
here is probationary.

374
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,081
So you end up
in the Headmaster's office...

375
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,485
you might as well
pack your bags.

376
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,217
Bringing the bitch out early.

377
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,425
Just keeping you
on the defensive.

378
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,625
Speak for yourself.

379
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,602
The arrogance of youth.

380
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,071
Don't you mean
the confidence?

381
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,133
Actually,
I meant the ignorance.

382
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,142
You know, it was just for fun.

383
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,181
Yeah, I do.

384
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,285
But you've got to know
it had some real consequences.

385
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,722
No offense, Mr. Walker.

386
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:29,058
This is high school.
Nothing's for real.

387
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,508
To buy as many properties...

388
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,138
Sorry. Just a second.

389
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,442
Sorry. Just my son.
Go ahead.

390
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,579
<i>Hello, this is</i>
<i>Charles Matthews. </i>

391
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,122
<i>I'm away from my phone</i>
<i>right now... </i>

392
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,021
<i>but if you leave</i>
<i>your name and number... </i>

393
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,356
<i>I will get back to you. </i>
<i>Thank you. </i>

394
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,829
What up, O-Dog! Sorry.

395
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,701
When I bend it like Beckham,
I usually lock the door.

396
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,209
I got your message.
What?

397
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,140
Text messaging
come in handy?

398
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,343
Dude, I didn't send this.
Yeah, right.

399
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,244
If it was me,
why would I deny it?

400
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,854
Dude, it's Dodger.

401
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,325
Doesn't really seem
like her style.

402
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,625
You kidding? It was her idea
to change the game
in the first place.

403
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,463
She's just taking it
a step further
by coming after you.

404
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,663
Watch and learn.

405
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,805
She usually does laps
after field hockey.

406
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,507
I bet she's on the computer
in the swim team office.

407
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:09,314
Dude, Dodger's been waiting
for a guy who'll bite back.

408
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,019
If you get laid after this,
you got me to thank,
all right.

409
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,335
Relax, man.

410
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,343
Whoever it is
knows your screen name.

411
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,377
<i>It's got to be someone</i>
<i>on campus. </i>

412
00:28:58,837 --> 00:28:59,997
Hello?

413
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,864
Who's there?

414
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:37,037
Aim for the shallow end.
We want to scare her,
not kill her.

415
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,473
Yeah, okay.

416
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,078
One, two...

417
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,723
Did you hit her?
What?

418
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,529
I think she's faking it.
Isn't she?

419
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,230
She's not coming up.

420
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,201
Owen Matthews,
you're my hero.

421
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,795
You bitch.

422
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,307
Twice in one day, not bad.

423
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,876
What's that supposed
to mean?
"Be careful what
you wish for"?

424
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,474
Talk sense, boys,
you're losing me.

425
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,517
Someone sent Owen
some IM's
claiming to be the Wolf.

426
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,053
Said they were going
to pick our bones clean.

427
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,280
That's a little
over the top.

428
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,880
Yeah, and pretending
to drown isn't?

429
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:04,054
Look, I was with Regina
all afternoon,
studying AP Chem.

430
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,489
You can ask her.

431
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,363
No, I believe you.

432
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,039
Someone's just trying
to scare you.

433
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,874
I'm late for the team run,
I got to go.

434
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,913
Okay, so if you were
with Regina
and Randall's at State...

435
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,154
that leaves Mercedes
and Lewis.
And Graham.

436
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,386
You did make him look
like a chump the other night.

437
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,224
You think he's trying
to get me back?

438
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,287
And get back in the game.

439
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,636
The sum total
would be about 51.

440
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,934
Very funny, Graham.
I'm glad you think so.

441
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,001
Do I look like I'm laughing?
Well, I had to do something.

442
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,470
Sure, I understand.

443
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:59,380
You had to send me
threatening IM's pretending
to be a serial killer.

444
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,977
I have no idea what you could
possibly be talking about.

445
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,054
You didn't just IM as the Wolf
about an hour ago?

446
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,253
No, I've been here
since sixth period.

447
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,189
Owen, you can't convince me...

448
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,132
if you can't
convince yourself.

449
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,632
What were you
just talking about, then,
the thing you had to do?

450
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,676
I filed a noise complaint.
For what?

451
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,211
Are you kidding? Your room
is directly above us...

452
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,476
it sounds like you're having
WWF tryouts up there.

453
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,644
Jesus, Tom.

454
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,742
What happened?

455
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,089
Did you do this?
Of course not.

456
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,389
Somebody else must've...
Why didn't they
touch your stuff?

457
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,828
Tom,
I didn't touch your stuff.
Then who did?

458
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,221
That's Randall's.
I know.

459
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,351
That's disgusting.

460
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,726
Do you think
something happened to Randall?

461
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,259
Like what?
Like he died a violent death?

462
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,699
It's Regina.

463
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,770
She has a recipe
for fake blood
she got off the Internet.

464
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,635
It's just corn syrup.

465
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,709
It used to be sweeter.

466
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,574
Hey, Re-genius,
I can't believe...

467
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,214
you got Randall
to let you borrow
his tongue stud.

468
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,650
You know
you're going to buy me
a new computer, right?

469
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,620
What is it?

470
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,620
Hey, what's up?

471
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,919
<i>I told Tom... </i>

472
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,393
<i>I've been on</i>
<i>an AP Bio field trip</i>
<i>all afternoon. </i>

473
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,556
I thought you were in AP Chem.
<i>No. I took AP Chem</i>
<i>junior year. </i>

474
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,293
<i>Who told you that?</i>

475
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,539
Why are you doing this?

476
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,077
Not here.

477
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,389
Look, I was in town.
Yeah? Doing what?

478
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,524
I was visiting my mom.
What was she doing in town?

479
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,166
She lives here, all right.
This is my home.

480
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,696
Go ahead, laugh all you want.
The Dickens scholar.

481
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,236
Sixth grade English teacher.

482
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,439
I'm not even going to tell you
what my dad does.

483
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,607
So how can you afford...
Scholarship.

484
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,955
You think
people would really care?
I'm a town.

485
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,554
Around here,
town means trash.

486
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,524
You don't have to rub it in.
What?

487
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,088
It's not that.

488
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,601
It's just...

489
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:42,103
You know, I wish my dad
taught school, lived in town.

490
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:47,039
I mean, the guy sent me here
just so he wouldn't
have to deal with me.

491
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,178
I'm sorry
I flipped out earlier.

492
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,977
After what happened
at my last school and...

493
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,518
Yeah, you told me.

494
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,419
The vengeful dean
and his darling daughter.

495
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,626
What I didn't tell you
was that I was charged
with possession.

496
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,558
She got busted, was freaked
about her dad's job.

497
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,496
So I took the fall.

498
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,996
I'm not surprised.
Why is that?

499
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,604
You may not have a tell,
Mr. Matthews.

500
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,879
But you do have a weakness.
Yeah?

501
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:30,252
You're a good guy.
Makes you predictable.

502
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,856
Yeah, if it gets me
kicked out of Westlake...

503
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,358
I might as well sign up
for community college.

504
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,687
Then why did you play the game
to begin with?

505
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,164
The sneaking out.
The hoax e-mail.

506
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,743
At the pool.

507
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,744
You saved me.

508
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,809
You were faking.

509
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,053
I'm not now.

510
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,061
What?

511
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,228
Someone's here.

512
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,395
So?

513
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,576
They're wearing
an orange ski mask.

514
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,402
You're kidding.

515
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,641
If the light's gone off,
it means he's gone, right?

516
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,983
Or standing very still.

517
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,651
Who do you think it is?

518
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:47,562
It has to be someone we know,
he's wearing a ski mask.
Indoors.

519
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,458
How in the hell
did he get over there?

520
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,296
He's coming this way.

521
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,259
Okay, don't move.

522
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,096
The light will go off
and then we can jump him.

523
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,835
Try German Philosophy.
No one will bother you there.

524
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,273
So I don't get it.

525
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,311
Okay, not to get
all fortune cookie on you...

526
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,716
but the most obvious answer
is usually the right one.

527
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:22,955
My gut, when I got the IM,
was that it was the real guy.

528
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,119
Why not?

529
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,289
No, I said the most obvious,
not the most ridiculous.

530
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,163
I don't know, I mean,
someone murdered that girl
in the woods.

531
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,792
Maybe he read our e-mail.

532
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,833
Maybe he didn't get the joke.
Maybe he's pissed.

533
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,102
Maybe it's Randall?
It was his tongue ring, right?

534
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,203
It's hard to believe
he'd give up bragging rights
to Jenny Ryder...

535
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,871
just to play killer
in the stacks.

536
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,746
Like he could ever
actually seal the deal.

537
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,078
I bet you $20
he didn't even go to State.

538
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,780
How about dinner?

539
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,318
As long
as it's not over $20.

540
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,091
Damn, I left my book bag
in the stacks.

541
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,097
I'll be right back.

542
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,465
You know what,
I've got something
I should go do.

543
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,735
I'll see you tomorrow.

544
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,812
Sorry. Not a fan of the PDA.

545
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:58,253
It was a black
Jansport backpack.
I left it on the lower level.

546
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,320
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.

547
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:04,259
If one of the staff
had picked it up they would've
turned it in by now.

548
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,298
Did you see
any other students?

549
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,266
Maybe they picked it up.

550
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,338
<i>Student information. </i>

551
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,602
Hi, can you give me
Jenny Ryder's phone number?

552
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,701
I believe
she's in the freshman class.

553
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,143
<i>I'll connect you. </i>

554
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,916
<i>Hello?</i>
Hi, Jenny.

555
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,884
Can I speak to Randall?
<i>Who is this?</i>

556
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,750
I'm a friend of his
from school.

557
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,654
I just wanted to tell him...
<i>Tell him yourself. </i>

558
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,214
<i>He's not here. </i>
Well...

559
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,953
Do you know
how I can reach him, or...

560
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,860
<i>I told you, he's not here. </i>
<i>He never showed up. </i>

561
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,831
Did he say where he...
<i>No. He didn't say anything. </i>

562
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,027
<i>He stood me up</i>
<i>for my own formal. </i>

563
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,366
<i>Half my sorority doesn't think</i>
<i>he even exists. </i>

564
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,030
He didn't call?
<i>No. </i>

565
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,336
<i>There has to be something</i>
<i>really wrong with the guy... </i>

566
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,273
<i>to just not show up like that. </i>

567
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,209
I couldn't agree more.

568
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,012
Hey, Mercedes!

569
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,725
You know
where I can find Dodger?

570
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,987
Why?
I have something of hers.

571
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,193
Well, she's
on the floor below me.

572
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,027
I'm sure I'll see her
before lights out.

573
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,932
Actually, I was kind of hoping
to give it to her myself.

574
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,526
I bet you were.

575
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,165
I saw her heading toward
the faculty building.

576
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,730
I think Mr. Walker
is going over her article
with her.

577
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,934
Thank you.

578
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,126
Obi-Wan, what's up,
man?

579
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,030
Hey, you seen
my shoulder pads
around here?

580
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,103
By the way...

581
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,699
librarian dropped
your bag off.

582
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,970
Said someone turned it in,
or something like that.

583
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,738
O- Dog...

584
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,714
what do you think
a murder victim looks like?

585
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,452
Owen!
Tom.

586
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,048
What do you want?

587
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,189
Chill, buddy.
I'm just trying
to figure out...

588
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,523
what I'm going to be
for the Halloween dance.

589
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,961
You figured out
what you're doing
for a costume yet?

590
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,228
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm going.
I've got to work
that night anyway.

591
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,464
What? Dude, we could both
be murder victims.

592
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,199
I mean, Regina is a pro
with effects makeup.

593
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,672
And that's the night the Wolf
is supposed to strike.

594
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:11,113
Come on, O-Dog, don't make me
chase you to this thing.

595
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,170
Look...

596
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:15,446
I need to focus
on this article.
It's due tomorrow.

597
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:17,547
What? Really?

598
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,714
On the Friday
of Halloween?

599
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,152
What heartless bastard
assigned that?

600
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,523
Nice job, ladies.

601
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,667
All right.

602
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,301
Thank you.

603
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,641
Owen, you have
your assignment?

604
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,271
Sure do.
Can I have it, please?

605
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,613
I e-mailed it to you.

606
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,982
And the rest of the school.
Very funny.

607
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,491
All right, let's get down
to business.

608
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:58,085
Pop quiz. Everybody take out
a pen and a piece of paper.

609
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,861
Owen?
No, wait!

610
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,372
Put the knife back
on the ground.

611
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,908
This isn't mine.
You don't understand.

612
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,567
Someone is trying to play
a joke on me here.

613
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,407
Put it down, Owen! Now!

614
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,752
Can I explain? Please?

615
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,621
Save it for the Headmaster.
Someone trashed my room, too.

616
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,183
Did you report it?
I think it was Randall.

617
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:32,853
He wasn't even in class
this morning.

618
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,955
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

619
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,500
I think he's trying
to make me think
the e-mail's coming true.

620
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,433
Look, Owen, it's over.

621
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:43,135
You brought a weapon
to my class.
My hands are tied.

622
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,072
By the morning
you'll be onto your next
missed opportunity.

623
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,377
I know.
Good.

624
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,744
No. I know about you...

625
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:54,648
and Dodger.

626
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,888
I don't know
what you're talking about.

627
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,517
You're really going to
make me say it?

628
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,687
She's a student.
Exactly.

629
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:07,687
No.

630
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:11,196
She's a student.
In my class.

631
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,396
Anything you may have heard
about our relationship
is strictly...

632
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,530
What? Strictly what?

633
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,132
I saw you two last night.

634
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,506
You have proof?
No.

635
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,673
But I won't need it.

636
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,878
If word gets out
about you and a student...

637
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,217
the administration
will invent a reason
to fire you.

638
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,989
You know what, Owen?

639
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,455
What?

640
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,432
I like you.

641
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,704
But you think you're smarter
than you are.

642
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,403
Hey! There you are.

643
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,377
I've been looking
all over for you.

644
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:29,770
You okay?

645
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,345
Good, 'cause if you're lucky,
later on...

646
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,576
I'll let you go
over the river...

647
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,584
and through the woods.
Sorry.

648
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,449
Not a fan of the PDA.

649
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:39,949
Funny.

650
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,582
You gonna come
to the dance?

651
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:43,990
The Wolf is supposed
to strike tonight.

652
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,859
That's not funny.
Besides, I have to work.

653
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,826
Come on.

654
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,492
We're all going to
Tom's lake house right after.

655
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,058
I'm not going.

656
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,734
Why not?
Because I'm not playing
anymore.

657
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,038
And I'm through
with your friends.

658
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,841
Look, I'm really sorry about
what happened in Rich's class.

659
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:06,405
Randall sucks.

660
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,509
Good news is, I was right.

661
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,414
You owe me dinner.

662
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,913
I don't owe you anything.

663
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,933
Can I help you?
Yeah.

664
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,131
No. I work here.

665
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,000
Not all the time.

666
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,138
I guess I better
watch my back.

667
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,672
Randall?

668
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:40,745
Boo!

669
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,190
Someone just attacked me.

670
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,984
You sure
it wasn't Tom?

671
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,689
He said he was going
to give you a scare...

672
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,698
for skipping out
on the dance.

673
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,768
Yeah, he tried
to chase me here.

674
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,629
Hey, if you talk to him,
let him know Randall's back.

675
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:56,694
You saw Randall?

676
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,638
No, but Tom's car
is in the parking lot.

677
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,643
Keys just sitting on the tire
and everything.

678
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,171
See if you can find your car
tomorrow, T-Dog.

679
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:53,523
Officer!

680
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:58,862
Officer!

681
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,230
Get on the ground!

682
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,067
Drop the weapon!

683
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,639
Drop it!
It's not real!

684
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,481
I was just joking.

685
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:23,957
I'm sorry.

686
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,294
What's going on?

687
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,996
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

688
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,042
What was that?
Punch line.

689
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,188
Dead man walking.

690
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,790
I'm going to keep you all here
for the remainder
of the weekend...

691
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:12,130
while I determine
the best course
of action to take.

692
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:16,468
I'm at a loss to explain
how or why this happened.

693
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,167
We thought that...
Please, Mr. Matthews.

694
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,412
Mercedes has already told us
all we need to know.

695
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,416
I doubt if you are
any better able to explain
how a juvenile prank...

696
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:30,783
led to the police
almost shooting
two of my students.

697
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,586
No, ma'am.
Let me be clear, Mr. Matthews.

698
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,424
Given your history...

699
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:43,330
you are in
far more serious trouble
than your friends.

700
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,934
I don't care
who your father knows.

701
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,962
I'm inclined
to send you packing now.

702
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,201
Mr. Walker, however,
has spoken up in your defense.

703
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,006
He seems to feel that...

704
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,877
Trick or treat.
Adam!

705
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,542
Please, Mommy has to work.

706
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:04,080
Come on.

707
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,623
Yesterday wasn't Halloween.

708
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,859
It was just
the Halloween dance.

709
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,562
Today's the 31st.

710
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,133
The full moon's tonight.

711
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,639
I'll be sure to set
my tide charts accordingly.

712
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,369
What's your point?

713
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,837
I think our original hoax...

714
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,113
the mass e-mail...

715
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,275
was read by the person
who murdered that girl.

716
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,874
Owen, please.
No.

717
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,852
I got another IM today.

718
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,212
I think
something's going to happen.

719
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,748
Are you sure it's not just
another one of your friends?

720
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:23,056
Where's Mercedes?

721
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,358
She just spent the whole day
talking to the cops.

722
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,096
No way is she sneaking out.

723
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,195
Whenever you do see her,
make sure you thank her...

724
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,570
for getting us all stuck
on campus, all right?

725
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,235
I mean, what the hell was
she doing in my car, anyway?

726
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,278
Trying to convince you
the killer could be a girl.

727
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,940
Yeah, well, all I'm convinced
is that Randall's
a dead man...

728
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,245
for letting her
touch my ride.

729
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,351
I mean, where the hell is he,
anyway?

730
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,182
Merce gave him a ride
to the bus station...

731
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,745
so we could keep
your car around.

732
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,950
Randall never went
to State.

733
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,457
I think something
happened to him.

734
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,190
The IM said, "Be careful
what you wish for. "

735
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,288
Good job, Scoob.

736
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,026
You figure that one all out
by yourself...

737
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,533
or did you get some help
from Shaggy?

738
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,091
I don't think
this is a joke.

739
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,102
You're the only one,
then, man.

740
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,732
Mercedes pulled the stunt
with Tom's car, right?

741
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,038
She hid in the back,
I put the fake blood
in the front.

742
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,100
Okay.

743
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:12,375
So who was following
me and Dodger in the library?

744
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:16,478
Sorry.

745
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,378
I was really trying
to scare Dodger.

746
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:23,884
You're always
the shepherd.

747
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,486
I figured it was time
you felt like a sheep.

748
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,156
She took my bag.

749
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,367
Yeah, I saw you left it there,
bumped it to Tom...

750
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,300
and figured he would
give it to you.

751
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,803
You put a knife in my bag?

752
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,430
Only because
you trashed my stuff.

753
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:40,374
Why would I trash our room?
You didn't trash
our room, man.

754
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,240
You trashed my side.
It was all my stuff.

755
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,473
Look. Mercedes had
an earring...

756
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,674
that looked
like Randall's tongue stud.

757
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,513
She figured it'd be
a good setup for the car.

758
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,451
You smashed my laptop?

759
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,223
I got a little carried away.

760
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,349
I was in character.
In...

761
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,090
Dude! If I would have known
what you and the Vocab Ho
were up to...

762
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,562
I would have
gone after you guys...

763
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:02,825
instead of Owen
in the dining hall.

764
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,424
Jesus, why do you make it
so easy for us to hate you
sometimes?

765
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,162
Same reason your girlfriend
makes it so easy.

766
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,534
Who sent the IM's
from the Wolf?

767
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,875
It's not us, man,
it's got to be Randall,
all right.

768
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,781
If Randall was behind this,
don't you think...

769
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,480
he would have shown up by now
to gloat?

770
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,350
Are you sure
he got on that bus?

771
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,254
I told you, I wasn't with him.
Merce took him
to the bus station.

772
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,817
Then call her.

773
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,760
Jesus, for what I paid
for this thing...

774
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:41,998
you'd think I get better
than one bar of service.

775
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:44,095
Wait a second.

776
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:47,671
How do we know
Owen's telling us the truth?

777
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,275
Excuse me?

778
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,741
I mean...

779
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,239
he could be making
this whole thing up.

780
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,614
To get back at us
for the other stuff.

781
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,448
Why would I do that?

782
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,054
I'm the one
they're about to expel.

783
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:02,952
Exactly.

784
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,328
This is it.

785
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,129
This is the new game.

786
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:15,163
Owen knows
he's going to take the fall.

787
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,801
Brought us all here
to confess.

788
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:22,105
Surprise, surprise.
You all fell for it.

789
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,614
Victims of your own lies.

790
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,387
Is that what you're going to
tell Mr. Walker?

791
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,851
I saw you two.

792
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:42,053
In his office.

793
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,296
Is that why you've been
such a prick?

794
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,066
You're the one
who's screwing a teacher.

795
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,569
I was.

796
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:57,843
It's over.

797
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,548
After the library...

798
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,654
I went to Rich's office
to end it.

799
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,884
But I saw you...

800
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,524
you kissed him back.

801
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,095
What else could I do?

802
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:23,437
He tried a lot more
before I pushed him off.

803
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:30,369
Then he told me
I was too mature
for guys my own age.

804
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,014
He did what?

805
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,349
I guess he was right.

806
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,724
I don't believe it.

807
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:49,389
I do.

808
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,899
You should really get
some sleep, baby.

809
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,336
<i>I'm all congested</i>
<i>from crying. </i>

810
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,937
I think I'm going to
take a shower.
The steam might help.

811
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,975
<i>Did your RA take off?</i>

812
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:12,377
The whole dorm's empty
except for the incarcerated.

813
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,553
<i>You okay?</i>

814
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:20,295
Yeah, just...

815
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,230
still a little spooked.

816
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:32,200
So what are you guys
talking about?

817
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,072
We're just trying
to figure out
who the wanna-be-Wolf is.

818
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,375
Well, who is it?
<i>They think it's Randall. </i>

819
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:42,417
<i>I told them you dropped</i>
<i>him off at the bus station. </i>

820
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:44,781
I didn't.

821
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,786
Not really.

822
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:50,690
I left him in town.
He said had some time to kill.

823
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,224
It was, like, an hour
till the next bus.

824
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,095
He probably just needed
to go buy condoms.

825
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,094
<i>You taking your clothes off?</i>

826
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:04,163
Yes.

827
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,235
<i>Tell me about it. </i>

828
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,941
I'm in my underwear.

829
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:11,911
<i>Which ones?</i>

830
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,241
I'm wearing your favorites.

831
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,176
Take a picture.

832
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,420
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

833
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:23,389
Come on,
it's like Phone Sex 2.0.

834
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,974
What's taking so long?
Relax, I just sent it.

835
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,283
Merce, someone's there.

836
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,878
What are you
talking about?

837
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,413
You okay?

838
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,955
<i>Tom just scared</i>
<i>the crap out of me. </i>

839
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,527
Still pissed about your car,
Tommy-boy?

840
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,829
What's going on, man?
We heard you shout.

841
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:07,334
Merce, Tom's here.

842
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,427
<i>In the chapel. </i>

843
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,114
Merce was attacked!
She was getting in the shower!

844
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:27,378
Call for help!

845
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,385
Dude, it was
just another joke.

846
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,451
He probably wasn't
even on the phone with her.

847
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,087
It was the guy
that shot the girl.

848
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,529
Are you listening
to yourself?

849
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,659
The first murder happened
in a bathroom, remember?

850
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:42,795
We wrote it.
The victims are us!

851
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,238
<i>Campus Security. </i>
<i>How can I help you?</i>

852
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,871
I think someone's
being attacked. Please send
the police right away.

853
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,211
<i>Look, we're tired</i>
<i>of the practical jokes. </i>

854
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,682
<i>If you put a member</i>
<i>of the staff on,</i>
<i>I'll be happy... </i>

855
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,845
But there's no one here!
<i>Once I speak to your RA... </i>

856
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,953
Wait, where are you going?
I'm going back to my dorm.

857
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,361
Look, maybe Owen's right,
maybe we should just take off.

858
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:11,093
No, we're not taking off!

859
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,362
Tom, she's right,
we have to get out of here!

860
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,336
You're not going anywhere.
You keep out of this.

861
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,998
All she's trying to do
is make a bad situation worse.

862
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:21,100
Said the self-centered
loudmouth
to no one in particular.

863
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:22,940
Do you ever shut up?

864
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:26,773
What?

865
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:28,809
What?

866
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,115
What's on your face?

867
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,427
It's on my sweatshirt.

868
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:12,421
Oh, my God!

869
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,222
Randall!

870
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:21,892
We have to get out of here!
We have to get out of here!

871
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,100
What about Dodger?

872
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,038
What about her, man?

873
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:31,577
I'm going to find her.

874
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,711
Will you wait for me?

875
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,319
You have 20 minutes.
All right?

876
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:46,986
At 2:15 we are out of here.
With or without you.

877
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:07,609
Hello?

878
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,248
Lewis!

879
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,055
Are you okay?

880
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:16,682
Merce, she's gone.

881
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,249
I surprised him.

882
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,591
I think I hurt him, but...
Hold on, I'll be right there!

883
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,130
No! Get help!

884
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,993
Tom and Regina are waiting,
we have to get...

885
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:28,529
Lewis!

886
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:08,470
Dodger?

887
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,339
Tom, stop!

888
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:17,670
Tom!

889
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,651
Mr. Walker.

890
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,859
Mr. Walker!

891
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:19,467
Hello?

892
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,169
<i>Owen?</i>
Dodger?

893
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,913
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>in Rich's office?</i>

894
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:28,575
I'm trying to get help.
Where are you?

895
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,550
<i>I just found Mercedes. </i>

896
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:34,286
<i>She's dead. </i>

897
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:36,647
<i>What do we do?</i>

898
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,591
Tom and Regina
already left.

899
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:42,654
We have to find
a way off-campus.
<i>Where's Rich?</i>

900
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,298
I don't know.

901
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:47,163
<i>I think he keeps</i>
<i>a set of car keys there. </i>

902
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,334
<i>Look in his desk. </i>
Good.

903
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:51,802
I'll meet you
in your room.

904
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,898
<i>No, I'm on my way</i>
<i>to you. </i>

905
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:56,809
Be careful.

906
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,473
<i>I will. </i>

907
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,040
<i>Owen, I'm sorry. </i>

908
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,142
Me, too.

909
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:10,018
Just get here, okay.
<i>I can see you in the window. </i>

910
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,318
I can't see you.

911
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,085
<i>I'm right here. </i>

912
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,063
Run!

913
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,165
No!

914
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,504
Oh, my God.

915
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,420
Keys. Keys. Keys.

916
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,049
I have a gun.

917
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,519
I've called the police.
They're on their way.

918
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,856
Owen, is that you?

919
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,288
Mr. Walker?

920
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:52,122
Look, I'm coming in.

921
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,556
Don't do anything.

922
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,265
Where'd you get that?

923
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:03,599
Your desk.

924
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:04,764
What?

925
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:06,372
It's yours.

926
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:10,207
Why don't you give it to me?
Not a chance.

927
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,543
Relax, Owen.

928
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,275
No one's going to hurt you.

929
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,542
Look.

930
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,310
Where did you get those?

931
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:22,084
I found them
in the stairwell.
Oh, God.

932
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,917
You did this, didn't you?

933
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,561
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

934
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,858
Dodger called me...

935
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,957
That's why
you stood up for me...

936
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:35,230
with the Headmaster.
You wanted me here for this!

937
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,938
Why don't you give me
the gun, son?

938
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,997
You killed them!

939
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,534
Mercedes! Randall! Lewis!

940
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:45,473
Dodger!

941
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,581
I don't know
what's going on.
Yes, you do.

942
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:50,582
No, listen to me.
Don't lie to me.

943
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,678
Your friends are probably
just screwing with you.
Give me the gun.

944
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:56,121
Is this the gun that killed
that girl in the woods?

945
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,351
Becky?

946
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,922
Were you screwing her, too?

947
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,062
Dodger tell you that?

948
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:08,431
She didn't have to.

949
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:51,810
Oh, my God!

950
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:02,882
Owen.

951
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,920
Are you okay? We...

952
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,740
It was...

953
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,037
I don't know what to say.

954
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,979
It was just for fun,
we had...

955
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:34,989
We had been playing this game,
and we decided that...

956
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,915
We decided to
work together tonight.

957
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:41,185
We were trying to scare
Owen and Mercedes...

958
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,731
because they got everyone
in trouble before.

959
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:51,462
Listen, we didn't think that
anything was going to happen.

960
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,770
How could you let Graham
do that to me?

961
01:16:57,012 --> 01:17:00,243
Baby, I didn't even know
about it
till I left the chapel.

962
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:12,257
Dodger wasn't supposed
to hit me that hard.

963
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,466
Why did you hide
when Mr. Walker showed up?

964
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,839
Why didn't you
say something?

965
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,837
No, thanks, Dad.

966
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:49,656
My attorney tells me
the news is good.

967
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,387
They're going to drop
the charges. Self-defense.

968
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,157
It'll be a few years
probation, if that.

969
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:57,524
Dad...

970
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,729
how's that possible?

971
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:02,702
They ran ballistics
on the handgun. It turned out
to be the weapon...

972
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:06,502
the police were looking for
in the shooting
of that local girl.

973
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:07,769
Really?

974
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,670
It appears you shot
a wanted murderer.

975
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,376
How do they know
it was him?

976
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:20,421
It seems he was involved
with the victim at some point.

977
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:21,956
They checked
his credit card bill...

978
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:25,117
and found out that he'd
purchased two airline tickets
last month.

979
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:28,128
One in his name,
the other in the girl's.

980
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,593
Do they know
why he killed her?

981
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:33,899
My attorney says
they're calling it
a crime of passion.

982
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:37,503
No one ever really knows
the truth with these things.

983
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:42,674
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Matthews...

984
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,907
but one of your son's friends
is here to see him.

985
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,739
Go ahead, Owen.

986
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:54,049
It's going to be okay, son.
I promise.

987
01:19:58,026 --> 01:19:59,653
Right over there.

988
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,151
I'm so sorry.

989
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,684
For everything.

990
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,657
I didn't mean to hurt you.

991
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,335
You have to believe me.
It's okay.

992
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:49,437
I wish I could
make it up to you.
I know.

993
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:55,041
If I had known Rich
was involved with that girl...

994
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,812
I wouldn't have played
this stupid joke.

995
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:06,954
What did you say?

996
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,396
If I had known Rich
was screwing that girl...

997
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:15,368
I wouldn't have talked
the others into this.

998
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,071
You're right.

999
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,608
You're absolutely right.

1000
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:24,206
I don't understand.

1001
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,710
You wouldn't play some game...

1002
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:31,041
if you knew
Rich was cheating on you.

1003
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:33,955
That's what I just said.

1004
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:36,756
You would get him back.

1005
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:42,694
Owen, I'm confused.
I don't...

1006
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,288
No, you're not.

1007
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:47,033
That's what
you want me to believe.

1008
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:50,770
Just like...

1009
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:55,105
you wanted me to believe
that you were off-campus...

1010
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,436
when the first IM went out.

1011
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:00,046
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1012
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:01,514
Yes, you do.

1013
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:05,976
In the chapel.

1014
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,413
You said you had ended it
with Rich.

1015
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,793
I don't think
that's what happened.

1016
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:18,226
I think you were still
in love with him.

1017
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,064
I think you knew that girl.

1018
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:22,228
This is my home.

1019
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,363
And you knew she was
still sleeping with Rich.

1020
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,236
Some townie was screwing
the wrong guy.

1021
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,468
Dodger tell you that?

1022
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:28,941
You murdered her.

1023
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,637
Well, the girl was shot.

1024
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:32,708
Then you planted the gun.

1025
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,007
I've got something
I should go do.

1026
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,675
And told me where to find it.

1027
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:37,843
Look in his desk.

1028
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:39,409
I was your guy.

1029
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,318
Someone's just trying
to scare you.

1030
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,879
From the moment we met...

1031
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,425
It's a small school.

1032
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:45,754
Word spreads fast.

1033
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:46,851
...you planned it.

1034
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:49,055
It was her idea
to change the game
in the first place.

1035
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,392
We're going to create
a killer.

1036
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:51,762
The whole thing.

1037
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,233
It's like you're playing
checkers.

1038
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:58,069
And I'm playing chess.

1039
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:01,039
Makes you predictable.

1040
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,509
You knew I'd shoot him.

1041
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,084
Owen, that's crazy.

1042
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,384
Really?

1043
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:20,325
I thought it was the object
of the game.

1044
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,087
Avoid suspicion.

1045
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,558
<i>Manipulate your friends. </i>
<i>Eliminate your enemies. </i>

1046
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,474
Honestly, Owen,
even if that were true...

1047
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:46,251
who would believe you?

1048
01:24:46,252 --> 01:24:49,052
