1
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,350
Dr. Leo Semenau
General practitioner

2
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,832
Come on.

3
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,077
Again.

4
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,275
Cut down on the cigarettes.
- Sure, Doc.

5
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,193
That's what you always say.

6
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,711
Get dressed.

7
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,793
I haven't forgotten you.

8
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,071
Don't worry.
I'll stop by when I'm done here.

9
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,753
See you later.

10
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,150
Okay, I'll see you on the 20th,
as usual.

11
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,675
I forgot my checkbook.

12
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,952
No problem. You can pay next time.

13
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,558
Is room 321 ready?
Can you come down here?

14
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,360
What about this guy?
- What guy?

15
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,273
The American who keeps calling.

16
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,715
Will you pick up?
He's been on hold for 10 minutes.

17
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,953
Listen Malecot,
I have a meeting in 20 minutes...

18
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,156
Have him call back.

19
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,111
Like clockwork.

20
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,312
I don't want to wait anymore.

21
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,516
I want to die.

22
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,678
I'd like some breakfast, please.

23
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,469
I have nothing to say.
He's harassing me.

24
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,438
What's this?
- All his faxes.

25
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,480
I'm coming.
- Lunchtime! We're waiting for you.

26
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,159
Come on.

27
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,629
I don't know...
- Move!

28
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,159
What the hell is this shit?

29
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,511
Look at this.

30
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,233
Let's get out of here.
- Stay down here if you want.

31
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,993
Please.
- Leave me alone!

32
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,870
Shit.
I hope I didn't do something stupid.

33
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,109
Do you have a cigarette?

34
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,872
Thank you.

35
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,158
I need 6 months.
- I can't. It's not kosher.

36
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,790
I'm not asking much.
Just a favor. A little time...

37
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,555
You can help me.
- It's not kosher.

38
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,270
Do it for Coré at least.
Do it for her.

39
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,957
I can't.

40
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,869
You okay?
- Yeah.

41
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,838
You're late today.
