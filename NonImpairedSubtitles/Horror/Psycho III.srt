1
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,111
There is no God!

2
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:39,459
Forgive me.

3
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:46,885
Give me a sign.

4
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:49,015
Help me.

5
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:57,019
Maureen. Maureen, where are you, dear?

6
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:59,766
Maureen, where are you?

7
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,437
Oh dear God. She's up there.

8
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:04,655
Maureen!

9
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:07,068
Stay where you are!

10
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,202
Oon't move!

11
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:14,781
Stay where you are.
- Come down!

12
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:19,249
There is no God!

13
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:22,424
Wretched girl, how dare you!
- Get away from me!

14
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:24,750
Please, Maureen. You mustn't.

15
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:29,175
You have an obligation to Him.
- I have nothing.

16
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,225
I am nothing.
- You can't. - No!

17
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,987
Wasn't your own sin red enough?
You'll burn in hell for this!

18
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,816
You'll burn in hell!

19
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:55,581
Maureen!

20
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:56,482
Want a ride? Or do you have
the Olympic torch in the suitcase?

21
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,155
Wouldn't want to lose ya.

22
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,536
Oon't worry.
I ain't born again or nothing.

23
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,290
I'll get this junk out of your way.

24
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,202
Jesus just come with it
when I bought her used.

25
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:17,544
I wanted to replace it
with a magnetic compass,

26
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,672
but you usually end up
going the wrong direction anyway.

27
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,847
That makes two of us.
- Yeah?

28
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,931
Water?
- Thank you.

29
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,643
Name's Ouane Ouke, by the way.
Friends just call me Ouke.

30
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:43,779
Put the suitcase in the back seat.
- Thank you.

31
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,361
Hey, watch the guitar!
- I'm sorry.

32
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,247
No harm done.
Just watch out. It's my life.

33
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:57,293
Going to LA to be a rock-n-roll star.
What about you? Where you going?

34
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:00,881
What were you doing back there?
- I...

35
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:05,344
Car trouble?
- Yes. I had car trouble.

36
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,257
What kind?

37
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:15,760
Ah, no car.
- No car? That's the worst kind.

38
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:19,521
Still don't know where you come from.
- So?

39
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:23,987
Are you my Father confessor?
- Jesus,

40
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:28,867
I was just asking! You act as if
I accused you of murder or something.

41
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:33,824
Hey, it's none of my business.
Play mystery lady if you want.

42
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:38,911
I don't care where you come from.
Could've fallen from the sky.

43
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:42,336
A little angel
just tumbled off her cloud.

44
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:47,132
Well, hold on angel,
I'll get you where you're going.

45
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:04,149
Get out of here!

46
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:16,653
Come on, baby.

47
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:27,455
You alright?
- Yes.

48
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:51,480
What are you doing? - It's as
far as we go in this shit, honey.

49
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:55,904
But it could rain all night.
- That's right.

50
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:01,196
Better get some sleep.

51
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:57,673
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

52
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,628
You kind of slid over.

53
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:05,262
It's still raining.

54
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:11,221
Why did you do that?
- Why didn't you stop me?

55
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:15,183
I didn't have time.
- I'll give you another chance.

56
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,028
I'm not very good at this.
- You could have fooled me.

57
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,408
Please don't!

58
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:32,747
Oh, well, I guess
we got him a little excited.

59
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,410
Oon't!

60
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:37,418
No!

61
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:42,552
What's the problem, angel?

62
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:45,593
Get away from me!

63
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:55,807
Are you crazy? Get in here!
- Give me my suitcase.

64
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:02,311
Stupid bitch!

65
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:05,989
You could've been coming
instead of going.

66
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:52,854
Are you really my mother?
- The name Spool means nothing to you?

67
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:56,859
No. Should it?
- It was Norma Bates' maiden name.

68
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,735
The woman you thought was
your mother was my sister.

69
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:03,573
She never mentioned me, did she?
- No.

70
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:06,449
You sure you won't have a sandwich?

71
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,415
Pardon?

72
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,194
Hi there.

73
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,119
Be right down.

74
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:02,186
Room?

75
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,444
I'd love one,
but I don't think I can afford it.

76
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:10,898
You should keep the register closed.
Somebody'll steal you blind.

77
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:14,194
Wouldn't get them very far.
- Business slow?

78
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:19,446
You're my first customer of the day.
Or did you just need directions?

79
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:23,954
I was actually interested in the sign.
But if business is bad...

80
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:28,044
No, it's not bad, just slow.

81
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:35,173
Well, 12 cabins, 12 vacancies...
We've been closed for a while.

82
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,551
Renovations.
But life's picking up along here.

83
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,884
Good prices, good service.
Things'll pick up.

84
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:44,893
I've got a rebuilt ice machine,
and 4 cabins booked for this week.

85
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:49,184
Fairvale High's Homecoming.
Big game against Central.

86
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:53,565
I'm rattling on.
Yes, there is a job. Interested?

87
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:58,238
In money? The only honest way
to get it is to earn it or inherit it.

88
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:02,195
And I don't have any rich relatives.
Got an application form?

89
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:05,161
Not necessary. My name is Norman,

90
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:07,541
Norman Bates.

91
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:11,998
What'ya been painting?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

92
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:17,169
Step into the back while I clean up.
- Said the spider to the fly.

93
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:27,723
Local branch of the Audubon society?
- My hobby. Stuffing things.

94
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:32,441
Have a seat...
- Ouane Ouke. Just call me Ouke.

95
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:35,109
I can pay you 5 dollars an hour.

96
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,277
You'd work the desk,
make beds, clean up. Stuff like that.

97
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:45,446
Want some of these?
You'd be general assistant.

98
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:49,491
Work's not too hard,
and you'd have lots of free time.

99
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:54,248
I'm the manager,
so you'd be assistant manager.

100
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:59,464
You'd get a free room and work days.
I prefer the nights.

101
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:01,927
I've got to be honest, Norm.
- Norman.

102
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:05,928
I just want to make enough bucks
to get my car fixed and

103
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:09,721
build up a little stake for LA.
I'm a singer.

104
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:15,484
But I could fill in until you found
somebody permanent. I'm just not

105
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:17,445
staying too long.

106
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,317
No one ever does.

107
00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:26,529
Your cabin's at the end.
Why don't you go unpack?

108
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,907
I need to get back to the house.

109
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,127
You live up there?
- Yeah.

110
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,829
Me and myself, alone.

111
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:47,550
You clear on the credit card machine?
- Yeah, I used to be a pump jockey.

112
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:52,101
The rooms cost...
- 20.95 single, 25.95 double.

113
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,853
I'll bring you a couple of burgers.
- Alright!

114
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,114
Still beats the hell out of me.
Just doesn't show up for work one day.

115
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:09,405
Thought you would've turned up
some clues by now, John.

116
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:15,035
Her apartment's all in order.
Oidn't say anything to her landlord.

117
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:19,538
You'd think she'd tell me
if she was going to take a month off.

118
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:21,920
Emma Spool
was as regular as clockwork.

119
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,790
I don't think she missed a day
in the? years I've owned this dump.

120
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,213
I hope that nothing's happened to her.
- You mean like Norman Bates?

121
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:37,178
Oidn't they work here together?
They say he likes older women.

122
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:41,560
Rumors and innuendo caused
that boy enough trouble.

123
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:45,434
What's your interest anyway?
- I drove from LA to see him.

124
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:48,982
Why? You another relative
of somebody he killed?

125
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:51,862
It's really not any of your business.

126
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,113
Keeping the peace is my business.

127
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:57,823
Then until I've broken some law,
lay off the third-degree, OK?

128
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,823
Can't you just leave
the poor slob alone?

129
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:06,495
What are you? His fan club?
- No, we believe in second chances.

130
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:10,044
What Norman did was a long time ago,
and he paid the price.

131
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,461
It depends on who you ask.

132
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:15,888
20 years in the bunk house
is paying the price, girly.

133
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,932
The guy's okay now.

134
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,555
When he worked here,
he was always on time and reliable.

135
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,187
A real Employee of the Month!

136
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:30,233
Go ahead and talk smart, lady.
He just wants to be left in peace.

137
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:37,107
Now look, Norman Bates has suffered
enough. Just leave him...

138
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:40,660
Afternoon, sheriff.
- ... alone.

139
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:43,750
Mrs. Oudley...
- What'll it be, Norman?

140
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,368
Chicken fried steak is good today.

141
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:52,008
Alright, and a glass of milk, please.
And a couple of burgers to go.

142
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:54,798
I'm warning you. I don't want trouble.

143
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:59,467
Then let go of my arm
or I'll holler police brutality.

144
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:05,810
Mind if I join you, Mr. Bates?
Tracy Vanderbilt.

145
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:10,101
Thanks, Myrna.

146
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,901
Coastal Reports?
- I write for them sometimes.

147
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:17,690
If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you
a few questions. - I mind.

148
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:21,736
Mr. Bates... - Norman.
- I'm writing on the insanity defense

149
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,914
and the rehabilitation
of mentally ill murderers.

150
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:29,412
Many people think
they can't be rehabilitated

151
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,124
and there shouldn't be
an insanity defense.

152
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:37,754
We hear the objections of the victims
and relatives, but the murderers,

153
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:43,764
who can't help themselves,
are victims too. What do you think?

154
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,020
If this lady's bothering you,
I'll have her leave.

155
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:50,143
Isn't your coffee break over, sheriff?

156
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,358
Anything else, Norman?

157
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:01,446
What do you think?
- About? - What we were just saying.

158
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,197
You were incarcerated for 20 years.
- 22.

159
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,531
Right.
For 22 years, you were locked away.

160
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,498
The state says you're sane.
You paid your debt.

161
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,171
Then Lila Loomis starts
to persecute you. - Because of

162
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,548
what happened to her sister.
- Yes.

163
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,174
Marion Crane. Right?

164
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,479
Right.
- But that was 20 years ago.

165
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:35,273
22.

166
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:38,478
A long time to harbor revenge.

167
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:43,149
Aren't you bitter about
what Lila Loomis tried to do to you?

168
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,694
I understand.

169
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:48,691
My cure
couldn't cure the hurt I caused.

170
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:52,405
My return to sanity
didn't return the dead.

171
00:20:52,832 --> 00:20:54,872
There's no way
to make up that loss.

172
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:58,079
The past is never really past.

173
00:20:58,503 --> 00:21:02,206
It stays with me all the time.
No matter how hard I try,

174
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:07,177
I can't escape. It's always there.
Throbbing inside you.

175
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:11,925
Coloring your perceptions of the world,
and sometimes controlling them.

176
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:14,259
That's my point, Norman. You have

177
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:17,556
a conscience. You live with guilt.
You punish yourself all the time.

178
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,855
Why does the rest of society have to?

179
00:21:21,276 --> 00:21:25,023
Take Mrs. Spool's disappearance.
What if a well-meaning citizen

180
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:27,986
thought that
you had something to do with it?

181
00:21:35,498 --> 00:21:38,369
I'm not upsetting you, Norman?
All this talk

182
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:41,164
is only hypothetical.
- What's yours, babe?

183
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:45,037
She is only an example
of how people might,

184
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:47,375
given your past history,

185
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:52,512
tend to automatically blame you
for any murder in the area.

186
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,570
You're not going, Norman?
I'd like to talk to you again.

187
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:21,368
You're not going to stiff us, Norman?

188
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:27,794
Excuse me. Could you tell me,
is there a cheap place to stay here?

189
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,491
Hello, angel.

190
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:53,456
You work here?

191
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:56,714
It's called suffering for one's art.
I'm sorry about last night.

192
00:23:57,132 --> 00:23:59,884
I was a little road-weary.
I'm glad you didn't drown.

193
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:01,677
I'm so very tired.

194
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:05,012
You won't find another place close.

195
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,397
Oon't worry. Aside from total boredom,
nothing will happen to you here.

196
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,910
Maureen Coil. Pretty name.

197
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:32,454
How much?
- For a single, $25.95.

198
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:47,835
There you go, angel.
Enjoy your stay.

199
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:17,279
Your type, Norm?
- You gave her Cabin 1.

200
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:20,493
Makes it kind of cosy.

201
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:24,787
Clean her up a little,
she'll look pretty good.

202
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:44,025
Put me closer to the window.
- Someone will see you, Mother.

203
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,732
Are you ashamed of me?

204
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:50,653
You know why, Mother. They've
even written about you in the paper.

205
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:55,025
Stop your whining, boy.
All this fuss over nothing.

206
00:25:55,872 --> 00:25:58,327
Not nothing. I saw her.

207
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,458
Even the initials on the suitcase.
M.C., Marion Crane.

208
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:08,921
Another of your cheap,
erotic delusions.

209
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:13,126
You killed her.
The slut deserved it. But she's dead.

210
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,677
And the dead don't come back.

211
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:19,895
You came back.
- I never went away.

212
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:25,021
Oon't you know that by now?
You can't get rid of me.

213
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,059
I'll always be with you, Norman.

214
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:30,321
Always.

215
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,780
Stand up straight and
wipe your snotty little nose.

216
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:39,655
If the disgusting little whore upsets
you so much, just get rid of her.

217
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,077
No!

218
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:48,088
Then maybe I will.

219
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:14,272
You have an obligation, Maureen.
Maureen, don't!

220
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:16,855
There is no God.

221
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:22,573
Please Maureen, you mustn't.
Get away. You'll burn in hell.

222
00:27:22,997 --> 00:27:26,993
You have an obligation.
I have nothing.

223
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:30,334
I am nothing.

224
00:27:56,653 --> 00:27:59,404
What'll it be?
- Give me a beer.

225
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:13,915
Hi.

226
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:18,334
I'm Ouane.
- No kidding?

227
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:25,635
Any objections
to a guy buying you a drink?

228
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:29,674
I got a drink.
- So have another.

229
00:28:30,102 --> 00:28:32,891
You got a limit?
- Only to my patience.

230
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:37,014
You don't have to call me Ouane.
- No, I don't. - Friends call me Ouke.

231
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:39,400
I had a dog named Ouke once.
- Really?

232
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,446
Scratch my belly, my leg'll shake.
- I hated the mutt.

233
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:52,827
Keep the matches, lady. You need 'em.
You're as warm as a cry for help.

234
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,667
Just a minute. Ouke. Ah, Ouane.

235
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:02,124
Whatever. I'm easy.
- I've noticed.

236
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,958
You staying there?
- Working there.

237
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:07,553
Even better.

238
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:11,512
Let's sit down. I'll buy.

239
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,917
Help.

240
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,387
Help me!

241
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:04,322
Miserere mei, Oeus.

242
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:09,875
Miserere mei, Oeus.

243
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:30,154
Forgive me.

244
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,788
I figured Bates was a geek.
But a full-fledged loony tune?

245
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:46,843
You think he offed this Spool broad?
- Well, he acted pretty weird.

246
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:51,307
But then he's pretty a weird guy.
- No shit.

247
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:55,474
So you'll pay me for...
- Anything I can use. - How about:

248
00:32:55,896 --> 00:32:59,065
A girl checked in this afternoon.
Nice looker, too. When Norman saw her,

249
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:02,650
he kind of freaked.
Strolling down memory lane.

250
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:09,567
Are you leaving so soon?
- I'm afraid so.

251
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:13,658
Oon't you want to work this off
in trade? I'll credit your account.

252
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,951
You shouldn't rely so much
on that face and those pearly whites,

253
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:22,251
because come-ons like that
could get them punched out.

254
00:33:35,602 --> 00:33:37,760
Forgive me.

255
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,313
You're alright.
You're in St. Matthew's Hospital.

256
00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:48,984
I'm Father Brian.
I'm the resident psychiatrist.

257
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:55,370
Maureen,
do you know who saved you?

258
00:33:57,582 --> 00:33:58,696
Mary.

259
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:06,503
I'm sure she had a hand in it.
But there was someone else.

260
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:10,373
You ought to be real proud, Norman.
- Yes, it was very heroic.

261
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:13,968
How do you happen to be here?
- Just my dumb luck.

262
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:18,683
I saw the ambulance leaving the motel
and wanted to see what was up.

263
00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:22,516
Must've been disappointing for you.
- How did Norman find out?

264
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:26,807
Towels. - Towels.
- Yes, he took her some fresh towels.

265
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:32,276
Now I do know my job, Ms. Vanderbilt.
- Mr. Bates, she wants to see you.

266
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,371
I wouldn't pick out a silverware
pattern just yet, sheriff.

267
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:54,755
You found me, Mr. Bates.

268
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,626
Norman.

269
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,045
My name's Maureen.

270
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,470
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did.

271
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:11,726
I can't have that going on
in my motel. It gives it a bad name.

272
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:17,491
Please don't take it the wrong way,
Marion. I'm sorry, I mean, Maureen.

273
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:21,947
I'm sorry.
- I did leave the bathroom a mess.

274
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,581
I've seen it worse.
- I'm sorry.

275
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,157
I'm sorry to be such a bother.

276
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,584
Oh, you're no bother.
No bother at all.

277
00:35:32,003 --> 00:35:35,124
People should look out
for each other, don't you think?

278
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:39,879
Sometimes we get lost.
But if there'd only been someone

279
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,720
to help us understand,
then maybe we wouldn't do

280
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,597
some of the sad, awful things we do.

281
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,394
You're very kind.

282
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:53,689
You should rest.

283
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,727
Oo you have somewhere to go
when you get out?

284
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,194
If you want, you can stay
at the motel until you're better.

285
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:07,995
FOC, of course. Free of charge.
As long as you like. It's never full.

286
00:36:08,414 --> 00:36:11,416
It would give you
a chance to sort things out.

287
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:13,828
Why are you so kind to me?

288
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:19,755
You remind me of someone I knew once.

289
00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:24,594
You don't know me.
After the way you found me,

290
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:28,215
you must think I'm mad.
- No, no.

291
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:36,188
We all go a little mad, sometimes.

292
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:40,273
But sometimes...

293
00:36:42,197 --> 00:36:46,489
the despair is just so overwhelming,

294
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:50,360
that all you want is for it to stop.

295
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:58,208
I'd like to stay at your motel
for a few days, if you don't mind.

296
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:03,547
I'm glad you're safe.
- Thank you.

297
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:08,135
Thank you for looking out for me.

298
00:37:09,848 --> 00:37:11,389
Sure.

299
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:33,277
You were down there, Mother.
Weren't you?

300
00:37:34,204 --> 00:37:37,121
I'm glad she didn't die. I'm glad.

301
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,158
She will.

302
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:45,503
Oon't you touch her. Never!

303
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:49,208
Be quiet or someone will hear us.
- Let them.

304
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:54,465
Let them hear.
- They sure like the TV up loud.

305
00:38:26,629 --> 00:38:28,836
I'm sorry.

306
00:38:29,424 --> 00:38:31,381
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

307
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:34,885
I usually keep this locked
when no one's here.

308
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:44,348
Mommy's little helper. Very sweet.

309
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,645
You always watch TV so loud?

310
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,982
Oh, the TV, yeah.

311
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,863
Who are you?

312
00:38:59,284 --> 00:39:02,735
A friend of Ouke's?
- We're getting to know each other.

313
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:09,117
Why don't you come and
join our party?

314
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:14,456
Oh, no. No, thanks.

315
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:18,589
Too bad. Thanks for looking after me.

316
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:21,052
See you around, maybe.

317
00:39:22,308 --> 00:39:23,849
Oh my God.

318
00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:31,266
Maybe!

319
00:40:53,562 --> 00:40:54,936
Hey,

320
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:59,055
watch the guitar.

321
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:31,715
Oh God, don't tell me you're of those
who farts, rolls over and sleeps.

322
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,675
I picked you up in a bar.
What, you want to get married?

323
00:41:36,103 --> 00:41:38,390
You shithead!

324
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:42,227
I got to get up for work soon.
Just go home.

325
00:41:42,649 --> 00:41:44,725
How?
You brought me out here.

326
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:48,235
Here's the cab fare.
Phone book's on the table.

327
00:41:48,654 --> 00:41:53,282
You make it all sound so cheap.
- It is, but it beats a vibrator.

328
00:41:54,036 --> 00:41:57,654
Yeah?
At least a vibrator gets me off.

329
00:41:58,081 --> 00:42:02,126
Use the payphone, bitch.
- Ouch. Let go!

330
00:42:11,426 --> 00:42:15,175
Give me my clothes. Bastard!

331
00:42:39,996 --> 00:42:41,787
You fucking idiot!

332
00:43:10,273 --> 00:43:11,818
Oh shit.

333
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:27,248
No! Help!

334
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:54,061
We're unable to complete
your call as dialed.

335
00:43:54,484 --> 00:43:56,772
Please hang up and dial again.

336
00:43:58,863 --> 00:44:01,151
Mother! Oh God, Mother!

337
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:03,611
Blood, blood!

338
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,428
Up early, huh?

339
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:53,572
When I was young, my parents
always made all my decisions.

340
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:57,668
Becoming a nun was my idea.

341
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:06,464
But as my final vows grew closer,
it became so frightening.

342
00:45:06,886 --> 00:45:09,673
I began to dwell upon things
that I would never know.

343
00:45:10,097 --> 00:45:11,805
What things?

344
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:15,092
Hungers for the flesh, Father.

345
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:18,685
It's perfectly normal.

346
00:45:19,106 --> 00:45:21,892
Sister Catherine said
it was bad, and...

347
00:45:22,316 --> 00:45:27,359
if my faith were strong enough,
that I wouldn't have evil thoughts.

348
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:33,152
Why didn't you just leave the
novitiate rather than be tormented?

349
00:45:33,577 --> 00:45:36,827
But the Church teaches us
to endure suffering.

350
00:45:37,248 --> 00:45:39,655
It also teaches us
that suicide is a sin.

351
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:42,657
I knew it was wrong, Father.

352
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,789
I was afraid...

353
00:45:48,258 --> 00:45:50,629
to face the consequences of my sins.

354
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:56,010
Maureen, it seems that only you
have given up on yourself, not God.

355
00:45:56,434 --> 00:46:00,929
Why else would he have twice saved you
from your own desperateness?

356
00:46:01,355 --> 00:46:03,228
The other night,

357
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:06,641
as I lay there,

358
00:46:08,652 --> 00:46:11,818
I saw the Virgin standing above me.

359
00:46:12,908 --> 00:46:16,488
A halo of white light was about her,

360
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:21,537
and she held a shiny, silver crucifix.

361
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:26,372
Her arms were outstretched
as if she were beckoning me.

362
00:46:26,795 --> 00:46:30,378
Oh Father, what did she want of me?

363
00:46:32,717 --> 00:46:37,295
What about this? - Maybe she got
change for the phone or cigarettes.

364
00:46:38,138 --> 00:46:42,551
It might help if you knew her name.
- Forgot to ask.

365
00:46:42,975 --> 00:46:46,596
It usually comes after "Hi, I'm Ouane,
but you can call me Ouke. "

366
00:46:47,023 --> 00:46:51,485
I'm more interested in those voices
you heard up at the house.

367
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:57,027
Maybe voices.
It could have been a TV or a radio.

368
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:02,244
Quite a crowd!
- Yeah, homecoming weekend.

369
00:47:02,662 --> 00:47:05,498
They're celebrating the big victory.
The game's not until tonight.

370
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:09,165
Where are you going? - You said
he's at the hospital picking her up.

371
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:12,836
Yeah. But what if he comes back?

372
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:15,747
You don't know a thing.

373
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:25,097
Fairvale or Central? Come on!
Where are you from? - Fairvale.

374
00:47:25,517 --> 00:47:29,645
Too bad. Hope you don't mind losing.

375
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:36,014
Ms. Vanderbilt!

376
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:42,276
After you check in, come down to 4.
There's a party. We gonna beat you.

377
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:54,539
Ms. Vanderbilt, are you looking
for something? - Just you.

378
00:47:54,961 --> 00:47:58,830
Hoping we can finish our little chat.
- Your chats end up sounding

379
00:47:59,258 --> 00:48:02,792
more like interrogations.
- Another time? - No.

380
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:06,341
And please, don't come back.

381
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,239
Oh, Norman. How sweet of you.

382
00:48:23,656 --> 00:48:27,819
You had them cleaned.
- They were a little wrinkled and wet.

383
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:30,318
And a little out of style, too.

384
00:48:30,915 --> 00:48:33,535
Oh, no. Conservative clothes

385
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:35,750
never go out of style.

386
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:39,916
I especially like that one.

387
00:48:42,426 --> 00:48:45,460
You'd look swell in that tonight.

388
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:55,384
I think Mrs. Spool said she had
a son once. But he never visited her.

389
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:59,016
And she never went anywhere.
- Never went out, huh?

390
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:02,311
Just work. A real homebody.

391
00:49:02,736 --> 00:49:07,231
I've got a backed-up toilet in 6...
- Mind if I stay and snoop a bit?

392
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:12,651
Why should I? The cops have already
paraded through here and everything.

393
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:17,657
You can rent it for all I care.
Spoolie's rent was two weeks past due.

394
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,618
How much for just a couple of hours?
- Thanks...

395
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:27,253
It's a pleasure to see a woman here
without blue hair and varicose veins.

396
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:30,796
Yeah.
- Just close the door when you leave.

397
00:49:31,222 --> 00:49:32,846
Sure thing.

398
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,745
Bates Motel.

399
00:50:43,497 --> 00:50:46,072
Hello?

400
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,286
Hello?

401
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:06,767
I'm going now. I won't be out late.

402
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:08,385
Mother?

403
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,981
She's a nice girl.

404
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,260
I've never drunk this much before.
- Me neither.

405
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,057
My mother never allowed liquor
at home. - What can we toast to now?

406
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:47,935
To happiness.

407
00:51:52,522 --> 00:51:57,433
Would you like to dance?
- Oh, no. No. I couldn't.

408
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,023
It's very easy.
My mother taught me. Come on.

409
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:07,405
I feel woozy.
- It'll make you light on your feet.

410
00:52:20,633 --> 00:52:24,582
Norman, I feel silly.
- Nothing wrong in that.

411
00:52:25,012 --> 00:52:28,131
Just follow me.
I go forward, you go back.

412
00:52:28,556 --> 00:52:32,140
Slow, slow, quick, quick...

413
00:52:36,148 --> 00:52:39,315
See? You just learned
your basic back step.

414
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:45,694
Slow, slow, quick, quick...

415
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:21,223
Oh well, they say
the wet-look is coming back.

416
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:36,994
How's the party going, Ouke?
- It's cool, Norm.

417
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,660
You mind hanging on for a while?
- It's your overtime.

418
00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:26,543
What's wrong?

419
00:54:28,547 --> 00:54:30,872
I must've had too much to drink.

420
00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:34,134
I just thought
I saw a woman in your house.

421
00:54:38,223 --> 00:54:41,009
It's okay, Ouke. You can go now.

422
00:54:42,017 --> 00:54:43,810
Whatever you say, boss.

423
00:54:49,567 --> 00:54:52,568
Sorry, I can't offer you anything
to drink. - That's okay.

424
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:56,106
Except water.
- That's fine.

425
00:54:56,531 --> 00:54:59,021
They're pretty loud.

426
00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:15,714
I had a very special time tonight.
- Me too.

427
00:55:18,011 --> 00:55:19,385
Thank you.

428
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:39,478
I should go.

429
00:55:40,323 --> 00:55:43,527
Because of her?
- Who?

430
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:47,322
That lady you say I remind you of.

431
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:50,416
Oid she mean a lot to you?

432
00:55:53,669 --> 00:55:55,578
We weren't...

433
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:58,578
It wasn't...

434
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:01,957
like it is with you.

435
00:56:04,598 --> 00:56:07,052
How is it with me?

436
00:56:31,831 --> 00:56:33,456
What's wrong?

437
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:37,377
I'm sorry, Maureen.

438
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:42,965
I can't do this.
It wouldn't be right.

439
00:56:43,758 --> 00:56:45,465
Not just now.

440
00:56:45,884 --> 00:56:48,257
It wouldn't be right?

441
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:58,851
Let's just lie here...

442
00:57:00,234 --> 00:57:02,475
and hold each other.

443
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,673
Sorry to wake you, honey, but
you fell asleep with the door open.

444
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,472
With all these horny bastards

445
00:57:38,894 --> 00:57:44,600
running around here, it's not a good
idea. Just wanted to let you know.

446
00:57:45,651 --> 00:57:48,650
Thank you.
- I'll close it on my way out.

447
00:57:57,329 --> 00:57:59,784
You dirty, dirty boy!

448
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:04,157
But I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything, Mother.

449
00:58:04,585 --> 00:58:08,084
She's a nice girl.
- She's a whore.

450
00:58:08,506 --> 00:58:13,167
We didn't do anything.
- You let her come between us.

451
00:58:13,594 --> 00:58:17,012
It isn't right. It isn't natural.

452
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:21,131
It's perfectly natural
for a son to love his mother.

453
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,261
Would you leave me alone, Mother!
Will you leave me alone!

454
00:59:12,192 --> 00:59:15,941
Norman,
are you in there? Are you awake?

455
00:59:16,364 --> 00:59:19,732
It's me, Maureen.
- Bring me the knife, Norman.

456
00:59:21,077 --> 00:59:22,356
Norman!

457
00:59:22,786 --> 00:59:26,119
Are you up there?
- Bring it to me.

458
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:31,585
Oid you hear me? What are you doing?

459
00:59:32,003 --> 00:59:33,662
Can't you do it?

460
00:59:37,134 --> 00:59:39,837
Please answer me. It's Maureen.

461
00:59:42,763 --> 00:59:46,345
What do you want?
- What happened to you?

462
00:59:46,766 --> 00:59:49,304
Are you alright?
- Yes.

463
00:59:50,562 --> 00:59:53,847
No... I'm feeling a little sick.

464
00:59:54,273 --> 00:59:57,191
Let me come up.
- No. Get away!

465
00:59:58,904 --> 01:00:03,282
I had a little too much to drink.
That's all. I just need to rest.

466
01:00:04,743 --> 01:00:06,616
Alright, Norman.

467
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:09,121
Please, Maureen,

468
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,911
go back to your room.

469
01:00:12,332 --> 01:00:14,041
Lock your door.

470
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:18,210
Please!
- Alright.

471
01:00:30,185 --> 01:00:33,101
Stop! Stop!

472
01:00:36,523 --> 01:00:40,187
You haven't changed in 15 years.
You're still disgusting.

473
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,066
Ruthie, all cheerleaders
boff the linemen.

474
01:00:45,488 --> 01:00:50,399
I wasn't a cheerleader.
I was a majorette.

475
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:56,197
You can twirl on...

476
01:00:57,252 --> 01:00:59,409
What?
- You can twirl on my...

477
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:00,868
What?

478
01:01:01,672 --> 01:01:04,163
You can twirl on my baton.

479
01:01:14,474 --> 01:01:16,052
Hey, cutie.

480
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:18,343
Hello?

481
01:01:19,438 --> 01:01:21,927
You have a john?

482
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:51,291
Men!

483
01:02:02,229 --> 01:02:05,015
Hey, where'd you come from?

484
01:02:05,982 --> 01:02:09,931
Geez, you scared the piss out of me.

485
01:02:11,696 --> 01:02:13,653
Oo you mind, sister?

486
01:02:14,073 --> 01:02:17,029
This is occupado.

487
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:43,847
Ouke?

488
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:16,003
Hey, innkeeper, I need change!
- Charlie, I got it.

489
01:03:46,495 --> 01:03:49,246
Get away from me.

490
01:03:50,248 --> 01:03:53,119
Looks like someone's getting lucky!

491
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:35,910
What's happening?

492
01:04:36,336 --> 01:04:38,127
Come on, Leo.

493
01:04:40,131 --> 01:04:43,333
Oon't go up there.
- Why? Something's wrong with Norman?

494
01:04:43,758 --> 01:04:46,877
It's time somebody told you.

495
01:05:09,617 --> 01:05:14,112
Good morning, Norman. It's a bit hot
to be sleeping so late, isn't it?

496
01:05:14,537 --> 01:05:16,660
We had a lot of revelers last night.
- I know.

497
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:20,782
One didn't come home.
Name is Patsy Boyle.

498
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,995
She came with a group of locals
to party after the game.

499
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:30,259
When they all left around 3,
nobody noticed that she wasn't there.

500
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:35,090
Someone's missing and you come to me.
- There have been other accusations.

501
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,803
From that reporter! She knows nothing.

502
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:42,057
That's what we're going to find out.
Now it's too hot to argue.

503
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,312
That rain made everything more muggy.
- Nothing back there. - Of course not.

504
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:49,022
Please get out of my house.
- Sorry, Norman.

505
01:05:49,448 --> 01:05:54,522
We have the warrant.
It's in everybody's best interest.

506
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,985
Who's? There's nothing here.
I didn't do anything.

507
01:05:58,414 --> 01:06:02,742
Then there's nothing to worry about.
Norman, come back!

508
01:06:04,334 --> 01:06:07,003
Get him, Leo. Ooggone you!

509
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:34,727
Norman,
what the hell's the matter with you?

510
01:06:40,702 --> 01:06:42,160
Mother?

511
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:48,662
I'm sorry, Norman.

512
01:06:49,754 --> 01:06:53,336
All seems a little unnecessary now.
- That's okay.

513
01:06:53,758 --> 01:06:57,801
Still no reason to get so...
so riled up.

514
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:00,544
We'll leave you alone now. Again,

515
01:07:00,972 --> 01:07:04,176
I'm sorry. - That's not enough.
You just can't let it lie!

516
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:08,182
I've had enough
of this Nancy Orew horseshit.

517
01:07:09,232 --> 01:07:11,638
I'm letting it lie and so are you.

518
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:17,601
Until I have evidence to the contrary,
both ladies are missing persons.

519
01:07:18,031 --> 01:07:19,988
Aren't you going to question him?

520
01:07:20,408 --> 01:07:23,822
Why not drag the swamp?
He dumped the last bodies there.

521
01:07:24,243 --> 01:07:26,734
Oon't tell me my job,
Ms. Vanderbilt.

522
01:07:27,163 --> 01:07:29,369
Somebody has to.

523
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:34,204
You're not going to let him go?
- Oespite all your glib insinuations,

524
01:07:34,628 --> 01:07:37,916
I don't have one iota of proof.
- He didn't do it.

525
01:07:38,342 --> 01:07:41,046
Norman was with me
until 6 o'clock this morning.

526
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,712
Whatever happened to that girl,

527
01:07:44,139 --> 01:07:47,306
he didn't have anything to do with it.
- Well, Miss,

528
01:07:49,602 --> 01:07:53,301
had you told us sooner, you would
have saved us a lot of trouble.

529
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,731
No one asked me.
- Come on, Leo.

530
01:07:57,526 --> 01:07:59,981
Bad time to beat the street, Norman.

531
01:08:00,403 --> 01:08:03,359
You'd better follow
the sheriff's example.

532
01:08:03,782 --> 01:08:09,370
I'm taking a passenger. Ready?

533
01:08:20,673 --> 01:08:23,543
She told you about me, didn't she?
- Yes.

534
01:08:23,968 --> 01:08:25,841
Where are you going?

535
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:31,256
Father Brian said I could come stay
with him if I needed to.

536
01:08:31,684 --> 01:08:33,841
Please let me go.

537
01:09:06,091 --> 01:09:07,337
Mother!

538
01:09:10,928 --> 01:09:12,127
Mother!

539
01:09:39,248 --> 01:09:41,536
Mother, where are you?

540
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,139
I love the silver
that shines in your hair.

541
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:54,694
And the brow that's all furled
and wrinkled with care.

542
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:59,062
I kissed the dear fingers,
so toilworn for me.

543
01:10:59,491 --> 01:11:04,450
Oh God bless you and keep you,
dear Mother...

544
01:11:05,497 --> 01:11:06,612
Bates.

545
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:12,371
It doesn't scan, does it, Norman?

546
01:11:13,254 --> 01:11:14,335
But...

547
01:11:14,757 --> 01:11:17,544
a lot of shit around here doesn't.

548
01:11:17,968 --> 01:11:19,795
What are you doing with my mother?

549
01:11:20,596 --> 01:11:22,089
Oon't you mean...

550
01:11:22,513 --> 01:11:24,090
Mummy?

551
01:11:27,601 --> 01:11:30,175
You did a nice job on her, Norman.

552
01:11:30,604 --> 01:11:32,892
Fresh as the day she was croaked.

553
01:11:36,278 --> 01:11:37,225
Why?

554
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:39,396
Just looking out for you.

555
01:11:39,821 --> 01:11:43,026
And yourself.
- I have ambitions, dreams.

556
01:11:43,451 --> 01:11:46,119
But dreams don't come cheap nowadays.

557
01:11:46,537 --> 01:11:48,992
I could have turned
Mom over to the cops,

558
01:11:49,414 --> 01:11:52,864
but all I would have gotten
was a pat on the back.

559
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:56,664
That reporter
would've shelled out a few bucks,

560
01:11:57,088 --> 01:12:01,878
and gotten the lion's share
of the credit, a five-figure salary,

561
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,590
and a big news job.

562
01:12:05,013 --> 01:12:09,342
Fine for her dreams,
but what about mine? No.

563
01:12:09,767 --> 01:12:14,761
I figure Mama's greatest value to me
is in her value to you.

564
01:12:15,188 --> 01:12:17,596
I don't have that kind of money.
- Oon't gripe to me.

565
01:12:18,024 --> 01:12:20,942
With that big piece of real estate
and this thriving business,

566
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:25,109
you could just sell an acre.

567
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,408
Please, Ouke.
I want my mother back.

568
01:12:28,828 --> 01:12:32,196
Take her. You know what I want.

569
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,166
And you know what I'll do
if I don't get it.

570
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,541
I know.

571
01:12:44,048 --> 01:12:47,168
I'm going to kill you,
you little freak.

572
01:13:03,486 --> 01:13:05,607
You think I'm stupid, Ouke?

573
01:13:07,072 --> 01:13:11,282
Even if I gave you money,
you'd still tell on Mother.

574
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:14,369
No one must know what she did.

575
01:13:18,081 --> 01:13:19,824
She can't help it.

576
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:24,877
She can't help the things she does.
She's just an old lady.

577
01:13:25,297 --> 01:13:26,957
A sick, old lady.

578
01:13:36,558 --> 01:13:38,183
Watch the guitar!

579
01:13:48,526 --> 01:13:52,738
You shouldn't sneak up
on a guy like that, Ouke. Ouke?

580
01:13:53,992 --> 01:13:57,407
I didn't mean it.

581
01:13:59,997 --> 01:14:03,946
You made me do this!
Your tainted blood in me!

582
01:14:06,294 --> 01:14:10,708
Oon't laugh at me, Mother.
Oon't laugh at me.

583
01:14:13,634 --> 01:14:18,593
I didn't even know she had any kids.
- Wasn't it on her job application?

584
01:14:19,016 --> 01:14:21,685
She was already here
when I bought the place? years ago.

585
01:14:22,102 --> 01:14:26,515
Best waitress I ever had.
- She worked for the previous owner?

586
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,556
Harvey Leech. - Where's he now?
- He used to be in a nursing home.

587
01:14:30,984 --> 01:14:34,317
Outside town.
- Probably dead now.

588
01:14:40,868 --> 01:14:43,622
Spool?
- Emma Spool.

589
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,574
She worked in your diner.
- Oiner?

590
01:14:48,377 --> 01:14:52,790
Yeah, I had a diner once.
- Mrs. Spool used to work for you.

591
01:14:53,215 --> 01:14:57,875
I had a woman named Spool
who used to work for me. A waitress.

592
01:14:58,302 --> 01:15:00,294
She come from that place.
- Place?

593
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,422
That place for nuts. As-s-asylum.

594
01:15:04,849 --> 01:15:07,138
Mrs Spool was in an asylum?

595
01:15:07,559 --> 01:15:10,811
Asylum, that's it, asylum.

596
01:15:11,232 --> 01:15:13,805
You know, she killed somebody.

597
01:15:14,653 --> 01:15:17,653
Who?
- Somebody. Husband?

598
01:15:20,824 --> 01:15:25,900
I don't recall. Good waitress, Spool.

599
01:15:28,914 --> 01:15:32,698
Are you sure, Maureen?
- Oh yes.

600
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:36,295
Norman understands me.
He understands forgiveness.

601
01:15:36,714 --> 01:15:40,462
I failed so many people, Father.
I won't fail him.

602
01:15:40,885 --> 01:15:45,345
That's why Mary came to me
the night he saved my life.

603
01:15:45,764 --> 01:15:48,006
It was a sign.

604
01:15:49,976 --> 01:15:54,934
And the woman in the window.
That must've been Mary too.

605
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,723
I'll be back, Mother.

606
01:18:45,603 --> 01:18:50,016
Miserere mei, Oeus...

607
01:20:06,304 --> 01:20:10,883
I thought if she saw these copies
she might change her story.

608
01:20:12,895 --> 01:20:14,803
Can I see her?

609
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:16,937
I'm afraid not.

610
01:20:41,296 --> 01:20:42,411
Norman!

611
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,743
Norman? It's me.

612
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,822
I've come back.

613
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,883
I never should've gone away.

614
01:21:31,802 --> 01:21:35,421
Whatever happened to you in your past,

615
01:21:35,848 --> 01:21:39,132
I know you're good. You took a life,

616
01:21:39,559 --> 01:21:42,097
but you also saved a life.

617
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,064
My life.

618
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,097
Let it be your life.

619
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:50,358
Oh, Norman!

620
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:57,442
What happened to you?
- I slipped in the mud.

621
01:21:58,203 --> 01:21:59,781
I slipped too.

622
01:22:00,205 --> 01:22:03,039
I know I've hurt you.

623
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:05,782
Can you forgive me?
- Norman!

624
01:22:23,395 --> 01:22:25,637
Maureen? Maureen?

625
01:22:35,404 --> 01:22:38,109
Mother!

626
01:22:49,586 --> 01:22:50,960
Maureen?

627
01:23:32,543 --> 01:23:35,118
Get that whore out of my house!

628
01:23:35,548 --> 01:23:39,294
Throw her down in the mud,
filth, where she belongs.

629
01:23:40,802 --> 01:23:44,252
I'll get you for this, Mother.
I'll get you for this.

630
01:23:45,055 --> 01:23:48,424
You haven't got the guts, boy.

631
01:25:47,128 --> 01:25:50,499
You dumb, stupid,

632
01:25:50,925 --> 01:25:53,595
naive girl.

633
01:26:01,852 --> 01:26:05,185
Why can't you leave my poor son,
my Norman, alone?

634
01:26:15,533 --> 01:26:20,075
What set you off again, Norman?
You killed Mrs. Spool, didn't you?

635
01:26:22,205 --> 01:26:25,123
Oid she tell you
that she was your mother?

636
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:28,578
She was crazy, Norman,
but she wasn't your mother.

637
01:26:29,003 --> 01:26:30,830
Neither are you!

638
01:26:32,923 --> 01:26:35,759
She was your aunt,
and in love with your father.

639
01:26:36,177 --> 01:26:39,959
But your mother stole him
away from her. Emma Spool...

640
01:26:40,387 --> 01:26:46,094
killed your father in a jealous rage
and kidnapped you as a baby.

641
01:26:50,648 --> 01:26:54,812
She killed your father
because she thought you were hers.

642
01:26:55,861 --> 01:26:58,778
The child
she should've had with him.

643
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:03,159
She was crazy.

644
01:27:03,578 --> 01:27:08,371
They locked her away.
- It's lies, it's all lies.

645
01:27:09,626 --> 01:27:12,495
She's a lying whore.
- Norman, where are you?

646
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,794
She's a slut.

647
01:27:18,175 --> 01:27:21,425
Oon't let her talk about me like that.

648
01:27:23,847 --> 01:27:25,470
Norman, please listen to me!

649
01:27:26,098 --> 01:27:32,183
Norman, Mrs. Bates! Whoever you are.
It doesn't matter to me.

650
01:27:32,604 --> 01:27:35,607
Get her, boy.
Get her, just like the others!

651
01:27:38,903 --> 01:27:42,355
Get her!
- No! No!

652
01:27:42,783 --> 01:27:47,278
Oon't! Oon't! Please! Norman!

653
01:27:47,703 --> 01:27:48,734
No!

654
01:27:50,163 --> 01:27:54,457
Norman, can't you do anything right?

655
01:27:56,211 --> 01:28:01,088
How dare you treat your mother
in such ways.

656
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:06,589
So, I don't have the guts, huh?

657
01:28:48,259 --> 01:28:51,464
I was for you, Norman.
Believed in you.

658
01:28:52,306 --> 01:28:55,428
You made a fool of me.
Look what you did to yourself!

659
01:28:55,852 --> 01:28:57,512
Why, Norman, why?

660
01:28:57,937 --> 01:29:01,852
Good God, son,
you'll never get out again.

661
01:29:04,318 --> 01:29:05,979
They're going to lock you up forever.

662
01:29:07,529 --> 01:29:11,857
But I'll be free.
I'll finally be free.
