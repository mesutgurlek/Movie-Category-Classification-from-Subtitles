00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,310
Hey, hey, you're gonna kill us.

3
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,819
lf l wreck my brother's car--
Let's just wait.

4
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,049
No, l can't wait.
You can't wait either.

5
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,528
l told you to take it easy
with that champagne.

6
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,491
-You take it easy with--
-Hey! Hey!

7
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,566
Okay.

8
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,979
-You're on private property.
-Sorry, we're just lost.

9
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,356
And you figured she might have a map
tucked up under that dress.

10
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,755
Don't feed me that bullshit.
l know what's going on.

11
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,223
Go do it someplace else.

12
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,732
Hello?

13
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,138
Hello?

14
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,469
-Evening.
-Hey, what's going on, man?

15
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,478
We're on our way down to Danville.

16
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,413
l was wondering if you had a room
where we could rest up?

17
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,417
Maybe like an hourly deal
or something?

18
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,647
Sorry. lt's nightly rates only.

19
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,850
But l do have a nice room
for you to rest up.

20
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,653
Cool.

21
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,064
Baby, hurry up!

22
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,208
Baby!

23
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,844
-Come on!
-Keep the change.

24
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,075
Honeymoon suite.

25
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,815
Hurry up.

26
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,159
Let's get to work.

27
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,984
l wasn't shy before we were married.
No reason to start now.

28
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,376
Come on.

29
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,956
-What happened?
-l don't know.

30
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,132
What's going on?

31
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,006
lt's okay, babe.

32
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,939
-l don't know. Old wires maybe.
-That was freaky.

33
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,698
We should go back to the car.

34
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,673
Are you kidding me? Now?

35
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,677
Come on, l'm dying here.
Come on, babe.

36
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,543
Please?

37
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:04,284
Remember, till death do us part?

38
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,670
That got a better view.

39
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,834
Newlyweds are always the best.

40
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,805
Newlyweds and cheating husbands.

41
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,184
-Hurry up!
-l'm coming.

42
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,882
Hey, hey, get your feet off the dash!

43
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,166
Hang on, babe! Hang on!

44
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,794
That kid better slow down a bit.

45
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,184
Hustle back and fold up the sheets
in case we got another.

46
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,433
Welcome to the Meadow View.

47
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,575
l'd like a single for the night.

48
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,136
Got a room open.

49
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,208
-Can l have a print of your lD?
-l left my lD in the car.

50
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,977
The name's Smith.

51
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,982
Not a problem.

52
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,664
You know, l think the pipes
are backed up in 2.

53
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,770
lt's number 6. Down on the end.

54
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,668
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Smith.

55
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,943
l'm in lousy shape, man.

56
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,636
l couldn't even make her out.
ls she worth watching?

57
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,513
You gotta put in a new microphone.

58
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,422
-Yeah.
-We can barely hear this.

59
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,053
He don't--
He don't trust your housekeeping.

60
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,124
Probably one of them germ freaks.

61
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,663
<i>Where do you want me?</i>

62
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,030
<i>I want you on the bed.</i>

63
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,807
<i>Face down.</i>

64
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,039
<i>Should I take this off
so it doesn't get wet?</i>

65
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,189
What--? What is that?

66
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,319
l can get you a hundred copies
by the morning.

67
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,849
Make it 25.

68
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,182
Sales are slow.

69
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,020
Same old shit. lt's getting old.

70
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,525
Are you kidding me?

71
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,697
Look at her.

72
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,732
What you have here is classic.

73
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,569
Twenty-five.

74
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,848
-What's going on?
-We have a problem.

75
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,076
-Reece!
-This guy--

76
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:50,058
-What's the problem?
-lt's nothing we can't handle.

77
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,127
Jesus.

78
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,401
What the hell is this? This shit real?

79
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,066
Oh, yeah.

80
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,707
Damn.

81
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,643
Where's this guy here?
Right-- That dude.

82
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,984
We have no idea what to do with him.

83
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,241
Did he know her?

84
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,948
Who's the lady?

85
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,551
She must have killed herself
when l checked in.

86
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,692
You in the habit
of murdering strange women?

87
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,130
We got it all on video.

88
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,562
All of it. Everything.

89
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:45,366
Just my luck, huh?
A couple of peeping Toms.

90
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,691
Should we call the cops?

91
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:07,161
<i>This is.... This is a murder scene.</i>

92
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,665
You call the cops, all right,
they start asking questions.

93
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,997
You run the risk
of exposing your operation.

94
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,805
We could kill him.

95
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,379
We yank the camera.

96
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,051
We heard screams,
but we couldn't get there in time.

97
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:31,279
-Or you could untie me.
-What was that?

98
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,390
You could untie me.

99
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,885
Put my skills to use.

100
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,936
<i>You've got a....</i>

101
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:54,144
You've got a setup here.
lt's a real moneymaker.

102
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,582
Nobody buys porn anymore.

103
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,413
<i>But killing....</i>

104
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,887
Killing is different, you know.

105
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,115
Watching somebody die...

106
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:12,354
...l mean, that's rare. lt's valuable.

107
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,862
We could work together.

108
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:24,672
We could sell 1 0,000 copies easy.

109
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,653
Well, you know...

110
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,796
...there is a market
for this type of deal.

111
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,802
As soon as we untie him
he's gonna take off.

112
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:56,031
Getting paid to kill. What better deal
am l gonna get than that?

113
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,709
Who said anything
about getting paid?

114
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:03,210
Well, l am doing the dirty work.
l get equal cut.

115
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,543
You got big demands
for a fella tied to a chair.

116
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,448
Equal.

117
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,551
Otherwise, wrap me up with her
when you're finished.

118
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,151
Give me the knife.

119
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:07,406
Gordon, what's to keep him
from wrapping us up in plastic?

120
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,352
You get out of line...

121
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:23,020
...someone anonymously drops
that tape off to the police.

122
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,691
He's gonna have another copy,
so if something happens to us...

123
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,497
...well, he'll take care of the rest.

124
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,634
Now, let's get something straight.

125
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,768
l run the show here.

126
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,372
l wouldn't have it any other way.

127
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,091
Are you sure about this?

128
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,890
lf it doesn't work,
empty your shotgun into him.

129
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:11,132
Let's shut down for a few days.
Get everything in order.

130
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,648
Let's go bury
our first star someplace.

131
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,353
Eight hundred miles.

132
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,328
lt's a long way from home.

133
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,232
Home is where the heart is, Caleb.

134
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,963
Don't you ever forget that.

135
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,338
l thought you were serious.
l was about to jump out.

136
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,876
Don't do that. They might not
find your body out here for weeks.

137
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,855
This was a mistake.

138
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,051
You're over-thinking again.
Everything is gonna be fine.

139
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,526
l mean, what if your father
doesn't like me?

140
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,029
Why would he not like you?
You're almost perfect.

141
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,363
-Almost?
-Yeah.

142
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,336
Yeah, everything except for
that weird sideburn defect you have.

143
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,542
-Hey, my sideburns.
-They're never even.

144
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,543
You don't know the difference between
a socket and crescent wrench.

145
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,877
<i>And there's that little issue of you
stealing his only daughter away, but....</i>

146
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,918
-l'm sure it'll be fine.
-Oh, Jesus.

147
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,847
This is such a mistake.

148
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,028
Yes, this is a mistake! So turn back.

149
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,697
Go back now, dude.
Let's just go back. Let's go home.

150
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,732
You promised you were gonna be
sleeping the rest of the way.

151
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,369
How can l sleep
when my best friend is about to...

152
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,664
...disappears into
the Virginia wilderness?

153
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,205
-lt's North Carolina.
-Same difference.

154
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:29,608
All outhouses and corn bread
and damn AM radio.

155
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,046
-You're an idiot, you know that?
-That's irrelevant.

156
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,118
l bet you that at some time
during your youth out here...

157
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,448
...your old man taught you
how to hunt.

158
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,888
Didn't he? Come on, tell the truth.
l know you know how to hunt.

159
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,494
Right? Come on, didn't he?

160
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,994
Hunting does not
make somebody a hillbilly.

161
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,632
l knew it.
l told you, what'd l tell you?

162
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,161
Why are you even here?

163
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,339
To help my boy Caleb
with all this shit back here, remember?

164
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,305
Because you're not supposed to do any
heavy lifting in your present condition.

165
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,272
Reason number 2 7 why Daddy's
not gonna think you're perfect, dude.

166
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,451
He's just messing with you.

167
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,483
Tell her you're just fucking around.

168
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:13,021
-l am just fucking around, man.
-Thanks.

169
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,122
So, what's our ETA into Hooterville?

170
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,459
A few more hours, Tanner.

171
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,596
Well, l'm not the smartest guy, but it
might not be the best first impression...

172
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,934
...waking up the family
at 3 in the morning.

173
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:35,740
-What do you think, Jess?
-Whatever you want, babe.

174
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:41,151
lt'd give me a chance to shower.
Even out these sideburns.

175
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,546
You know what?

176
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,747
You're right.

177
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,952
lt's going to be perfect.

178
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,994
Meadow View, great.

179
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,833
Add it to the list of other
high-class motels we passed.

180
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,737
Prairie View, River View,
Mountain View.

181
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,775
Somebody should come up
with Titty View.

182
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,379
Now, that is a joint
l wouldn't mind staying in.

183
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,550
That sounds nice. Titty View.

184
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,950
You have to make it so easy
for her to see you're an idiot?

185
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,090
-What?
-Stop trying to press her buttons.

186
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,885
lt's hard not to, dude. There's just
so many damn buttons to push.

187
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,296
Hey. Tanner's just pissed
because l'm leaving.

188
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,091
All right? Don't worry about it.

189
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,461
We've been hanging out
since the first grade.

190
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,466
l'm like the only friend he's got.

191
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,831
That's a shocker.

192
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,065
Why don't you remind him
that you guys aren't 8 anymore?

193
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,440
Meadow View.

194
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,482
Hello?

195
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,782
Hello?

196
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,863
Sorry for the wait.

197
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,661
A little too much iced tea tonight.

198
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,935
No problem.
We're just looking to grab a room.

199
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,473
Oh, we have some of those.

200
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,642
lt's for the two of you?

201
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:53,182
The couples' rate is 49 a night.
lncludes air and cable.

202
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,949
-Well, we actually need--
-No, that's it. Sounds good.

203
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,333
Where are you folks moving from?

204
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,837
The trailer.

205
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,405
Oh, yeah. Chicago.

206
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,172
We're on our way to Beulah.
That's where my family's from.

207
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,315
Oh, you're not far now.
lt's beautiful, very peaceful.

208
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,510
Feels like you're in
the middle of nowhere.

209
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,519
-Great.
-So you're in room 6.

210
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,190
Just down near the end.

211
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,552
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

212
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,351
l hope you enjoy your stay.

213
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:41,054
And if you need anything,
don't hesitate to scream.

214
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,375
So we get to have a room
with Tanner again.

215
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:55,171
We'll stick him on the floor.
lt's only for a couple hours.

216
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,714
Where'd he go now?

217
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,018
We didn't pass any bars
coming in, did we?

218
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:12,322
No, not that l saw. But he has, like,
a special radar for those places.

219
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,054
Fuck him, he'll find us.

220
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:31,042
Oh, God. See that squirrel?

221
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,284
That was gross.

222
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:54,093
Oh, my God. What a mess.

223
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,865
lt'll be fine.
We'll fix it when we get there.

224
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,804
Yeah.

225
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:05,045
You up for a little dip before bed?

226
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,773
lt's all yours. Go first.

227
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,886
The least we could do
is grab the squirrel for your dad.

228
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,387
Save him having to
hunt down lunch tomorrow.

229
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,149
l'll tell him that you said that.

230
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,294
Did l mention he's 6'5''
and used to box?

231
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,953
-Oh, that's it. You're going in.
-No, Caleb! No, no, no!

232
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,909
This is actually pretty nice.

233
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,978
Yeah, it's not bad.

234
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:47,281
Better tell Tanner not to make
a big entrance when he shows up.

235
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:52,960
-l got nothing.
-Yeah, me either.

236
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,155
lt's the middle of nowhere.

237
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,166
Why do you need to call him anyway?
He'll find us. He always does.

238
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,497
Let's hurry.

239
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,800
We don't want to waste
what little privacy we've got.

240
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,150
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing?

241
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:17,617
We'll get cell-phone reception
as soon as we get into town, l promise.

242
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:22,155
No, l'm talking about
everything else.

243
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,524
Living around your family,
me working for your father.

244
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,594
Chicago's not going
anywhere, Caleb.

245
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,070
And if you're not happy,
we'll go back.

246
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,468
What if you're happy?

247
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,667
l won't be. Not if you're not.

248
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,718
''lf you need anything, just scream''?

249
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,180
What?

250
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,057
Didn't it seem like
a weird thing for that guy to say?

251
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:01,161
l don't know, it's the same as,
''lf you need anything, just yell.''

252
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,867
Scream is different.

253
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,502
You're over-thinking again.

254
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,345
Sexy.

255
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,858
What is that?

256
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,293
l don't know.

257
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,366
Shit!

258
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,906
There's nobody out there.

259
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,446
-Shit!
-Caleb, wait!

260
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,454
Fuck! Caleb!

261
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,817
Caleb, open the door, man. Shit!

262
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,050
What the hell are you doing?

263
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,321
Counting the broken bones in my hand.
What's the matter with you?

264
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,989
l gave you the whole big warning knock
and everything. Shit!

265
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,460
-We didn't know who it was.
-Well, who else would it be, man?

266
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,332
Man, l think you gave me
a concussion too. Don't touch.

267
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,066
How did you get in there?

268
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,142
There was an open window
in the back.

269
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,109
So you just decided to crawl in?

270
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,442
lt's not like there was anybody else
in there. Saves me the price.

271
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,079
-You're just gonna sleep in there?
-Better than sleeping in here.

272
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,849
l can't get a good night's rest
listening to you two cuddle all night.

273
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,152
l'm gonna take a shower
before he gets us all kicked out.

274
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,828
You do that.

275
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,826
See? What'd l tell you?

276
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,972
She always getting pissed
about something.

277
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,936
l wonder why.

278
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:56,641
But that's how your life's
gonna be from now on.

279
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,041
God bless you.

280
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:02,276
Spending 1 0 hours a day selling rakes
in her old man's hardware store.

281
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:06,047
And don't forget, dinner with
the in-laws, huh? That'll be fun.

282
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,227
She'll get pissed because you don't
really like Mom's jerky and pinto beans.

283
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,727
Not exactly the dream life
we always talked about, dude.

284
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,959
But, you know, maybe you'll like
turning into Daniel Boone.

285
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,137
Yeah, or just keep hanging out
at Wrigley and getting drunk...

286
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,537
Yeah, or just keep hanging out
at Wrigley and getting drunk...

287
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,503
<i>...at North Side bars until we're 50.</i>

288
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:28,509
We're about to go in and that son
of a bitch started banging on the door.

289
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,409
He must have snuck in the back.

290
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,575
We gotta put up some exterior cameras
so this does not happen again.

291
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,084
What do you want to do
with this bunch?

292
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,425
We hold off.

293
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,659
lt's just too risky with three.

294
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,330
Where's Smith at?

295
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,399
He's still out there.
He's keeping an eye on things.

296
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,838
<i>-Hey, come on.
-This shit is hard as hell.</i>

297
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,752
Hey. Hey!

298
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,857
Hey. Gordon says
we're a no-go for tonight.

299
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,536
Why?

300
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,731
ln case you didn't notice, there's
three of them in there instead of two.

301
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,873
Hey! Hey!

302
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,348
Did you hear me?

303
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,249
Gordon says to call it off.

304
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,424
No, listen to me.
Gordon calls the shots around here.

305
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,759
l don't need anyone
to tell me how to do this.

306
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,934
Try to get a non-smoking room.

307
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,282
How are you, sir?

308
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,283
lt's a long day of driving?

309
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:20,014
Very. My wife and l are looking for
a soft bed if you got one.

310
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,488
Afraid we don't. Not tonight.

311
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:27,453
We're doing a little maintenance
on the place. Sort of like a remodel.

312
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,257
Really?

313
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:35,470
You might wanna turn that off, then.
Save folks the trouble.

314
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:39,131
That's totally my fault.
l'll get to that soon enough.

315
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,971
You know,
there's the Alpine Motor Lodge...

316
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,944
...just down the road.
lt's about a 20-minute drive.

317
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:51,045
Come on in, l'll call them for you.
See what they got open.

318
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,144
l'm just checking to see if you have any
rooms available tonight.

319
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:24,480
-Non-smoking.
-Oh, and no smoking if possible.

320
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,054
l'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

321
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:35,195
Well, hopefully this other place
will take us in.

322
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,714
Oh, that sounds good.

323
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,357
Lucky l got something for you.

324
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,692
We should be up and ready
in a couple days...

325
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:14,497
...so if you need a place to stay
on your way back, come on by.

326
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,267
l'll give you our special room
for half off.

327
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,604
Why aren't we staying here?

328
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,041
l already found another place.

329
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,430
What in the hell were you two doing?

330
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,263
He wouldn't listen to me.
l told him you called it off.

331
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,631
He was gonna kill them.

332
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,434
When l say a plan has changed,
the plan has changed.

333
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,770
-What's the fucking difference?
-All--!

334
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,072
All it takes is for one to get away.

335
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,272
Now, no one's going anywhere.

336
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,077
But if you're getting
a little squeamish...

337
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,311
...just say so.

338
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,438
-Get out.
-That's all l can--

339
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,372
l'm kind of tired.

340
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,081
Well, l guess back to my free room.

341
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,150
Better hope nobody
walks in over there.

342
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,949
Not unless it's the
Squirrel Creek Community College...

343
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,648
...cheerleading bus showing up.

344
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,855
All right. Good night, Tanner.

345
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,860
l really don't like him,
you know that?

346
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,397
Why didn't you
say something earlier?

347
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,170
lt's just one more day, okay?

348
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,865
Come on.

349
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,143
Are you sure you're tired?

350
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,391
Not funny.

351
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,095
-Jesus!
-What the hell you doing, man?

352
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,602
Normally l wouldn't stop
a good porno flick.

353
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,105
-Can you please get out?
-l'm the good guy, okay?

354
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,335
Listen to me, all right?

355
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,412
l'm not the only one
watching you two.

356
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,275
-What?
-What are you talking about?

357
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,213
Caleb, come here. Come here, man.

358
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,322
-Look at this.
-What is this?

359
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,458
l don't know, but it sure as hell
ain't pay-per-view.

360
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,854
Caleb, what are you doing?

361
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,665
He's watching us.

362
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,995
<i>What? Who's watching us?</i>

363
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,171
<i>-And that's that.
-Who's watching us?</i>

364
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,771
<i>The guy up in the office.</i>

365
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,101
<i>He's got cameras all over this room.</i>

366
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,504
<i>-Are you serious?
-Yes, he is, darling.</i>

367
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,772
lf we're gonna do this,
you better get there before they bolt.

368
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:19,946
Let's do this fast.

369
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,119
-We go in and out, yeah?
-Hold on.

370
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,853
Look how scared she looks.

371
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,190
-l like watching them squirm.
-They'll take off.

372
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,622
No, we won't let them,
but Smith's right.

373
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,327
We shouldn't be
in such a hurry to finish.

374
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,764
Let's play with them for a while.

375
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,302
What the hell are you doing?

376
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,904
Wanna scare them?

377
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,805
Let's scare them.

378
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,177
<i>How do you know he's watching us?</i>

379
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:03,254
l saw your ass, but once l knew
it was yours, l stopped looking.

380
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,191
l turned it off almost immediately.

381
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,100
<i>I knew I'd find you two together.</i>

382
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:15,031
<i>If I hadn't, Elsa, I might have gone on
playing it your way.</i>

383
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,707
There's nothing on here.

384
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,275
lt might be one of those perv joints
where you can check in...

385
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,447
...and watch the action
in the other room.

386
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,940
-l'm going over to kick that fucker's ass.
-No, the dude's watching us.

387
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,245
He knows we found the cameras.

388
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,786
You go there, the dude's
waiting with a shotgun...

389
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,821
...and some fucking K-Y Jelly.

390
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,754
We call the cops and wait for them.

391
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,452
Dude, the sheriff's probably
his cousin or something.

392
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,925
Call the cops, they show up,
we get corn-holed.

393
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,600
Fuck that idea, let's just go.

394
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,694
We're leaving, right?

395
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,106
-Assholes!
-Caleb, let's just go.

396
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,942
Dude, like always, your beautiful
fiancée's dead-on. Come on, dude.

397
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,049
Caleb, get in the car.

398
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,720
-Now!
-Come on, dude.

399
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,121
Shit.

400
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,564
l'm telling the cops
soon as we get back.

401
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,926
Whatever, man,
let's just get the hell out of here.

402
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,298
-What?
-You've got to be kidding me.

403
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,567
Fuck.

404
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,371
-You leave the light on or something?
-No.

405
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:35,016
Great. You gonna go ask
Norman Bates for a jump or should l?

406
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,588
l know l didn't leave
the lights on, okay?

407
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,419
What the fuck is that?

408
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,595
They're headlights. lt's a truck.

409
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,196
-Shit. Come on, Tanner. Come with me.
-What are you doing?

410
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,602
-Fuck!
-Caleb, get back inside. Get back.

411
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,468
Go out the other side!
Go, go, go! Go!

412
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,476
Shit!

413
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,548
l'm calling the cops, man.

414
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,283
Oh, my God!

415
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,461
Damn! l can't get a signal!
Shit, this is not funny anymore.

416
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,893
Oh, my God. What is he doing?

417
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,932
Can you all scream
a little louder for me?

418
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,363
l'll fucking kill you!

419
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,868
l seriously doubt that, Caleb.

420
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,901
-Fuck!
-Where is he going?

421
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,667
Maybe to get a better view.

422
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,402
-A better fucking view of what?
-Where is he going?

423
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,876
Oh, shit!

424
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,445
-We have to get out.
-Where are we gonna go?

425
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,385
-Fuck!
-Hey!

426
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,323
Go, go!

427
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:04,333
Come on. Come on. Come here.

428
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:07,840
This has gone way past some porn
video. What the fuck is happening?

429
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:11,014
-They tried to kill us.
-They could have if they wanted to.

430
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:14,046
-They're just trying to scare us.
-No.

431
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,486
They're not just trying to scare us.
This is more than that.

432
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:21,054
They wouldn't go through that
if they planned on letting us walk.

433
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,691
Oh, my God. He said your name.

434
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,794
What? What?

435
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,393
You didn't say your name
when we checked in.

436
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,433
Oh, my God.

437
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,368
They can hear us.

438
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,943
All right, you guys.
You guys, come on. Come on.

439
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,613
Tanner, grab the door.

440
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,916
All right, so, what else did we say?

441
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,522
Who gives a shit? lt's not like there's
gonna be a pop quiz at the end.

442
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,885
We told him that we were
coming from Chicago.

443
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,391
We're on our way to Beulah.

444
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,966
He knows we don't know anybody here,
or where to run for help.

445
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,965
Caleb, it doesn't matter where we run,
let's just run.

446
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,735
-l need to get to the trailer.
-Fuck that. Let's just go.

447
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:13,841
Jessica's right.
They're not gonna let us run out.

448
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:17,104
Yeah, but they're not gonna
just let us sit in here either.

449
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,271
We need something to fight with.

450
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,951
There's a bunch of stuff
in the back of the trailer.

451
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,154
There's kitchen stuff, knives, tools--

452
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:28,085
No, no, no. l like our chances
better if we just run.

453
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,295
How did you say
you got in here again?

454
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,294
There was an open window
in the bathroom.

455
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,130
But you told us that in our room.

456
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,698
They must have heard you.

457
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:49,835
Maybe not. lt's worth a shot anyway.
Come on.

458
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,844
Let's go.

459
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,282
You guys stay.

460
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,065
All right, Tanner.
You go first, then Jess.

461
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,141
We don't know
what's out there, man.

462
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,974
We know what's gonna be in here
in a second. Now, let's go. Come on.

463
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,882
Careful.

464
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,435
Easy does it. Easy does it.

465
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,069
No!

466
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,767
Run, Jess!

467
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,339
No! Caleb!

468
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:56,772
Caleb! Caleb!

469
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,844
-We have to go back!
-You can't!

470
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,277
-They'll grab you too!
-No!

471
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,508
Come on. Come on.

472
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,081
-Hold him.
-No! Caleb!

473
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,950
-Tie him. Tie him.
-No!

474
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,248
Where'd they take him?

475
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,688
Caleb! Caleb!

476
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,560
-Caleb!
-What about them?

477
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,464
They won't run. Not yet anyway.

478
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:24,231
-Caleb! Caleb!
-Not while he's still alive.

479
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,237
Jess!

480
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,439
Caleb!

481
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:34,115
No! Caleb!

482
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:37,912
-How many do you see?
-l don't know. l think there's two. Caleb!

483
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,055
-What are they doing?
-Stay here.

484
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,780
Keep banging. Keep banging.

485
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,620
-Where are you going?
-They'll think we're both here.

486
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,886
Caleb!

487
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,599
No!

488
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,067
No!

489
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,568
No! They're killing him!

490
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:23,594
-Caleb! Caleb!
-Oh, my God.

491
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,324
No!

492
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,261
-They're out here.
-Come on! Come on!

493
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,938
Don't let them
make it out of the trees.

494
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,979
And make sure to get it on camera!

495
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,061
-No. l can't do this.
-No, they'll kill you. Come on.

496
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,394
We have to go back for him.
He would go back.

497
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,902
Listen. Listen to me.
We cannot go back, okay?

498
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,074
We just have to get to the cops.

499
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,741
You see anything?

500
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,309
Oh, shit. Come on.

501
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,785
What was that? l heard something.

502
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,696
Okay, let's go.

503
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,162
Shit.

504
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,667
Shit.

505
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,775
Reece!

506
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,847
-Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
-Come on.

507
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,244
Stop moving!

508
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:21,207
Tanner, Tanner, come on. Come on.
Are you okay? Come on.

509
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,102
Where'd they go?

510
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,609
Where did they go?

511
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,644
Oh, Jesus Christ.

512
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,251
l told you we should've waited.

513
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,287
The chase is half the fun.

514
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,519
We're gonna go this way.
You take the road.

515
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,492
No, no, no. l know these woods.

516
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,165
-Me and Reece--
-Take the road.

517
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,597
You, move. Let's go.

518
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,803
Come on!

519
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,680
What are you doing?

520
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,651
Maybe we should just hide
until daylight.

521
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,550
-See where we're going.
-No, l am not waiting here.

522
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,385
There'll be cars in the morning.
Somebody will help us.

523
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,222
l don't care. l'm not waiting here
while Caleb is there.

524
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,829
-Caleb is dead, okay?
-Fuck you!

525
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,728
You don't know that.

526
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,827
You don't know that.

527
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,635
Yes, l do know that.

528
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,869
And you know too.

529
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:00,843
l'm sorry.

530
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,853
Let's just keep going, okay?

531
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,160
Let's keep going. Let's go.

532
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,327
Let's keep going.

533
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,510
Over there. Over there.

534
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,564
-Somebody!
-Hello?

535
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,029
Hello? Please help us.

536
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,259
-Over here.
-Hello?

537
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,735
-Somebody?
-Please.

538
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,601
Hello?

539
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,900
Hey, Tanner! Tanner.

540
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,573
-We need your help.
-What do you think you're doing?

541
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,615
-Men were trying to kill us.
-What men?

542
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,878
One of them works at the motel.
Meadow View.

543
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:13,988
The Meadow View?
Why would they do that?

544
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,058
-We don't know why the fuck--
-You watch your mouth, son.

545
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,787
-You are disturbing a Christian home.
-Sorry, there's somebody out here--

546
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:23,625
No. No, no, listen.
No, listen, he's sorry, okay?

547
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,835
We need to use your phone
to call police.

548
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,333
Like we're gonna let strangers
into our house.

549
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,335
-How stupid do you think we are?
-Otis.

550
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:33,474
For all we know, this is an act
to get in here and rob us.

551
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,473
We don't give a fuck about
the shit in your house.

552
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,306
Be quiet, okay? Be quiet. Listen.

553
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:41,779
You could call them yourselves.
Please, just call the police. Okay?

554
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,917
All right, but you go on
and get off the porch.

555
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,090
Okay. Okay.

556
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,127
-Hillbilly.
-Don't say anything else, okay, please?

557
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,126
They could turn off
the damn spotlight.

558
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,765
Okay, just shut up. Come here.

559
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,173
-Shit.
-Oh, God.

560
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,975
You two. Hey, hey.

561
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:16,516
Why don't you wait inside
until the sheriff comes?

562
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,822
Doris, what the hell are you doing?

563
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,019
Jesus would let these two in here.

564
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,892
But he knows if they slit his throat,
he'd be back.

565
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:33,000
-Otis, that is blasphemy.
-And this here is crazy.

566
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:36,502
Oh, l don't know what you're
worried about. You're trifling.

567
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,698
Honey, why don't you come in the back
and have some coffee?

568
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:43,902
-No, it's okay.
-Nonsense. Come on.

569
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:51,620
Let's go, son. Come on.

570
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,884
How much longer do you think?

571
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,825
Don't know. We're a long ways out.

572
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,660
Time enough to tell me
what brought you two our way.

573
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:08,064
-We told you, the guys from the motel--
-l was asking her.

574
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,441
We were on our way to Beulah,
that's where l'm from.

575
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,377
Lot of good people in Beulah.
What's your family's name?

576
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:24,553
-Pruitt.
-Not Jack and Sarah Pruitt?

577
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,288
Sounds like the sheriff.

578
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:34,460
-What if it's not?
-Oh, l'm sure it is. Otis, go get him.

579
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:41,264
There's nothing to worry about, honey.
Not anymore.

580
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,381
Christ, what's taking them
so long, huh?

581
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,813
They're probably talking about
what happened, that's all. Otis.

582
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,713
Bring them back here, Otis.

583
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,980
There's been a change.
Gordon'll take them.

584
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,588
-No!
-That's fucking them!

585
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:06,057
-The guys we were telling you about!
-l appreciate you calling me, Otis.

586
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:07,888
These are the two who robbed us.

587
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,760
What? No, he's lying!
They're the ones that killed Caleb!

588
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,594
Hold on, now. Who's he?

589
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:16,101
-Christ, can we just do this?
-He just-- He works for me, Doris.

590
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,901
ls that right? Why don't you tell me
what it is you say they stole?

591
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,237
What's it matter?
Gordon said they robbed him.

592
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,969
l take his word over strangers.

593
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:26,112
That fella there,
he's a stranger to me.

594
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,580
Call the sheriff. Call him, Otis.

595
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,412
Gordon.

596
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,485
You know what?
You guys held him for us.

597
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,587
That's more than enough. We'll take--

598
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:38,084
-We don't have time for this shit.
-Now, Otis.

599
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,228
No! Shit! No!

600
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:44,123
-What the hell are you doing?!
-Cleaning up my mess.

601
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,028
No!

602
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,667
Otis trusts me.

603
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,635
She would've called the sheriff.

604
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,434
-Let's run.
-Where do you think you're going?

605
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,803
He shot twice.
He doesn't have any shells.

606
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:58,978
Go! Go! Get them!

607
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,352
No!

608
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,355
No! No!

609
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,961
No!

610
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,357
No!

611
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:22,398
No! No!

612
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:47,723
Do it. Shit.

613
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:55,905
We need to find a phone.
Look for a phone, Jessica.

614
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:57,902
There's no phone!

615
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,609
There's a car, there's a car!

616
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,244
Go, go, go!

617
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,754
Jessica, come on!

618
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,600
Come on. Come on.
lt's right over here. Come on.

619
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,704
No, no. Shit! Fuck!

620
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,038
Tanner, look out! No!

621
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,115
-l got them!
-No!

622
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,446
-l got them!
-Get off me!

623
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,990
Start filming.

624
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,267
Please!

625
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:00,868
They'll find those bodies...

626
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:04,403
...so let's make sure
they don't find anything of ours.

627
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:08,475
Go on. Go on. Make it look like
a fucked-up burglary. Go on!

628
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,374
Here. Give me that.

629
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,079
Move.

630
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,480
Move!

631
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,280
Go!

632
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:35,935
This moviemaking shit
is a lot harder than it looks.

633
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,167
Please.

634
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,713
l can't breathe.

635
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:12,573
What happened?

636
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,936
He murdered them both.

637
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,137
What are we gonna do, Gordon?

638
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,376
Go!

639
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,698
-Haul his ass to the truck.
-No.

640
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,837
l'll take care of her. Come on.

641
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,707
No, no, no!

642
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,720
No!

643
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:40,295
<i>No! No!</i>

644
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,795
<i>-No!
-Well, time to go back to work.</i>

645
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,298
Are you sitting this one out too?

646
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,842
You've done the rest on your own.
Might as well make it a clean sweep.

647
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,979
Well, it makes me wonder
what l need you two for.

648
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,415
Let's have some fun.

649
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,355
l don't like this anymore, Gordon.

650
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,963
What are we gonna do?

651
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,602
<i>No!</i>

652
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,802
No!

653
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,271
No!

654
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,324
We'll just let it play out.

655
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,628
l mean, he's the only one
who's killed anyone tonight.

656
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,357
We'll wait till the time's right
and we'll pin the whole thing on him.

657
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:55,366
-What are you two talking about?
-Nothing.

658
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,374
Not that either of you
have got the balls to use it.

659
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:04,506
lf you start getting a brave feeling...

660
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:08,114
...l'd be real careful.

661
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:25,897
You enjoy your nap?

662
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,334
Why, you looked like
a little angel sleeping there.

663
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,773
l'm gonna try something
a little different this time.

664
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:48,790
Unless you can
convince me different.

665
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:59,064
Wait, wait, wait.

666
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,713
You remind me of a girl
l picked up in Tulsa.

667
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,586
Or Little Rock. l can't remember.

668
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:29,454
Wish l got to know her better.

669
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,801
She had the damnedest scream.

670
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,806
Almost made my ears bleed.

671
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:47,441
l wonder what you sound like.

672
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,226
Get over there!

673
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,990
You bitch!

674
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,668
-Shit!
-Get in here, you fucking bitch!

675
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,493
Fuck!

676
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,457
Fuck!

677
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,832
Fuck. Fuck.

678
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,501
Get her! Get the fucking gun!

679
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,463
-Maybe we should--
-Go get her!

680
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,527
Where is she?

681
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,598
Find her.

682
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,736
Find her!

683
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,372
Caleb.

684
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,271
Caleb.

685
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,178
Caleb.

686
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,550
You have to be quiet.

687
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,853
Jessica.

688
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,526
Just keep looking up here, okay?

689
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:19,238
Tanner.

690
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:22,908
Tanner.

691
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:18,839
Shit.

692
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,770
Shit.

693
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,883
Reece!

694
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,899
Stupid asshole.

695
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:09,264
Reece!

696
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:29,210
Hello, angel.

697
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,033
No!

698
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:49,730
No!

699
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:53,038
No! No!

700
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:13,690
Shit!

701
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,821
Back off! No!

702
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:19,898
No! No!

703
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:47,853
Shit!

704
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,210
Please. Stop.

705
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,145
Please stop!

706
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:55,357
Sheriff, somebody tore the shit
out of this place.

707
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:58,862
-Well, she said there were cameras.
-They're not here anymore.

708
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:02,264
Yeah, no bodies either.
You get ahold of the owner?

709
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,467
Yeah. Lives in Florida.

710
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:07,938
Says Gordon Jenks
runs the business for him.

711
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:12,102
l know Gordon.
Seems decent enough.

712
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:15,977
Not if you buy the girl's story. Do you?

713
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:18,812
All l'm buying
is some folks are dead.

714
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:24,153
Sure would make it easier if we could
find out what happened to her friends.

715
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,841
So how many do you want?

716
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,738
As many as you can make me.

717
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,413
l'll start burning some copies.

718
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:50,550
How long before
you can have a new one?

719
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:52,344
A few weeks.

720
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:56,319
Just as soon
as l get the place fixed up...

721
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:58,686
...put the cameras in...

722
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,763
...we'll be open for business.

723
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,726
All right.

724
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:10,127
