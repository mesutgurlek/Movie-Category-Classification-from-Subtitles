One minute it's hot, the
next minute it's cold...

You know, the weather is crazy
though. I hope it doesn't rain today.

What if something happens to your phone?

188
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:08,615
That's what I got my boy for. Photographic
memory, keen sense of direction,

Oh and hey, Please don't hide
from my bother tonight, ok?

00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:18,391
I don't hide from him, I just
don't think he's ever uh...

Ok, gross! You cannot say that!

195

I think I recall me hooking up with you...

Either way, it was the
end of the dynamic duo.

And which one of you was the Boy Wonder?

Yeah, I love you. Bye.

Have fun you guys, Ok?

- See you guys later, be safe!
- Be good.

203
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:44,084
Come on, let's get there early, maybe
we can catch a little batting practice?

You think David Wright is
gonna hit a homer today?

205

Maybe, he's been roping them lately.

206

Do you remember what
you promised this time?

207

Alright alright, I'm turning
it off. No more work, alright?

All play all day. Me and
you. Let's go. Come on.

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,702
We have some new developments
right now on a 747 that made an

210
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:05,605
emergency landing at
JFK airport this morning.

211
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,574
It happened at 7:33.

212
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,910
We're told it was a Santa
Mira Airlines flight 209.

213
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,646
Reports that we're getting
say it hit turbulence

214
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:16,616
on it's decent, and that
a passenger actually aided

215
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,119
in the safe landing of that plane.

216
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,621
The plane flew into some
kind of crazy weather pattern.

217
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,356
And a shark got sucked up into the engine.

218

Reporter: That's hard to believe.

219

Hard to believe that a storm
bigger than anything you've ever

220
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,095
seen before is about to hit
Manhattan? Well guess what?

221
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,210
It's about to happen, so here's the deal...

222
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:33,032
You need to lock down the city.

223
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,602
You need to call the Mayor and have
him put the National Guard on alert.

224
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:38,671
Get helicopters in the air with firebombs
so they can throw them into the tornado.

225
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,640
Ok, I can see you're upset...

226

I'm not crazy.

227
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,077
You gotta alert the city.

228
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,392
The people have to know the
truth before it happens again.

00:47:02,225 --> 00:47:06,628
A shark storm similar to the one that tore
through the Los Angeles region last year.

809
00:47:06,663 --> 00:47:07,963
And Al has more details.

810
00:47:07,997 --> 00:47:12,434
Matt, these-these Sharknadoes
are actually a rare anomaly.

811
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:16,271
While they've been isolated reports in the
past of marine life actually being sucked

812
00:47:16,306 --> 00:47:21,043
into storms. A Sharknado is much
more powerful and a lot more deadly.

813
00:47:21,077 --> 00:47:24,012
I mentioned Los Angeles last
year. Anything learned by the

814
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:26,682
situation there that New
Yorkers need to know now?

815
00:47:26,716 --> 00:47:31,053
You've got to avoid going near one at
all cost. They're very unpredictable.

816
00:47:31,087 --> 00:47:35,190
Think of it this way this
is a twister with teeth.

817
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:36,658
Enough said.

818
00:47:36,693 --> 00:47:39,228
Enough said indeed,
Al. Thank you very much.

- Come on!

967
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:43,257
You alright, buddy?

968
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,892
Ben, you should do it.

969
00:56:45,427 --> 00:56:46,460
Ah.

970
00:56:46,995 --> 00:56:47,995
Wait.

971
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:53,901
Move it! Move it! Move it!

972
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:58,472
Whooooaaa.

973
00:56:58,506 --> 00:56:59,573
You can do it Ben.

974
00:56:59,607 --> 00:57:02,409
But only one of my legs is real.

975
00:57:03,511 --> 00:57:04,978
- Come on!
- Let's go Ben!

976
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:07,014
Keep your head up and
you'll get to keep it.

977
00:57:07,482 --> 00:57:08,916
You got this!

978
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,652
Hook's on the other side.
Keep your legs up!

979
00:57:11,686 --> 00:57:13,487
- I can do this.
- You can do it!

980
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:15,756
Hold on Ben! Hold on!

981
00:57:16,624 --> 00:57:17,558
Ben!

982
00:57:17,592 --> 00:57:20,294
Oh no!

983
00:57:20,328 --> 00:57:23,597
Oh!

984
00:57:32,941 --> 00:57:35,142
We'll try to find another rope!

985
00:57:35,176 --> 00:57:37,144
There's no time.

986
00:57:40,682 --> 00:57:42,683
[Together] Frogger.

987
00:57:44,953 --> 00:57:46,353
Yah!

988
00:57:48,189 --> 00:57:50,357
- Yes!
- Nice, Nice! You got it!

989
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:54,270
You know what you just did, don't ya?

990
00:57:54,295 --> 00:57:56,029
Don't say it.

991
00:57:56,064 --> 00:57:57,965
He jumped the shark.

992
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:59,800
Let's get outta here. Come on! Let's go!

993
00:57:59,834 --> 00:58:01,435
Let's go! Come on!

994
00:58:01,469 --> 00:58:03,537
- Ellen! Mora!
- Mom!

995
00:58:03,571 --> 00:58:05,139
Concierge: Can I help you?

996
00:58:05,173 --> 00:58:06,907
No one else is here.

997
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,910
- We gotta go get her.
- Wait. Fin hold up.

998
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,146
Ellen is not the same
little girl you remember.

999
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:16,902
She's taken Martial Arts, she's run in
marathons. My wife kinda kicks ass...

1000
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:18,485
She'll get'em here.

1001
00:58:19,187 --> 00:58:20,587
Let's get to the roof. Come on.

1002
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,356
Hold up!

1003
00:58:22,657 --> 00:58:24,324
We'll go up to the roof.

1004
00:58:24,692 --> 00:58:25,926
You two wait here.

1005
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,529
You get killed, she'll kill me.

1006
00:58:28,897 --> 00:58:30,497
Come on. Let's go.

1007
00:58:30,532 --> 00:58:32,499
Be safe guys.

1008
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:52,445
So what's so bad about being famous?

1009
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,215
I was famous when I was a surfer.

1010
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:57,484
It cost me my family.

1011
00:58:57,551 --> 00:58:59,152
Because you were famous?

1012
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,688
Because I thought I was a star?

1013
00:59:01,756 --> 00:59:03,657
I thought I deserved
everything I was offered.

1014
00:59:03,724 --> 00:59:05,292
I was offered a lot.

1015
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,862
You saved a lot of people in L.A, Fin.

1016
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,597
You're uncomfortable with that?

1017
00:59:10,665 --> 00:59:12,365
It's different.

1018
00:59:12,433 --> 00:59:16,169
When you got girls in bikini's
screaming for you, it strokes your ego.

1019
00:59:16,237 --> 00:59:21,675
But when you got people thanking you
for saving their lives...[Sigh]

1020
00:59:21,742 --> 00:59:23,843
It's humbling.

1021
00:59:23,911 --> 00:59:28,782
The best thing that came out of that was
a chance to put my family back together.

1022
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:31,685
I can't risk screwing that up again.

1023
00:59:31,752 --> 00:59:33,753
If we'd married...

1024
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:37,123
I would have never let you screw that up.

1025
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:38,959
[Sigh]

1026
00:59:39,026 --> 00:59:43,596
To bad your father didn't think so.

1027
00:59:43,898 --> 00:59:45,632
It was a different time, Fin.

1028
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,134
[Under Breath] Yeah.

1029
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:53,139
And my daddy didn't love you.

1030
00:59:53,207 --> 00:59:55,342
I did.

1031
00:59:56,544 --> 00:59:59,212
And that's what should've mattered to you.

1032
01:00:01,215 --> 01:00:03,049
[Ding]

1033
01:00:07,455 --> 01:00:11,658
[Honking]

1034
01:00:14,328 --> 01:00:15,495
Polly come on!

1035
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:19,165
Keep going! Don't stop!
I'm ok. I'll catch up!

1036
01:00:19,934 --> 01:00:20,814
Come on baby!

1037
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:22,469
Polly come on!

1038
01:00:26,073 --> 01:00:28,108
Just keep going! I'll catch up!

1039
01:00:28,175 --> 01:00:29,676
Mora, this way!

1040
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:31,478
[Screaming]

1041
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,113
Polly! Come on!

1042
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:36,831
- We gotta get inside the hotel.
- [Mora Crying]

1043
01:00:36,832 --> 01:00:38,410
Let's go Mora! Come on!

1044
01:00:38,452 --> 01:00:39,986
Come on Mora!

1045
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:50,463
[Thunder]

1046
01:00:50,531 --> 01:00:51,731
Ellen: Martin!

1047
01:00:51,799 --> 01:00:53,800
- Mora!
- Mom!

1048
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:55,735
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

1049
01:00:55,803 --> 01:00:57,537
Thank God.

1050
01:01:00,144 --> 01:01:01,384
I'm so glad you guys are here.

1051
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:02,876
Where's Fin? He said
he was going to get you?

1052
01:01:02,943 --> 01:01:04,344
He did. He's up on the roof.

1053
01:01:04,412 --> 01:01:05,278
He's on the roof?

1054
01:01:05,346 --> 01:01:06,346
Yep.

1055
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:07,894
He's doing something dangerous again.

1056
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:09,883
Of course he is. Fin does what Fin does.

1057
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,318
Didn't you try to stop him?

1058
01:01:12,386 --> 01:01:15,422
I did but wanted to make sure
that you two guys got here.

1059
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:19,125
I'm so glad you guys are here.

1060
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,661
[Ellen Crying]

1061
01:01:36,844 --> 01:01:38,445

[Thunder]

1067
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,545
We gotta work quick
before the twisters merge!

1068
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:19,919
You sure this is gonna work?

1069
01:02:24,225 --> 01:02:26,659
How are we gonna get
these into the storm?

1070
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,495
I gotcha.

1071
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:30,063
- Sling shot.
- Nice.

1072
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:32,632
Told you to trust me.

1073
01:02:37,976 --> 01:02:41,217
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where
you going Ellen? Where you going?

1074
01:02:41,242 --> 01:02:42,742
I'm going up there.

1075
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:45,145
Fin was very specific. We're not
supposed to get ourselves killed.

1076
01:02:45,212 --> 01:02:47,213
So it's ok for him, but it's not Ok for me?

1077
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:48,815
Mom!

1078
01:02:48,883 --> 01:02:50,416
Just stop.

1079
01:02:50,484 --> 01:02:52,886
- Mora: Stay here.
- Martin: Stay here.

1080
01:02:52,953 --> 01:02:54,354
Stay here.

1081
01:02:55,114 --> 01:02:56,726
We are now receiving reports that the

1082
01:02:56,752 --> 01:02:58,634
twisters from the rivers
are about to merge.

1083
01:02:58,659 --> 01:03:02,295
Apparently this will happen
right over the Bales Tower hotel.

1084
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,291
And Al, the big question is first of all,

1085
01:03:04,292 --> 01:03:06,925
what is drawing these
two twisters together?

1086
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:10,036
And I don't even want to ask but
what happens when they finally meet?

1087
01:03:10,104 --> 01:03:13,339
Matt, I am really nervous about this.
If fact, I'll say I'm down right scared.

1088
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,812
Here's the problem. The island of Manhattan

1089
01:03:15,813 --> 01:03:18,670
creates a lot of heat.
As the hot air rises,

1090
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:21,857
cool air is sucked in to replace it.

1091
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:25,476
That affect is drawing
these Sharknadoes to the very

1092
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:30,256
heart of this city. Now if
these two EF2 tornadoes merge...

1093
01:03:30,324 --> 01:03:34,427
their power can actually multiply. We
could be talking about an EF5 Sharknado

1094
01:03:34,495 --> 01:03:39,065
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Matt, that's sufficient power enough

1095
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:42,101
to damage steel reinforced sky scrapers.

1096
01:03:42,169 --> 01:03:44,571
I've never seen anything
like this. Stay with us, Al.

1097
01:03:44,638 --> 01:03:47,452
We go live to Manhattan with
weatherman, Raphael Miranda.

1098
01:03:47,478 --> 01:03:48,933
From our local station that's

1099
01:03:48,976 --> 01:03:53,546
NBC 4. Can you tell us a little bit more
about what's happening down there, Raphael?

1100
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:57,217
Thanks Matt. This storm is already taking
a toll on the city. The residence are

1101
01:03:57,284 --> 01:04:01,321

that keep raining down from the sky.

Well we can't equalize
the pressure with a bomb.

Right.

01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:29,378
Well if I can't blow it
out, I'll freeze it out.

1237
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:32,714
I'll throw the freon tank into the storm.

01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:38,353

to work. But it's a moot point.

here to make that happen.
