kiss my wife. It's rude.

Ugh. Gross! That is sick.
Thank you.

DRAKE: Yeah.

I'm not allowed to kiss your brother.

Reminds me of when you were a kid.
You should've seen him.

No, you shouldn't have.
Oh, yeah?

172
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,400
DRAKE: Yeah. He was like
a little chubby angel.

Really?
KELLY: A little cherub.

DRAKE: Yeah.
I was always a little chubby.

175

He says "only a little chubby."
CRISPIAN: I have a round face.

That doesn't mean I'm fat.
It doesn't mean he's fat.

177

ERIN: It means you're beautiful.
DRAKE: All the fat on him means he's fat.

Oh, hello.

00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,146
Um, I was just wondering if you need
any help in here with anything.

00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,420
Could you go over
to the neighbor's house

188
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,170
and see if he has some?
His name's Erik.

Come join us, Erin.

201

Your mom just asked me
to go to your neighbor's

202
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,497
to see if I could borrow some milk.

No?

No. Uh...

214
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,205
I guess there were a lot of
applicants this year, and...

215
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,254
I haven't exactly been
published recently, so...

216
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,170
Well, there are some people
that aren't published

217

that do get the fellowship,

Are you sure?
