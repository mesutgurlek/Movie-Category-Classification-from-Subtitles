1
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:58,530
We should have talked to the boatyard.

2
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,908
You don't wanna talk here.

3
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:05,204
I'm not falling over
to talk about it much anywhere, jack.

4
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:09,083
How much do you know?
- Not much.

5
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,840
The Birmingham one
was in the papers over a month ago,

6
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,678
and Atlanta was all over TV.

7
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:25,099
Did you think about giving me a call?
- No. - why not?

8
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:27,101
I quit, remember?

9
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,357
You look alright now.

10
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,778
I am alright.

11
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,583
If you can't look anymore,
I understand.

12
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:55,254
Don't play games with me!

13
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:05,180
If I really didn't need you,
I wouldn't ask.

14
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:10,144
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks till full moon.

15
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:14,732
We have a better chance
if you help me.

16
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,359
I'll think about it.

17
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:01,779
Stay and eat.

18
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:27,596
Think it'll keep them out, dad?
- Yep.

19
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:32,559
How many turtle's eggs are in here?
- In this hatchery?

20
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:34,979
40 or 50 of 'em.

21
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,234
Crabs get most of them, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.

22
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:43,529
These are all gonna make it.

23
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,575
What about the dogs?

24
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:53,080
No. That's why
we buried the wire down in the sand.

25
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:57,418
I need more staples, pal.

26
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:09,847
You're supposed to be his friend.
Why didn't you leave him alone?

27
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,727
If he decides to do it, molly,

28
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:18,105
I’ll keep him
as far away from it as I can.

29
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,207
We've got it pretty good.
- More than good.

30
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:40,628
All that happened before
lets you know that.

31
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:47,718
If I went back,
I’d only look at the evidence.

32
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:50,304
I wouldn't get involved.

33
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,307
He'd never even see me.

34
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,602
If they find him,
they'll have to take him down.

35
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,650
What do you think?

36
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:09,323
You've already decided
and you're not really asking.

37
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,453
If I were asking?

38
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,998
Stay here with me.

39
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,875
Me and Kevin.

40
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:23,462
That's selfish and I know it.

41
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:29,737
I'll come inside with you
and show you around.

42
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:44,501
Mr. Crawford said maybe you want
to be alone. - That's right.

43
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:49,214
There's a VCR in your hotel room.

44
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:53,677
There's home movies
of both families on half inch VHS.

45
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:55,012
Thanks.

46
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:39,241
Intruder entered through kitchen door.
Used a glass cutter on a suction cup.

47
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,493
Entry was skilful.

48
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,456
All prints are smooth gloves.

49
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:48,042
Blond hair, strong.

50
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:50,544
Size 12 shoe imprint.

51
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:55,466
Blood ab positive, from saliva
on glass from the suction cup.

52
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:59,178
Why did he leave saliva on the glass?

53
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:04,975
It was hot that night,

54
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:08,812
so it must have felt
cool in the house.

55
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:16,946
Intruder cut Charles Leeds’s throat
then shot Mrs. Leeds.

56
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:21,909
Bullet lodged in her lumbar spine,
but she died of strangulation.

57
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:26,830
Moderate elevation of serotonin and
an increase in histamine indicate she

58
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:29,500
lived for 5 minutes after the shot.

59
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:33,921
All other injuries are post-mortem.
Direction of the

60
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:37,049
blood stains on the wall
indicate arterial spray.

61
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:43,180
Leeds tried to fight because intruder
moved towards the children's room.

62
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,351
Blood stains on west wall

63
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,231
in master bedroom and sliding marks
on hall carpet remain unexplained,

64
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,944
as does superficial ligature mark
around Mr. Leeds' chest.

65
00:11:57,344 --> 00:11:59,655
Also believed post-mortem.

66
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,786
What did the killer
do with them after they were dead?

67
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:37,192
Hi. This is Valerie Leeds.

68
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:39,320
I can't speak right now,

69
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:44,158
but if you leave a message after the
beep, I’ll get right back.

70
00:12:58,113 --> 00:12:59,590
290th floor.

71
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:03,761
Going up.

72
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,490
When they were dead,

73
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:30,162
he smashed the mirrors and
selected pieces for use on Mrs. Leeds.

74
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:35,376
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children
would take less than a minute.

75
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:41,340
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were
post-mortem 4 or 5 minutes later.

76
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,550
What did he do in the interval?

77
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:51,558
He smeared blood stains on the wall.

78
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,478
Hello?
- Molly?

79
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:40,399
Will, is that you?
- Yeah, honey.

80
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,194
Look, I’ll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.

81
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:49,992
I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

82
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,538
What are you dreaming?

83
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:43,337
That's something you can't afford
for me to know about.

84
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:49,760
God, she's lovely, isn't she?

85
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:58,519
It was maddening to touch her
with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?

86
00:15:59,545 --> 00:16:04,358
They found talcum powder on her leg,
but there wasn't any in the bathroom.

87
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:13,951
It came out of a rubber glove
as you pulled it off to touch her.

88
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:17,997
You took off your gloves
to touch her, didn't you?

89
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:22,126
You touched her with your bare hands

90
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:24,586
and then you put your gloves back on!

91
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:27,339
But while your gloves were off,

92
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,010
did you open all their eyes
so they could see you?

93
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:46,900
Hallo?
- Jack, this is graham.

94
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:51,989
Is price still in latent prints?
- Yeah, the single print index.

95
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,992
What have you got?
- Get him to Atlanta.

96
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:59,455
Atlanta p. D. Dusted everything and
they're good. - Not as good as price.

97
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:03,500
I'll send him tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?

98
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:10,215
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails
and the corneas of all their eyes.

99
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:13,427
I think he took off his gloves.

100
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,766
The subject's teeth look like this.

101
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,352
These were reconstructed

102
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:28,400
from the bite mark impressions we took
from Mrs. Leeds and the jacobi woman.

103
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:34,949
He has pegged lateral incisors,
that's these teeth here and here.

104
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:40,245
Vice and narcotics, you take the
k-y cowboys and the leather bars.

105
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:44,375
Marcus, Whitman heads up at the
funeral. The rest, see the sheet.

106
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:46,126
One more thing.

107
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:50,381
I've heard officers call
this killer the 'tooth fairy'.

108
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:54,260
Well, I don't wanna hear that
in public or see it in memoranda!

109
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:55,928
That's it.

110
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:13,904
I know a burglar's gonna fence
what he stole for cash money.

111
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:17,366
I know his motive,
so I go to work on fences.

112
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:19,994
This guy, we don't have a motive.

113
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:23,080
None of us have shit and we know it.

114
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,873
It's in his dreams.

115
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,626
His motive?
- Yeah.

116
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:30,879
His act fuels his fantasy.

117
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:35,009
Which is?
- I don't know.

118
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:38,846
Commissioner says you're the one
who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes

119
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:43,601
and then dr. Lecktor 3 years ago?
- Lecktor killed 90 people, didn't he?

120
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:47,855
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.

121
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:51,650
I heard he cut you pretty good.

122
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,531
What about the dog?

123
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:02,328
It's at the vet's.
It has puncture wound.

124
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,456
The Jacobis had a cat.

125
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:07,166
That's right.

126
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:10,669
We found the litter box,
but not the cat.

127
00:19:11,403 --> 00:19:14,923
Give Birmingham p. D. A methane probe
out of Washington.

128
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:19,011
Have them cover the backyard.
Maybe the cat's buried there.

129
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:23,599
Yeah?
- This is Jimmie price, fbi.

130
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,936
Let me put you on the speaker.
- Who am I talking to?

131
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:29,146
Jack Crawford
and will graham.

132
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:32,107
I got a partial print,
probably a thumb.

133
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:35,945
And a fragment of a palm off the
nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.

134
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:41,325
Thumb print came off
the oldest kid's left eye.

135
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:46,455
Can we make an identification off it?
- Maybe if he's in my index.

136
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:49,249
Wanna work on these in the dark room.

137
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,045
I'll fax the prints this afternoon.
- Thanks.

138
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:12,815
If we get lucky with that print...

139
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:15,943
if Jimmie can find him in the index.
- Hey, graham!

140
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:19,822
Whatta you say?
It's me, Lounds, from the "tattler".

141
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:23,200
I did the Lecktor paperback.
When did they call you in?

142
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,869
I'm buying lunch, alright?
- Give it a rest!

143
00:20:26,228 --> 00:20:28,622
I'm doing my job.

144
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:32,584
How does he compare to Lecktor?
What does he do to them?

145
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:34,837
How does he do 'em, will?

146
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:40,718
Keep the fuck away from me!
- Will, will!

147
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:52,896
Son-of-a-bitch snuck into the hospital
while I was sedated and took pictures.

148
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:55,983
I know.
- Don't expect too much from me.

149
00:20:56,383 --> 00:21:01,280
We only got three weeks left.
- You think I’m just gonna see him?

150
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:04,033
That's Houdini!

151
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:09,371
The tooth fairy's gonna go on till
we get smart or lucky. He won't stop.

152
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:10,914
Why?

153
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:15,669
He's got a taste for it.
- You do know something about him.

154
00:21:17,238 --> 00:21:18,672
Not enough.

155
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:23,135
I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.

156
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:24,762
Why?

157
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,432
Recover the mind set.

158
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:03,550
That's the same atrocious aftershave
you wore in court 3 years ago.

159
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:05,719
I keep getting it for Christmas.

160
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:13,227
Did you get my card?
- I got it, thank you.

161
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:16,772
How is officer Stuart?

162
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:20,317
Fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.

163
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:23,320
Do you have any problems, will?
- No.

164
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,990
No, of course you don't.

165
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:29,285
I'm glad you came.

166
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:34,957
My callers are usually psychologists
from cornfield universities.

167
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:36,792
Second-raters, the lot.

168
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:41,046
Dr. Bloom showed me your article
on surgical addiction. - And?

169
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,799
Very interesting, even to a layman.

170
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,848
I want you to help me, dr. Lecktor.
- I thought so.

171
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:54,476
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes? - you read about it?

172
00:22:54,835 --> 00:22:58,314
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.

173
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:02,901
I wouldn't want them to think
I was dwelling on anything morbid.

174
00:23:04,845 --> 00:23:07,072
You want to know
how he's choosing them.

175
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:09,950
Any ideas?
- Why should I tell you?

176
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:14,538
You get to see the file.
There's another reason. - Pray tell.

177
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,374
You might be curious to see
if you're smarter.

178
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:19,960
Smarter than you,
since you caught me?

179
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:23,881
I know I’m not smart.
- Then how did you catch me?

180
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,550
Your disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?

181
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:28,302
You're insane.

182
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:32,222
You're very tanned, will.

183
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:35,184
Your hands are rough.

184
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,564
Not cop's hands any more.
And that shaving lotion

185
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:43,651
is from a child?
With a ship on the bottle?

186
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:49,657
Don't think appeals to my
intellectual vanity will work.

187
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:52,576
I don't think that.

188
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:55,454
You'll do it or you won't.

189
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:58,582
Dr. Bloom's working on it.
He's the best.

190
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:01,961
Have you got the file?
- Yes. - pictures? - yes.

191
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:06,215
Let me have them and I’ll consider it.
- No.

192
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,552
Dream much, will?

193
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,680
Goodbye, dr. Lecktor.

194
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:16,058
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet.

195
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:21,188
Let me have the file
and I’ll tell you what I think.

196
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:22,541
This is a very shy boy.

197
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:29,256
What were the yards like?
- Big, fences, hedges. Why?

198
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:30,799
Because,

199
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:37,181
if he imagines he has a relationship
with the moon, he'll go look outside.

200
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:42,269
Ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.

201
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:46,565
If one were nude,
it would be better to have privacy.

202
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:49,193
Interesting.

203
00:25:49,468 --> 00:25:52,905
No. You thought of it before.
- I considered it.

204
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:54,490
You wanted to look at me.

205
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:57,076
To get the scent back.
- I want your opinion.

206
00:25:57,476 --> 00:26:00,704
I don't have one now.
- When you do, I want to hear it.

207
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:04,750
Can I keep this?
- Haven't decided. - I’ll study them.

208
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:07,878
Also any other files.
You can call me.

209
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:12,925
For calls to my lawyer I get a phone.
Will you leave me your home number?

210
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:15,094
No.

211
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:17,805
Do you know how you caught me?

212
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:21,475
There's a number on the file.
- Do you know how you caught me?

213
00:26:22,877 --> 00:26:24,687
You caught me, will,

214
00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:28,107
because we're just alike.
You want the scent,

215
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:31,610
smell yourself!

216
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:47,561
Gotcha!

217
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:06,121
Get up and face the wall.

218
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:10,000
Don't turn around,
or I’ll mace you in the face.

219
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:25,933
Thank you so much.
I'll call when I’m finished.

220
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:37,653
You ready for your call?
- Yes, thank you.

221
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,241
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub,
law offices.

222
00:28:42,516 --> 00:28:44,368
I'm sorry, I misdialed.

223
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:55,879
Thank you for using AT&T.
This is operator 24.

224
00:28:57,072 --> 00:29:00,676
Operator,
I don't have the use of my arms.

225
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:06,140
Would you dial a number for me?
- Certainly. What's the number?

226
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,851
Area code 3-0-1.

227
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:12,146
5-5-5-6-6-2-4.

228
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,570
University of Chicago, department of
psychiatry. - Dr. Bloom, please.

229
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:21,989
I'll connect you with his office.

230
00:29:22,264 --> 00:29:26,619
What's his secretary's name?
- Martha king. Just a moment.

231
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:29,788
Martha king's desk.
- Hi, Martha.

232
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:32,625
Martha doesn't come in nights.

233
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:36,962
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer.

234
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:40,799
Dr. Bloom asked me to send
a paper to someone,

235
00:29:41,116 --> 00:29:44,845
but I never got the address or number.
- She'll be in in the morning.

236
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:51,101
I've got to catch the federal express.
Could you pull it out of her rolodex?

237
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,189
I don't see a rolodex.
- I bet she has a call caddy.

238
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:59,151
Yeah.
- Well point right on down to g.

239
00:29:59,552 --> 00:30:03,614
Alright.
- The last name is graham.

240
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:07,701
The man the book is for.
Mr. Will graham.

241
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,872
Federal bureau of investigation,
10th and Pennsylvania, Washington d. C.

242
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:15,876
I bet his home address is there too.

243
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:19,255
3680 Desoto highway, Captiva, Florida.

244
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:23,425
Thank you very much.

245
00:30:26,996 --> 00:30:28,597
Finished!

246
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:09,740
Mommy!
- Oh my gosh! Lt's ok. Stewardess?

247
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:40,854
There's a couple down from Duluth,
we were talking about mortgages.

248
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:42,356
And...

249
00:32:42,715 --> 00:32:46,193
I figure,
you're gonna unload this turkey.

250
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:48,320
Well,

251
00:32:48,762 --> 00:32:51,073
then the squad car rolls up,

252
00:32:51,473 --> 00:32:53,784
they start asking questions,

253
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:59,290
the whole grand tour:
Who was lying where and what.

254
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,791
Terrific.

255
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:05,421
So they get in their sedan
and get the hell out of here.

256
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:08,048
Any single men ask to see the house?

257
00:33:08,491 --> 00:33:09,967
No-one asked me.

258
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:04,790
You cut the branch so you could see.

259
00:35:05,149 --> 00:35:06,959
Then you passed the time whittling

260
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,878
and dreaming.

261
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:13,132
When night came,

262
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:16,885
you saw them behind bright windows.

263
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:19,888
You watched the shades go down,

264
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:23,183
saw the lights go out one by one.

265
00:35:23,584 --> 00:35:25,769
Then you went in to 'em,

266
00:35:26,212 --> 00:35:27,479
Didn’t ya?

267
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,609
Didn't you, son-of-a-bitch?
You watched them all day long!

268
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:37,281
That's why houses with big yards.

269
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:45,664
I need the firearms and toolmarks
section on the severed branch.

270
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:49,209
I need bowman to fall on this carving.
- Is it weird?

271
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,586
The mark? Yeah.

272
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:56,091
If documents can't do it, Langley can.
- Did price get an identification?

273
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,720
No, not yet.
It's a hand search.

274
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,181
Have you seen the "tattler"?

275
00:36:02,706 --> 00:36:05,434
It's not on my reading list.
- Yeah, well,

276
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:08,062
you're all over the front page.

277
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:12,566
Who the hell was it, Lounds?
- Who else?

278
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:17,071
Goddammit, jack!
I promised molly.

279
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:23,035
Come in!
- Dr. Chilton? - yes?

280
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:26,956
On cleaning out dr. Lecktor's cell,
he hid something in a book.

281
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:32,753
We dug around.
- Is that it? Put it down.

282
00:36:40,286 --> 00:36:43,305
Has anyone seen this except you?
- No.

283
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:50,688
Crawford's office.
- This is Chilton. Mr. Graham please!

284
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:54,358
He's not here. Mr. Crawford
is on the line with him now.

285
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:58,779
Will you tell him this is very, very
urgent. I’ll hold on.

286
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,909
Dr. Chilton, it's Crawford.
Graham is on the line, too.

287
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:06,829
I have two pieces of a note

288
00:37:07,188 --> 00:37:09,915
that appears to be from
the murderer in Atlanta.

289
00:37:10,274 --> 00:37:13,836
Where did you get it?
- Hidden in a book in Lecktor’s cell.

290
00:37:14,236 --> 00:37:19,550
Don't touch the note. Read it to us!
- It's on toilet tissue.

291
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,635
"Dear dr. Lecktor,

292
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:25,639
I am delighted that
you've taken an interest in me.

293
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:29,476
You alone can understand
what I am becoming.

294
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:33,480
You know the people I used to help me

295
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:38,527
are only elements undergoing change
to fuel the radiance

296
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:44,033
of what I am becoming. Just
as the source of light is burning.

297
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:50,080
My collection of your press clippings
is as absurd as are mine.

298
00:37:50,397 --> 00:37:53,959
The "tooth fairy".
What could be more inappropriate?

299
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:57,046
Investigator graham interests me.

300
00:37:57,404 --> 00:38:01,508
Very purposeful-looking.
I hope we can correspond."

301
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:04,929
There's a piece missing.
I'll read the bottom part.

302
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:09,099
"After I hear from you,
I might send you something wet."

303
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,438
Signed: "avid fan."
There are teeth marks at the bottom.

304
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,107
Order a chopper. Don't care whose.

305
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:21,028
2. call Alabama air national guard,
get graham back here right now.

306
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:25,324
Call documents and scramble a team.
I want everybody movin'.

307
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:28,202
The documents team is underway
to pick up the note.

308
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:32,331
Listen, I wanna replace the note.
I don't want Lecktor to know.

309
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:36,877
He might try to warn the killer.
Where's Lecktor? - Holding cell.

310
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:40,506
How long can you keep him in there?
- Three, four hours.

311
00:38:41,282 --> 00:38:44,593
We have a note coming in,
possibly from the tooth fairy.

312
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:50,224
No. 1 priority.
Has to go to hair and fiber.

313
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:30,764
One hair.
Maybe half an inch.

314
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:34,935
Couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.

315
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:39,148
What do you have as a negative
comparison? - Lecktor's comb.

316
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:44,528
Whiskers from a razor,
hair from the security guard.

317
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:06,800
How many handled this without gloves?

318
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:10,220
Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
- The cleanup man scrubbing sinks

319
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:13,390
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.

320
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,560
But the others... one smudge.

321
00:40:20,923 --> 00:40:23,484
No ridges,
it's just the texture of the paper.

322
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,280
I can fume it but I can't say the
iodine stains will fade. - Ninhydrin?

323
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,034
Boosted with heat?
- No. You couldn't wash it out.

324
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:35,371
I can't get a print in the time.

325
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:37,915
How long?
- 20 minutes max.

326
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:41,543
Main thing is,
how was Lecktor supposed to reply?

327
00:40:41,944 --> 00:40:46,382
It's probably in the missing section.
'I hope we can correspond'.

328
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,342
Then comes the gap.

329
00:40:49,785 --> 00:40:51,762
This note was written in ballpoint.

330
00:40:52,371 --> 00:40:55,933
But it looks like Lecktor went over
this area with a felt-tip pen

331
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,185
and tore it away.

332
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:27,172
You're so sly,

333
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,800
but so am I.

334
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,351
The aniline dyes in the felt-tip pens,

335
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,855
like Lecktor used,
are transparent to infrared.

336
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:46,400
The tooth fairy's ballpoint isn't.

337
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:56,410
This looks like the tip of a t.

338
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:57,953
This one could be

339
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,332
the top of an r.
- Three t's and an r in "tattler".

340
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:03,918
The article about me and Lecktor.

341
00:42:04,276 --> 00:42:07,129
No-one else carried that.

342
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,006
Personal ads.

343
00:42:11,992 --> 00:42:15,971
The tooth fairy told Lecktor
to reply through the personal ads

344
00:42:16,372 --> 00:42:20,559
in the "tattler". Chicago is running
through them right now.

345
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:24,605
Here is a line of communication
between the tooth fairy and Lecktor.

346
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:29,234
If we find Lecktor’s answer,
we'll replace it with our own.

347
00:42:29,593 --> 00:42:31,445
This is what he'll read:

348
00:42:32,346 --> 00:42:36,033
"Dear avid fan: Inherit my mantle
and surpass my achievements.

349
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,119
Mementos for you at Baltimore central.
Left luggage.

350
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,705
Ticket 7-2-6-8-3."

351
00:42:42,064 --> 00:42:45,918
It's a letter drop.
We stake it out and grab him.

352
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:49,713
Anything from Chicago? - Not yet.
- When do they go to press?

353
00:42:50,072 --> 00:42:53,342
In 35 minutes. - Christ!
- Let's get to the physical.

354
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:56,220
There was no print.
- The core size of the hair

355
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:01,725
matches the blond hair found in the
Jacobi's. Your man wrote the note.

356
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:05,312
Three blue grains
went to Brians's end.

357
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:08,732
Commercial granulated cleanser
from the cleaning man.

358
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:12,361
Particles of dried blood,
but not enough to type.

359
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:16,991
This is Chester, who's there?
- Will graham, jack Crawford.

360
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:21,537
Got a personal ad with "avid fan"
in it. - Read it!

361
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:25,874
"Dear avid fan,
you honor me. You're very beautiful.

362
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:28,711
One hundred prayers for your safety.

363
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:32,715
Find help in Galatians 6, 11 and 15,2.

364
00:43:33,115 --> 00:43:37,469
Acts 3,3; revelations 18,7.

365
00:43:37,786 --> 00:43:43,475
Jonah 6,8; john 6,22; Luke 1,7.

366
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:44,810
Thanks.

367
00:43:51,091 --> 00:43:52,026
Jimmie,

368
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:55,821
get anywhere with the Leeds print?
- Not yet.

369
00:43:59,475 --> 00:44:03,495
Cryptography at Langley?
- They're working on the telex now.

370
00:44:16,408 --> 00:44:17,176
No.

371
00:44:17,618 --> 00:44:20,971
Our ad has to go out
in the same book code, or he'll know.

372
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,306
Book code?

373
00:44:22,706 --> 00:44:27,019
"100 prayers" could be a page number
and the paired numbers lines.

374
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:32,149
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah, it only has four.

375
00:44:32,508 --> 00:44:34,568
Lecktor was not using the bible.

376
00:44:34,927 --> 00:44:39,239
The tooth fairy probably named
the book in the part torn out.

377
00:44:39,598 --> 00:44:41,033
What about sweatin' Lecktor?

378
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:44,453
We tried sodium amytal 3 years ago,

379
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:48,040
and he gave 'em a recipe for
a chip dip. - Wonderful.

380
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,254
The tooth fairy knows which book.
He'd know from articles about Lecktor.

381
00:44:53,654 --> 00:44:56,757
Willingham took polaroids
of Lecktor’s cell.

382
00:44:57,074 --> 00:45:02,263
Have him meet me.
- Where? - library of congress.

383
00:45:07,376 --> 00:45:09,311
25 minutes. He won't make it.

384
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:13,857
Lecktor's ad runs as is,
or we pull it

385
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:18,112
and run our own ad next week.
- We got 17 days left till full moon!

386
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:22,741
I don't like Lecktor’s ad running
without knowing what it says.

387
00:45:23,642 --> 00:45:25,202
It's your call, will.

388
00:45:28,355 --> 00:45:29,498
Run it.

389
00:45:30,316 --> 00:45:34,169
And what if it encourages the
tooth fairy to do something else?

390
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,046
Then we'll all feel sick.

391
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:39,383
And if bowman can't figure it out?

392
00:45:39,783 --> 00:45:44,638
Then we'll bait him with something
else in the "tattler". - What?

393
00:45:46,415 --> 00:45:47,433
Me.

394
00:45:49,084 --> 00:45:51,895
That's not a very good idea.

395
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:59,653
Why not? Won't it provoke him?
- Maybe.

396
00:46:00,054 --> 00:46:02,781
I was thinking about you.

397
00:46:03,265 --> 00:46:05,659
You're getting in deeper and deeper.

398
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:07,661
Sidney?

399
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:11,957
The last time

400
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:16,003
you pushed yourself all outta shape.
Try it on again,

401
00:46:16,445 --> 00:46:19,089
or if you go through some trauma,
you could relapse.

402
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:22,051
Sidney, don't worry about me.

403
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:26,305
I'm workin' the evidence,
makin' moves, that's all.

404
00:46:26,705 --> 00:46:28,182
I'm fine.

405
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:34,605
Bowman says
it is not books in Lecktor’s cell.

406
00:46:34,964 --> 00:46:37,316
Price?
- It's a bust out.

407
00:46:37,675 --> 00:46:41,320
The Leeds' print will
get us a conviction.

408
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:43,280
He must never have been printed,

409
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:45,199
because he is not in our index.

410
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,160
We are not gonna
identify him off the print.

411
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:52,456
I'll use Lounds.

412
00:46:53,315 --> 00:46:54,625
What for?

413
00:46:55,025 --> 00:47:00,256
Our boy doesn't read the times.
He reads Lounds in the "tattler".

414
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,347
What else should we cover? - He put
the shorts on Leeds after he was dead,

415
00:47:08,747 --> 00:47:11,141
so we wouldn't think he was gay.

416
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:18,065
He molested all his male victims

417
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:22,444
and may be impotent with women.
Our forensic psychologists

418
00:47:22,845 --> 00:47:24,697
have projected

419
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:28,575
that he may have had
sexual relations with his mother.

420
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:37,960
How long will you stay in Washington?
- Till we've got the tooth fairy.

421
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:43,966
Will the "tattler" get the stuff?
How's your sex life been affected?

422
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:47,386
Mine? Lt doesn't.
It affects yours! Fuck yourself!

423
00:47:47,745 --> 00:47:50,347
Look, pal, you're news!
- You shot the pictures.

424
00:47:50,706 --> 00:47:55,561
Alright. I’m in the shots with graham.
- What? - yeah. Come on!

425
00:47:55,878 --> 00:47:57,563
You want this to look real?

426
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:02,776
Make sure the theater sign
is just out of focus.

427
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:07,323
We want him to read it.
- And make sure I look excellent!

428
00:48:07,723 --> 00:48:09,450
Shoot it!

429
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:11,452
One more.

430
00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:13,621
One more.
- That's enough.

431
00:48:13,979 --> 00:48:16,123
Ok, graham. Always nice, huh?

432
00:48:16,524 --> 00:48:19,877
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.

433
00:48:20,236 --> 00:48:23,797
Dr. Bloom. L need them
on my desk in 2 hours. - Ok.

434
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:34,016
Did bowman break the code yet?
- No.

435
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:39,063
They say the cutting tool
was a common bolt cutter.

436
00:48:39,463 --> 00:48:41,649
I got a call
from Asian studies in Langley.

437
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:47,446
The mark on the tree is a Chinese
lucky sign in gambling.

438
00:48:47,847 --> 00:48:52,326
The same character appears in
mah-jongg. Lt means red dragon.

439
00:48:52,685 --> 00:48:54,370
Mean anything to you?

440
00:48:56,689 --> 00:48:57,873
No.

441
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:03,837
If he shows and he's smart,
he'll approach from the front,

442
00:49:04,238 --> 00:49:09,051
pass, turn and try and take you from
behind. How's your hearing? - Good.

443
00:49:09,451 --> 00:49:13,347
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, but you won't hear us.

444
00:49:13,747 --> 00:49:17,518
Checked out a 44 special bulldog?
Load these in it.

445
00:49:17,918 --> 00:49:19,728
You ever fire 'em?
- Glaser safety slugs?

446
00:49:24,383 --> 00:49:28,779
Opens up on impact.
Guaranteed one shot stop.

447
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,824
You got body armor?
- Kevlar second chance.

448
00:49:32,558 --> 00:49:36,662
Hope you get one.
- 'Cause he goes for the head shot?

449
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:39,665
Let's walk the route.

450
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:05,608
United flight 8490 to Newark
now boarding at gate 7.

451
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:09,194
United flight 8490 to Newark
now boarding at gate 7.

452
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:44,480
Can you get to a phone?

453
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:51,236
So where are things?

454
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,865
Got nine days left.

455
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:57,701
We're working on it.

456
00:50:59,061 --> 00:51:02,122
You don't wanna talk
about what you're doing, do you?

457
00:51:06,861 --> 00:51:08,545
Hotel rooms...

458
00:51:09,738 --> 00:51:11,799
an illicit romance...

459
00:51:13,284 --> 00:51:15,344
we have to stop meeting like this.

460
00:51:21,584 --> 00:51:23,644
Remember the first time we met?

461
00:51:24,044 --> 00:51:25,187
Yeah.

462
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:28,399
We were alone together in that room.

463
00:51:29,508 --> 00:51:32,444
Though I’d never seen you before,
we were sitting there,

464
00:51:32,803 --> 00:51:38,242
speaking. A shadow flickered across
your face. L said, "what's that?"

465
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,080
Remember what you said?

466
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:49,044
I said:
"This is too good to believe."

467
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:57,094
Time is luck, will.

468
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:01,682
You know the value of every day.

469
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:38,320
Someone's coming.

470
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:09,435
Go!

471
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:15,441
Don't!

472
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:17,026
Don't move!

473
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:23,949
Take the money!

474
00:54:24,266 --> 00:54:25,784
Don't shoot!

475
00:54:27,102 --> 00:54:28,162
Clear!

476
00:54:36,111 --> 00:54:39,131
Quicker, man!
I'm being mugged!

477
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:33,310
Do you know who I am?
- I don't wanna know who you are.

478
00:55:34,628 --> 00:55:37,356
You said I’m a sexual pervert.

479
00:55:37,715 --> 00:55:39,441
'An animal' you said.

480
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,697
Do you know who I am now?

481
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:47,700
Yes.

482
00:55:49,602 --> 00:55:51,203
Do you feel privileged?

483
00:55:55,524 --> 00:55:57,376
I'm very scared.

484
00:56:00,613 --> 00:56:02,214
Open your eyes!

485
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:05,134
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.

486
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:09,179
That's why you're here.

487
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:13,350
Open your eyes or I’ll staple
your eyelids to your forehead.

488
00:56:20,216 --> 00:56:22,443
Well, here I...

489
00:56:23,886 --> 00:56:24,945
am.
