<i> There's one word to describe what's happening,
and that word is... </i>

2
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:34,303
<i> "Panic" </i>

3
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:38,311
<i> And of course this comes with unthinkable
irrational behaviour, </i>

4
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:43,506
<i> the crash of 29, 1987 Black Monday
came with tragic suicides and murders, </i>

5
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:46,891
<i> ..this collapse is no exception. </i>

6
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,107
<i> Just one hour ago.. </i>

7
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:54,378
<i> as the market were opening, 2 partners at Cava
Holding were shot at the troubled company's headquarters.</i>

8
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:58,103
<i> Senior partner, Laura Muller,
died on site. </i>

9
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,990
<i>An analyst, Albert Bernard,
is in critical condition.</i>

10
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:07,908
<i> Jeffrey Dosage, also Senior partner, was in the office
at the time of the shooting and is now gone missing.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, we, we got to go, sweetheart.</i>

12
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,349
<i>Isn't Mommy taking me to school?</i>

13
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,155
<i>Mommy's not feeling well.</i>

14
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:44,934
<i>Hurry. Put on your glasses. Come on.</i>

15
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:48,172
<i>Let's go.</i>

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,100
<i>Daddy, where're we going?</i>

17
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:09,901
<i>I don't know.</i>

18
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:34,902
<i>Fuck.</i>

19
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,600
<i>You're driving too fast.</i>

20
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,800
<i>- Daddy, you're driving too..
- Shut up!</i>

21
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,200
<i>Sorry, excuse me.</i>

22
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,640
<i>- Hey, buddy, you want to get behind the tape?
- I'm family. I'm Lucas Dosage.</i>

23
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,240
<i>You called me. Someone called me.
Detective or something?</i>

24
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,290
<i>- You live here?
- No, my brother lives here.</i>

25
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,450
<i>What's going on?
Where is Jeff?</i>

26
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,050
<i>Are the girls okay?
Where are the girls?</i>

27
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,850
<i>Sir, just hang on, all right?
Just wait here.</i>

<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

29
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:55,751
<i> ..Jeffrey Dosage apparently shot 2 of his partners
to death before going on to murder his estranged wife. </i>

30
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:58,952
<i>And kidnapped his two daughters,
age three and one. </i>

31
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,470
<i>It's okay. It's okay.
Come on.</i>

32
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,950
<i>Daddy, are we there yet?</i>

33
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,450
<i>My glasses are broken.</i>

34
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,550

<i>Helvetia</i>

36

00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:11,360
<i>Now!</i>

38
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,780
<i>Come on, come on..</i>

39
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,680
<i>Daddy, there's a woman outside.</i>

40
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,680
<i>She's not touching the floor.</i>

41
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,670
<i>- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm sad, honey.</i>

42
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,670
<i>Why are you sad?</i>

43
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,870
<i>You know, Mom and Dad they..</i>

44
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:26,971
<i>They tried real hard. But sometimes
they messed things up.</i>

45
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,670
<i>You know Daddy loves you, right?</i>

46
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,670
<i>I can't see.</i>

47
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,670
<i>What's that?</i>

48
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:58,970
<i>Look honey, there..</i>

49
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,970
<i>Daddy?</i>

50
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,970
<i>Daddy?</i>

51
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,970
<i>Daddy?</i>

52
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,270
<i>Daddy?</i>

53
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,270
<i>Look, Lilly. A cherry.</i>

54
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,170
<i>Burnside, where are you guys, then?</i>

55
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,770
<i>Well, we're going to to have a another
look around sector  1-7-12-33.</i>

56
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,970
<i>- That's the mountain road, right?
- Uhuh.</i>

57
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,770
<i>Gas station..
Road to the Paulson Pass..</i>

58
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,770
<i>- This is good.
- Oh, God. I hate to do this.</i>

59
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,570
<i>- Do what?
- The last payment didn't clear.</i>

60
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:33,169
<i>Well, uh.. I'll check on that.
Don't worry about that. Things go down.</i>

61
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,470
<i>All right. I'll work on that
and get back to you.</i>

62
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:36,271
<i>"Not Pregnant"</i>

63

<i>Thank you, God.
Sweet!</i>

65
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,570
<i>- That was Burnside on the phone?
- Yup.</i>

66
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,070
<i>What is his next move?</i>

67
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,470
<i>Is he going to search sector lousy alpha?</i>

68
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,670
<i>Hey, guess who's not pregnant?</i>

69
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,670
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

70
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,570
<i>Last payment didn't clear.</i>

71
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,200
<i>- Is there a problem with the bank, or..
- The money's gone.</i>

72
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,470
<i>- I pick B.
- That is the correct answer.</i>

73
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,470
<i>Look, babe..</i>

74
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,071
<i>It's your brother. You want to spend all
your money, and find them, it's okay with me.</i>

75
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,571
<i>It's cheaper than therapy.</i>

76
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:30,272
<i>- And so am I.
- What..?</i>

77
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,470
<i>I need to go.</i>

78
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,600
<i>- Burnside!
- What?</i>

79
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,770
<i>Hey, Burnside!</i>

80
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,470
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

81
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,170
<i>- You're going to call him?
- Just give me a minute.</i>

82
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,470
<i>- But we should call, we said we'd call.
- Ronny, shut up.</i>

83
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:24,171
<i>Just for one minute.</i>

84
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,470
<i>Here you go, Bird.
Take a whiff of that.</i>

85
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,470
<i>Hello?</i>

86
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,470
<i>Ah, yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir.</i>

87
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,870
<i>It's cherry pits.</i>

88
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,470
<i>Hey, Burnside!</i>

89
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,570
<i>Burnside, can we call him now?</i>

90
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,070
<i>- They found them.
- You shitting me.</i>

91
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,470
<i>They found the girls. Alive.</i>

92
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,470
<i>Dr. Gerald Defuses. And you
must be Annabel. - I must be.</i>

93
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,570
<i>Lucas.
How are they?</i>

94
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,070
<i>Well, just let me warn you.
This won't be easy.</i>

95
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:57,371
<i>We're very fortunate, that Victoria was
old enough to retain much of her vocabulary.</i>

96
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:03,070
<i>But it's still too early to determine
if this development..- What about the other one?</i>

97
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,070
<i>That's a different story.</i>

98
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,269
<i>Shit.</i>

99
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,570
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

100
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,070
<i>Hey, Victoria.</i>

101
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,570
<i>Is that you, Lilly?
Hey..</i>

102
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,370
<i>No, no, no. It's okay.
It's okay.</i>

103
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,670
<i>I'm not going to hurt you.</i>

104
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,170
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

105
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:11,170
<i>I brought something for you.
For your eyes.</i>

106
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,170
<i>When you were a little girl.
You had a pair of these. You remember?</i>

107
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,570
<i>I was going to put.. That's okay.</i>

108
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,570
<i>Just going to put them here.</i>

109
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,570
<i>It's okay.</i>

110
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,570
<i>Yeah.</i>

111
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,570
<i>That's it.</i>

112
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,570
<i>Daddy?</i>

113
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:17,570
<i>Oh, no, no, honey.
Honey, no, I'm not your Daddy.</i>

114
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,570
<i>I'm your Daddy's brother.</i>

115
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,570
<i>Remember Uncle Luke?</i>

116
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,570
<i>Dad?</i>

117
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,570
<i>It's okay.</i>

118
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,570
<i>- Dad?
- It's okay.</i>

119
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:59,570
<i>Dr. Gerald Defuses, Your Honour.
The girls have been in my care at the Institute.</i>

120
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,870
<i>- Since they were found 87 days ago.
- And how would you define their progress?</i>

121
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,970
<i>Solid, and outstandingly fast.
If I may?</i>

122
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:17,770
<i>Your Honour, Victoria and Lilly Dosage
were found in deplorable conditions.</i>

123
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:20,571
<i>Isolated, starved.</i>

124
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,570
<i>They feared and distrusted all physical contact.</i>

125
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,970
<i>Their emotional growth was
clearly compromised by their abandonment.</i>

126
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,870
<i>In order to survive such extreme isolation,
the girls created an imaginary guardian.</i>

127
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,270
<i>A parent figure, to feed them,
sing to them, protect them.</i>

128
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,970
<i>They called her: "Mama".</i>

129
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,170
<i>Victoria and Lilly have a real chance
to have a normal life, though.</i>

130
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:55,100
<i>With the right care, physical emotional development,
and much needed love and affection. They'll get better.</i>

131
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,920
<i>Thank you, Dr. Defuses.</i>

132
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,320
<i>Ms. Podolsk. Would you care
to address the Court?</i>

133
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,920
<i>Good morning, Your Honour. Jeffrey Dosage murdered
my niece. And abandoned his daughters in the forest.</i>

134
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,020
<i>And now his brother did an extraordinary thing.
Lucas never gave up on his nieces.</i>

135
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,600
<i>But he did it for the girls. Not for himself.
So, if he still has their best interest at heart,</i>

136
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:22,220
<i>he must know neither his salary, nor his very small
apartment are suitable for the raising of 2 children.</i>

137
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,512
<i>- Let alone, 2 children with a very special needs.
- How many kid did you raise, Jean?</i>

138
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,920
<i>Not as many as you, Lucas.</i>

139
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,220
<i>Of cause she wants the girls, Lucas.
Stand on her shoes first.</i>

140
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,920
<i>She can't just sweep in, and take them.
They are not hers to take.</i>

141
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,620
<i>I'm sure that's not entirely fair.</i>

142
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,920
<i>I'll tell you, what's not fair.
It's not fair is she gets to buy my nieces.</i>

143
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,080
<i>Is that really such a bad thing?</i>

144
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,920
<i>- What?
- Annabel plays in the band..</i>

145
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:49,221
<i>You draw pictures for a living.</i>

146
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,920
<i>Where do you live? Do you have room for
children in your life? I mean, really..</i>

147
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,920
<i>What are you saying, Gerald?</i>

148
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,920
<i>When it comes to the girls' welfare..</i>

149
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,220
<i>Family Court judge is pretty much
oblige to act on my recommendation.</i>

150
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:10,221
<i>And right now, I'll be lying if I didn't
say it was a slam dunk for Ms. Podolsk.</i>

151
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
<i>But the truth is..</i>

152
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,920
<i>I don't want them living on the other
side of the country anymore than you do.</i>

153
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,920
<i>So, we can really really help each other out
right now. You want the girls..</i>

154
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,020
<i>- I need continued access to them.
- What are we going to do?</i>

155
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,720
<i>This house, courtesy of the Institute,
is used for case studies. Rent-free.</i>

156
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,020
<i>- You move to the house, you get the girls.
- This is a joke, right?</i>

157
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:56,219
<i> Mr. Dosage, is your brother still alive?</i>

158
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,920
<i>Oh, son of a bitch.</i>

159
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,020
<i>- Look, Jean..
- No.</i>

160
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:06,220
<i>I just want to see them.
That's all.</i>

161
00:24:06,322 --> 00:24:10,620
<i>You'll see them. I mean, you've got
visitation, right? We respect that.</i>

162
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,420
<i>Right now, we need a little space.
Just work on this thing for a while.</i>

163
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Find their feet.</i>

164
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,021
<i>- Okay?
- Excuse me.</i>

165
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,421
<i>October the 26th.
Although she seems collaborative,</i>

166
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,120
<i>and is quickly recovering her language skills..</i>

167
00:24:29,221 --> 00:24:33,620
<i> Victoria maybe repressing the memory
of her experience in the wilderness.</i>

168
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,420
<i>Okay, Victoria. Are you nice
and relax?</i>

169
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,020
<i>Are you feeling sleepy?</i>

170
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:45,721
<i>I want you to tell me the story again.</i>

171
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:48,522
<i>Can you tell me the story?</i>

172
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,420
<i>It was long time ago, a lady run away
from hospital for sad people.</i>

173
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,220
<i>She took her baby.
She jumped into the water.</i>

174
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,170
<i>How could you know that story, Victoria?</i>

175
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,000
<i>Did Mama tell you that story?</i>

176
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,570
<i>- She showed me.
- How?</i>

177
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,170
<i>In a dream.</i>

178
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,570
<i>Go on, Victoria.</i>

179
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,070
<i>And you can't tell anyone
where you are?</i>

180
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,470
<i>- Nope.
- That's just bizarre, dude.</i>

181
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,370
<i>Yeah, well. For the girls.
Few breaths away.</i>

182
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,990
<i>- So much deplorable.
- All families are the messed up.</i>

183
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,370
<i>Yeah, but this one messed up,
and it ends it.</i>

184
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,570
<i>I don't even have the chance
to screw them up. They came that way.</i>

185
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,470
<i>- Leave him.
- I can't.</i>

186
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,870
<i>You don't sign up for this, babe.</i>

187
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,570
<i>I can't do that to him.</i>

188
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,470
<i>Mrs. Sensitivity,</i>

189
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:07,170
<i>- You are in a rock band.
- I was in a rock band, yeah.</i>

190
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,570
<i>Hey, girls.</i>

191
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,570
<i>Hey, come here.</i>

192
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,470
<i>Mama.</i>

193
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,870
<i>No, don't call me that. I'm not your Mom.
I'm Annabel. You can call me that..</i>

194
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,870
<i>or Annie, or whatever you like.</i>

195
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,870
<i>We could..
We could work it out together, right?</i>

196
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,570
<i>Mama.</i>

197
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,570
<i>Handsome?</i>

198
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:39,471
<i>There are no police reports between 2008 and 2012
that match the patient's story.</i>

199
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,570
<i>And Doctor, there are no psychiatric hospitals
anywhere near Clifton Forge.</i>

200
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:50,570
<i>- Where were the closest one would be?
- Falls Church, 200 miles from here.</i>

201
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:55,570
<i>Now this log book, contains records
from St. Kerch’s asylum.</i>

202
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,470
<i>Abided to Salt Lake.
That's 5 miles north from here.</i>

203
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,470
<i>But you told me that there are no
mental hospitals in the area.</i>

204
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,970
<i>There aren't.
St. Kerch is shut down in 1878.</i>

205
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:15,170
<i>Page 31.
Patient Edith Brennan.</i>

206
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,670
<i>- Annabel?
- Yup?</i>

207
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,170
<i>- Handsome is outside.
- Try to put him there.</i>

208
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,070
<i>But he's crying.</i>

209
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,201
<i>Awesome.</i>

210
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,070
<i>There's no way these kids
are ready for this.</i>

211
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,870
<i>- I know it's tough. It'll get better. I promise.
- I don't know if I can do this, Luke.</i>

212
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,070
<i>I love you, girl.</i>

213
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,070
<i>Someone's here!</i>

214
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:42,670
<i>What?
Victoria, Lilly?</i>

215
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,070
<i>- No one's here.
- Someone's here. I saw them.</i>

216
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,970
<i>- Wow, wow, honey, honey.
- I saw them.</i>

217
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:37,370
<i>Give me the hammer. I'll check downstairs.
You look after the girls.</i>

218
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,570
<i>Lucas?</i>

219
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,870
<i>Oh my God. Lucas?</i>

220
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,370
<i> Hi, it's Vince with Slap Chop.</i>

221
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,870
<i>I'm really sorry, Annabel.</i>

222
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:23,370
<i>But they told me he responded well to the tests.
And it's uh, very likely this coma is temporary.</i>

223
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:28,000
<i>- What happens now?
- I'm afraid I don't follow.</i>

224
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:35,770
<i>Those girls now without Lucas..- Annabel, the girls
need you. They need security, protect ability.</i>

225
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:40,990
<i>But I'm not prepared for this. I can't
do this alone. This is not my job to do.</i>

226
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,200
<i>Just follow, if you not,
you'll lose custody.</i>

227
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,970
<i>And Lucas will be lucky if he sees
his nieces every second at Thanksgiving.</i>

228
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:58,400
<i>Well, I checked out. All the doors and windows
are locked. No evidence of intruder. Nothing's stolen.</i>

229
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,470
<i> - So, I imagined it then, yeah?
All right, thank you, bud.</i>

230
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:07,371
<i>- Mama!..
- Richmond's finest..</i>

231
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,170
<i>Okay, guys.</i>

232
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,170
<i>Just you and me for a while.</i>

233
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,470
<i>I don't know how are you feeling
about that. But we got no choice.</i>

234
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,770
<i>- How they've been affected by all of this?
- They are talking to the walls.</i>

235
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,470
<i>What did they say?</i>

236
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,470
<i>Mama.</i>

237
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,470
<i>What's this?</i>

238
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,370
<i>They made that.</i>

239
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,470
<i> They found a doll
in the cabin, Victoria. </i>

240
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,470
<i>Who made the doll?</i>

241
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,470
<i>Mama.</i>

242
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,970
<i>The doll's called Mama?
Or Mama made the doll? </i>

243
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:33,470
<i>- Mama made the doll.
- And who is Mama?</i>

244
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,470
<i>Are you Mama, Victoria?</i>

245
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,270
<i>This is Dr. Gerald Defuses.
Please leave a message. </i>

246
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,470
<i>Dr. Defuses, this is Louise from
Clifton Forge Public Records. </i>

247
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,470
<i>I found something that
you would want to see.</i>

248
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,470
<i>You guys okay?</i>

249
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,070
<i>What's so funny?</i>

250
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,670
<i>- Good night.
- No!</i>

251
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,770
<i>Whatever.</i>

252
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,470
<i>Nice butt, Bruce.</i>

253
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,470
<i>Victoria..</i>

254
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,770
<i>Come. Mama...</i>

255
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,470
<i>You guys know what time it is?</i>

256
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:22,771
<i>I guess you wouldn't. It's late.
It's really really late.</i>

257
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,970
<i>Don't.</i>

258
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,570
<i>- Don't what?
- Don't close the closet.</i>

259
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,470
<i>Why not? What's in the closet?</i>

260
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:56,009
<i>Nothing.</i>

261
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:25,150
<i>Okay. It's been an along day. So you guys
should get some sleep. Go to bed.</i>

262
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:31,050
<i>You want me to leave the door open?</i>

263
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,150
<i>Good night.</i>

264
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,150
<i>Just tell me about it.</i>

265
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,350
<i>- I think someone's coming to visit them.
- Who?</i>

266
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,150
<i>I don't know.</i>

267
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:56,050
<i>- And you believe that?
- I heard her..</i>

268
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,150
<i>She was.. singing to them,
like a lullaby, or something.</i>

269
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,150
<i>You heard her?</i>

270
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,150
<i>- Definitely a her?
- Yeah.</i>

271
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,150
<i>Sound like this?</i>

272
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:30,090
<i>Yeah, but it was, it was different.
Her voice was deeper.</i>

273
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:35,200
<i>Victoria is showing signs.
A dissociative personality disorder.</i>

274
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,650
<i>I think she could taking on the role
of Mama. Literally, becoming her.</i>

275
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,650
<i>It's treatable.
With time and patience.</i>

276
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:46,990
<i>- Am I safe?
- What? Look, she's 8 years old.</i>

277
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,650
<i>Give me a break.</i>

278
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,150
<i>I found second entry under the name of
that woman. - Edith Brennan?</i>

279
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,950
<i>Not Edith Brennan.</i>

280
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:17,951
<i>Welcome to isle 17, Doctor.
Every archive has one.</i>

281
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:22,050
<i>Lost and found of things
people don't want to find.</i>

282
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,750
<i>Twenty years ago, when they moved
to Clifton Forge cemetery.</i>

283
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:31,550
<i>Some of the oldest, smallest remains,
were not claimed by the relatives.</i>

284
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,350
<i>They were sent here to be filed.</i>

285
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,544
<i>I'm not a religious person, but I do
believe, there's a place for human remains.</i>

286
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:44,150
<i>And that's not on the shelf
in a Government building.</i>

287
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,650
<i>Do you believe in ghosts?</i>

288
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,650
<i>I can't say that I do.</i>

289
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:06,540
<i>When a corpse is left out.
The elements withered. Desiccated..</i>

290
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:12,151
<i>Twisting it into a distorted figure that's
barely recognizable as a human being.</i>

291
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:20,550
<i>A ghost is an emotion went out of shape.
Condemned to repeat itself, time and time again.</i>

292
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:24,150
<i>Until it rights the wrong that was done.</i>

293
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,650
<i>- What's this?
- The wrong.</i>

294
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,650
<i>- Jeff?
- Save my girls...</i>

295
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,650
<i>Go to the cabin.. </i>

296
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,650
<i>He seizures. Hold him still.</i>

297
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,650
<i>- Lorazepam. 4 milligrams.
- 4 milligrams of lorazepam.</i>

298
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,650
<i>- Fever?
- No fever, doctor.</i>

299
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:49,949
<i> You kicked me out of the bed. Checked on
the girls. That as much as I remember. </i>

300
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:54,150
<i>- For I know that you took me..
- I would've managed the job..</i>

301
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,350
<i>- Oh, you drew me a picture.
- It's a raccoon.</i>

302
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,590
<i>Thank you. I do something
for you guys too.</i>

303
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:13,550
<i>- Here you go. You like it?
- Yeah.</i>

304
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:19,849
<i> It's cute. So, how was it?
Was it a tunnel? With the light at the end? </i>

305
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:24,350
<i>Oh yeah, that was good.
Also I stepped into the light.</i>

306
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,550
<i>So, how was it been?
How is the single Mom?</i>

307
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:32,150
<i>- That's great.
- Yeah?</i>

308
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,250
<i>- They're terrible. They hate me.
- They don't hate you.</i>

309
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:42,550
<i>So easy for you to say. You're like
the cool uncle. - I am the cool uncle.</i>

310
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,450
<i>What?
What is it, Annie?</i>

311
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:51,150
<i>Just get well soon, so you can come home,
and clean their mess, please?</i>

312
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,850
<i>- You sure about this?
- Yeah.</i>

313
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,650
<i>You okay?</i>

314
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:14,650
<i>What are you doing in here?</i>

315
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:19,650
<i>Here, I'll help.</i>

316
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:28,550
<i>- What is it?
- I don't want you to get hurt.</i>

317
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:35,350
<i>What do you mean? I'm fine.
Nothing bad is going to happened.</i>

318
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,600
<i>- You can't do that.
- Why?</i>

319
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,150
<i>She gets jealous.</i>

320
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,050
<i>Hey, wait!</i>

321
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,650
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

322
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,550
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, Jean.</i>

323
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,750
<i>How can I help?</i>

324
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:14,950
<i>It's my day.</i>

325
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:18,850
<i>- Are you sure. I thought that was Thursday.
- It is Thursday.</i>

326
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,050
<i>- Sorry about the mess.
- Children make mess. It's how it works.</i>

327
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,950
<i>- How are they?
- Adorsey. You want coffee?</i>

328
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,050
<i>Thank you.</i>

329
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,050
<i>Oh my God. What is this?</i>

330
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:38,050
<i>- I know, they're wild sometimes.
- It's not an excuse.</i>

331
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,550
<i>Hey, now. They're bruises.
Kids get bruise.</i>

332
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,300
<i>- This bruise?
- It's not like that.</i>

333
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,050
<i>- Let me have them.
- Sorry?</i>

334
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:56,600
<i>Just for a few days. You can umm.. I don't know.
Play with your band, have a drink with your friends.</i>

335
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:03,900
<i>Jean, I think it's great. But the girls
have relationship with their own. I really really do.</i>

336
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:08,050
<i>But right now, I need you to get out
of my house. Before I kick your ass.</i>

337
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:19,650
<i>- I'll see you both very soon, okay?
- Hey!</i>

338
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,650
<i>- Do you've been coming around here?
- I beg your pardon?</i>

339
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,100
<i>Do you've been coming at the house,
playing with girls? - Of cause not! Why?</i>

340
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,150
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

341
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,150
<i>Richmond.
Social Services.</i>

342
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:45,150
<i>Who should I speak to if I
believe my nieces are being abused?</i>

343
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:52,150
<i>Well, what kind of evidence
do I need exactly?</i>

344
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,750
<i>- How the hell did you forget?
- Are you kidding me?</i>

345
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,700
<i>You know she wants to take
the girls from us.</i>

346
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,350
<i>I'm exhausted, I'm sorry.
I forgot today is her day.</i>

347
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:07,350
<i>Jesus Christ, Annie. It's one visit.
It's not much to remember.</i>

348
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,600
<i>Annie, listen. They're just kids.
All you got to do is..</i>

349
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:15,200
<i>What? Chill out? Take it easy?
You know I can't do this. This is not my job.</i>

350
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,150
<i>This is your job. - I'm out of here
in a day, just hold it together until then.</i>

351
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,990
<i>All right, fine, yeah. We'll see what
happens then. - I'll take care of them..</i>

352
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,150
<i>Those girls are the important thing
in the world to me..</i>

353
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,150
<i>- Awesome..
- Annie, you..</i>

354
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,050
<i>Okay, Victoria.</i>

355
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,550
<i>Are you nice and relax?</i>

356
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:52,150
<i>Are you feeling sleepy?</i>

357
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,450
<i>I'd like you to tell me
about Mama.</i>

358
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,150
<i>Did she live in that house with you?</i>

359
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,150
<i>The house by the lake..</i>

360
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,850
<i>Where did she live?</i>

361
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,150
<i>In the walls.</i>

362
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,150
<i>Where is she now?</i>

363
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,150
<i>I don't know.</i>

364
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,650
<i>I think you know. I think
you know where she is.</i>

365
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,600
<i>Where is she, Victoria?</i>

366
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:43,950
<i>Is she here, in this house?
Did she come with you?</i>

367
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:49,150
<i>Open your eyes, Victoria.</i>

368
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,950
<i>Look at this photograph,
is this Mama?</i>

369
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,607
<i>- Is this Mama, Victoria?
- Go away!</i>

370
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,950
<i>- Tell me about her.
- No!</i>

371
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,550
<i>Yes!</i>

372
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,900
<i>- What's going on?
- Nothing. Nothing's going on.</i>

373
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:32,750
<i>- Gerald, what happened?
- I have to go. I'll call you.</i>

374
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:51,150
<i>November third..</i>

375
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,050
<i>The seventh session was more
than revealing.</i>

376
00:57:55,150 --> 00:58:01,950
<i> I think I have found the door, a passage,
that connects Helvetia into this house..</i>

377
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:08,050
<i> There is no rational explanation
that supports this theory. </i>

378
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,450
<i>But it is only the ability to embrace
the different reality,</i>

379
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:16,450
<i>that makes science expand beyond
the limits of what we know..</i>

380
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,850
<i> However, extraordinary claims
require extraordinary proof. </i>

381
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:32,550
<i> I'm never this close than ever,
to the real subject to my research. </i>

382
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:38,650
<i>I will come back from Clifton Forge,
with an answer.</i>

383
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:36,951
<i>No! </i>

384
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:58,152
<i>Make her stop! </i>

385
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:53,850
<i>What's wrong?</i>

386
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,850
<i>What's under the bed?</i>

387
01:01:05,851 --> 01:01:06,851
<i>Victoria?</i>

388
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,600
<i>Victoria. Come. Mama.</i>

389
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,300
<i>Victoria. Come. Mama.</i>

390
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:42,100
<i>Victoria stay.</i>

391
01:03:14,009 --> 01:03:15,499
<i>Mama?</i>

392
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,100
<i>Where, Mama?</i>

393
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,100
<i>I know your name.</i>

394
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,800
<i>I know what you want.</i>

395
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,800
<i>Lilly?</i>

396
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,200
<i>Lilly, are you okay?</i>

397
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,800
<i>How did you get down here?</i>

398
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,800
<i>You shitting me. Are you shitting me?
Come, you crazy.</i>

399
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,400
<i>Okay.</i>

400
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,500
<i>Stop!</i>

401
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,900
<i>Stop it!</i>

402
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,990
<i>Stop.</i>

403
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,700
<i>It's okay. Come on.</i>

404
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,800
<i>What?</i>

405
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,800
<i>You like that?</i>

406
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,800
<i>Okay.</i>

407
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:18,900
<i>Okay. Door's good, window's bad. So, if
you want to go outside, what do we do?</i>

408
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,700
<i>- We use the stairs?
- Right. Lilly?</i>

409
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,300
<i>We took stairs?</i>

410
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:34,600
<i>Yeah, that's excellent. Okay.
Let's go get breakfast.</i>

411
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,200
<i>Oh, God!</i>

412
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,000
<i>Lilly, you scared the crap out of me.</i>

413
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,700
<i>Annabel, breakfast is ready!</i>

414
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,300
<i>I'll be right down!</i>

415
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,900
<i>Annabel, Lilly's hungry!</i>

416
01:09:06,105 --> 01:09:07,564
<i>Annabel?</i>

417
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,509
<i>Yeah.</i>

418
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:36,756
<i>Victoria. You and Dr. Defuses, you guys
talk some.. I mean, you guys talked a lot, right?</i>

419
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,547
<i>Victoria, Dr. Defuses and I,
we talked some too.</i>

420
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,994
<i>We talked about Mama.</i>

421
01:09:51,973 --> 01:09:57,355
<i>You and Dr. Defuses. You..
You guys talked about Mama too, right?</i>

422
01:10:03,693 --> 01:10:05,917
<i>Where is Mama, Victoria?</i>

423
01:10:11,661 --> 01:10:14,608
<i>This is Dr. Gerald Defuses.
Please leave a message.</i>

424
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:19,739
<i>Hey, it's Annabel. I need to talk to you.
So, please call me whenever you get this.</i>

425
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:21,739
<i>Okay, thanks. Bye.</i>

426
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,114
<i>Yes, I talked to him, sir.
Two and a half hours ago.</i>

427
01:11:10,705 --> 01:11:12,115
<i>I'm sure you are.. </i>

428
01:11:13,506 --> 01:11:19,116
<i> I just don't understand. I am afraid that
something bad may have happened to the doctor.  </i>

429
01:11:25,807 --> 01:11:27,044
<i>You okay?</i>

430
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:38,107
<i>Sit!</i>

431
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,140
<i>Come on. Get your clothes.</i>

432
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:33,703
<i>Richmond. I need a number
for enterprise that rent a car.</i>

433
01:12:34,629 --> 01:12:35,661
<i>Yeah.</i>

434
01:13:56,009 --> 01:13:57,399
<i>Dosage</i>

435
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,802
<i>Mama - by Dr. Gerald Defuses</i>

436
01:14:23,866 --> 01:14:27,003
<i>Dr. Defuses:
I want you to tell me the story again.</i>

437
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,760
<i>Can you tell me the story?</i>

438
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:36,303
<i>It was a long time ago, a lady run away
from the hospital for sad people.</i>

439
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,303
<i>She took her baby.</i>

440
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,504
<i>She jumped into the water.</i>

441
01:14:42,214 --> 01:14:46,805
<i>How could you know the story, Victoria?
Did Mama tell you that story?</i>

442
01:14:48,672 --> 01:14:51,500
<i>- She showed me.
- How? </i>

443
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:54,448
<i>- In a dream
- Go on.</i>

444
01:14:54,485 --> 01:14:58,907
<i>She fell into the water,
but the baby didn't.</i>

445
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,397
<i>Why?</i>

446
01:15:02,858 --> 01:15:04,034
<i>I don't know.</i>

447
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,909
<i>- What could've happened to the baby, Victoria?
- I don't know. </i>

448
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:14,168
<i>Mama didn't show you?</i>

449
01:15:14,928 --> 01:15:17,969
<i>She doesn't know what happened
to her baby. </i>

450
01:15:24,555 --> 01:15:31,200
<i>She went walking in the woods.  Looking
for it. She searched for a very long time. </i>

451
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:32,545
<i>And then?</i>

452
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:38,046
<i>- Then she found us.
- Why are you crying, Victoria? </i>

453
01:15:38,726 --> 01:15:40,421
<i>Because she's sad..</i>

454
01:15:44,026 --> 01:15:45,421
<i>Disenterrement Request</i>

455
01:15:47,023 --> 01:15:50,002
<i>Is she sad, or are you sad, Victoria?</i>

456
01:15:51,662 --> 01:15:56,020
<i> Where is Mama?
Is she here with us?</i>

457
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:01,645
<i>- Can you show me Mama?
- She won't come here. </i>

458
01:16:01,794 --> 01:16:03,052
<i>Why not? </i>

459
01:16:04,985 --> 01:16:07,845
<i>Because she knows through watching. </i>

460
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:42,100
<i>This isn't Annabel. Leave your message
after the beep. Fuck you. Beep.. </i>

461
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,861
<i>Annabel?</i>

462
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,652
<i>Hey, Victoria.</i>

463
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,433
<i>- Are you, okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

464
01:17:24,224 --> 01:17:25,812

469
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,853
<i>Don't look at her!</i>

470
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,234
<i>She's mad.</i>

471
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,935
<i>Go up!</i>

472
01:20:29,405 --> 01:20:31,918
<i>Open the door!</i>

473
01:20:47,258 --> 01:20:49,710
<i>- Victoria, what's going on? - Annabel.
- Are you okay?</i>

474
01:20:50,002 --> 01:20:51,865
<i>It's Lilly!</i>

475
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,744

01:20:56,008 --> 01:20:57,540
<i>Are you okay?</i>

477
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,625
<i>Mama, stop it!
You promise!</i>

478
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,939
<i>Leave her alone!</i>

479

486
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:30,698

- What the hell's happening?</i>

493
01:25:51,536 --> 01:25:56,104
<i>She's going to kill them. We got to get to the cabin.
She was here with them the whole time.</i>

494
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,048
