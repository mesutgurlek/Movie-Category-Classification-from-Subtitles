and we have a rental on Sycamore Lane.

315
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,233
And you wanted to know
if I thought it was possible

316
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,945
you had a 17-year-old daughter.
I would have to say no.

317
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,826
It's actually about Ryan Jacobson.

318
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,238
He drove my daughter home
the other night.

319
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,125
I was just wondering if you
knew anything about him. If he's...

320
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,079
OK?

321
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,124
Yeah.

322
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,748
Finding out that your parents
were murdered,

323
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,794
by your own sister, God,
that's really intense.

324
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,134
You'd think people would show him
a little bit of sympathy, right?

325
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,844
You know, I drove three hours upstate
personally to tell Ryan.

326
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,478
He was living with his aunt,
a senile old woman.

327
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:27,562
He had no one taking care of him.
He was taking care of her, actually.

328
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,069
Anyway, he moved back here with her,
she died about a year ago.

329
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,823
The Kid's had a tough, tough life.

330
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,701
Look, I've never had
any problem with him,

331
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,657
and as far as I know,
no one else has either.

332
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,199
But they sure like to bitch about him
and their property values, don't they?

333
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,118
Yeah, I have heard people doing that.

334
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,583
- 710-49 at Main and Jackson. Over.
- Excuse me.

335
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,292
OK.

336
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,004
Sorry. I gotta go.

337
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,469
Thanks, officer.

338
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,848
Oh, hey, no.
it's, uh, Bill, OK?

339
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,216
Bill.

340
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,932
- I'll see you around?
- Yeah.

341
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,303
- Hi.
- Hey.

342
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,216
I... made you a CD.

343
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,845
Wow, thank you.

Oh, my gosh, my page.

345
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,109
Yeah... I wanted to listen
to some more of your music.

346
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,241
That's not weird, is it?

347
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,404
No. Not unless you didn't like it.

348
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,076
No, actually,
I thought it was beautiful.

349
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,246
Good answer. Whoa!

350
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,457
Stocking up
the old fallout shelter, huh?

351
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,804
Um, yeah. I don't like to go to town
more than I have to.

352
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,822
Wow, it's big.

353
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,577
What's up there?

354
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,459
Construction never really got finished
on this part of the house.

355
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:57,625
I don't have a wall or anything,
but I moved back here when I came back.

356
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,673
It's a little bit small.

357
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,589
Well, at least you're not a sleepwalker.

358
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,352
- ls this the family?
- Yeah.

Oh, Ryan, you're so cute.

360
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,901
And that's Carrie Anne.

361
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,904
Wow. Her eyes are so blue.

362
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,743
Your family looks really happy.

363
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,290
It must've been nice,
having everyone together.

364
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,331
Having two parents.

365
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,457
Carrie Anne was the head of the family.

366
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,294
After the accident, things changed.

367
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,469
Is that when they sent you away?

368
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,931
I've never really talked to anyone
about this stuff before.

We ran around, we'd play tag.

379
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,367
Her favorite thing
was to play on the swings.

380
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,538
My mom and dad were inside.

381

I was supposed to be watching her.

382

RYAN: When she woke up,
she was different.

387
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,866
She used to scream all the time,

388
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,999
and she would attack us
and break things.

389
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,202
Is that why there are bars
on all the windows?

Yeah.

391
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,379
She never knew where she was.
She would...

392
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:50,048
She'd run out into the woods.
They were to keep her in.

393
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,262
Now they just keep the townies
from coming down here.

394
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,354

into this part of the house.

You went to his house?

Ryan, Elissa has just started in
a new school, and I want her to do well,

478
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,369
and it's really one of the reasons
we even moved here.

And she is in high school
and you are in college...

Mom, what is your point?

481

I think Ryan knows
exactly what my point is.

We are neighbors,
and I want us to be friends,

SARAH: Oh, God,
I invited him over last night,

504
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,996
and then I threw him out

505
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,661
and I told him I didn't want him
to be alone with Elissa.

506
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:32,002
So Elissa's not talking to me,

507
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,838
and I'm sure Ryan
thinks I'm against him,

508
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,629
like everyone else
in this ridiculous town.

509
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,843
Ryan's a smart kid, I'm sure he gets it.

510
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,219
I mean, I'm not stupid.
I can't keep her away from boys.

511
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,309
But I just don't want her to make
the same mistake I always make,

512
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,599
which is pick the wrong boy.

513
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,518
She just still treats me
like I'm a child.

514
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,938
That's lame.

515
00:46:55,104 --> 00:47:00,326
She was just getting wasted and trashy
and he was so nice and gentle.

516
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,909
She didn't even care, she still talked
to him like he was a monster.

517
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,244
That's what she does.
She picks the most damaged kid around,

518
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,751
and then she makes them into a project.

519

know, Ryan 's just part of that pattern.
