00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:17,956
Hi, O'Shea, isn't it? Ciarán?

23
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,497
My name is Lisa Nolan, Garda Lisa Nolan.

24
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,830
- You are not serious?
- What?

25
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:28,955
You getting in or what?

26
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,412
- I have a bag.
- Put it in the boot.

27
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:54,410
- Would you like a mint?
- Hmm?

28
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,827
No, thanks. They give me a heartburn.

29
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:19,277
Garda Nolan. 'Tis lovely to have you.

30
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:21,317
- Lovely to be here.
- Lovely to have you.

31
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:22,235
Oh... coffee.

32
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,944
Oh, that'll be great,
thank you. Here you go.

33
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:31,046
So...

34
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:34,109
- What do you think of the place?
- It's gorgeous, isn't it?

35
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:37,818
- It is, indeed. 'Tis, indeed.
- Quiet as shite.

36
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:41,233
- Milk?
- What kind?

37
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:45,483
- Cow's.
- I'll just take a black, thanks.

38
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,608
So, you are gonna have
my desk, when I'm gone.

39
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:52,028
O'Shea here will tell you, with half the
island leaving for the show on Dungary,

40
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,316
it'll be dead this weekend.

41
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,066
- I'm sure I'll find something to do.
- Sure you will.

42
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:58,899
- Here you go now.
- Thanks.

43
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:07,148
- She really necessary?
- Do tell me, boy.

44
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:10,231
You are only gone two weeks.
I can handle two weeks.

45
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,065
You could, but you wouldn't!

46
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:31,469
Tadhg, take a look at this.

47
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,687
It's a big 'un.

48
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,437
- That's not a lobster.
- Then what is it?

49
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:47,852
Feck! You bastard, you! Paddy!
You knew it was going to do that.

50
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:49,786
I didn't, on me life.

51
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:52,686
Ugh! The smell!

52
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,935
- What is it?
- 'Tis no fekkin' lobster!

53
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,934
I had some holidays saved,
that needed to be taken, and...

54
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:18,058
this posting came up and I just thought,
you know, "What harm? Why not?"

55
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,722
Can't hurt with the
Review Board, you know.

56
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,349
Ah... the old Review Board.

57
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,474
- Where are you stationed?
- Dublin Central.

58
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:28,140
- How's that working out for you?
- Oh, it's great.

59
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:31,723
We've got our drugs, muggings,
murders and rapes. Always on the go.

60
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:36,057
Oh, it's exciting. You can relax,
there's none of that here.

61
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,181
You never know. It's always the quiet
places where the mad shit happens.

62
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:42,514
Just open a paper.

63
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:56,263
In all my years, I've never
seen anything like it.

64
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,846
Lisa Nolan. Jim Gleeson, local doctor.

65
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,512
- Hello, love, how are you?
- Grand, thanks.

66
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:04,726
Wouldn't have any aspirin
on you, would you, Jim?

67
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:08,012
I have a couple of wine gums.
Would you like a wine gum?

68
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:12,094
- All right.
- Look who's here.

69
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:15,678
I'd prefer it if you'd
introduced me as 'Garda Nolan'.

70
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:18,094
- Nobody minds.
- I do.

71
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:22,135
- What happened?
- Yeah... one second.

72
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,926
- Smith.
- Lisa.

73
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:36,626
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:39,092
Smith's a marine psychologist
or something.

75
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:43,301
- Did I get that right?
- No, it's marine ecology.

76
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:46,729
Will you hold this a second?
So, how long are you here for?

77
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,979
I'm here two weeks.

78
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,010
Oh, wonderful. Whereabouts you staying?

79
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:55,130
So... they are dead.

80
00:10:55,914 --> 00:11:00,090
Dead? Oh, no. They are just sleeping.

81
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,214
- So, what happened?
- Well...

82
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,958
They are pilot whales.

83
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,047
It happens with them from time to time,
but no one really knows why.

84
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,047
And what are all these deep cuts?

85
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,922
Possible wounds from the rocks,
while being washed up here.

86
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:26,671
- They didn't beach themselves?
- Oh, no. They died at sea.

87
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:30,004
All of them? At once?

88
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:36,171
- Yeah, it's a strange one all right.
- Yeah.

89
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:37,505
- Squeamish?
- No.

90
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:38,911
- No?
- No.

91
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:40,545
Good to know.
Okay, there's an orifice...

92
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,697
What's that?

93
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:53,752
- What is that?
- That.

94
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:55,627
It's a hand in a claw position?

95
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,544
It's a dead one of those.

96
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,084
That's global, isn't it?

97
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:05,709
- I don't get it.
- You don't get it?

98
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,001
- No.
- What's not to get?

99
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:10,833
"What's that? It's a dead one of those"

100
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,875
No.

101
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,292
Don't get it.

102
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,617
You there, what's your name?

103
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:44,705
Chemisov Wlodzimierz Voychehovski.

104
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,997
Carry on.

105
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,163
Hey, Daly! Where is Cooney?

106
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:06,537
Put that cigarette out, or I go down and
use your top of your knob as an ashtray.

107
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:39,772
You busy?

108
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:42,659
Not at all. Just strip
'em down, and I take 'em.

109
00:13:42,742 --> 00:13:46,075
- Where's the sarge?
- He's away on his holiday.

110
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,408
- Leave me up shit creek.
- Why? What's up with you?

111
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,658
Remember that favour you owe me?

112
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:59,615
Well, I'm looking for some boys to help
move a few 'things' off the beach there.

113
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:03,157
It's an hour's work, tops.

114
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,948
What sorta... things?

115
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,988
Let's get outta here.

116
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,405
Whale sandwiches forever, huh?

117
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:30,087
Daly! The shovels!

118
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:33,529
- What?
- Don't be leaving things behind, you!

119
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:36,112
- Going, sir!
- Gobshite (idiot).

120
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,647
Brilliant.

121
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:56,854
Daly!

122
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:59,521
Where are you, you gobshite?

123
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:11,270
Daly!

124
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:17,352
<i>...last night, but by the time the Coast
Guard arrived at the scene, the men...</i>

125
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,185
<i>were no longer on board. With bad
weather set to hamper tomorrow's search,</i>

126
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,616
<i>the hope of finding the
missing fishermen alive,</i>

127
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,310
<i>has grown bleaker by the hour.</i>

128
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:28,726
<i>Officials believe, the crew of the
Sea Harvester were washed overboard...</i>

129
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:31,101
Hi, I'm just looking for an iron.

130
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:32,759
Yeah, I'll just go and
hock it out for ya.

131
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,476
Great, thanks.

132
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:41,267
- Hiya.
- Hi.

133
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,165
- That's you.
- Thanks.

134
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,875
Now, it gets very hot,
so just keep it moving, yeah?

135
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,724
Okay, thank you. See you tomorrow.

136
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:58,766
As a woman, to a man,
now I tell you, O'Shea,

137
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:01,556
there's a twinkle in the
eye in there for you.

138
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,848
- What?
- He'll be up in a minute!

139
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:10,890
You like her?

140
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:13,472
She's all right. A little uptight.

141
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:16,472
- You should talk to her.
- I do talk to her.

142
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:19,972
- I mean, talk to her.
- Ah, leave him off, Una.

143
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:25,763
Do you listen to him? Eight years, I was
waiting for him to go down on his knee.

144
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,730
Have you ever heard the like of it?

145
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:30,638
My family thought I was mad,
wasting my time on him.

146
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:34,720
- Ah, feck them.
- Ah, feck you, Brian.

147
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:42,345
- Same again?
- Pour on.

148
00:17:56,926 --> 00:18:01,593
- What is it, Paddy?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

149
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:04,635
- Not really, no.
- You would, though.

150
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:08,217
- No, not really.
- You would.

151
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,800
If you were to know what I know,
you'd want to know.

152
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,841
- All right, tell us then.
- Right, you are.

153
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:22,891
Between you and me, I caught
meself a sea monster today.

154
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:26,465
Swear to God, may He strike me down.

155
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:28,965
- You don't believe me?
- Not a bit.

156
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:30,084
I am not a liar.

157
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,215
- Huh!
- Feck off, you!

158
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:34,548
All right, where is it?

159
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:41,547
- In me bathtub.
- In your bathtub?

160
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:44,131
Having a bath.

161
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:55,171
Good night, Paddy.

162
00:18:56,505 --> 00:19:00,045
Ignorant bollocks.

163
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:02,004
- What?
- Huh?

164
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:04,629
- What did you say?
- Nothing, didn't say a word.

165
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:07,254
He called you a bollix (idiot).

166
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:09,927
If this wasn't the only fekkin'
pub on this shittin' island,

167
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,003
I'd piss in it sooner than come in here!

168
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:14,711
Fine, you are barred.

169
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:17,586
Ah... I am joking. Come on now,
another one here now.

170
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:30,085
<i>They are coming to get you, Barbara.</i>

171
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:38,292
<i>- They are coming for you.
- Stop it! You are acting like a child!</i>

172
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:41,376
<i>They are coming for you, Barbara.</i>

173
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:43,039
<i>Look! There comes one of them now!</i>

174
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,875
<i>- He'll hear you!
- Here he comes now.</i>

175
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,500
Irene! Irene!

176
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,208
- What?
- Someone's at the door!

177
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,624
I'm not dressed!

178
00:19:57,457 --> 00:20:00,374
All right, all right.

179
00:20:00,457 --> 00:20:04,581
That better not be Paddy
and his stinking lobster.

180
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:17,538
It's the bloody Declan Cooney,
and he's pissed as a fart.

181
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:20,913
Don't give that cowboy any money. You're
gonna piss it up against the wall!

182
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:32,162
Cooney, you look like death.
What are you doing?

183
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,828
What does he want?

184
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,953
To dance?

185
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,494
Jesus, Cooney! Are you all right, mate?

186
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:54,410
Cooney?

187
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,911
Tadhg! Tadhg! Tadhg!

188
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:06,543
- Tadhg!
- Oh, my God!...

189
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,042
Tadhg! Oh! Tadhg!

190
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,543
Irene!

191
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:25,243
Tadhg! Tadhg!

192
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:41,447
Okay... okay... okay...

193
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:45,622
Okay...

194
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,239
Sweet Jesus Christ, okay...

195
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:57,446
Okay, okay, this is easy.
Okay, okay, okay, I can do this.

196
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,150
- Hi.
- Come on down for a drink.

197
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:44,858
No, I have work tomorrow.

198
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,253
You know, it doesn't matter.

199
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:51,733
Nobody's checking up on you.
It doesn't matter out here.

200
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:54,066
- You are drunk.
- No, I'm not. No.

201
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:55,440
Is that right?

202
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,640
Say the alphabet backwards for me.

203
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,341
Em...

204
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:06,747
Zed...

205
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:11,581
Et cetera.

206
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:19,105
- I hope you are not driving.
- I'm taking Johnny's horse, yah...

207
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:20,963
You are gonna ride a
horse while intoxicated?

208
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:22,813
Yeah, so, the horse is sober.

209
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:26,688
- Well, that's just brilliant.
- It's great.

210
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:28,020
It's great that you are in charge here.

211
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:33,354
Em, listen, em...

212
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:36,087
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

213
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,811
It's okay. I'm fine.

214
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,185
It's nothing.

215
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,977
Last drink's gone straight to me head.

216
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:03,642
Do you get this drunk every night?

217
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:08,184
Just... high days and holidays.

218
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:10,767
Let's get you to bed.

219
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,308
Now you are talking.

220
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,724
Brian, ugh...

221
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:31,169
Oh, ya little... such pa...

222
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:08,211
Desist herself.

223
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,005
Do I have something to sign?

224
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,797
Oh, yes, the big one.

225
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:17,547
- Looks like it should be nice out.
- There's a storm coming.

226
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,975
Really? Are the gulls
flying low or something?

227
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:22,754
No, it was on the telly.

228
00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:29,379
- You are not married, Lise, are you?
- No.

229
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:34,295
Like O'Shea.

230
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:37,087
- Well, widowed.
- Widowed?

231
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,161
He wouldn't tell you.
No, he's a very private fella.

232
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:41,752
With a few drinks and a nog, it might
come up, but not normally, no.

233
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,952
There's no need for him to be
here, really. I think it's...

234
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:45,502
bit of a sabbatical.

235
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:49,944
Oh, if you need, at any stage,
a bigger bed, I have a lovely room,

236
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,168
'The Honeymoon Suite', usually we
call it, off the back of the hotel.

237
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:54,554
- It's very quiet.
- No, thank you.

238
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:57,668
It has much bigger beds. If there's two
instead of one, you know you are salved.

239
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:00,751
Because next week, we have a huge stag
party from Dublin, so if you want...

240
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:03,750
- the bigger room, now is to book it.
- Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

241
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:06,250
- All right, Lisa, have a great day!
- Thank you!

242
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,541
Morning!

243
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:25,457
Nice place you've got here.
Close to the beach, all mod cons.

244
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,707
What happened?

245
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,165
Section 4.1 of the Public Order Act:

246
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:32,562
"It is an offence for any person...

247
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:34,665
to be present in any public
place while intoxicated...

248
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:38,497
to such an extent as would give rise
to a reasonable apprehension... "

249
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:41,789
You arrested me?

250
00:27:41,872 --> 00:27:45,081
You passed out before I
could find your house.

251
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,038
Garda Nolan.

252
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:55,705
But I get a reward for
discovering it, a finder's fee.

253
00:27:55,788 --> 00:28:00,120
- We'll discuss it later.
- But I get something, right?

254
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:07,821
Ugh.

255
00:28:09,578 --> 00:28:11,703
Is that your professional opinion?

256
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:13,541
- A grabber.
- A what?

257
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:15,911
I've told you, Paddy,
I'm not calling it that.

258
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,993
It needs a name that defines it's genus.

259
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:23,035
- I discovered it. I get to name it.
- All right. Hi.

260
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,831
Hi.

261
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:27,254
Hi.

262
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,742
Hello.

263
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:35,909
- What is that thing?
- I haven't a clue.

264
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:41,200
I've never seen anything like it before.
It's a completely foreign species.

265
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:43,366
I can't even begin
to origin it or class it.

266
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,116
- A grabber.
- Paddy.

267
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,783
- It has attacked you?
- Stalked on the ceiling, it was.

268
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:51,824
- Nearly ripped me throat off.
- It's dead, right?

269
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:54,949
- Um, I'm not sure.
- You are not what?

270
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:58,740
The basic tests I've done so far have
shown up nothing usual or normal.

271
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:01,157
It is beyond mystifying.

272
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,364
I mean, really, I can't be
sure without opening it up.

273
00:29:07,823 --> 00:29:09,989
'Tis dead.

274
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:15,238
Would you stop doing that?
Is it any wonder it bit you.

275
00:29:15,322 --> 00:29:20,113
- What's that in it's mouth?
- That... is it's tongue.

276
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:22,113
Check it out.

277
00:29:27,154 --> 00:29:30,737
Spits like a frog and strangles ya.

278
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:32,946
Whip it fast and sharp.

279
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:35,815
So, I'm guessing this creature
bleeds it's prey like a leech,

280
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:40,861
consuming the blood like
some sort of Vampyroteuthis.

281
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,445
- Vampyro what?
- Vampyroteuthis.

282
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:49,027
It's a rare deep-sea squid,
but no, this is not that, no.

283
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,694
This is something totally
different, something alien.

284
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:58,318
You know, in that it's
undocumented, not from...

285
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:02,109
- It's gotta be worth a fortune.
- Oh, but... here's the thing.

286
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,817
When I tried to clean some dirt off it,

287
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,442
Well, I stood on it a few times.

288
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:14,650
this happened.

289
00:30:21,524 --> 00:30:25,232
- What's that mean?
- All this thing needs to survive...

290
00:30:25,316 --> 00:30:28,648
is blood and water.

291
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:33,481
Could you put it on the eBay?
Do you think?

292
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:37,940
You are not putting this on eBay.
You are so lucky she didn't kill you.

293
00:30:38,023 --> 00:30:42,439
- She?
- Yeah, it's a... Sorry, excuse me.

294
00:30:42,522 --> 00:30:46,072
Yeah, it's a female,
from what I can tell.

295
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:47,232
How can you tell?

296
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,604
How can I tell? Well,
it's got no testicles.

297
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:57,104
- And...
- Takes a scientist to realise that.

298
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:01,395
Indeed, O'Shea. She was pregnant.

299
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:09,562
That's disgusting.

300
00:31:09,645 --> 00:31:12,159
Well, a small fly in the
ointment there, Smith.

301
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,102
How did that big egg come out of that?

302
00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:20,936
Mother Nature's a
mysterious woman, isn't she?

303
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:24,893
Incredibly beautiful. Are you related?

304
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:28,518
Do you think that grabber thing...

305
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,893
could have anything to do
with those dead whales?

306
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:34,017
- What makes you say that?
- Just a hunch, you know.

307
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,267
- Oh, you get hunches now?
- No, I watch a lot of Columbo.

308
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:44,266
- Why have we stopped?
- That's Declan Cooney's car.

309
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:49,933
Cooney!

310
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:01,682
- Where could he be?
- Nowhere without his keys.

311
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:07,889
- You believe in coincidences?
- Not really.

312
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:10,639
Neither do I. Come on.

313
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:19,763
One of the light's on. So, how
come you are not in uniform?

314
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:21,504
- It's Sunday.
- Ah.

315
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:22,846
Neither are you.

316
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,054
Suits ya. You look nice.

317
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,179
- Smith's a nice fella, isn't he?
- "Positively smashing. "

318
00:32:34,262 --> 00:32:38,011
He's a proper gentleman,
and such polite company.

319
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:40,761
Yeah, he's like you, married to his job.

320
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:44,636
I'm not... I take pride in my work.

321
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:45,611
Unlike you.

322
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:49,343
Shh... I'm working.

323
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,635
You are looking in the
wrong place, Columbo.

324
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:57,718
Okay, hold it steady.

325
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:01,879
You're something else, you know that?

326
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,634
You should have joined
the Army, not the Guards.

327
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,652
Stop talking to yourself,
it's very distracting.

328
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:07,467
I'm not talking to meself,
I'm talking to you.

329
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:08,768
Uh-huh.

330
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:12,841
Great! Something up here.

331
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:16,758
Could you be a bit more specific?

332
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:24,174
It stinks like that thing.

333
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,882
It's stuck on something.

334
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:32,923
Jesus!

335
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:36,381
Jesus! Crap, me nose!

336
00:33:36,423 --> 00:33:38,423
It's a head!

337
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:51,422
- What killed him, Jim?
- The fact that he's just a head.

338
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:55,796
You bring me someone with a head cold or
a headache, then I could do something.

339
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:58,515
But you bring me just a head,
then you are taking the piss.

340
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:00,212
Jesus, I could bury him in a shoebox.

341
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:01,595
Doctor, we need to know.

342
00:34:01,678 --> 00:34:07,678
He was mauled, in some way, by some
animal or something. I don't know.

343
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:11,128
- A tiger?
- A tiger?

344
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:12,630
We can't put that on our report.

345
00:34:12,631 --> 00:34:15,294
But I am a country
doctor, for God's sake.

346
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:17,627
What, am I going to run across stuff
like this, every day of the week?

347
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:23,710
- Christ! Didn't I tell ya?
- Jesus! Paddy! What is it?

348
00:34:26,376 --> 00:34:29,001
How am I supposed to wash meself?

349
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:38,000
Okay. Here is where
Cooney's car was abandoned.

350
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,875
Here is Tadhg and Irene Murphy's house.

351
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:42,375
Here is where the whales
washed up, and we're here.

352
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,930
I was hoping it'll show
us some sort of pattern.

353
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:47,999
Well, it's the letter 'Z'.

354
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:51,291
Did you show that thing to
anyone else before we saw it?

355
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:55,000
Tadhg Murphy got a look of it,
before I brought it home.

356
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,166
It gawked (vomited) on him.

357
00:34:56,249 --> 00:34:58,206
Why?

358
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,706
We think there might be another one
of those things. At least one anyway.

359
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,248
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

360
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:08,914
That thing you caught couldn't
have fertilised that egg by itself,

361
00:35:08,997 --> 00:35:11,247
which would mean
there's a male out there,

362
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,164
big enough and strong enough to
knock a hole in your bathroom wall.

363
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:17,664
- Smith said it needs water, right?
- Pfft, he says a lot of things.

364
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:19,050
- Mostly bollocks.
- Whatever.

365
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:22,246
But if it needs water to survive, how
could it be moving about on dry land?

366
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,038
It was raining.

367
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:30,995
When it's raining,
there's no such thing as dry land.

368
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:33,328
There's a storm due tonight.

369
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:35,162
It'll piss it down.

370
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,369
Okay, all of this.
This area must be it's territory.

371
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:42,330
Which would mean,

372
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:46,202
it's got to be somewhere with access
to the waters around the west beach.

373
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:50,452
Black Rock Caves. I caught
the female just beyond there.

374
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:59,826
You know what's to blame for
all this? Global warming.

375
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,617
You got your icebergs melting,
and your thingamajigs flooding.

376
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,242
The whole world is drowning, and we
have don't have the gills for it.

377
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:15,366
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

378
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:17,491
- You gave me that look.
- What look?

379
00:36:17,574 --> 00:36:19,029
The "I feel sorry for you" look.

380
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,574
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

381
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:24,532
No, I gave you the "I feel embarrassed
for you" look. Big difference.

382
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,573
Shit, that's worse.

383
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:31,032
Listen, I know I'm no
'dandy fop PhD' Smith's type...

384
00:36:31,115 --> 00:36:33,697
What's Smith got to do with
your raging alcoholism?

385
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:36,239
I'm not a raging alco...

386
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:41,156
You're some character, you
know that? A real character.

387
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,821
- I'm a social drinker.
- Mhm, I'm sure you are.

388
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:47,997
Now look, the tide's coming in.

389
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,738
So, another hour and this
place will be underwater.

390
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:56,320
Brandy McGuire drowned in there,
so be careful now.

391
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:59,612
- Wait here.
- You can be sure of that.

392
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,900
Wow!

393
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:07,606
- Are we missing some fishermen?
- Huh?

394
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:55,507
Oh, my God!

395
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:16,682
- Hello!
- Geez, my heart!

396
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:18,206
What are you doing?

397
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:22,224
Just checking. What? You
know of a better way, hmm?

398
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:24,932
Hello!

399
00:39:25,016 --> 00:39:28,431
What are you expecting?
"Hello, it's only me"?

400
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:35,348
Run!

401
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:37,805
Move! Come with me!

402
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:39,805
- Lisa, hurry! Hurry!
- I'm trying!

403
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:43,180
- Would you move your ass!
- Get your hands off my ass!

404
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:45,430
Go!

405
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,513
Come on, get up!

406
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:56,096
- You okay?
- The size of it!

407
00:39:57,513 --> 00:40:00,345
We're okay. It can't
get through that gap.

408
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:03,970
Ooh, Jesus! Whoa...

409
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:06,678
- Leg it!
- Okay, go! Go!

410
00:40:06,762 --> 00:40:09,344
Paddy! Run! Run! Run!...

411
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:11,386
Come on!

412
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:17,769
<i>Haven Point Garda Station, please hold.</i>

413
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:21,118
No, Regan, wait! No, we've got an
emergency! A real one, huge one!

414
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:22,930
<i>What? Did you run out
of whiskey, O'Shea, huh?</i>

415
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:24,985
Give me the phone. We need the ERU now!

416
00:40:25,068 --> 00:40:28,235
<i>Look, there is a storm coming. Coast
Guard's called all boats back to port.</i>

417
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,009
<i>Now whatever it is, it's gonna have
to wait till the morning, all right!</i>

418
00:40:32,884 --> 00:40:34,903
Oh, good. You are back.
Listen, I have a theory.

419
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:37,384
Those whales were killed as a
food source for their spawn.

420
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:40,134
- The eggs are buried at the beach!
- Oh, yes, exactly.

421
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:42,170
- Yeah, we know.
- Oh.

422
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:44,174
And well done.

423
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:45,028
What are you doing?

424
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:47,174
Everywhere this has been,
the other one's followed!

425
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:50,049
- You found another one? Where?
- It tried to eat us!

426
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:53,090
And it's huge! And it's looking for her!

427
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:54,682
Are you mad? Don't do that.

428
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:55,737
Smith, it's for the best!

429
00:40:55,738 --> 00:40:57,882
No... if he lights
that in here, he'll...!

430
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:04,181
Get it wet. Yo-u-u... really are Irish.

431
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:08,131
- Can I shut it off?
- I'll-a... see youse later, lads.

432
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:14,755
- No, it's that one here!
- No, it's not!

433
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:17,546
- No, it's not that one!
- It's not that one!

434
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:24,374
Is it dead?

435
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:28,082
It think it's just resting...

436
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:33,081
O'Shea! Oh, my God!

437
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:40,747
It's trying to fuck me face!

438
00:42:48,538 --> 00:42:51,704
Stand up!

439
00:43:20,202 --> 00:43:23,076
Vicious little fuck!

440
00:43:47,906 --> 00:43:48,906
Oh...

441
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:54,366
There goes THE scientific
discovery of our time.

442
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:57,906
Imagine all that we
could've learned. Oh...

443
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,031
Still moving?

444
00:44:11,622 --> 00:44:13,390
We are gonna need to get
help for the mainland.

445
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:15,280
Oh, they'll never get across the water.

446
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:17,904
What if those eggs hatch,
there's no whales to eat...

447
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,779
Yes, they will head inland to feed.

448
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:21,363
Finishing each other's sentences, now?

449
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:22,496
- What?
- Nothing.

450
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:25,477
I would've helped,
but I have a bad back.

451
00:44:25,478 --> 00:44:28,445
Gives me shocking pain,
you know, yourself.

452
00:44:28,528 --> 00:44:33,028
- How are you still alive, huh?
- Diet and exercise.

453
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:35,528
Took three of us to get
that thing off of me.

454
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,861
I was always lucky.

455
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:42,819
Yeah, it mustn't have
liked your blood much.

456
00:44:42,902 --> 00:44:45,354
What have you been eating?

457
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:49,693
I had a banana and a
bag of chips yesterday.

458
00:44:50,526 --> 00:44:53,360
You were drunk.

459
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:56,985
They are like leeches, right?
Feed off the blood.

460
00:44:57,068 --> 00:45:01,234
Well, when one of them bit Paddy,
it almost died. Why?

461
00:45:01,317 --> 00:45:04,317
Because Paddy was so intoxicated,
his blood alcohol level was toxic.

462
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,650
Exactly, if we taint our blood with
booze, we are poisonous to eat.

463
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:09,442
Uh, yeah, in theory.

464
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:12,191
You told me to cut back.

465
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:13,594
Tomorrow we'll be sore, so they'll...

466
00:45:13,895 --> 00:45:16,941
that we will get off the island. They'll
nuke the beaches or whatever they do.

467
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:20,358
But all we have to
worry about is tonight.

468
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:23,190
It's simple.

469
00:45:23,273 --> 00:45:25,440
We have a 'lock-in'.

470
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:28,648
We stay out of the rain, and we drink.

471
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:38,397
- What?
- Listen, it's a hostile, migratory...

472
00:45:38,481 --> 00:45:40,897
- Grabbers.
- For God's sake.

473
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:43,980
- Are you for real?
- Show him.

474
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,605
That? Should've killed
that with a hammer.

475
00:45:51,688 --> 00:45:55,295
No... That's just the tip of
the blood-sucking iceberg.

476
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:56,086
Grabbers?

477
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:58,145
Okay, I give up.
Yes, it's a grabber. Well done.

478
00:45:58,229 --> 00:45:59,668
But if it's allergic to alcohol,

479
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:02,187
couldn't we just hose it down
with vodka or some shit?

480
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,761
- No... That won't work.
- How'd you know? Give it a go. Why?

481
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,311
Can't, see because
alcohol is a poison, yes,

482
00:46:05,312 --> 00:46:07,178
but it has to be ingested
to have an effect.

483
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:09,781
Could we not just spray
some whiskey in it's mouth.

484
00:46:09,782 --> 00:46:11,186
Feck that. Waste of whiskey.

485
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,344
If you want to get that
close to it, good luck.

486
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:18,227
- What's going on here, then?
- Just discussing something.

487
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,477
- Looks like you are plotting something?
- No, no, no, no, no.

488
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:26,309
Em, it's more like, em... planning.

489
00:46:31,226 --> 00:46:33,142
Oh, carry on.

490
00:46:35,934 --> 00:46:41,475
Great, it's her birthday next week. Now
she thinks this is something for her.

491
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,057
The only people that
know about this are us.

492
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,598
It's gotta stay that way,
or we'll have a panic on our hands.

493
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:02,931
- So how drunk are we talking here?
- Paddy-levels of drunkenness.

494
00:47:03,014 --> 00:47:04,496
Have you gone off your game, boy?

495
00:47:04,497 --> 00:47:07,556
Uh, no offence, but I don't think
my body can handle Paddy-levels.

496
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:09,766
Takes years of practice.

497
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:12,430
And with everyone hammered, there's no
one in a fit state to call the shots.

498
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:17,930
- I'll keep order. I won't be drinking.
- You? Then we'll both do it.

499
00:47:18,013 --> 00:47:22,471
Well, that would put you both at risk.
I suggest it's just O'Shea.

500
00:47:23,387 --> 00:47:26,637
Thanks. Only one of us need to risk it.

501
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:30,845
And I know these people, this island,
better than you. Should be me.

502
00:47:35,511 --> 00:47:37,920
I see what you're doing here. But have
you forgotten you are a dependent...

503
00:47:38,003 --> 00:47:42,635
alcoholic organising a piss-up in a
brewery? I'll do it. It'll be easier.

504
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:48,719
Lisa, I'm good to no one when I drink.
I know that. So do you.

505
00:47:49,802 --> 00:47:52,384
I can do this.

506
00:47:55,968 --> 00:47:59,134
- Okay.
- Yeah.

507
00:47:59,218 --> 00:48:05,175
But just so you know, I don't drink.
I've never even been drunk.

508
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:09,508
- I don't know if I can.
- Of course you can.

509
00:48:09,592 --> 00:48:13,257
And you'll be the best drunken
garda this country's ever seen.

510
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:15,591
You'll probably get promoted.

511
00:48:19,507 --> 00:48:20,669
Right, okay, well,

512
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,006
if we are going to do this, we'll need
a blood test from a healthy subject.

513
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:29,465
- Lisa, you are the fittest person here.
- Oh, you charmer. It's true though.

514
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:33,173
Brian, I want a table of
everything Paddy had last night.

515
00:48:33,256 --> 00:48:36,505
- What night was last night?
- Saturday.

516
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:39,630
- Oh, you gotta be joking me.
- Coming up.

517
00:48:48,379 --> 00:48:51,004
He never likes me as much as her.

518
00:48:51,088 --> 00:48:57,088
She was always the talented one.
Daddy's little girl. Bitch!

519
00:48:57,587 --> 00:49:02,462
But, I threw him out, for you guys.

520
00:49:02,545 --> 00:49:06,587
And I love you all.

521
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,961
Even you.

522
00:49:11,294 --> 00:49:12,967
She's langered (drunk).

523
00:49:12,968 --> 00:49:14,852
For the size of her,
she's having her day good.

524
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:17,960
Yeah, that's the lot.

525
00:49:18,043 --> 00:49:21,293
Hm, it's extraordinary. Well done, you.

526
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:26,168
Thank you.

527
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:29,792
- I also had a snifter of...
- What's that?

528
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,523
It's a home brew.

529
00:49:31,524 --> 00:49:33,167
You bring poitín (illegal whiskey)
into my bar?

530
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,459
- A bird never flew on one wing.
- When this is over, we need to talk.

531
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:39,749
Ah, come off it. This could
save all our lives yet.

532
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:43,249
- I'll take that!
- Give it back to me! Shit!

533
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:44,791
Paddy!

534
00:50:01,664 --> 00:50:03,581
Careful.

535
00:50:03,664 --> 00:50:05,831
Up you get. Nice and easy.

536
00:50:05,914 --> 00:50:10,081
Guys, Jim, let's get ready
to do the blood test.

537
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:27,204
- So if you're right, this will kill it.
- Bottoms up.

538
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:29,662
Okay.

539
00:50:59,576 --> 00:51:03,576
- It must be a teetotaler.
- Bingo.

540
00:51:07,783 --> 00:51:09,325
Okay.

541
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:19,157
That's good.

542
00:51:23,157 --> 00:51:25,990
- '.2'.
- Holy Christ.

543
00:51:26,074 --> 00:51:30,448
You unnatural eejit (idiot).
You are what could kill us. '.2'?

544
00:51:30,573 --> 00:51:34,073
You are looking at ten pints each,
depending on height and weight.

545
00:51:34,114 --> 00:51:37,988
We'll have to do shots.
Properly third the yard sound of it.

546
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,363
So let's do it.

547
00:51:49,196 --> 00:51:54,112
The Mass is ended. Go in peace
to love and serve the Lord. Amen.

548
00:51:54,837 --> 00:51:59,603
Father, would you mind if I say a
few words? Hi, folks, how are ya?

549
00:52:00,178 --> 00:52:01,061
- "Tá go maith" (okay).
- Thanks.

550
00:52:04,361 --> 00:52:06,065
Just a quick announcement.

551
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:10,194
At Maher's Tavern tonight,
we are having a bit of a shindig,

552
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:16,027
and you are all coming to join us for
what'll be a great night's craic (fun).

553
00:52:19,985 --> 00:52:25,026
So, tell everybody. Tell your friends,
tell your families. Everybody's welcome.

554
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,068
- You are throwing a party?
- Yeah.

555
00:52:27,151 --> 00:52:30,443
- Why?
- Who needs a reason to have a laugh?

556
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:33,150
It's a welcome party for me.

557
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,317
Welcome party? But you are
leaving in a fortnight.

558
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,067
- This is a goodbye party, whatever.
- Yeah, well, you just got here.

559
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:43,274
- What's her problem?
- Em, what we mean to say is that...

560
00:52:43,357 --> 00:52:46,982
Hey, bucko! Where are you going?
This party's for your benefit.

561
00:52:47,066 --> 00:52:48,721
And all of you are gonna be there too.

562
00:52:48,722 --> 00:52:51,857
Is... the law, and it's vertical.
I'll arrest any one of you who isn't.

563
00:52:51,941 --> 00:52:55,398
- You! Sit down.
- What Garda Nolan means...

564
00:52:55,481 --> 00:53:00,940
is that... we'd love your company.

565
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:05,480
There's no point going home
to a cold, empty house...

566
00:53:05,564 --> 00:53:10,189
when there'll be music,
and company, and craic!

567
00:53:13,355 --> 00:53:16,063
- And a free bar.
- A free bar?

568
00:53:16,146 --> 00:53:18,604
- Oh, you are on, boys!
- That's the spirit!

569
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:22,313
So come on, it's a party,
and the drinks are on us!

570
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:54,560
How are you, Bridget?
How are you, Pascal?

571
00:53:54,643 --> 00:53:57,060
How are you, love?
Hey, mate, how are you, love?

572
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:04,850
They are singing our song and
playing our tune, Father.

573
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:18,474
All right, weapons. What have we got?

574
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:20,932
Crap.

575
00:54:21,015 --> 00:54:25,098
I have a nail gun and a
board with a nail in it.

576
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:28,348
Well, I've got a Harley
and a pellet gun.

577
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,514
What are we going to
do with a pellet gun?

578
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:34,806
Shoot pellets. But I
don't have any pellets.

579
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:37,347
Oh, right. Well, you can
just wiggle it at them then.

580
00:54:37,431 --> 00:54:41,180
- All right, what have you got?
- I've got a flare gun!

581
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,596
I have dibs on the flare gun.

582
00:54:46,138 --> 00:54:49,638
CPS 4100 Pump-Action
Twin-Jet Super Soaker.

583
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:52,970
Shoots twenty feet. The nephew's.

584
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:56,887
Brian, it's a water pistol.
This thing loves water.

585
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,660
It's a water pistol if you use water.

586
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:01,595
Fill it with petrol,
you've got a flamethrower.

587
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:05,761
- Dibs on the water pistol.
- Right, look sharp, folks.

588
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:10,303
You know your stations. Guard each
exit and don't let anyone out!

589
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:11,619
- Bottoms up.
- Tequila!

590
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,620
Sláinte (cheers).

591
00:55:30,217 --> 00:55:32,967
One! Two! Three!

592
00:55:44,214 --> 00:55:45,714
Whooooo!

593
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:50,174
- Mamie!
- Two shandies, Brian's best.

594
00:55:50,257 --> 00:55:52,757
Two shandies for Mamie!

595
00:55:54,757 --> 00:55:57,298
- How's the heart, Mamie?
- Tip-top.

596
00:55:57,381 --> 00:55:59,506
Thank Christ for that! Next!

597
00:56:05,506 --> 00:56:07,505
Perfect.

598
00:56:13,047 --> 00:56:16,755
- Come here, come here, listen.
- Okay, I'm here.

599
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:19,296
At the end of the day, it'll...?

600
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:23,254
I don't know.

601
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:26,212
- How much have you had?
- Not enough to fancy you.

602
00:56:26,296 --> 00:56:29,711
Well, then, keep drinking.

603
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:56,001
Blow.

604
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,208
That's it, is it?

605
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:09,417
You think, I think, I fancy you.

606
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,499
No more for you.

607
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:22,456
Well, I do. So what do
you want to do about it?

608
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,998
Arrest me?

609
00:57:28,548 --> 00:57:34,548
As... flattering as it is to
hear a... beautiful drunk...

610
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:38,830
slurring her feelings for me,

611
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:41,164
now is not the time.

612
00:57:55,495 --> 00:57:58,453
<i>Patrol to base, patrol
to base, come in, over.</i>

613
00:57:58,537 --> 00:58:01,370
Reading you loud and clear.

614
00:58:01,453 --> 00:58:03,495
<i>How're you doing in there?</i>

615
00:58:03,578 --> 00:58:06,827
Ignorance is bliss.

616
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:42,516
I have to go and wizz.

617
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:48,282
- You all right?
- I'm a bit bloated.

618
00:58:48,365 --> 00:58:50,948
You haven't touched your pint.
Are you gonna finish it?

619
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:54,448
- Oh, hold it for me, will ya?
- Oh, here, right.

620
00:58:57,823 --> 00:58:59,792
Is there some fella in there
doing his make-up or something?

621
00:58:59,793 --> 00:59:01,614
Ah, they can't hold their drink.

622
00:59:01,697 --> 00:59:05,072
- Saviours!
- Wait, you've only had two pints.

623
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:07,973
That's not Paddy-levels, the two.

624
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:34,194
- Why do you drink so much, Ciarán?
- For the craic.

625
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:37,944
Yeah, rite, and I work
everyday 'cause I'm driven.

626
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:41,611
Always... chasing them goals, you know?

627
00:59:41,694 --> 00:59:46,235
Always chasing, always running.

628
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:51,152
You're too hard on yourself.

629
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:04,150
I feel like I've known
you for years, you know?

630
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,608
Don't know why.

631
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:30,939
I'm sorry about your wife, O'Shea.

632
01:00:31,064 --> 01:00:35,273
- My what?
- Una told me how she died.

633
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:41,605
Of all the stories. Nobody died.

634
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:44,897
We just, we didn't work out. That's all.

635
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:52,229
- Shit, I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're grand (fine).

636
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:59,520
Did you split because, um...
because of your alcoholic-isis?

637
01:01:01,686 --> 01:01:04,770
No, I didn't drink back then.

638
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:09,102
She met someone else.

639
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,769
That'll happens.

640
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,100
Feck her, O'Shea! If you want, I'll
find her, and I'll sort her out for you.

641
01:01:56,515 --> 01:02:00,265
A toast, from an alcoholic
to a workaholic.

642
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:22,020
Get it off me!

643
01:02:24,803 --> 01:02:25,845
Jim!

644
01:02:28,303 --> 01:02:29,115
Jim!

645
01:02:30,116 --> 01:02:32,428
Okay, keep still! Keep still, Jim!

646
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:39,019
- Drinks for everybody, on the house!
- Yayyyyy!

647
01:02:56,934 --> 01:03:00,634
Are you okay? Jim? Jesus! Man.

648
01:03:00,717 --> 01:03:05,300
- You okay, Jim? What were you doing?
- I needed to pee.

649
01:03:19,423 --> 01:03:20,507
No, Jim!

650
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:29,964
Don't! No, Jim!

651
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:34,006
You big ugly bastard!

652
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:42,546
Fuck that!

653
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,338
Come on, quickly! Quickly!

654
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:50,754
Oh, Jesus, Mary, Mother of God!

655
01:03:50,837 --> 01:03:54,420
Quickly! That's it. Start the car! Start
the car! Come on, what are you doing?

656
01:03:54,504 --> 01:03:56,754
- Quick! You should race the car!
- Stop it! Stop...

657
01:04:09,919 --> 01:04:12,543
We are gonna die!

658
01:04:14,627 --> 01:04:17,668
I'm arresting you for
the murder of Dr. Gleeson!

659
01:04:17,752 --> 01:04:20,877
You don't have the right to say
anything, unless you wish to...

660
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,834
No, what are you doing?
You can't arrest a grabber!

661
01:04:23,917 --> 01:04:29,334
<i>...but the kegs are outside.
We're out of spirits...</i>

662
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:32,251
Brian, Brian, get the door.
Open the door now.

663
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,500
That's it. Quickly, come on.

664
01:04:46,832 --> 01:04:48,999
Merciful shit.

665
01:05:01,914 --> 01:05:04,581
Brian, close the fucking door!

666
01:05:04,664 --> 01:05:06,622
Grab the table!

667
01:05:07,413 --> 01:05:10,122
- Smith!
- I can't feel my face!

668
01:05:10,205 --> 01:05:13,455
Smith! The lighter!

669
01:05:14,913 --> 01:05:19,246
Argh! God damn it, this thing's heavy!
Focus! Push the table toward me.

670
01:05:21,662 --> 01:05:23,746
Uh, your floor... Your floor is broken.

671
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:27,161
Brian, forget that!
Help us barricade the door!

672
01:05:27,245 --> 01:05:30,036
- Smith!
- Your floor is broken.

673
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,911
- Light me!
- Come on, Lisa, push!

674
01:05:33,995 --> 01:05:36,161
Focus. Look at me. Push.

675
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:40,452
- You've blown it out.
- Don't climb on the table!

676
01:05:40,535 --> 01:05:42,410
- Okay.
- Get off the table, Lisa.

677
01:05:46,077 --> 01:05:48,534
- I can't do it.
- Brian, man, forget that!

678
01:05:48,618 --> 01:05:50,784
Come and help us do this!

679
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:53,534
- Brian, what are you doing?
- You did it, Brian.

680
01:05:53,618 --> 01:05:56,493
- You put that down!
- Brian did it!

681
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:05,408
No, don't be a hero.

682
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:13,532
Argh! Big ugly bastard!
Have some of this shit!

683
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:15,366
Die!

684
01:06:19,491 --> 01:06:21,281
Oh, Christ.

685
01:06:28,948 --> 01:06:30,823
Get up now!

686
01:06:36,489 --> 01:06:40,030
- What's going on?
- Um, nothing.

687
01:06:41,988 --> 01:06:43,063
Who's that at the door?

688
01:06:43,064 --> 01:06:45,821
Nobody! It's nobody! Come on,
everybody out into the bar!

689
01:06:45,904 --> 01:06:48,029
I'm gonna go check the booze situation.

690
01:06:48,113 --> 01:06:50,363
Smith, c'mon! C'mon, now! Smith, c'mon!

691
01:07:01,362 --> 01:07:03,861
We're dry.

692
01:07:03,944 --> 01:07:06,180
Unless someone goes outside
to change the kegs,

693
01:07:06,181 --> 01:07:07,777
we're done drinking for the night.

694
01:07:08,161 --> 01:07:14,111
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I was just getting a taste for it.

695
01:07:20,568 --> 01:07:23,318
Lisa, could you stop the music.

696
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:27,400
Folks, folks. Can I have
your attention, please?

697
01:07:27,484 --> 01:07:30,650
Listen carefully, we're
moving this party upstairs.

698
01:07:33,775 --> 01:07:37,399
- I know what kind of party's this.
- Sir, sir, it's just a precaution.

699
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:39,941
A precaution to what?

700
01:07:40,024 --> 01:07:42,608
- I'm going home. I'm pissed.
- No!

701
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,941
No, because... nobody can. You can't.

702
01:07:45,024 --> 01:07:47,982
- Why?
- It's raining!

703
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:51,148
This party isn't for me,
Brian, is it? You lied to me!

704
01:07:51,857 --> 01:07:56,398
See, you? This is your fault!
You brought this thing to the island!

705
01:07:56,482 --> 01:07:59,939
Oh, relax. You'll
give yourself angina.

706
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:03,647
I'll give you angina!
Outside, now! I claim ya!

707
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:07,022
- Can't go outside!
- Because of the rain!

708
01:08:07,106 --> 01:08:09,494
All right! Put 'em up! Come on!

709
01:08:09,495 --> 01:08:11,605
Right, sir, I've had
enough of your bollocks!

710
01:08:12,938 --> 01:08:16,896
Paddy! Brian! Come on!
Now is not the time for this!

711
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:29,354
Okay, everyone! Don't worry, it's grand.
We've got it all under control.

712
01:08:29,437 --> 01:08:32,103
There's no one trying to kill you.

713
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:39,528
- We need more alcohol!
- Yeah!

714
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:46,893
No! Again, stay back.
Smith, what are you doing?

715
01:08:46,935 --> 01:08:49,935
Smith! Smith!

716
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:53,226
Smith, listen to me! Listen to me!

717
01:08:53,267 --> 01:08:58,101
It's bigger than you think.
Get back inside now, please.

718
01:08:58,142 --> 01:09:00,309
I'm begging ya!

719
01:09:00,392 --> 01:09:05,105
I need a photograph with it
for National Geographic...

720
01:09:05,906 --> 01:09:07,308
and Facebook.

721
01:09:07,391 --> 01:09:10,391
Feck your photos! Change the kegs!

722
01:09:10,392 --> 01:09:11,437
Paddy!

723
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,784
What? He's sloommered,
sure he'll be fine.

724
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,599
Go on, Smith! Fighting fella, you are!

725
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:23,606
Smith, listen to me! I'm begging ya!
Get back inside, Smith!

726
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:28,348
Come on! Smith! Listen to me!

727
01:09:28,389 --> 01:09:31,889
Shush, you'll scare it.

728
01:09:38,347 --> 01:09:41,513
You are beautiful.

729
01:09:47,054 --> 01:09:49,096
Oh, wow.

730
01:09:56,386 --> 01:10:02,011
Steady... You don't want to eat me.

731
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:26,176
You see? I told you!

732
01:10:26,259 --> 01:10:31,592
It's just an animal.
It doesn't want to hurt you.

733
01:10:39,299 --> 01:10:41,049
Oh, okay, okay.

734
01:10:42,591 --> 01:10:43,674
Jesus.

735
01:10:46,424 --> 01:10:48,632
Everybody, upstairs now!

736
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:56,798
What the hell is that?

737
01:11:14,129 --> 01:11:16,546
Everybody, stay calm!

738
01:11:21,129 --> 01:11:23,918
What in the name of
fuck were those things?

739
01:11:23,919 --> 01:11:26,212
Everybody okay? Yeah?

740
01:11:26,295 --> 01:11:29,045
Everybo... Stay calm! Stay calm!

741
01:11:29,128 --> 01:11:32,045
Anybody been bitten?

742
01:11:33,211 --> 01:11:36,836
Anybody been bitten? Look at me.
Has anybody been bitten?

743
01:11:36,919 --> 01:11:40,002
No? Good. You haven't been bitten,

744
01:11:40,586 --> 01:11:43,668
'cause of the alcohol
you've been drinking.

745
01:11:43,751 --> 01:11:48,751
This might sound crazy,
but they're allergic to drunk people.

746
01:11:48,835 --> 01:11:53,085
So there's no need to panic,
we're safe up here.

747
01:11:53,168 --> 01:11:57,542
And let's stay away from the windows.
I think it's best.

748
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,249
We're gonna be fine.

749
01:12:24,165 --> 01:12:26,414
It's swinging one of Tommy
Riordan's sheep at the door.

750
01:12:26,497 --> 01:12:30,456
My cat does that, then leaves it
on the doorstep as a present.

751
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:32,872
It's a bitch. A mating ritual.

752
01:12:32,956 --> 01:12:37,081
The female. It's following her scent.
So didn't she slime you on the lab?

753
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:41,180
What does that mean?

754
01:12:41,263 --> 01:12:45,121
It'll try to mount ya, somehow.

755
01:12:45,205 --> 01:12:48,745
Failing that, it'll rip ya
limb from limb in frustration.

756
01:12:48,829 --> 01:12:51,579
Grand! Ah, sure, what can you do?

757
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:55,995
What's your reading?

758
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:58,911
Too drunk to drive a car, but not
drunk enough. We're sobering up.

759
01:12:58,994 --> 01:13:02,369
- What if we threw a bomb at it?
- Have you got semtex on ya?

760
01:13:02,453 --> 01:13:03,277
Not on me, no.

761
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:06,869
How about if we like, uh,
push it off a cliff or something?

762
01:13:06,953 --> 01:13:10,743
How you say we feed it Father Potts.
Lest it eats shit, it'll choke to death.

763
01:13:10,827 --> 01:13:12,827
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, feck.

764
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:16,202
It was a joke, Father. I apologise.

765
01:13:19,452 --> 01:13:20,551
Okay.

766
01:13:21,534 --> 01:13:26,284
We know it does two things.
It drinks blood and it needs water.

767
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:29,159
We took away one.
We can take away the other.

768
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:29,923
What do you mean?

769
01:13:29,924 --> 01:13:32,366
We need to keep it away from
the water. Dry it out, somehow.

770
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,663
Look outside!

771
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:35,575
There's got to be some
way we can stop it.

772
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:37,158
Fight fire with fire.

773
01:13:37,241 --> 01:13:39,991
- The thing!
- What?

774
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:42,740
The fekkin' thing at Cooney's site.
What's it called?

775
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:44,740
- A grabber.
- Yeah, exactly.

776
01:13:44,824 --> 01:13:49,365
With that thing, you could grab it,
and you could just f'kin' lift it up,

777
01:13:49,449 --> 01:13:52,240
and you could just hoist it up,
and leave it there, and trap it,

778
01:13:52,324 --> 01:13:54,681
and it'll be stuck in the air,
and then the sun will come...

779
01:13:54,682 --> 01:13:58,948
and the sun will come up, and
it'll be dry and that'll dry it out.

780
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,163
Brian, have you got
the keys to your truck?

781
01:14:02,164 --> 01:14:03,780
No, that'll be on the kitchen table.

782
01:14:03,863 --> 01:14:06,613
I need them.

783
01:14:07,113 --> 01:14:08,371
You are sober.

784
01:14:08,372 --> 01:14:11,163
You can't be going down there,
those things will rip the head off ya.

785
01:14:11,247 --> 01:14:13,662
- Yeah, she's right.
- You might not get past them.

786
01:14:14,263 --> 01:14:17,153
But I know someone who could.

787
01:14:17,154 --> 01:14:21,529
Talking about the
drunken-est person we've got.

788
01:14:23,612 --> 01:14:26,403
Absolutely not. No.

789
01:14:26,486 --> 01:14:29,945
- Paddy, you go.
- Feck off, you.

790
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:32,961
Brian. Brian should go.

791
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:37,860
Thanks for that, um...

792
01:14:37,944 --> 01:14:40,902
Yup. Yeah... I... suppose I could, yeah.

793
01:14:40,985 --> 01:14:43,763
Your arse, you're going!
You're pickled, you fucking go!

794
01:14:43,764 --> 01:14:46,818
Just... Come on. I'm gonna go.

795
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:49,193
No, no, it's too dangerous.

796
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:51,651
Newsflash, I'm gonna go because...

797
01:14:51,734 --> 01:14:56,234
I'm one of the best drunken garda
this country's ever seen, you said.

798
01:14:56,318 --> 01:14:57,592
Didn't you say it?

799
01:14:58,775 --> 01:15:01,675
I'm just gonna get the keys.
This is not gonna take it lightly.

800
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:04,983
I'm just gonna go, gonna get
the keys. It's gonna be grand.

801
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:08,774
I'm your shining knight in silver armor.

802
01:15:13,024 --> 01:15:15,316
Right, if you get in trouble,
pull the trigger.

803
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:16,924
Ho-ho, Savage!

804
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:20,231
- Oh, careful.
- You missed.

805
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,565
- Brian! Would you ever feck off it?
- Paddy!

806
01:15:23,731 --> 01:15:25,523
Just get the keys, I'll do the rest.

807
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:27,523
Got it, just the keys.

808
01:15:29,605 --> 01:15:31,689
I'll be all right.

809
01:15:35,514 --> 01:15:36,839
Jesus Christ!

810
01:15:40,064 --> 01:15:42,146
It's okay! I'm all right.

811
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:44,046
Shush, keep your voice down.

812
01:15:45,271 --> 01:15:46,704
She's a goner.

813
01:15:49,271 --> 01:15:53,270
- How're you gonna get to the truck?
- Well, run very fast.

814
01:15:53,353 --> 01:15:56,353
- Well, you're not that fast.
- No, he'll need a decoy.

815
01:15:56,437 --> 01:16:00,520
I've got it. If it's you it wants,
we give it what it wants.

816
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:02,483
We make a dummy of you,

817
01:16:02,484 --> 01:16:05,644
dress it up as bait, and confuse
the shite clean out of it.

818
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,977
- How do we make a dummy?
- Improvise.

819
01:16:43,183 --> 01:16:44,782
Focus.

820
01:16:56,983 --> 01:16:57,783
Ewh.

821
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,687
I love this song.

822
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:28,353
Hurry.

823
01:18:18,299 --> 01:18:22,006
Hey, everybody, stay calm!

824
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:37,255
Fire! Fire!

825
01:18:58,295 --> 01:18:59,861
I smell smoke.

826
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:12,919
Lisa! Lisa!

827
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,918
Is there another way down?

828
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:32,333
- Una, it's lovely.
- I don't think it's scary enough, lads.

829
01:19:32,417 --> 01:19:36,000
It is not a bleeding beauty contest!
Una, it's a scarecrow!

830
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:56,998
Lisa! Lisa!

831
01:20:00,455 --> 01:20:02,514
Come on, for fuck's sake!

832
01:20:07,914 --> 01:20:09,913
Go, Lisa! Go!

833
01:20:15,538 --> 01:20:18,371
<i>O'Shea, O'Shea, do you read me?</i>

834
01:20:18,372 --> 01:20:22,328
<i>We're evacuating.
You did it, boy! You did it!</i>

835
01:20:25,912 --> 01:20:30,827
Stop now! Lisa, stop anywhere.
Okay, you can stop now.

836
01:20:30,911 --> 01:20:33,952
Lisa? Lisa, stop now! Stop!

837
01:20:36,494 --> 01:20:39,494
- We are here!
- Jesus! You're dangerous!

838
01:20:39,577 --> 01:20:42,576
Come on, quickly! Hey, it's not raining!

839
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,526
How long do you think
it'll take it to dry out?

840
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:50,685
- I don't know, couple of hours.
- Bollocks, where is the crane?

841
01:20:50,868 --> 01:20:53,117
- Shit!
- What are we gonna do now?

842
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,835
Okay, I'm thinking if
I can get it over there.

843
01:20:54,836 --> 01:20:56,784
- Wait, we are not ready!
- Run! Run! Run!

844
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:58,292
- Give me the keys!
- What keys?

845
01:20:58,293 --> 01:21:00,617
- Cooney's keys.
- There! Go! Run!

846
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,195
Come on, you...

847
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:53,112
Just a little closer.

848
01:21:54,112 --> 01:21:58,944
What are you waiting for?
Come on and come and get me!

849
01:22:01,361 --> 01:22:04,153
Come on, you smelly bastard.

850
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,216
Get away from him, you C-U-U-U-UNT!

851
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:04,316
Yaa-Hoooo!

852
01:23:39,977 --> 01:23:43,144
I think this calls for a celebration.

853
01:23:56,058 --> 01:23:57,142
No!

854
01:24:08,391 --> 01:24:10,141
Sláinte (cheers).

855
01:24:22,306 --> 01:24:25,681
Are you okay? You okay?

856
01:24:25,765 --> 01:24:27,972
He couldn't handle his drink.

857
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:33,805
What are you doing?

858
01:24:36,222 --> 01:24:37,972
Ah! Shut your hole!

859
01:25:04,969 --> 01:25:08,136
That was fun, wasn't it?

860
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:11,593
- Tell that to Una.
- Ah, she'll be grand.

861
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:17,010
Would you like a drink?

862
01:25:18,051 --> 01:25:20,718
I wouldn't say no.

863
01:25:25,092 --> 01:25:27,342
Here, I thought you'd run out of drink?

864
01:25:27,425 --> 01:25:31,384
- Have you poitín in your house?
- Is the Pope a Catholic?

865
01:25:36,633 --> 01:25:38,716
Here.

866
01:25:48,632 --> 01:25:51,882
I shouldn't have done that!

867
01:25:51,965 --> 01:25:55,214
Just kidding, I should.

868
01:25:57,172 --> 01:25:58,859
I think I'll take some time off.

869
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,339
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

870
01:26:02,672 --> 01:26:07,130
You know, if you lived here,
you'd be home already.

871
01:26:08,338 --> 01:26:11,505
- Home of the Erin Island Grabbers.
- Uh-huh.

872
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:14,046
It's gonna get mental around here.

873
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:17,170
I'm gonna need all the help I can get.

874
01:26:48,584 --> 01:26:52,334
- Wanna get some breakfast?
- Yum! Yes, I do.

875
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:57,584
I think we should go
and pick up Jim's dog.

876
01:26:57,709 --> 01:27:00,208
- Aw, Dr. Gleesons dog?
- Yeah.

877
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,741
Yeah, she'll be missing her 'dad'.

878
01:27:02,825 --> 01:27:06,050
Aw, I've always wanted a dog.

879
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:13,000
