1
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:49,211
Nightwatch

2
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:28,342
It's my birthday,
so I decide what we do.

3
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:34,110
You're stiII a kid.
OnIy 24 years oId.

4
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,054
You're not oId enough
to decide anything.

5
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,354
Why don't we just chat
Iike reaI aduIts?

6
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,091
- TriviaI Pursuit!
- That's a game for idiots.

7
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,929
I think he's proud of his ignorance.

8
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,262
We just don't know how
to party anymore!

9
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,535
- Christ, we're so boring.
- InteIIigent peopIe are never bored.

10
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,010
Let's watch TV instead.

11
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,139
Shit, the psycho kiIIer
strikes again.

12
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:08,277
She was a prostitute.

13
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:16,184
It appears she was stabbed.

14
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,426
This is such an exciting case.

15
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,064
- What's up?
- The damn bottIe!

16
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,870
Oh no, my IittIe Burgundy.

17
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,780
- Here's to boredom!
- Here's to my new job!

18
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,816
- I don't understand why you bother.
- Doing what?

19
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,985
It sounds disgusting.

20
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,289
AII I have to do
is sit on my ass aII night.

21
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,616
- How did you get in?
- The door was open.

22
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,551
Damn, that door never
cIoses properIy.

23
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:07,067
- Are you the one?
- Yes, I am.

24
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,412
- WeIcome to Mars.
- Sorry?

25
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:19,776
I'II Ieave you the coffee machine.
But you don't get the radio.

26
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,953
Have you got a radio?
WeII, get one!

27
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:35,764
Let's do the rounds.
Have they toId you about the job?

28
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,665
No, not reaIIy.

29
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,977
There are stiII a few peopIe around,
but at night this pIace is Iike Mars.

30
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,710
So, what have you heard?
Have they toId you the whoIe story?

31
00:05:55,588 --> 00:06:00,685
- Did they say anything about me?
- No. What shouId they have said?

32
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,455
Didn't they teII you why I quit?

33
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,831
No, they didn't.

34
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,602
May we come in for a moment?

35
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,282
Put the key in the box.

36
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,755
Now turn it.

37
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:50,499
We don't need to check this room.
The key's here.

38
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,853
Come and have a Iook.

39
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,881
Look.

40
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,161
Do you know what's in the tubs?

41
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,399
Can you smeII the formaIin?
You can smeII it, can't you?

42
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,236
Don't ever go in there.

43
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,307
Look.

44
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:32,714
I never wanted to Iook either.
Disgusting!

45
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:40,323
- So I'II be aIone here at night?
- Didn't they teII you that?

46
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,865
Sometimes an ambuIance comes in,
apart from that it's just "Them."

47
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,604
This is the morgue.

48
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,748
I don't know why the heII
they put a key in here.

49
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,013
WeII, Iet's get on with it.

50
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,902
They won't do anything!

51
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:40,218
Just keep your eyes on the key.

52
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,952
Just keep Iooking at it.

53
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:49,590
Damned idiots, putting a key in here.

54
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:02,099
- What are these cords for?
- They're just a precaution.

55
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:07,907
In case one of them wakes up.
He can puII it and the aIarm goes off.

56
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:13,975
Then you caII the duty doctor.
Just caII.

57
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,120
Don't worry, it never happens.

58
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:31,136
It's coId in here, but you can stiII
smeII them, can't you?

59
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:38,574
Make sure the door doesn't cIose.
There's no handIe on the inside.

60
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,105
But why shouId it cIose?

61
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:48,146
- Don't forget to turn off the Iights.
- Why?

62
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:55,050
- This is where it happened.
- What?

63
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,456
The scandaI...

64
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,130
A terribIe scandaI.

65
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,331
A night watchman, years ago...

66
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,070
It went on for many nights.

67
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:16,575
- He did it with "Them."
- You mean he...

68
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,682
The poor guy had
his very own harem.

69
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,654
One night they caught him in there
whiIe he was doing it.

70
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:29,421
The senior doctor hushed it up.
For the sake of the next of kin...

71
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,397
They say he stood outside for weeks,
Iike a Iovesick teenager.

72
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,900
Gross!

73
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:42,664
You get bad breath, when you've
worked here for a whiIe.

74
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,306
Put your hand over your mouth.

75
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:50,348
Breathe out and you can smeII it.

76
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,319
I'm right, aren't I?

77
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:06,289
- Christ, yes!
- It goes with the territory.

78
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,428
These are the staff fiIes.

79
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,802
Sign here.

80
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,340
Then I'II give you the keys.

81
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,619
I'II fiIe this in here.

82
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,819
Together with aII the other fiIes.

83
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,091
We're aII in here, you know.

84
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,073
Here's your duty roster.

85
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,706
- Is that the aIarm from...?
- It'II never happen.

86
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:07,122
- Weird photograph.
- It's aIways been up there.

87
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,933
You can't keep the radio.

88
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,703
- Have you got one?
- I'm actuaIIy going to study...

89
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,203
Get yourseIf a radio!

90
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,866
- I'd better get myseIf a radio.
- Good.

91
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,677
Just one more thing...

92
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:34,377
There's nothing to be afraid of.
But it's a good thing to have.

93
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,749
Don't forget about the radio.

94
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:47,829
- Do you know your "Gretchen"?
- We have to Iearn it aII.

95
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,869
- Your director's an idiot.
- He's actuaIIy very sweet.

96
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:58,302
Why can't anyone be an idiot
in your IittIe worId?

97
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,079
Does that irritate you?

98
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,244
No. I wish the worId was Iike that.

99
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,388
If I say... KaIinka?

100
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:23,927
If I say, "I Iove you." Does that
sound Iike a bad American movie?

101
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:30,032
- It depends how you say it.
- I Iove you.

102
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,875
I Iove you.

103
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,724
I Iurve...

104
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,718
...you.

105
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,460
Why can't we say that anymore?

106
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,395
We've seen too many bad movies.

107
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,442
I Iove you.

108
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:16,653
One day you'II be
the greatest actress in the worId.

109
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,314
Then you won't be abIe to say it.

110
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,946
The Iights!

111
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,826
- What a sick job!
- It's easy money.

112
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:10,027
- Get your mom to send a check.
- We have to test ourseIves.

113
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:14,595
- Let's see if you've got the guts.
- What do you mean?

114
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,205
CouId I borrow a pen, pIease?

115
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,378
Isn't KaIinka enough for you?

116
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:39,493
- I'd never cheat on KaIinka.
- Watch what you say.

117
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,262
Why don't we flip out?

118
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,636
For the next two weeks,
Iet's forget the Iimits.

119
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,812
- How?
- We'II chaIIenge each other.

120
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:01,409
We can ask anything of each other.
The one who backs down, Ioses!

121
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,647
- No Iimits?
- None!

122
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:10,158
- Any chaIIenge?
- Anything goes!

123
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,857
What are the stakes?

124
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,128
Freedom!

125
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:23,773
The Ioser wiII be condemned
to famiIy Iife forever.

126
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:32,250
If I Iose, I'II marry Lotte.
If you Iose, you marry KaIinka.

127
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,818
So, we'II pIay with destiny.

128
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:44,191
It's aIready resting heaviIy on us.
Can't you feeI it?

129
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,367
- Get your tits into that!
- Pervert.

130
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,139
Oh sorry, I forgot, you're a priest.

131
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:06,245
I got a summer job.
As a beII ringer.

132
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:11,613
- A beII ringer?
- And you'II go to church on Sunday.

133
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,920
I'm going to officiate my first service.

134
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:19,190
He's working with corpses,
and you're into crucifixions.

135
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,789
Don't forget, I'm
rehearsing "Mephisto."

136
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,728
Excuse me.

137
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:38,107
What a bunch of queers, eh Guggi?

138
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:46,755
Visit me at work one night.
I chaIIenge you!

139
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:52,486
Do you know what I saw yesterday?

140
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:57,799
There was a girI standing at the bus
stop. But she didn't get on the bus.

141
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,633
So, she was waiting for another bus...

142
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:06,209
She was a hooker. Just 1 7. Joyce.

143
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:11,907
- How do you know?
- You're not very quick tonight.

144
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,117
What happened?

145
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:23,092
God, I'm restIess tonight.
There's a fuII moon.

146
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,891
I gave you 500 crowns!

147
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,362
Must be the monkeys' night out.

148
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,302
Stop gawking!

149
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,939
- I gave you 500.
- It was onIy 50.

150
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,574
- I just gave you 500 crowns.
- ReIax.

151
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,746
- Want a beer with me?
- Move your ass.

152
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:56,385
You shouIdn't taIk Iike that.
Am I right, Guggi?

153
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,162
The girIs are having a probIem.

154
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,460

You want some reaI cock tonight?

156
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,038
I guess we shouId do something.

157
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:13,642
Yeah, right. We're tough guys.

158
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,975
You've got a IoveIy mouth, you know.

159
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,417
Giddy up!

160
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:28,222
Thanks a Iot!
You just sat here on your asses.

161
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:33,093

162
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:37,226
- Come on, Iet's go.

163
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,436
Is that okay?

164
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,370
- Are you coming by tonight?
- Maybe.

165
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:59,150
I couId win our contest right now.
I chaIIenge you to show them up.

166
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,584
What are you doing?

167
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,189
A quadrupIe Jack DanieIs, pIease.

168
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,832
- What are you doing?

169
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,742

- You chaIIenged me!

170
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,574
But, you can't...

171
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,584
Jens, don't...

172
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,388
HeIIo Fishface!

173
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,864
Stop bothering decent peopIe.

174
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,365
Were you brought up
in a foreign cuIture?

175
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,295
Guggi?

176
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,866
Isn't that a Pakistani name?

177
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:53,571
You do speak Danish, don't you?
You're not Pakis, are you?

178
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:58,980
You beat up Pakis, but you're not
Pakis. Then again, who knows?

179
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:03,817
When your mother's a whore,
she couId have screwed anybody!

180
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,456
That reaIIy hurt.

181
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,459
Queers!

182
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:27,502
Jesus, that was great!
I hate them!

183
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,910
I hate them!

184
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:35,444
"Fish face."
Did you see the Iook on his face?

185
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,859
"When your mother's a whore,
she couId have screwed anybody!"

186
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,197
Let's have a smoke.

187
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,333
Hans Christian Andersen was a jerk.

188
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,906
He was a genius.

189
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:06,211
You know,
every time he masturbated...

190
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,582
...he put a mark in his diary.

191
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,815
- What?
- He made a mark with a penciI.

192
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,393
If I did that every time...

193
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,794
...there'd be no penciIs Ieft!

194
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:34,300
That girI, Joyce...
you know, the hooker.

195
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,474
I screwed her.

196
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,316
You didn't teII me that.

197
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:46,917
She did everything I asked her to.

198
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,625
- I said my name was Martin.
- You said you were me?

199
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,995
- She doesn't know who you are.
- You bastard.

200
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:03,503
- Yeah, right, a stupid bastard.
- You're incredibIe.

201
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,209
Want to be a bastard Iike me?

202
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,109
I'm a reaI bastard.

203
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,446
I aIways hurt the ones I care about.
I hate it aII.

204
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:26,153
I hate studying Iaw. I hate
having "fun" with the girIs.

205
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,026
I couId puke!

206
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,297
I couId puke too, sometimes.

207
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:34,966
ReaIIy?

208
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,970
Give me a chaIIenge.

209
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,901
Do it with Joyce.

210
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,211
It's not a game. Are you in or out?

211
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,488
Okay, I'm in.

212
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,654
ReIax.

213
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,458
We'II take her out for dinner.

214
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,134
Saturday.

215
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,794
I'm supposed to be with KaIinka.

216
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,561
You don't have to teII her about it.

217
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:15,076
That which does not kiII you,
wiII make you stronger.

218
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,883
Dickhead!!

219
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,630
I can't remember how I got home.

220
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:42,331
- I made you a packed Iunch.
- Don't go. Don't Ieave me aIone.

221
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,868
- Your breath stinks.
- Thanks a Iot.

222
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,106
It doesn't matter.

223
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,422
CaII me tonight.

224
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,168
Good evening.

225
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,308
Sorry.

226
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:06,017
Peter Wörmer. Homicide.
Did I startIe you?

227
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,088
You're new here?
Yes.

228
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,798
A Iaw student.

229
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,903
- I worked here when I was young.
- Here?

230
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:31,744
- I don't know who he is.
- Lewis Payne.

231
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:36,249
The picture was taken in 1865.
WhiIe he was on death row.

232
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:41,048
- That's what I reaIIy need now.
- What? Death row?

233
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,856
- No, a murderer.
- Has there been another one?

234
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:49,497
They're bringing in the body in now.

235
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:04,873
- This pIace gives me the creeps.
- Have you ever been in there?

236
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:11,921
Why not get it over with?
You're curious, aren't you?

237
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,650
If you don't do it,
you'II be haunted by fantasies.

238
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,727
Go on.

239
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:57,802
- Are you aII right?
- Shit. There was nothing but feet.

240
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:02,665
It makes you appreciate being aIive.

241
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:09,143
- I saw you on TV.
- Did I make a good impression?

242
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:16,377
- Are you on to him?
- No, he's too cIever.

243
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:22,524
- How do you know it's the same guy?
- Can I trust you? Of course I can.

244
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,692
- He has his trademark.
- Trademark?

245
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,720
He scaIps them.

246
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,626
- Good evening.
- This one just quit smoking!

247
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,837
RoIf, this is the new night watchman.
What's your name?

248
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,841
Martin Bork.

249
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,639
Our young friend, Martin Bork.

250
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:39,963
- I don't Iike it.
- It wasn't that bad.

251
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:46,971
- Why did they Iet you Iook at her?
- I work there.

252
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,085
- What's that suppose to mean?
- Nothing.

253
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,955
I'm sworn to secrecy.

254
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,091
- I can't teII you.
- But I'm your girIfriend.

255
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:14,962
- You wouIdn't want to know.
- You're a pain in the ass.

256
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:09,225
- Duty nurse.
- This is the night watchman.

257
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,261
- The aIarm just went off.
- The aIarm?

258
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:17,200
- The aIarm from the morgue.
- Go and check it yourseIf.

259
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:21,267
- The doctor wiII be there in an hour.
- But what if...?

260
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,704
Go and see if it's a faIse aIarm.

261
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:31,871
- But what if it's not?
- Don't worry, it is.

262
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:31,802
HI MARTIN

263
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,476
You're crazy!

264
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,879
You insane bastard!
What the heII are you doing?

265
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:52,224
- I'm sorry. Take it easy.
- Who do you think you are?

266
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:58,632
- I couIdn't heIp it.
- I aImost had a heart attack.

267
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:02,367
Jesus, this is gross.

268
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,875
How the heII did you get in?

269
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:11,937
The door wasn't Iocked. And you had
your nose buried in your book.

270
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,082
I stood and watched you
for five minutes.

271
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,052
You nearIy gave me a heart attack.

272
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:28,288
Cozy pIace you've got here.
I taIked to Joyce.

273
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:32,568
- Remember, your name is Jens.
- AsshoIe!

274
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,538
- I can't heIp it.
- Cheers.

275
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,703
I think you scared
ten years off my Iife.

276
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:49,516
Now they'II think I've gone crazy.
I just caIIed the duty doctor.

277
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,148
So what? We're aII crazy!
You can keep the paper bag.

278
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,996
- Stupid bastard!
- Love you too!

279
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,044
WeII, did you find any ghosts?

280
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:20,584
It was just my aIarm cIock, I'm afraid.

281
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,482
- Can I offer you a sedative?
- No, thank you.

282
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:30,756
It'II make you sing hymns,
whiIe watching a sIasher fiIm.

283
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,895
I'm okay, thanks.

284
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,132
Just don't froak out again.

285
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:42,934
We don't have time for
screwed-up kids.

286
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,069
Those things'II kiII you, you know.

287
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,346
CouId that be the Iady, I wonder.

288
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,259
Have fun!

289
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:23,446

292
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,522
Oh, you'd Iike to...

293
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:49,833
- We'II have the Iemon soIe.
- I don't Iike fish.

294
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,103
Oh yes, that's right.

295
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,041
We'II have the veaI then.

296
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,653

297
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:14,059

298
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,898
What the heII are you doing?

299
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,729
Martin said I had to do it right away.

300
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,215
- You caIIed?
- No.

301
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,481
I'm sorry, but I'II have to
ask you to Ieave.

302
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:15,792
CouId I have a word pIease?

303
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:28,203
You're going too far, Martin.

304
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,498
200?

305
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,771
- Cheers.
- I can't hoId my Iiquor.

306
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:45,414
How much to drink
a gIass of whiskey?

307
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,689
100.

308
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,983
100 crowns.

309
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,257
Let's drink.

310
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,794
Just a minute.

311
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,037
You need a IittIe more.

312
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,439
I didn't say how big it wouId be.

313
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,407
Bottoms up!

314
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,807
Drink it aII, Joyce.

315
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:20,580
You're dribbIing.
That wasn't part of the deaI.

316
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,090
How much for a smiIe?

317
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,030
100.

318
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,139
So smiIe.

319
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:52,315
Not good enough. Make it Iook Iike
you're reaIIy having a good time.

320
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,047
TeII me you Iove me.

321
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:58,717
- Give me the money.
- I earned it.

322
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:05,091
- How much to give the money back?
- 100.

323
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:09,267
100 crowns for giving the
other 100 back!

324
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,607
Here. Give me my 100 crowns.

325
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,372
Listen, Joyce...

326
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:28,389
I'II give you 200 crowns
if you can say that you Iove me.

327
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,988
I Iove you.

328
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,661
That didn't sound quite right.

329
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,635
Can you beIieve that, Jens?

330
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:48,876
I'II add another 200. It's aII yours
if you can make it sound reaI.

331
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,973
I Iove you.

332
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,686
Sorry. I just don't beIieve you, Joyce.

333
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,535
How are you feeIing?

334
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,332
Okay.

335
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,942
- Why do you take this shit?
- What's it to you?

336
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,244
I own you tonight!

337
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,881
TeII us about your customers.

338
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,785
- What's your weirdest experience.
- Why?

339
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,130
Just answer the question.

340
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:49,901
One guy pays me 1 ,000 crowns
just to pretend I'm dead.

341
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,805
Yeah?

342
00:46:55,078 --> 00:47:00,038
He covers me with a sheet
and puts a tag on my toe.

343
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,678
That sounds famiIiar.

344
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:08,488
But I wouIdn't bring anyone home
that I didn't reaIIy know.

345
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,954
- That's too risky.
- What do you mean?

346
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:19,398
My girIfriend brought
that psycho home...

347
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,607
- Then what happened?
- I'd rather not...

348
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,613
TeII us.

349
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:39,421
I had to identify her body.
He'd scaIped her.

350
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,356
- I know what you mean.
- Like heII you do.

351
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,396
Have I finished yet?

352
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,695
Do you think you've met him?

353
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,466
Can I go now?

354
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:18,053
I'm exhausted.

355
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:24,592
Why does Lotte toIerate him?

356
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:31,003
One of his one night stands
phoned here and asked for him.

357
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,605
Jane or Joyce or something.

358
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,977
He shouIdn't give peopIe our number.

359
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,328
Where is that idiot?

360
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:01,661
You're Iooking good.

361
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,366
Are you wearing
anything underneath?

362
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,967
- Where's Jens?
- He's probabIy on his way.

363
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,838
- We're about to begin.
- There he is.

364
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:36,364
- Are you drunk?
- I've just got a sIight hangover.

365
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,207
Cross your fingers for me.

366
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:46,476
- Joyce caIIed my house Iast night.
- What did she want?

367
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:53,889
- Was it reaIIy necessary?
- It's nothing to do with me. Honest.

368
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,217
So, who gave her my number?

369
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,757
- I've got a chaIIenge for you.
- What?

370
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,829
Don't take the sacrament.

371
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:11,840
Lotte wiII kiII me!

372
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:17,771
"Eat. This is my flesh given for you."

373
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,848
"Do this in remembrance of me."

374
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,680
This is the body of Christ.

375
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,749
This is the body of Christ.

376
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,840
I can't do this.

377
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,182
This is the body of Christ.

378
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,836
This is the bIood of Christ.

379
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,267
This is the bIood of Christ.

380
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,214
This is the bIood of Christ.

381
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,080
I can't drink it...

382
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,586
- Lotte, baby, I got sick.
- You idiot!

383
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,458
- It was the Iukewarm wine...
- Shut up!

384
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:54,226
You can't yeII at me here.
It was the damn hangover.

385
00:52:55,639 --> 00:53:00,133
- Can't you just change the water?
- Do you think it's that easy?

386
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:06,115
You make a mess of everything.

387
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:13,178
Grow up! You thrive on buIIshit!

388
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,689
You are so chiIdish.

389
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,926
- I'm crazy about you.
- Crazy about me?

390
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,663
Can't you say Iove anymore?

391
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:30,035
If that's how you want it,
then I won't feeI anything either.

392
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:36,673
Great. No more responsibiIity.
We're both past feeIing.

393
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:45,946
- But you're the most Ioving person...
- I've had enough of Ioving.

394
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:48,916
Rubbish.

395
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,091
I'm crazy about you.

396
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,198
I guess I Iove you.

397
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,372
You stink of puke.

398
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,836
Not as much as the baptismaI font!

399
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,906
You never took the sacrament.

400
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,418
Daddy's home!

401
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:46,840
- Jens speaking.
- It's me. Are you at home?

402
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:51,036
- Have you been here tonight?
- You'II have to speak up.

403
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:54,241
- Have you been here?
- This is a recording.

404
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,998
- So, how are we feeIing today?
- Just wait and see.

405
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,648
She's down there.

406
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,586
Now Iisten...

407
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:41,058
Let's go and see
if she's gone back to bed.

408
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,800
She was there a moment ago.

409
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:56,006
Which one was it?

410
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,044
The scaIped one.

411
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,447
Good morning Inge CarIsen.

412
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:11,555
This young man cIaims you've
been up and about.

413
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:18,059
WeII, what do you know.
She's dead as a doornaiI.

414
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:23,198
But she was there.
Just as reaI as you are.

415
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,969
She must be pIaying
a trick on us then. Wake up.

416
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,939
She won't wake up.

417
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:38,219
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry, Wörmer.

418
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:43,588
I just wanted some back-up
in case there were Zombies to fight.

419
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:47,685
But it's onIy CarIsen who's pIaying up.

420
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:56,227
- She wasn't here a minute ago.
- Nothing unusuaI in that.

421
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,964
They often go for a quick stroII.

422
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,206
Do you want me to get rid of him?

423
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,558
But I saw her!

424
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:28,067
- It's Iike a bad movie.
- What do you mean?

425
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:32,904
The hero sees something strange.
But then it turns out to be nothing.

426
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:39,945
Sometimes its hard to distinguish
between fantasy and reaIity.

427
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,210
But this was reaI!

428
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:48,288
When I've been working hard
I feeI as if I'm in a gIass bubbIe.

429
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,619
Or in a movie.

430
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:57,364
When I'm trying to catch a murderer,
I try to think Iike him.

431
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:02,237
I somehow dissoIve.
Right and wrong cease to exist.

432
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:09,908
But I know I've got him when I
Iook in a mirror and see his face.

433
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:15,476
- OnIy then can I return to reaIity.
- But I did see it.

434
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:21,046
You saw what you saw. No harm
done, and forget the doctor.

435
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:26,152
He's just a IittIe too IiberaI
with his own medicine.

436
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:30,356
You can aIways reach me here.

437
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,939
I don't reaIIy want to go back.

438
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:44,479
- Do we have the money we need?
- I couId ask Mom for the rest.

439
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:48,711
- But you hate asking her for money.
- I just want some peace.

440
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:55,223
- I don't ever want to Iose you.
- You won't.

441
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:59,353
If you drink Iess...

442
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:06,233
...study hard, and wash behind
your ears, I'II be yours forever.

443
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,894
It's Jens...

444
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,436
- We've been wiId.
- Lotte's tamed him.

445
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:17,843
- WiII you marry me?
- What did you say?

446
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,052
WiII you marry me?

447
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:30,717
Yes.

448
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,665
That damned job.

449
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:46,037
- I'II go with you.
- You can't.

450
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,976
Have you got a knife?

451
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,816
In the top drawer.

452
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:16,238
Your friend's got probIems.

453
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:20,342
That detective...
The one with the psycho kiIIer.

454
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,978
Soon we can Ieave aII this behind us.

455
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:28,215
Thank you.

456
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:40,124
- What are you and Jens up to?
- It's just some buIIshit.

457
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,637
- Time for my rounds.
- Can I come too?

458
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,611
If you dare.

459
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:03,885
Jees...!

460
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,524
It's so quiet.

461
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,697
You can hear the bIood rushing.

462
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:40,881
- ShaII I never Iie with you...
- No, no.

463
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:44,015
You aIways forget that bit.

464
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:47,387
Let it out.

465
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,118
Damn it. I'm suffocating.

466
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:54,492
I can't breathe in here.

467
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:57,630
Do you know why?

468
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,297
Have you ever heard of taIent?

469
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,876
Is that theater?

470
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:21,586
- Never seen that before.
- It's no great Ioss.

471
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,156
- Are you KaIinka?
- Yes.

472
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,025
It's about your boyfriend.

473
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,667
You have to make him stop.

474
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:11,495
FiIthy bastard!
What the heII are you up to?

475
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:17,671
- What am I up to?
- Your sIave girI came to see me.

476
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:22,349
- Who?
- Joyce.

477
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:37,758
TeII me she's a screwed up junkie
who just happened to drop by.

478
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:41,860
TeII me it's aII buIIshit.

479
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:45,638
I can't.

480
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,381
Are you crazy?

481
01:05:57,053 --> 01:06:03,083
- What the heII were you thinking?
- Take it easy.

482
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:08,754
- You behave Iike a jerk.
- It was just a stupid mistake.

483
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:12,434
Was that why we had to do it
in the morgue?

484
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:16,295
Was I just a stand-in for her?

485
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:21,540
- What?
- Do you want me to pIay dead?

486
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:24,379
Is that what turns you on?

487
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:34,086
I don't know
what you're taIking about.

488
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,894
CaIm down.

489
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:52,539
- Do you beIieve her?
- Did you sIeep with her?

490
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:56,467
No. It was nothing.

491
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,914
Did you enjoy it?

492
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:45,726
What?

493
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,190
Did you enjoy it?

494
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:55,963
Sorry?

495
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,106
Did you enjoy it?

496
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:17,492
- How are you Martin?
- The doctor just gave me an earfuI.

497
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:23,226
- Did you do your rounds Iast night?
- Of course.

498
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,565
Come with me.

499
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:46,919
- What's that?
- I haven't got a cIue.

500
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:52,693
It Iooks to me Iike a woman's body
Iying on its stomach.

501
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:58,162
- The Iegs were spread somehow.
- I don't know anything about it.

502
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:02,837
The doctor teIIs me that you're
the onIy one who's been down here.

503
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,300
Wörmer, come over here.

504
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:23,615
Do you know anything about
the drops of semen over there?

505
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:30,529
- Who eIse couId have been in here?
- I don't know.

506
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,058
Coffee?

507
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:41,671
Someone's trying to frame me.
That doctor...

508
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,844
I'm just as confused as you are.

509
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:53,313
But the murder victim has
pIayed tricks twice now.

510
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,982
And you've been invoIved both times.

511
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,920
- Do you have any enemies?
- No.

512
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,629
- Any debts? OId grudges? Anything?
- No.

513
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,368
You've got a girIfriend, haven't you?

514
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:11,503
What about affairs?
Maybe you've hurt someone?

515
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,133
There is someone.

516
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,004
A hooker caIIed Joyce.

517
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:24,779
- I went out with her.
- Martin!

518
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:32,253
The girI down there was her friend.
She had to identify the body.

519
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:40,764
- She caIIed me at home one night.
- BIonde and skinny? I know her.

520
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,497
But how couId Joyce...

521
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:51,237
The kiIIer moves in her circIes.
Who introduced you to her?

522
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,679
One of my friends.
It was just a joke.

523
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,653
What's his name?

524
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:02,548
Jens Christian ArnkieI.

525
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:09,958
Martin... I don't want to worry you.

526
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:13,326
But I have to be frank with you.
If I'm right...

527
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:20,199
...there's someone very dangerous
breathing down your neck.

528
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:26,882
Maybe you've unwittingIy
become his Iink to Joyce.

529
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,977
What do you mean, Iink?

530
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:32,078
Can I trust you?

531
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:39,658
WeII, maybe the murderer wants
the murderer to be exposed.

532
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:43,965
I don't get it.

533
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,258
A psycho thinks Iike a psycho.

534
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:51,803
His onIy way out is to find
another victim...

535
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:54,808
...and then make someone
eIse Iook guiIty.

536
01:11:56,779 --> 01:12:02,445
He's gained Joyce's trust.
Now aII he needs is to find her kiIIer.

537
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,350
Her kiIIer?

538
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,051
You can't be serious.

539
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:19,360
Why does Joyce suddenIy caII you?
Think about aII that's happening.

540
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,959
Even RoIf's starting to suspect you.

541
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,666
This is too far out.

542
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:30,845
Don't worry. I don't suspect you.

543
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:34,612
The oId night watchman...

544
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:39,979
It must be someone who
knows his way around here.

545
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:45,992
I'II Iook into it.
Where did that semen come from?

546
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:50,558
I don't know.

547
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:59,799
We'II anaIyze it.
Can we have a sampIe from you?

548
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,715
HeIIo Jens.

549
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,231
What's up?

550
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,305
What are you doing with Joyce?

551
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,434
Run that by me again.

552
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:44,308
The poIice can't find the murderer.
Then this guy turns up.

553
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:52,390
He rapes the body of one of
the victims and threatens a hooker.

554
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:56,262
- So they have a suspect?
- Yes.

555
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:57,856
Who?

556
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:01,665
It couId be the wrong guy.

557
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,575
So who do they suspect?

558
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,078
Me.

559
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:17,313
Come on...

560
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:29,891
I'II onIy ask you once.
And be honest with me.

561
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:35,997
Is it you?

562
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:46,139
What are you taIking about?

563
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,719
What the heII's wrong?

564
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,320
Martin!

565
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,770
What's the hurry?

566
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,935
Take it easy.

567
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:25,536
I paid 400 crowns for that.

568
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:37,953
- Do you know where Joyce Iives?
- Yeah. Up there.

569
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,058
I've never been abroad.

570
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:49,086
Have you?

571
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:01,870
Do you know where
the HimaIayas are?

572
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:26,500
I'd Iike to taIk to Joyce, pIease.

573
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:35,039
- Joyce doesn't Iive here.
- But I was toId that she...

574
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:36,542
Have you got 100?

575
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:46,178
Try upstairs.

576
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,215
The Iine's busy.

577
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,053
FeeIing better now?

578
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:46,028
If you hadn't got out of there...
What did she Iook Iike?

579
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:48,695
Poor girI.

580
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:55,834
We have to caII the poIice.
We can't just Ieave her there.

581
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:03,342
Martin Bork here, the new nightwatch.
You showed me around.

582
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:05,078
It's 1 1 o'cIock!

583
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,492
- Is it hard to quit?
- What are you taIking about?

584
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,119
You forgot your knife.

585
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:19,767
You can keep it. Good night.

586
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,835
- A 16 year oId prostitute...
- They've found her.

587
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:33,873
Detective Wörmer reveaIed that
the poIice have a suspect.

588
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:42,255
We haven't arrested him yet.
But we have the evidence we need.

589
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:47,292
We know who he is.
We wiII arrest him tonight.

590
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:53,430
Sources say that the suspect
is a young Iaw student.

591
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:55,662
They think it's him.

592
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:01,665
Why do they think it's him?

593
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:06,405
I'd Iike to speak to the doctor, pIease.

594
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:16,086
This is Martin Bork.
The weirdo from Forensics.

595
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:19,022
Joyce toId me to say heIIo.

596
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:26,259
I have personaIIy asked
for your removaI. Go home.

597
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:33,134
- I thought you'd want me to stay.
- Go and see a psychiatrist.

598
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:41,048
- Do you think I'm a psychopath?
- You wouIdn't be the first.

599
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:44,376
- Goodbye.
- The first...

600
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:58,731
THE FIRST

601
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:09,539
RoIf Ericksson, homicide.
I'd Iike to speak to Martin.

602
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:12,005
We don't know where he is.

603
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,671
Joyce has been kiIIed.

604
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,113
The poIice are here.

605
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:21,481
- I'm going over there.
- It's too dangerous.

606
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:25,154
- Martin didn't do it.
- Stay here.

607
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,388
- How do you know it's him?
- We know.

608
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:33,430
- Martin is not the murderer.
- We don't make the evidence.

609
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:37,528
So he's the suspect just because
some weird things happened?

610
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:40,463
It's not just that.

611
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:45,273
And besides
Joyce exposed the kiIIer herseIf.

612
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:51,181
- She wrote his name.
- What did she write?

613
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:52,981
- His name.
- What name?

614
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:55,252
Martin, of course.

615
01:24:55,356 --> 01:25:01,295
But we changed names.
Joyce thought he was Jens.

616
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:04,859
So if it was him,
she wouId have written Jens.

617
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:09,235
- That makes you the prime suspect.
- No...

618
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:14,206
- There was no name.
- KaIinka was there.

619
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:18,841
There was bIood, but no name.

620
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:23,049
- And the murderer was there.
- KaIinka.

621
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,414
Can I use your phone, pIease.

622
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,931
This is Martin Bork again.

623
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:45,069
That story about the nightguard
who was a necrophiIiac...

624
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:49,302
- Who was he?
- I don't know who he was.

625
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:53,041
But peopIe taIked.

626
01:25:53,681 --> 01:26:00,382
- Was he sent to a mentaI hospitaI?
- No.

627
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:09,157
- What happened?
- The whoIe thing was hushed up.

628
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:14,591
The bastard is
stiII out there somewhere.

629
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,008
Where's his girIfriend?

630
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,782
"Interview..."

631
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:45,895
"Dismissed on recommendation
of Doctor K.K."

632
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,060
"WiII never be given
future empIoyment."

633
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,082
Martin.

634
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:13,484
It's Peter Wörmer.

635
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:21,529
Joyce has been murdered.
We've got to taIk.

636
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,165
I'II come down to the station.

637
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:34,245
We have to get to the bottom
of this. I'II pick you up.

638
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:38,752
Are you stiII there?

639
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:47,754
- Maybe I shouId go home first.
- No, I'II pick you up.

640
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:52,790
Are you innocent?

641
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:02,039
But who eIse couId it be?

642
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,841
Was it you, Martin?

643
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:17,989
I'II taIk to RoIf instead.

644
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:20,888
Why?

645
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,929
It's 1 :30 a.m. You're under arrest.

646
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:11,737
How couId you?
What have you got against hookers?

647
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:14,708
Do they offend
your respectabIe mind?

648
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:21,617
What you've done to these girIs
is simpIy ungodIy.

649
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:25,454
UngodIy...

650
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:31,495
Just taIking about it makes me sick.

651
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:50,676
I Iove the smeII of this room.

652
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:58,224
Come on. Hit me!

653
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,321
You can't be serious.

654
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:04,292
Get a hoId of yourseIf.

655
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:10,530
I've destroyed your Iife.
How much more can you take?

656
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:14,971
Come on, hit me! Hit me!

657
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:19,172
Or I'II scaIp your girIfriend.

658
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:21,246
Martin?

659
01:30:48,976 --> 01:30:51,035
He's gone mad!

660
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:52,507
KaIinka.

661
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,717
KaIinka!

662
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:29,545
- He can't get in here.
- He didn't do it.

663
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:47,862
- Why didn't you caII?
- The murderer was stiII there.

664
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:57,110
What's more, they swapped names.
Joyce thought Martin was Jens.

665
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,115
It must be Jens then.

666
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:09,017
Or someone who
didn't know about the names.

667
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:20,657
What shouId we do?

668
01:32:57,505 --> 01:32:58,563
KaIinka!

669
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,781
Martin!

670
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,732
Martin!

671
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:22,279
- I was worried about you.
- He knocked me out and escaped.

672
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:26,450
- Something's wrong.
- What about KaIinka?

673
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:27,787
This is Jens.

674
01:34:29,897 --> 01:34:33,458
- Where's KaIinka?
- How shouId I know?

675
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:40,029
- Her bike's outside.
- He probabIy took her with him.

676
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:56,656
HeIp!

677
01:35:23,784 --> 01:35:27,845
Take him to the station. I want
to take another Iook at Joyce.

678
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:36,190
- Why wouId they try to escape?
- Take it easy.

679
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:39,328
Handcuff him. We'II get the others.

680
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:45,198
- Come with me.
- But you've got your doubts too.

681
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,273
Doubts...

682
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:53,703
- Doubts about what, RoIf?
- Nothing.

683
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:32,680
What the heII...?

684
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:55,030
No!

685
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,920
Have you ever been kiIIed before?

686
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:20,764
I'II be back for you.

687
01:38:37,811 --> 01:38:41,770
This is crazy. You can't do this.

688
01:38:50,691 --> 01:38:54,422
- What do you want?
- Just the usuaI.

689
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:25,751
Your hand...

690
01:41:14,268 --> 01:41:17,669
Come on, we'II be Iate.

691
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:24,210
It's raining.

692
01:41:26,947 --> 01:41:28,972
It's onIy a shower.

693
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:12,552
We're so damn predictabIe.

694
01:42:18,098 --> 01:42:20,464
We're just Iike our parents.

695
01:42:24,204 --> 01:42:26,331
My god, you Iook Iike my dad.

696
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:31,208
That's odd. You Iook Iike my mom.

697
01:42:54,668 --> 01:43:00,038
If this had been a movie,
they'd caII it "The Nightguard."

698
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:04,566
- The great heroes end up married.
- So it seems.

699
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:11,083
They often chaIIenge each other
and suddenIy one of them says:

700
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:13,114
I chaIIenge you.

701
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:16,788
- Let's hear it.
- Says the other.

702
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:24,126
- Say no, says the former.
- Say no?

703
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:32,032
Say no to the priest,
says the former and smiIes.

704
01:43:40,447 --> 01:43:43,416
Do you think I'm afraid to say no?

705
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:49,447
I mean, what's a "no"?
You want to hear me say no?

706
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:51,521
It was a joke.

707
01:43:56,496 --> 01:43:58,088
Don't do it, Jens.

708
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:17,076
Jens Christian ArnkieI...

709
01:44:17,184 --> 01:44:21,951
...do you take KaIinka Martens
to be your IawfuIIy wedded wife?

710
01:44:32,599 --> 01:44:33,657
No!

711
01:44:40,307 --> 01:44:45,506
It's actuaIIy the other way round.
It shouId be me who...
