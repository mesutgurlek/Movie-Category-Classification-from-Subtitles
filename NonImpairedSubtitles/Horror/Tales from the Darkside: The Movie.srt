1
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,800
Oh, see you
in the choir on Sunday!

2
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,900
Hi, Mike.

3
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,500
Hello?

4
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,500
<i>Hi.</i>

5
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,400
Oh, hi.

6
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,900
<i>Been home long?</i>

7
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,800
No. I just got back
from the store.

8
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,700
<i>We're looking forward</i>
<i>to tonight.</i>

9
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,100
<i>Can I bring anything?</i>

10
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,100
I think I have
everything.

11
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,500
<i>Well, if there's</i>
<i>anything...</i>

12
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,900
Wait.
There is something.

13
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,900
Do you have any
champagne glasses?

14
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,800
I thought we'd start
with champagne.

15
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
<i>We have some.</i>

16
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,400
Do you have eight?

17
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,700
<i>No. We have six.</i>

18
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,100
Bring them. Mitch and I
will drink from jelly glasses.

19
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,500
<i>You're going</i>
<i>to such trouble.</i>

20
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,900
I always go to lots of
trouble for a dinner party.

21
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,300
<i>I've got to run.</i>

22
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,700
See you
around 8:00. Bye.

23
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
<i>Bye.</i>

24
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Look at this floor.

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,300
I thought you love
chocolate chip cookies.

26
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,600
Where's that book
I gave you?

27
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,500
When I was a little girl,

28
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,600
this was my favorite book.

29
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,400
Which one was
your favorite story?

30
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,300
What difference
does it make?

31
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,500
Let me out of here! Help!

32
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,900
It's been so long,

33
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,800
I almost
can't remember them.

34
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
Help! Let me out!

35
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
What are you doing?

36
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
Just preheating
to 350.

37
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,800
Help! Help! There's
a crazy woman here!

38
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,700
She's going to cook me!

39
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,700
She's going
to eat me! Help!

40
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,100
I never could do
long division.

41
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,300
Let's see.

42
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,400
How many times
does 12 go into 75?

43
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,300
Oh... 6 times,
3 left over.

44
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,300
Why?

45
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,900
Well, at 12 minutes
a pound,

46
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,800
that means you have
to be in the oven

47
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,700
by no later than...

48
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
1:30.

49
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,200
Oh...

50
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,100
but evisceration takes
at least an hour.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,300
Evisceration?

52
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,500
What's that?

53
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,400
It's like gutting a fish.

54
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,600
First you make
a long slit,

55
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,700
then remove everything
that isn't meat...

56
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,700
the heart, the lungs,
the intestines, and so forth.

57
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,500
Then you fill it back up
with stuffing,

58
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,400
sew it back together
with one of these.

59
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,800
Maybe I should
get started now.

60
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
Wait. There's
plenty of time.

61
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,500
This was
your favorite book.

62
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,800
Don't you want
to hear a story?

63
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
A love story?

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,400
Yeah!
Well, not really.

65
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,400
But it's a really
good one.

66
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
You'll like it
a lot.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,900
Here.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
It's about these
guys in college.

69
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
They live
in the same dorm.

70
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,200
And one of them's
kind of poor,

71
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,100
so he works his way
through school selling things.

72
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,600
Hey!

73
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,200
Be careful with that.

74
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,800
<i>His name's Bellingham,</i>

75
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,700
<i>and he collects antiques.</i>

76
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,100
<i>Well, one day,</i>

77
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,200
<i>Bellingham got</i>
<i>a very special delivery.</i>

78
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,100
<i>Meanwhile, the other guys...</i>
<i>Andy and Lee...</i>

79
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,500
<i>they were real rich.</i>

80
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,400
<i>And they did something</i>
<i>very nasty to Bellingham.</i>

81
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
Lee, the most work
you've done

82
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,200
in four years
of college

83
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,600
is filling out that application
for the Penrose Fellowship.

84
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,700
Hey...

85
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,600
hard work pays off,
Andy,

86
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,100
especially when
you have a girlfriend

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
who can write
award-winning essays

88
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,900
about why I want to spend
the summer traveling Europe.

89
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,200
I suppose my sister's
pretty smart.

90
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
She's just not
very honest.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,500
I don't see why
you'd risk it.

92
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,400
If they learn she wrote
the proposal for you,

93
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,800
they'll kick you out.

94
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Your family sends you to Europe
every summer anyway,

95
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,100
so I don't understand.

96
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,100
Ah.

97
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,000
But this way I have
the fellowship money

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to bring back
a Maserati.

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,900
Maserati.

100
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,800
Guess who was
my main competitor

101
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
for the Penrose.

102
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,200
You know Bellingham works
part-time at the university museum.

103
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,500
Where Susan does
volunteer work. I know.

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,900
You better hope
he doesn't find out

105
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,800
she helped you screw him
out of that fellowship.

106
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Bellingham has
the hots for Susan.

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,800
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,200
Ah, Andy.

109
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,900
Ah, Edward.

110
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,400
How you doing?

111
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,900
You going to introduce me
to your friend?

112
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Uh, yeah.

113
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,900
This is...

114
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,300
Lee... Monckton,
right?

115
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
Yeah.

116
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,900
Yeah. I, uh,
saw your picture

117
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
in our illustrious
college newspaper.

118
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,100
Congratulations.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
Oh... thank you.

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,200
It's an odd coincidence,
us meeting,

121
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,600
since we're
in competition

122
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,300
for the Penrose
Fellowship.

123
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,200
Oh, wait, wait.
You said it.

124
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,400
Competition.
Somebody...

125
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,100
has to win, you know.

126
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,800
Not always
the better man.

127
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Oh, no, no, no, no.

128
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Allow me.

129
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,200
Hey, thanks.

130
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,700
That lot 249
was a heavy mother.

131
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,200
You'll get your money
back tomorrow.

132
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,500
Oh, there's no rush.

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,500
Uh...

134
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,400
I'll tell you what,
Edward.

135
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,400
Just show us
what you have in there,

136
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,100
and my friend here
will write it off.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All right.

138
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,000
If lot 249 lives up
to my expectations,

139
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,500
it won't matter that I was cheated
out of the Penrose.

140
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,400
Cheated?

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,400
Something unfortunate
happened to me

142
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,700
before
the committee

143
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,000
announced
its decision.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,800
What?

145
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,700
I was accused
of stealing

146
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,600
a pre-Columbian Zuni fetish
from the museum.

147
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,000
Well...

148
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,100
did you?

149
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,900
I loathe Zuni aesthetics.

150
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,300
But by the time
I was cleared,

151
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,700
the committee decided
in your favor.

152
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,600
Oh.

153
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,600
Well, who was it
that accused you?

154
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,100
It was
an anonymous tip.

155
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,500
Oh!

156
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
I should probably
get going.

157
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,000
Susan's waiting
at home for me.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,400
Absolutely not.

159
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
You're not leaving here

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,400
until you see
what's inside lot 249.

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
That was the deal.

162
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,600
Edward, why would you
buy something like this?

163
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,100
I wasn't born with a silver
trust fund in my mouth.

164
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,200
You... You can actually
sell this to somebody...

165
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,600
for a profit?

166
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
What else
would I sell it for?

167
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,100
Give me a hand.

168
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,500
My...

169
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,900
God, Andy,

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,800
it looks just like
your father.

171
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Ew!

172
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
It stinks like rotten flowers.

173
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's see if the embalmers
did him any justice.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,400
You're going
to unwrap it?

175
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,300
Why not?

176
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,800
All you're
looking at

177
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,400
is 3,000 years
of dry rot.

178
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,800
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to...

179
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
I'll show you out.

180
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
See you later, Andy?

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
Yeah.

182
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,200
<i>4, 5, over.</i>

183
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,400
<i>6. Two more.</i>

184
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,400
You're back early.

185
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,000
We quit after two sets.

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,400
Sounds like we lost
to Andy again.

187
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,300
Do you know what
your brother is doing

188
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,300
right now
as we speak?

189
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,400
Huh?

190
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,700
He's unwrapping
a mummy!

191
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,900
With Edward Fucking Bellingham!

192
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,000
How much did
you tell Andy?

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,900
Uh...

194
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,000
that... that... that
you wrote the essay.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh.

196
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,900
Well, that's okay.

197
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,900
He knows I do
all your papers anyway.

198
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Oh, and then... and then,

199
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Bellingham
casually mentioned

200
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,900
that someone dropped an
anonymous tip about the stolen...

201
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,500
Pre-Columbian
Zuni fetish?

202
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
He's guessing.

203
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Well, maybe, but I think
Andy knows it was you.

204
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,900
Andy's my brother.

205
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,100
He won't do anything.

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
And Bellingham's
a loser.

207
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,300
He can't do anything.

208
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,800
I've really got to
get ready for dinner.

209
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,000
Don't you want
to see his face?

210
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,300
No. Thank you.

211
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,800
He looks pissed off.

212
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,600
Like he's thinking.

213
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
He's not thinking
anything.

214
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,300
The first thing
the embalmers did

215
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,700
was stick a hook
up his nose,

216
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,400
then drag his brain out
through his nostrils.

217
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,600
Here's where they cut him open
to remove his innards.

218
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,700
Then they stuff him
with flowers and spices.

219
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,200
Here, hold this open.

220
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,300
Come on,
hold this open.

221
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,500
Ohh.

222
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,800
Myrrh.

223
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,200
Cassia.

224
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,300
Onions.

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,100
And...

226
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,300
What?
Onions and what?

227
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,200
A fortune cookie.

228
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,000
What does it say?

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,100
Uh...

230
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,900
I have no idea.

231
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,400
Do you know how to read
Third Kingdom hieroglyphics?

232
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,800
You're taking those books
back to the library now?

233
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,200
They're three months
overdue.

234
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,600
And I thought I'd
stop by to see Andy

235
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
on the way home.

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,900
You don't care about
those books or Andy.

237
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
You're going to
go see Bellingham.

238
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,800
I give him a hard-on.

239
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I'll talk to him,
throw him off the track.

240
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,100
Zuni fetish.

241
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,800
Hmm.

242
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,200
<i>They use their second timeout.</i>

243
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,700

Hey, Bellingham!

267
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,200
Hey, Bellingham, come on.

268
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,100
The fuse box is
right outside your door.

269
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,300
Christ.

270
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,700
Come on, Bellingham.
It's the end of the playoffs.

271
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,100
I mean, Christ.

272
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Oh.

273
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,900
God.

274
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,400
Hey.

275
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,600
You okay?

276
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,900
Yeah.

277
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,900
Jesus!

278
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,400
What the hell
are you doing here?

279
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,300
I just... I just
thought I'd stop by.

280
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,200
What's going on?
Somebody just knocked me down.

281
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,600
Look, you two
just wait here.

282
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,100
Don't go after him!

283
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,400
Go after who?

284
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,900
Um...

285
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,300
a thief.

286
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,400
Damn fuses.

287
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
Well...

288
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
he couldn't
have taken much.

289
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Would you like
some brandy?

290
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,700
Thank you.

291
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,300
Did you see him?

292
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,500
No.

293
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,800
Not really, but he did look
a little weird.

294
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,700
Yes, he was very weird.

295
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,600
He must've been on drugs.

296
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,600
Got off
with my rings.

297
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
Roman stuff.
Hollow gold.

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,300
At least he didn't get away
with lot 249.

299
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
No!

300
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,800
No!

Andy.

use this, huh?

What?

321
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,400
I saw who
killed Lee.

322
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,500
He was thin...

323
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500

324

325
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,100
Like rotten flowers.

326

<i>Very few thieves</i>

328
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
would have the discernment

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,700
that this was
one of the museum's

most unusual pieces.

331

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,000
What a sensual
candlestick.

334
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,500
Take your hands off that.

335
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,300
Good evening,
Mr. Smith.

336
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,200
Dean Murray.

337
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,900
Andy, do you
know Dr. Carey,

338
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
the curator of
the university museum?

339
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,100
Uh...

340
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,300
hi.

341
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,700
What's going on,
Edward?

342
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm a little busy
right now, Andy.

343
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
Yes.

344
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,600
Mr. Bellingham
is packing.

345
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,500
He's leaving
the university.

346
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,600
Oh!

347
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,200
Pity.

348
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,700
Would have been
a nice acquisition

349
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,100
if the mummy
had come with it.

350
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,000
What happened
to the mummy?

351
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,200
He never did have taste.

352
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,000
I don't care how cheap
the psychology is.

353
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,100
I still hate these
stupid chrysanthemums.

354
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm aware of that,
operator.

355
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,600
I've been trying to get
through for a half hour.

356
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,200
Help!

357
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
Police!

358
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,100
Please, somebody help me!

359
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,800
Susan!

360
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,000
Susan!

361
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,900
Jesus.

362
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,800
Jesus.

363
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,300
Damned fuses.

364
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
Hey!

365
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,800
Oh, you're awake.

366
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,700
That's my master's
thesis.

367
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,100
What are you doing?

368
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,600
Well, I'm going to start
a little fire under your chair

369
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
and roast your nuts.

370
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,200
Why?

371
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,400
Because you
killed my sister

372
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,800
and my best friend.

373
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,700
That's why.

374
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,600
I didn't kill them.

375
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,000
Right. Right.
Your friend lot 249 did.

376
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,700
Ah. I thought
he'd be back.

377
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,900
The alleged perpetrator's
got an airtight alibi.

378
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,400
He's been dead
for 3,000 years.

379
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,300
Then these should make
for excellent kindling.

380
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,900
Oh, Andy, you're crazy.

381
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,100
Ooh, damn, I think
I forgot my matches.

382
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,600
Grow, grow, o light.

383
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,300
Ascend, o light.

384
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,700
Rise, o light.
Come forth, o light.

385
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,000
O darkness, remove, re...

386
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,900
Shit, how does it go?

387
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,600
Remove thyself from them.

388
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,200
Open, tat. Open, nap.

389
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,600
Open his eyes.

390
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,900
Open his eyes.
Open...

391
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
Edward,

392
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,200
I believe
in being prepared.

393
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,600
Eh?

394
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,800
Batteries in case
those fuses blow again.

395
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,800
Need a hand up there,
fella? Huh?

396
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,400
Jesus.

397
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,300
Edward...

398
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,300
I'm not going
to apologize

399
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,500
for what Lee and Susan
did to you.

400
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,800
I won't call the cops either,
because what sane person

401
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,700
would believe that
a 3,000-year-old mummy

402
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,700
really did come
back to life anyway?

403
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,000
But I do have another idea.

404
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,000
Well, that takes care
of that, doesn't it?

405
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,500
Would you untie me,
please?

406
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,500
Yeah, of course.

407
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,300
As soon as you tell me
where the scroll is.

408
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,100
You don't need
the scroll.

409
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,600
It only worked
for that mummy,

410
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,300
which you've
totally destroyed.

411
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,800
The second drawer in the desk
on the right.

412
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,100
It's irreplaceable.

413
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,200
Yeah,
I certainly hope so.

414
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,200
That scroll would have made
my entire career.

415
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,200
My sister and my best friend
died because of this.

416
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,500
Killing me won't
bring them back.

417
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,400
If I let you live,
that will bring them back?

418
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,800
Don't worry, Andy.

419
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,900
You'll never
see me again.

420
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,200
But I'll find a way
to keep in touch.

421
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,900
Open, tat.
Open, nap.

422
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,200
Bind them both
to my service

423
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,700
and to the gods
of death, terror...

424
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,600
and revenge.

425
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,000
Ha ha ha!

426
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Hey, man, what's so
fucking funny?

427
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,700
I was just thinking
of this guy I know.

428
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Couldn't distinguish
a Third Dynasty sacred scroll

429
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,200
from a piece of post-Alexandrian
pictogram porn.

430
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,400
Ha ha ha!

431
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,600
Ha ha ha!

432
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Mom, I'll be home as soon
as finals are over.

433
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Yeah, the funeral
was hard on me, too.

434
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,800
No, the police don't
have any leads yet.

435
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,700
All right?

436
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,000
I'll see you
next week.

437
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,900
Bye.

438
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,100
Andy?

439
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,300
Bellingham
sends his regards.

440
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,100
Antiques
are so fascinating.

441
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You told that
very well.

442
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,900
Thank you.

443
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,400
Goodness,
it's almost 1:00.

444
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,700
We've got to
get things started.

445
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,100
You know, if I'm
not home by 6:00,

446
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,300
they'll come looking.

447
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,500
Looking for what,
dear?

448
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Uh... wait.

449
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,600
I'll tell you
another story.

450
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,700
Put the book away.

451
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,100
But it's the best
story yet.

452
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,700
I stopped reading twice
because I got scared.

453
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,300
It's about the old man
who's so rich

454
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,500
and lives in this
big house all by himself.

455
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,900
Okay. This'll be
the last story,

456
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,000
and you have to
make it quick.

457
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,100
I will. I promise.

458
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,900
It's about this old man
named Drogan.

459
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Old man Drogan
had this big problem,

460
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,400
so he hired this man
to help him,

461
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,200
<i>a very</i>
<i>professional man.</i>

462
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,300
It's already
taken care of, pal.

463
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,700
Here,
Mr. Halston.

464
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,100
Here!

465
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,300
You are Mr. Halston,
aren't you?

466
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,300
That's me.

467
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,300
Tell the driver
to wait.

468
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,000
The man says
you should wait.

469
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,800
For what this guy's paying,
I ain't going nowhere.

470
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,500
Take your time.

471
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,600
In here,
Mr. Halston.

472
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,000
In here.

473
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I want you
to make a hit.

474
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,900
That is what you do,
I understand.

475
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,200
How did you
get my name?

476
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,700
A Mr. Saul Loggia

477
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,900
told me
that you know him.

478
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,200
Who do you
want hit?

479
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,600
Your victim
is right behind you.

480
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,500
I ought to
kill you for that.

481
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,000
I don't like jokes.

482
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400
I don't make jokes.

483
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,600
Sit down.

484
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,600
Here.

485
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,400
Sit down,
Mr. Halston,

486
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,300
and look in
that envelope.

487
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,300
$50,000.

488
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,800
There will be
another 50,000

489
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,700
when you
bring me proof

490
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,100
that the cat has
ended its time on earth.

491
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,400
I don't believe this.

492
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,400
You're hiring me
to kill a cat?

493
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,000
That cat has
killed three people

494
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,700
in this household.

495
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,200
That leaves me.

496
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,600
I need not
explain anything,

497
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,000
but I will.

498
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,500
In fact, I feel the need
to justify myself

499
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,800
so you won't
think me mad.

500
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,800
This is
quite a mansion,

501
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,600
don't you think,
Mr. Halston?

502
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,000
Quite a mansion.

503
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,500
Help me up.

504
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,800
Over the years

505
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,900
lfilled this place
with everything,

506
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,300
everything
you could want,

507
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,000
everything
you could ever want.

508
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,000
There used to be
four of us living here...

509
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,300
<i>myself</i>

510
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,100
<i>and Carolyn Broadmoor,</i>

511
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,300
<i>the only friend</i>
<i>of my sister Amanda.</i>

512
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,400
<i>And Richard Gage,</i>
<i>a hired man</i>

513
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,200
<i>with the family</i>
<i>almost 20 years.</i>

514
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,900
<i>We were</i>
<i>a dull collection</i>

515
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,600
<i>of rich, old,</i>
<i>unhappy people.</i>

516
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,400
<i>Then...</i>

517
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,100
<i>the cat came.</i>

518
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,800
<i>It was Gage</i>
<i>who saw it first.</i>

519
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,200
<i>He tried repeatedly</i>
<i>to scare it away,</i>

520
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,000
<i>but every time</i>
<i>he drove it off,</i>

521
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,100
<i>it kept coming back.</i>

522
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,200
<i>Finally,</i>

523
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,500
<i>my sister Amanda</i>
<i>noticed the animal.</i>

524
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
<i>She's the one</i>

525
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,900
<i>who took it in.</i>

526
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,400
Oh, the poor
little thing.

527
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
It's starving.

528
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,700
Is Oo hungry,
darling?

529
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,600
Is Oo hungry?

530
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,900
Cats aggravate
emphysema, Carolyn.

531
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,300
Get rid of
the filthy thing.

532
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,200
Cats aggravate
my brother, Carolyn.

533
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,700
Don't pay
any attention.

534
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,100
I want it
out of here!

535
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,500
Either out of here
or dead!

536
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,800
Which is it to be?

537
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,200
Don't you ever

538
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,100
dare to hurt
this cat!

539
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,600
You hate cats.
You always have.

540
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,000
You're wrong.
I don't hate cats.

541
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,400
Cats hate me.
Don't you see?

542
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,300
We're all in danger
while this animal's here!

543
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,700
You'll find out!
You'll find out!

544
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,500
You'll...

545
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,200
You all right?

546
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,600
I'll be fine.

547
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,500
I'll be fine.

548
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,700
You know who I am,
don't you?

549
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,600
That is, where
my money comes from?

550
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Drogan Pharmaceuticals.

551
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,900
One of the biggest
drug companies

552
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,800
in America, Mr. Halston.

553
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,100
And the cornerstone
of our financial success

554
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,300
has always been this.

555
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,800
Tri-Dormal-Phenobarbin,

556
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,400
compound "G."

557
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,100
Good old Tri-Dormal-G.

558
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,800
A combination painkiller,
tranquilizer...

559
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,300
and mild hallucinogen.

560
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,700
Remarkably helpful
to those of us fighting

561
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,200
the debilitating effects
of an aging heart.

562
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,300
It's also
remarkably expensive.

563
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,900
It's also remarkably
habit-forming.

564
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,500
I've read
all about it, Drogan.

565
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,700
That stuff is one step
up from street junk.

566
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,900
You've obviously
done very well with it.

567
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,200
And you've
done well yourself.

568
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,300
Saul Loggia knows of
at least two dozen jobs

569
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,900
you have done for various members
of the professional community.

570
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,200
All right.

571
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,100
We each know who it is
we're dealing with.

572
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Tell me the rest
of the story

573
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,400
about that cat.

574
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Ah, yes.

575
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,300
The cat
killed them.

576
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,100
I warned them,
but they wouldn't listen.

577
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,500
They found out.

578
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,000
They found out.

579
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,900
<i>My sister</i>
<i>was the first to die.</i>

580
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,700
<i>It was midnight.</i>

581
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,600
<i>She was on her way</i>
<i>to the kitchen</i>

582
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,500
<i>to get that evil beast</i>
<i>some food.</i>

583
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,100
<i>We heard her scream.</i>

584
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,700
Amanda?

585
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,600
Amanda?

586
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,600
What happened, Amanda?

587
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,200
<i>Death by accident,</i>
<i>the coroner said.</i>

588
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,900
<i>But I knew.</i>

589
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,900
Why didn't you get rid
of the cat then?

590
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,800
I tried,
Mr. Halston.

591
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,700
I tried.

592
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,100
I'll kill it!

593
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,400
Let me have it!

594
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,800
I'll kill it!

595
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,100
<i>Carolyn locked</i>
<i>the damn thing</i>

596
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,500
<i>in her room.</i>

597
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,400
<i>She became obsessed</i>
<i>with the animal.</i>

598
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,200
I'm going to kill it!
Do you hear me?

599
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll kill it!
I'll kill, kill, kill!

600
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,500
<i>My mother told me</i>

601
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,800
<i>that cats like to get babies</i>
<i>and old people</i>

602
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,700
<i>when they're asleep</i>
<i>and steal their breath.</i>

603
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,400
Carolyn died
at midnight as well.

604
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,000
Suffocated in her bed.

605
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,400
The coroner said
natural causes in her case,

606
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,300
but again,

607
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,700
I knew.

608
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,400
What did you do then?

609
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,700
I told Gage to get rid
of the vile thing.

610
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,800
It took him
almost 24 hours

611
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,500
to find the cat
and capture it.

612
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,400
Without concern
for the time,

613
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,300
I sent him out to Milford
to the veterinarian...

614
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,300
to have the beast put
away once and for all.

615
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,600
I phoned ahead
to the vet.

616
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,000
"Mr. Drogan," he said,

617
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,400
"it's midnight."

618
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,000
A week later,

619
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,700
the day Dick Gage
was buried,

620
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,200
the cat came back.

621
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,200
No one actually witnessed
any of these deaths.

622
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,600
What makes you think

623
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,700
this cat had anything
to do with it?

624
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,600
I'm sure
it killed them.

625
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,900
It killed
them all.

626
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,800
And I'm next!

627
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,400
I'm afraid of it,
Halston.

628
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,800
It skulks around
in the shadows,

629
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,700
watching me.

630
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,700
It's waiting.

631
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,300
It's torturing me
by waiting.

632
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,100
It's been sent
to punish me.

633
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,600
I don't get it.

634
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,200
Tri-Dormal-G.

635
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,000
That's what
it's about.

636
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,600
It's a synthetic,

637
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,100
developed in our laboratories
in New Jersey.

638
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,500
Our testing
of Tri-Dormal-G

639
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,700
was confined almost
solely to cats

640
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,400
because of
the unique quality

641
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,600
of the feline
nervous system.

642
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,700
How many
did you eliminate?

643
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,300
Over four years
of testing...

644
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,700
5,000 cats.

645
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,300
5,000 of your buddies
get wasted,

646
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,700
and they send <i>you</i> back
to settle the score

647
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,100
with Drogan here,

648
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,000
is that the deal,
pussycat?

649
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,300
Don't make light
of it, Halston.

650
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,900
I warn you.

651
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,500
I never make light of any matter
involving $ 100,000.

652
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,900
Then you'll
take the job?

653
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,400
I could do it now
if you want me to.

654
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,300
I could put my hands
around its neck

655
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,700
and snap it.

656
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,200
Son of a bitch!

657
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,700
It's not going to be
that easy, Mr. Halston.

658
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,800
Don't worry, Drogan.

659
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,200
I'll kill your cat
for you.

660
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,600
Good. Kill it, bury it
and bring me its tail

661
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,200
so I can throw it in the fire
and watch it burn.

662
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,500
I'm going into the city.

663
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,800
That's why I made
the taxi wait.

664
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,100
There's food, there's liquor,
there's everything.

665
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,700
Everything
you could want.

666
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,700
Everything
you could ever want.

667
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,200
Okay, cat.

668
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,700
It's just
you and me now.

669
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,300
Jesus Christ.

670
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,700
Crazy old fucker.

671
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,800
Crazy old <i>rich</i> fucker.

672
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
How about it,
kitty cat?

673
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,000
"Everything
you could ever want."

674
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,000
Why is it rich guys always
buy the cheap stuff?

675
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,400
Look at this shit.

676
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,600
Hey, cat!

677
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,100
For me, it's nothing
but the best.

678
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,700
All the time.

679
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,000
"Everything
you could ever want."

680
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,100
Shit.

681
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,900
Hey, you little
motherfucker!

682
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,500
Nobody hits me twice!

683
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,900
No fucking body
hits me twice!

684
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,200
Can't get hot.

685
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,600
Can't let yourself
get hot, ever.

686
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,900
You make mistakes
when you're hot.

687
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,400
What is this?

688
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,300
What is this shit?

689
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Oh, no!

690
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
No!

691
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,900
This is a $ 100 shirt.

692
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
You'll be sorry
you messed with me,

693
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,500
you little shit.

694
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,200
I got a reason
to kill you now.

695
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,100
Drogan,
you cheap bastard.

696
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,300
Come on, kitty cat.
Let's be friends again.

697
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,500
We can go over
by the fire like before.

698
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,800
You can sit
on my lap again,

699
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,900
and I'll give you
a nice boost.

700
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,000
This is the real stuff,
kitty cat.

701
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,200
Not like that cheap crap
Drogan sells.

702
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,700
What do you say?

703
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,100
You're beating me, pal.

704
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,100
You're beating me good.

705
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,300
I'm trying too hard.

706
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,500
Hey, cat...

707
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,700
I've never
blown a hit yet.

708
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,300
It's just a matter of time.

709
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,700
Get away!

710
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,100
Get off of me!

711
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,800
You're done for,
you fuck.

712
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,600
The rest
of your nine lives

713
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,000
are going in one lump sum.

714
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,300
I can outwait you,
you little shit.

715
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,200
I've never blown
a hit yet, kitty cat.

716
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,600
This is the end of you.

717
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,600
That's impossible.

718
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,400
Fucking impossible!

719
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,700
I had a dead bead
on you.

720
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,700
Where are you?

721
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,800
You son of a bitch,
I know you're in here.

722
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,700
Oh, no.

723
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,000
No.

724
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,200
My goodness,
that was a scary story.

725
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,600
But my favorites
were the love stories.

726
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,300
Uh, yeah. There's one story
in that book that's really scary.

727
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,500
But it's
a love story, too.

728
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,400
Really?

729
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,800
Yeah.

730
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,300
Which one was that?

731
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,400
The one
that's in New York.

732
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,300
You still have to cook
for quite a while,

733
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,700
but I'd love
to hear the story.

734
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,500
"There's a part of New York
that's busy during the day,

735
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,100
"but late at night when
hardly anyone is around,

736
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,400
<i>"strange things</i>
<i>sometimes happen.</i>

737
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,100
<i>"10 years ago,</i>
<i>on a cold, dreary night,</i>

738
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,700
<i>"an artist named Preston</i>

739
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,300
<i>saw something</i>
<i>very, very strange."

740
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Oh, yes. Wyatt.

741
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,900
Hello.

742
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,700
Preston, it's Jer.

743
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,000
There's a guy here...

744
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,100
Fortyish, anal retentive
type, right?

745
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,100
On the money.

746
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,000
Tell him I've been waiting
half an hour.

747
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,300
He's been waiting
half an hour.

748
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,000
Another Drambuie
on the rocks, please.

749
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,300
This one's on him.

750
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,600
4.50.

751
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,500
Keep it.

752
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,500
Wyatt, I'm sorry.

753
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,200
I was just working
on a new piece.

754
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,200
Ah, come here.

755
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,300
Hey, Jer.
Give me a Holsten.

756
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,100
So, did you
bring me a check

757
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,400
or just a lot of cash?

758
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,200
Thanks, Jer.

759
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,000
Judith says she hasn't moved
anything of yours in four months.

760
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,400
Judith Amato.
Big gallery on West Broadway.

761
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,000
If it isn't out by tomorrow,
it gets junked.

762
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,900
What? Wyatt, you've got
to convince her that l...

763
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,700
I can't convince her
of anything.

764
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,400
Wyatt, you're my agent.

765
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:29,300
Well, not exactly.

766
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:35,900
Preston, your artistic vision
is just not a marketable commodity.

767
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,900
Wyatt, I'm broke.
I can't live on nothing.

768
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,600
And I can't live
on 10% of nothing.

769
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,100
You're a monster.

770
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,300
I'm an agent.

771
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,300
For an agent, being a monster
is just credentials.

772
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,800
I'm sorry, Preston.

773
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,200
Fuck you!

774
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,600
Jesus, what am I
supposed to do now?

775
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,600
Ah, Jesus.

776
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:39,100
There's Van Gogh.
Degas. Rodin.

777
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,900
They didn't have agents.

778
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,200
How'd they
get so successful?

779
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,300
They died.

780
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Time to put it to bed,
Preston.

781
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,700
All right.

782
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,300
What about Maddox?

783
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,600
Let him out
in the morning.

784
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,900
That's probably
how I'll end up.

785
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,400
Oh, jeez.

786
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,700
You're pissed
out of your mind.

787
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,600
Ooh.

788
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,000
I'll take you home.

789
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
All right.

790
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,900
Why didn't you
do that inside?

791
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,400
I did. It just goes
right through.

792
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,000
Oh, my God!

793
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,900
Jer.

794
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,000
Help me.

795
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,600
Help me!

796
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,600
Jesus.

797
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,800
Maddox!
Maddox, open the door!

798
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,100
Help! Maddox,
open the door!

799
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,000
Please! Aah!

800
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,400
Please! Please don't!

801
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,900
Your life in exchange
for a promise.

802
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,900
You got it.

803
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
If I let you go,

804
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,100
you must swear you'll
never say you saw me.

805
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Never say
you heard me speak.

806
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,100
Never tell anyone
how I look.

807
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,900
Never repeat
what I've said.

808
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,200
A promise forever.

809
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,900
You got to be kidding.

810
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,600
I... I... promise!

811
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,100
Cross your heart?

812
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,000
Ugh.

813
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,700
I promise!

814
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,500
Come here.

815
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,800
No! Oh, God!

816
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,100
Shh! Shut up.
Please be quiet.

817
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,200
Please be quiet.
Shh.

818
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
I'm not going
to hurt you.

819
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,800
Just be quiet,
all right?

820
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,900
All right?
I won't hurt you.

821
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,700
Let go of me!

822
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
What are you
trying to do?

823
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,900
Take a taxi.

824
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,900
You don't see
any taxis out here, do you?

825
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,200
If you want one,

826
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,000
you can use the phone
from my place.

827
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,800
Look, my name
is Preston.

828
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,700
I live just
around the corner.

829
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Come on.

830
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,400
Come on.

831
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,400
I thought someone
was following me back there.

832
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,400
That wasn't me.

833
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,900
Here we are.

834
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
What are you
doing down here?

835
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I was supposed to meet
some friends, but I got lost.

836
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,300
Here you go.

837
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,000
So what were you doing
out this late?

838
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,900
I was having an argument.

839
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,200
My agent dumped me
tonight.

840
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Police, 16th Precinct.
Hello?

841
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,000
Uh...

842
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,300
Anyone there?

843
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,800
Jerk.

844
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,300
The line's busy.

845
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,000
We'll try again
in a minute.

846
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,800
By the way...
what's your name?

847
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,800
Carola.

848
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,200
Carola.

849
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,900
Can I have something
to drink?

850
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,000
Sure.

851
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,500
So where are you
from, anyway?

852
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,300
Colorado.

853
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,300
Sort of.

854
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,200
I had a boyfriend
in California.

855
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,800
But...
it didn't work out,

856
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,700
so I left.

857
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,700
You're the first real artist
I've ever met.

858
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,300
Tell that to my agent.

859
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,500
Did he do that?

860
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:04,300
I had a run-in
with a bottle of scotch.

861
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,400
I'm sorry.

862
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,300
It's all right.

863
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,700
I'm sorry.

864
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,700
Say, did you try
that taxi again?

865
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,700
Maybe you should
wait till morning.

866
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,500
Good morning.

867
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:53,200
Last night was
very important to me.

868
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,700
It was a nightmare.

869
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,100
Oh, no, Carola!

870
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,500
Not you!

871
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,400
It was everything else
until I ran into you.

872
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,900
That part was good.

873
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,100
It was very good.

874
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,900
I needed it.

875
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,700
I need more of it.

876
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:21,500
I do, too.
Right now.

877
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,200
Oh, yes.

878
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,500
<i>Help me!</i>

879
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,300
Oh, look.

880
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,200
I have to go out
for a while.

881
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,700
Wait for me.

882
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,100
Hey, that's
my friend!

883
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,300
That's my friend!

884
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,400
I want to go!

885
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,200
Someone cut off
his head!

886
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,900
Carola?

887
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,500
Carola?

888
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,300
Yeah. I would've
left, too.

889
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,600
<i>Help me!</i>

890
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,600
Yeah.

891
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,800
It's Carola.

892
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,700
Can I come up?

893
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,600
Sure.

894
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Jesus.

895
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,900
I know what
you're thinking,

896
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,800
but the girl I'm staying with,
her boyfriend...

897
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,600
I didn't ask
any questions.

898
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,600
I called
a friend of mine...

899
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,600
She's a friend
of a friend.

900
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,900
She owns a gallery
on Houston Street.

901
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,800
That's
House-ton Street.

902
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,200
I told her how wonderful
I thought your work was,

903
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,000
so she'd like
to come see it.

904
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,100
Does she
have a name?

905
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,800
Victorine...

906
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,200
but I don't remember
the rest.

907
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,100
Roget?

908
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,500
Victorine Roget?

909
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,800
A friend
of a friend?

910
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,400
Jesus.

911
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,400
I hope you don't mind.

912
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,700
Victorine Roget...

913
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:18,600
owns the hottest
gallery downtown.

914
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,300
Of course
I don't mind!

915
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,500
It's what
I've always wanted.

916
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,500
So how does it feel
to be a huge success?

917
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:45,100
Victorine just sold
a piece to a couple for $23,000.

918
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,800
You're a smash.

919
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,600
Well?

920
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,000
Damn.

921
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,100
What?

922
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,300
Preston.

923
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,100
Excuse me.

924
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,000
Hey, Maddox.

925
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,200
Nice work.

926
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,200
Thanks.

927
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,700
I haven't seen you
around, pal.

928
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,600
Not since
the night Jer died.

929
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,500
I'm Carola.

930
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,000
Nice
to meet you.

931
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,000
Who's Jer?

932
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,100
The bartender
at this bar...

933
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,100
He died.

934
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,200
In the alley
out back.

935
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,800
Come on. Let's go.

936
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,300
Hey, you know
something, don't you?

937
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,700
Just sober up, Maddox,

938
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,300
before someone puts
a match to your breath.

939
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,400
Preston.

940
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,300
I told the cops
everything I knew,

941
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,700
which is
exactly nothing.

942
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,200
Come on.

943
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,600
<i>Promise forever.</i>

944
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:13,200
So are you sorry
you met me?

945
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,100
You take care of me.

946
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,900
Maybe just
a little bit...

947
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,800
I take care of you.

948
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,200
Will you take care
of me... and my child?

949
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,100
Your child?

950
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,600
Oh, so...

951
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:38,200
We going to make
this little bastard legitimate?

952
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,200
To put it
another way...

953
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,500
will you marry me?

954
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,900
Will you marry me
like this?

955
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,700
Oh, ho ho!
Yes, baby!

956
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,700
No! I'm pregnant!

957
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,400
Come here,
sweetie!

958
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,000
No, no, please!

959
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,600
Where are
the scissors... scissors?

960
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,800
Mom, look what Wyatt
bought for me!

961
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,500
They took our picture
a million times.

962
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,400
These kids
ran me ragged.

963
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,200
Each has the metabolism
of a hummingbird.

964
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:31,300
Ooh, is there some party
tonight that I'm missing?

965
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,500
Yes. Preston and I
are celebrating

966
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,900
the 10th anniversary of
the night we first met.

967
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,800
When you thought he was
going to rape you?

968
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,200
Yes, darling.
It's also the night

969
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,100
that Wyatt here gave
your father the shaft.

970
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,100
I had to murder
three other agents

971
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,500
before you'd let me
represent him again.

972
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,900
And you're still
on probation,

973
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,300
you mercenary wretch.

974
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,300
Find another agent
that'll baby-sit

975
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,300
the spawn of hell
on a Saturday night.

976
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,100
Wyatt!

977
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,400
Choose your weapon.

978
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,900
10 years.

979
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,500
So many things
have changed.

980
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,600
Changed for
the better, I hope.

981
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,700
The night I met you,
I almost died.

982
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,100
What do you mean?

983
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,000
Well, let's just say

984
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:49,100
it was the night
my life started over again.

985
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,300
So, happy anniversary.

986
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,000
You know,
you saved Preston

987
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,400
from people like me.

988
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,600
She saved me
from myself.

989
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,000
Time to go.

990
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,900
Sincerity is bad
for my self-image.

991
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,800
Good night, Wyatt.

992
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,200
Good night,
Wyatt.

993
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,000
Whoa, taxi!

994
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,600
Taxi!

995
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,100
Let's move
to the country.

996
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,000
We'll buy
a big house

997
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,600
with lots of land
for the kids.

998
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,300
They'd hate it
as much as you would.

999
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,800
Then for you.

1000
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:07,200
There's nothing
you could give me

1001
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,600
that I don't
already have.

1002
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,500
Yes, there is.

1003
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,900
Oh, Christ,
I hate this neighborhood.

1004
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,300
Can't get
a cab here ever.

1005
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,900
No one has
ever seen this.

1006
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,800
That's what killed Jer.

1007
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,100
Then it turned on me.

1008
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,500
I knew
I was going to die,

1009
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,700
but it spoke. It spoke.

1010
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,600
It told me
it wouldn't kill me

1011
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,900
if I promised never
to tell anybody what I'd seen.

1012
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,800
So I never told anybody.

1013
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,800
Then why are you
telling me?

1014
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,700
Because you're the most
important thing

1015
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,100
in my life.

1016
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,500
You've brought me
10 years of happiness,

1017
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,900
10 years of success,

1018
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,100
10 years
of a perfect life.

1019
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,700
I'm telling you
because I love you.

1020
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:38,300
You deserve everything
I can give you,

1021
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,200
and I've never
given you the truth

1022
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,400
about what happened
the night we met.

1023
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,300
What's wrong?

1024
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
I'm not
making this up.

1025
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,800
I'm telling you
the truth.

1026
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,400
You promised
you'd never tell!

1027
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,200
Ohh!

1028
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,000
Oh, God.

1029
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,300
You broke your promise,
you idiot!

1030
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,000
I loved you!

1031
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,400
Ugh!

1032
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,800
Jesus, please...

1033
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,800
Carola, stop it!
Just change back.

1034
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,500
I can't.

1035
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,000
No.

1036
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
No!

1037
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,500
What's wrong with the kids?
Stop it!

1038
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,900
It's too late.

1039
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:32,500
You betrayed
your vow.

1040
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,900
It can't be!

1041
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,800
No!

1042
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,500
I'm so sorry.

1043
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,200
Carola...

1044
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,700
I loved you.

1045
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,500
And I loved you, too,

1046
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,100
but you broke
your vow,

1047
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,400
and that sealed
our destiny.

1048
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,800
Yo!

1049
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,500
Raarrr!

1050
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,200
What the hell
was that?

1051
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,000
I don't want to know.

1052
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:28,700
My goodness, you really did keep
the best one for last.

1053
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,400
No. I saved the really,
really best one for now.

1054
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,700
You should have told me

1055
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,700
the really, really
best story before,

1056
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,000
'cause now
it's too late.

1057
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,900
It's the best one because
there's a happy ending,

1058
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,800
a really happy ending.

1059
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,700
The stories in that book
don't have happy endings.

1060
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,100
But you got to
hear this story.

1061
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,500
This kid,
his name's Timmy...

1062
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,900
That's nice, dear.

1063
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:56,000
And Timmy's older brother
had this paper route.

1064
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,600
One day, when
Timmy's brother got sick,

1065
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,500
Timmy had to go collecting.

1066
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,000
Timmy went
to this one house,

1067
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,600
and this lady at the door
said, "Come in."

1068
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,300
He went inside, and she
threw him into a pantry.

1069
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,000
She made him eat cookies
to get fat

1070
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,500
'cause she was going to
kill him and eat him!

1071
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,900
This is your story,

1072
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:20,000
and we both know
how it comes out.

1073
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,700
But you don't. Something
really weird happens.

1074
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,300
Oh, really?

1075
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:27,400
Yeah. Uh, Timmy
had these marbles

1076
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,800
in his pocket,

1077
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,800
and they were
all shiny and slippery.

1078
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,700
When he threw them
on the floor...

1079
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,500
she didn't see
where they went...

1080
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,700
and she slipped!

1081
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,000
Timmy saw his chance
to escape...

1082
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,600
if he could just
reach the keys!

1083
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,500
Don't you just love
happy endings?

1084
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,900
