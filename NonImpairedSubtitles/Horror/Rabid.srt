1
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:46,120
RABID

2
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:39,887
KELOID CLINIC

3
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:47,279
As far as I'm concerned these guys
are completely legit.

4
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:51,962
The bank is just as convinced as I am.
They wanna go all the way with us.

5
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:56,475
You know the idea of a franchise
operation for plastic surgery resorts is

6
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,637
one of those magnificent,
inevitable ideas.

7
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:03,003
Banks are always quick to say that
when everything's rolling easy.

8
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:07,156
But you can take it from me - first sign
of heat from the medical association,

9
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,522
first cries of professional outrage,
and the bank'll

10
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,744
call back its note and leave us
hanging by our thumbs.

11
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:14,481
It's not the financing that's
bothering you, Dan.

12
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,918
Your voice has that edge to it.

13
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:18,839
I've never denied it.

14
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:23,042
I sure as hell don't want to become
the Colonel Sanders of plastic surgery.

15
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,178
Why not? Sounds great to me.

16
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:05,442
- We passed it. - We didn't pass it.
I remember that farm.

17
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:08,765
We passed it. That farm comes

18
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:12,767
after concession road 12 and we were
supposed to turn at concession road 11.

19
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:15,043
I don't remember that farm, Dad.

20
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:18,881
We didn't pass it. I very distinctly
remember that farm.

21
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:23,320
If you would just stop this vehicle long
enough to look at this map I will...

22
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:24,841
All right!

23
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:29,079
You're both right and I'm all wrong.

24
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:31,831
We'll turn around and
go all the way back.

25
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:42,635
Goddamn thing!

26
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,413
Shoulda never sold
the goddamn station wagon.

27
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:51,835
Oh, Christ, Bob!

28
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:53,475
Huh? Oh, Christ!

29
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:11,635
Lloyd!

30
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:16,880
Lloyd! My God! I just saw a motorcycle
exploded in that field.

31
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:27,406
- I think there's somebody under it.
- I better tell the boys inside.

32
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:33,291
<i>Is Dr. Keloid there? It's urgent.</i>

33
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:34,875
Yeah, what is it, Steve?

34
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:37,641
<i>There's been a motorcycle accident a
few minutes down the highway.</i>

35
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:40,845
<i>- Should I take an ambulance
and go get 'em?</i> - Yeah, sure.

36
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:43,252
What am I suppossed to do?
Go back to the three of the

37
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:45,321
largest investment groups
of North America and say...

38
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:47,917
- Steve? You still there?
<i>- Yes.</i>

39
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,840
Hang on till I get there, OK? I'm coming
with you. Meet you at the front.

40
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:54,084
Oh, now, Dan. We've got
a lot of decisions to make...

41
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:55,846
You and Murray work it out, hon.

42
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:57,980
Just make the pill easy for me to
swallow, OK?

43
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,876
I don't know why you'd married him.

44
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,480
Bob, get back!

45
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,517
Be careful, Bob!

46
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:09,402
Get in back, hold him back there!

47
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:20,961
Get the car run, let's go!

48
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,308
They're over there, Doctor!
They were speeding!

49
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,435
Oh, my God.

50
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,842
- How is her breathing?
- Heavy.

51
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:16,917
The man's got a broken hand,
separated shoulder, concussion.

52
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,446
We can send him to the General.

53
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,125
But it's definitely major
surgery for her, and right now.

54
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:24,277
I know we're not, but
we've got no choice.

55
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:28,206
- How is her blood pressure?
- Steady.

56
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:30,592
I'd say she's got a half
hour to live and it's

57
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:32,760
three hours to the nearest
serious hospital.

58
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:34,480
It's us or nobody.

59
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:42,960
It must be bad.

60
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,395
Oh, my God.

61
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:08,715
Get it up!

62
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:16,406
The guy in the van has got a concussion,
separated shoulder, broken hand.

63
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:19,919
- Maybe some Demerol when
he becomes lucid. - OK, Dr. Keloid.

64
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,205
OK, boys. Take her into pre-op.

65
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,997
- Tell Dr. Karl to set her up for the
works. - Yes, doctor.

66
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,551
- What's that all about? - Somebody
said something about an accident.

67
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:47,841
Couldn't they throw a sheet over it
or something?

68
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:52,085
- I don't buy it, Dan.
- You haven't seen her.

69
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:54,006
I don't have to see her.

70
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,317
Neutral field grafts have never
been used internally.

71
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,717
We could end up with a terminal cancer
patient on our hands.

72
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:02,998
Aw, c'mon. We can monitor, Roxy.

73
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,364
She's got nothing to lose.
Literally.

74
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:11,398
So when do I get to see Rose?

75
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,356
Not for a while.

76
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:16,875
Why not?

77
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:24,960
Oh, Jesus.

78
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,320
I didn't kill her, did I?

79
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,800
She's not dead.

80
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,162
Now, I know everyone
here is familiar with

81
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:48,141
the standard techniques
of skin grafting,

82
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,982
but what we're going to do is
a little out of the ordinary.

83
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,191
I'll explain it as we go.

84
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,192
We're removing
full-thickness skin grafting

85
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:57,240
material from the
patient's thighs

86
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,437
as per normal graft
acquisition procedure.

87
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:03,642
However, before these grafts
are applied to the damaged areas

88
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:07,084
of the patient's breasts, abdomen,
and so on, they will be treated

89
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:11,605
so that they become
morphogenetically neutral.

90
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:15,523
They are then called
neutral field grafts.

91
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:20,436
Well, when the thigh skin tissue is
treated,

92
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:25,522
it'll lose its specificity as both
thigh tissue and skin tissue.

93
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:32,282
For example, if it were grafted
to a burned cheek,

94
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:35,845
it wouldn't just be thigh skin with the
color and texture of thigh skin

95
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:39,039
it would actually develop as facial
tissue.

96
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:45,764
In other words, neutral field
tissue has the same ability to form

97
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:51,086
any part of the human body that
the tissue of a human embryo has.

98
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:57,886
Let me add that there is always a
possibility that carcinomas will form

99
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:01,244
when neutral field grafts are
used internally.

100
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:07,080
In this case, we're using a radical
plastic-surgery technique

101
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:10,478
to compensate for our lack
of heavy medical hardware.

102
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,766
Can we treat the graft material here,
Dr. Keloid?

103
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,054
No, Dr. Karl. The
graft tissue will be

104
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,284
frozen and sent to the
Sperling Institute.

105
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:25,401
We'll have to keep the patient
in an operation-ready state

106
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:25,646
until it comes back to us.

107
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:27,717
That's going to be a bit trying for
all of us, but it can't be helped.

108
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,558
ONE MONTH LATER...

109
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,675
No. Her body is still in a state of
total shock.

110
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:53,017
She can't possibly be moved
to a city hospital yet.

111
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:56,558
Her grafts seem to be healing well.

112
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:00,764
We've been monitoring
the internal grafts electronically and

113
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:06,238
there is definitely new tissue growth
happening in the abdominal cavity.

114
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:10,238
Her helmet probably saved her
from brain damage,

115
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:12,399
but until she's fully conscious...

116
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:16,886
- You won't know that either. - Hart,
what can I tell you? There's no magic.

117
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:19,839
Look, I've done my best.

118
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:24,558
You're welcome to visit Rose
any time you want.

119
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,723
Please, believe me,

120
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:30,828
I will personally telephone
you the instant Rose shows

121
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:33,622
even the slightest signs of
regaining consciousness.

122
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:26,720
Jeez, when I saw that thing
burning, I never figured

123
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,382
I'd be standing here talking
to you a month later.

124
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:32,204
- How's your hand?
- Oh, it's ok, I think.

125
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,814
They're taking the
cage off later on this

126
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:37,044
afternoon. That's
when I'll find out.

127
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:41,798
The pin stays in my shoulder
for another month, though.

128
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,085
Doesn't seem to bother me except
when it gets damp.

129
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:53,162
Last time I've got my ears done I've
really felt when the weather changed.

130
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,600
- It's probably something you gonna
have to live with. - Yeah, I guess so.

131
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,715
- Hi Lloyd.
- Hi.

132
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,911
- How are you doing?
- Great, not too bad.

133
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:06,166
- Looks terrific.
- Good.

134
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:08,245
- C'mon, Hart. I got
a pack of hungry

135
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:10,153
investors waiting for me.
- Ok, Bye, bye.

136
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:23,919
I hope you've got some friends who'll
help you unload that pile of junk.

137
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:28,802
I've got a bad back. What're you going
to do with it? Use it for an ashtray?

138
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:03,272
Rose!

139
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:07,700
Rosie, sweetie, take it easy!
You need that juice, sweetie.

140
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:08,784
It's keeping you alive.

141
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:11,250
What are you doing, Hart?
Are we all right? Are we...

142
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:13,597
I'm not Hart, Rosie.

143
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:17,967
Hart's back in Montreal waiting for you.
I'm Lloyd. I'm a friend of yours.

144
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,927
- Hart?
- Back in Montreal. Waiting for you.

145
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:25,600
Oh. I... I guess I was dreaming.

146
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,260
I don't think you were just dreaming.

147
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:31,033
You and Hart were in a really
spectacular motorcycle crash.

148
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,521
- Crash?
- Yes.

149
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,190
You're bleeding right now.
I'd better get Dr. Keloid.

150
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,632
Oh. No! No. Don't go.
I'm all right.

151
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,166
But I'm freezing cold.

152
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,602
Oh, you're so warm.

153
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:46,698
- Look, I think I'd better...
- Hold me!

154
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,883
Please.

155
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,204
I'm dying of the cold.

156
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:56,568
Oh, God, that feels so good.

157
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,186
- Ah, look... you don't even know where
you are, do you? - Oh, good.

158
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,202
Look, this is really weird.

159
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,899
Are you sure you know
what you're... Ow!

160
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:10,572
Hey, I think I... I think
I cut myself.

161
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:15,423
I think I cut myself or something.

162
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:06,960
Yes.

163
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:09,120
Who is it?

164
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:26,971
Mr Walsh! What on earth
has happened to you?

165
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,125
I don't know.
I can't remember anything.

166
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:49,452
Were you sleepwalking?

167
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:53,704
Could you have fallen
against something outside

168
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:55,778
and then come back in
without waking up?

169
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,603
I doubt it. Never done
anything like that before.

170
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:04,485
Get me some stuffing, maybe a sponge
or two as well.

171
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:07,725
This wound isn't clotting at all.

172
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:11,547
I think we're going to have to shoot in
some coagulants to get a scab to form.

173
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:12,571
Right away.

174
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:23,123
Does this hurt?

175
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,046
Can't feel a thing.

176
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,329
You can't?

177
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:31,329
My whole right side has
no feeling in it.

178
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:34,973
Just this aching kind of tingling.

179
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,804
Dr. Keloid.

180
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:42,849
Maxim would like to see you.

181
00:18:43,696 --> 00:18:46,927
- Right now? - He says it's very
important. He's waiting in the hall.

182
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:49,524
Ok.

183
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,724
Listen...

184
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:58,011
our friend here may have had a stroke.
The General's the best place for him.

185
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,702
But before you plug him
up I want 10 cc of blood

186
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:03,171
drawn directly from
that wound for tests.

187
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,935
Then get Steve to drive
him into the city in the

188
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:08,365
ambulance. Tell him to take
lots of plasma with him.

189
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:11,004
We're going to have to
forget about the coagulants

190
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,433
until the General has a
chance to do an ECG on him.

191
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:14,685
Will do, Doctor.

192
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,365
Yes Maxim, what's up?

193
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,172
You told me to check around
the grounds to see if I could find out

194
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:23,046
how Mr. Walsh got hurt? I couldn't find
nothing outside. No blood, nothing.

195
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:25,209
Then Nurse Rita call me.

196
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,564
Watch your feet, Doctor.
The police may want

197
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,015
to examine it exactly
the way we found it.

198
00:19:40,818 --> 00:19:42,410
Why the police?

199
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:47,577
Mr. Walsh fellow attempted to molest the
poor girl while she was still in a coma.

200
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,331
I've seen things like that happen
before.

201
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,331
Maybe he was drunk.

202
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,093
Hm. Her grafts have taken amazing
well.

203
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,498
Judy Glasberg.

204
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:15,168
You back again?

205
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:17,398
Daddy didn't think the
new nose was different

206
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,401
enough, so I'm in for
more alterations.

207
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,408
I keep telling him it looks
just like his, and he

208
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,099
keeps saying, 'That's why
I want you to change it.'

209
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,088
- What's that? - I'm terrified
to find out what it all means.

210
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,533
All right, you! Hold it right there!

211
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:24,101
Oh. Whatta we got here?

212
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,057
Hello, sweet honey pie.

213
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:31,579
What're ya drinkin'?

214
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:34,742
You come in to get outta the cold?

215
00:23:38,227 --> 00:23:42,982
I got something ya can take a drink
off of, an'it ain't no whisky, neither.

216
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:46,215
Honey pie.

217
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:53,816
You've got blood on your mouth.

218
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:57,619
Do you like me, ha?

219
00:23:57,947 --> 00:23:59,700
I kin tell ya do.

220
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,825
Come on!

221
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:36,419
Hurry!

222
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:04,831
Lloyd, where are you going?
You can't leave yet.

223
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:07,791
They haven't figured out how come
you're bleeding all over the place.

224
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:10,063
Aw, it's slowed down to a trickle.

225
00:26:10,312 --> 00:26:12,348
- No problem.
- No problem, ha?

226
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,181
- How's your arm?
- It's fine.

227
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:17,501
All right.

228
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:22,235
If the night nurse comes around, I'll
tell her you're in the can, how's that?

229
00:26:22,513 --> 00:26:23,741
Terrific.

230
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,661
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too.

231
00:26:57,674 --> 00:27:00,825
Take me to Camelford.
I'll tell you where to go from there.

232
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:28,143
Rose? I thought everyone was asleep.

233
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,188
Do you mind if I get in with you?

234
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:37,786
I've been lying in bed for such a
long time, my body aches all over.

235
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:46,267
I'm so glad I ran into you.

236
00:27:47,635 --> 00:27:49,105
I think I'd better get out now.

237
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:51,641
I'm getting all wrinkly.

238
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,579
Oh, no. Not yet. You haven't
even told me your name.

239
00:27:57,236 --> 00:27:58,464
Judy Glasberg.

240
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:42,790
Mondom neki: "Miért hagyod,
hogy a nejed dirigáljon neked?"

241
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:45,157
Mister, are you ok?

242
00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:47,158
You look a little bit sick.

243
00:28:47,998 --> 00:28:50,226
Do you mind if I pull over the side
of the road?

244
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,950
- Hello?
<i>- Hart!</i>

245
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:41,157
I'm in terrible trouble.
I want you to help me.

246
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,074
<i>Rose? Is it really you?</i>

247
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,028
<i>Where are you? Are you all right?</i>

248
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,950
- Hart, can you hear me?
<i>- Yes, I can hear you.</i>

249
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:54,749
Listen, you've got to come quick
and get me.

250
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,228
Rose!

251
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:57,829
Tell me what's wrong?

252
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,389
You all right, dear?

253
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,868
<i>Rose, what's wrong?</i>

254
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:13,225
Christ! What was the number of that
place?

255
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,676
Doctor, I think you'd better
come with me.

256
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,110
I think...

257
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,711
I'd like to talk to her alone first.

258
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:40,431
Ok.

259
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,275
Rose... I'm Dr. Keloid.

260
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:13,677
Dan Keloid.

261
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:17,528
I'm here to help you, sweetheart.

262
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:22,792
Oh, dear.

263
00:31:23,804 --> 00:31:25,032
It's all right.

264
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:35,044
Rose, we won't talk about anything
right now except how you're feeling, OK?

265
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,913
Good.

266
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:41,069
First thing I want to do is to check out
some of the skin grafts we did for you.

267
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,060
What's the matter, Rose?
Are you in pain?

268
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:46,913
Talk to me, Rose.

269
00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:50,390
It's the only way I can
understand what's bothering you.

270
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,584
I'm hideous, Doctor.

271
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:55,278
I'm crazy and I'm a monster.

272
00:31:56,445 --> 00:31:57,719
C'mon, Rose.

273
00:31:58,045 --> 00:32:01,435
There's just about nothing we can't fix
if we know what's wrong.

274
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:06,840
Now, I don't want any more games.
Do what I tell you.

275
00:32:09,246 --> 00:32:10,599
That's enough.

276
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,518
Ok.

277
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:21,436
Look at Potato-man!
He is in love with Ketchup-women.

278
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:29,034
Not now.

279
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:31,925
Excuse me.

280
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,915
Who is this? What do you want?
Do you know what time it is?

281
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:43,319
Listen Murray, I hate like
	hell having to bother you like this,

282
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:45,718
but I'm going out of my skull.

283
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:49,404
It's ok. I was up anyway with
the baby.

284
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:52,878
- What's the matter?
- I got this phone call from the clinic.

285
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,685
<i>- And?</i>
- From Rose.

286
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:57,646
<i>- Who?</i>
- From Rose!

287
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:01,042
She's supposed to be in a coma,
for God's sake.

288
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:04,199
<i>She said she was in trouble.
She wants me to help her.</i>

289
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:07,284
<i>She wants me to come
and get her right now.</i>

290
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:11,476
Look, Hart - she's confused and
she's scared.

291
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:14,287
Did you phone the clinic
back and try to talk to Danny?

292
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:17,036
I did. I got to talk to
a tape recorder.

293
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,804
I left a message.

294
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:22,314
Ok.

295
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:24,994
OK. I tell you what I'm going to do.

296
00:33:25,774 --> 00:33:28,902
I'll phone Danny right now at his
private number, and I'll tell him

297
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:32,760
that your Rosie is making phone calls
in the middle of the night.

298
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:35,190
Then I'll pick you up
in an hour and we'll go

299
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:37,398
up to the clinic together.
How's that grab ya?

300
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:38,921
Ok, Murray.

301
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:43,761
- Thanks a hell of a lot.
<i>- Yeah, Keep well. See you soon.</i>

302
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:18,794
Does that hurt?

303
00:34:19,606 --> 00:34:21,245
No, it doesn't hurt.

304
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:43,044
How long have you been conscious,
Rose? Do you know?

305
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:46,355
Couple of days.

306
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:49,006
Do you feel weak?

307
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:53,005
I feel strong. I feel very strong.

308
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:56,810
Rita tells me you refused
to let her attach you

309
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:58,778
to your intravenous
nutrient bottles. Why?

310
00:34:59,527 --> 00:35:02,599
I don't need them.
They make me feel sick.

311
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:04,965
I don't understand.

312
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:09,202
- They've got to be your only
source of food. - They're not

313
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:12,397
They haven't been for
a couple of days.

314
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:16,757
- Not since that man...
- Man?

315
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,999
What are you talking about?

316
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:20,995
I'll show you.

317
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,320
- Half a BBQ chicken to go.
- Yes, sir.

318
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:38,325
Half a BBQ chicken to go.

319
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:41,765
And... will that be all?

320
00:36:44,527 --> 00:36:47,917
Hey, Mister. Did you know
you're bleeding?

321
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:50,880
It's nothin'.

322
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:54,484
- Musta had a rough night, Buddy.
- I can't remember too good.

323
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:55,995
Here is your order, Sam.

324
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:00,754
Hey, Buddy. I think that one's mine.

325
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,783
I said... I think that one's mine,
Buddy.

326
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:06,682
I gotta eat. I gotta eat. I gotta
eat...

327
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:08,799
I don't hit nobody with glasses.

328
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:15,675
Now calm down!

329
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,237
You're sure you want to do this one,
Dan?

330
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:28,573
Louise and I could handle it
with no trouble.

331
00:37:29,687 --> 00:37:30,961
I'll be fine.

332
00:37:32,647 --> 00:37:34,354
You were pretty groggy this morning.

333
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:36,995
Cut yourself shaving?

334
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:39,480
I'll be fine.

335
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:50,155
Scalpel.

336
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:04,595
Sponge.

337
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:53,672
Do you want me to complete
the stitching, Dr. Keloid?

338
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,585
I need... I need something to cut
with, Dr. Rushton.

339
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:02,041
- You want the scissors now, Doctor?
- Yes. The scissors now.

340
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:06,115
Scissors.

341
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:22,115
Dan...!

342
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:35,239
Rita, Dr. Keloid's gone crazy.
He's killing everybody!

343
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:36,840
There's blood everywhere!
We've got to do something!

344
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:38,440
- Calm down.
- Come quickly.

345
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:19,239
<i>The man, later identified as 43-year-old
Fred Atkins of Camelford,</i>

346
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:21,302
<i>went berserk this morning
during an argument over who was</i>

347
00:40:21,328 --> 00:40:23,141
<i>to be served first, and bit
the counter girl on the arm.</i>

348
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:27,526
<i>The man was subdued by an unidentified
truck driver and the place's cook,</i>

349
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:31,316
<i>but died of unknown causes
before police arrived.</i>

350
00:40:31,568 --> 00:40:34,521
<i>Local health authorities suspect
that rabies might be involved</i>

351
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:37,618
<i>and have vaccinated
everyone concerned.</i>

352
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,677
And now, after a brief pause for station
identification, we'll...

353
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:43,668
The place they were talking about
on the radio.

354
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:45,926
Wanna stop off for a bite?

355
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:48,356
Not hungry, thanks.

356
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:23,970
- Hey, look. What's going on there?
- What?

357
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:28,730
The place is crawling with police.

358
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:30,922
You're right.

359
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:32,854
Oh, Christ, no!

360
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:35,450
- What's the matter?
- It's Rose. It's got to be.

361
00:41:35,695 --> 00:41:38,160
- Something's happened to Rose!
- Take it easy, Hart.

362
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,708
They wouldn't need three cruisers
for that. It's something else for sure.

363
00:41:42,096 --> 00:41:43,688
C'mon! C'mon!

364
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:48,536
Take it easy, will you?

365
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,930
Bill, what's going on?

366
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:06,691
- Where's Dr. Keloid?
- Murray, thank God you're here.

367
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,208
It's been a nightmare.

368
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,492
I'm trying to find my girlfriend.

369
00:42:11,021 --> 00:42:12,932
She's a patient here.

370
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,736
She was here last night but nobody
seems to know where she is.

371
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:20,506
We got a young girl downstairs.
You wanna take a look at her?

372
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:24,652
- Is her name Rose? - We don't know.
We didn't ask her. C'mon.

373
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:29,455
Tell the chief I'm downstairs gettin'
	an ID. Be back in a flash.

374
00:42:32,544 --> 00:42:36,219
- So you are in fact Dr. Keloid's
business partner? - Yes, I am.

375
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:38,102
Come with me, please.
Excuse me.

376
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:42,176
- Bill?
- No, you go, Murray.

377
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:45,304
I can't. I've seen it.

378
00:42:47,226 --> 00:42:49,341
Mr. Cypher, please!

379
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:56,424
Couple of my men got bitten.

380
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,228
Those rabies shots are killers.

381
00:42:59,468 --> 00:43:02,123
Think I'd rather take my chances on
getting sick instead.

382
00:43:05,308 --> 00:43:06,536
How is he, doc?

383
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,820
You said they've got bitten.

384
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:26,302
- Bitten? By what?
- By that.

385
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,701
- What?
- Go ahead, take a look.

386
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:46,623
Can you confirm the identification
of this man as Dr. Daniel Keloid?

387
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,388
C'mere. Can't see anything from there.

388
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:15,746
Is that Rose?

389
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,478
No.

390
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,753
No. No, that's not Rose.

391
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,229
Rose, would you like a bite?

392
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,717
Steak on a bun.
Real good.

393
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:33,453
Um... wouldn't mind just one bite.

394
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:34,990
Sure?

395
00:44:49,283 --> 00:44:50,512
It's fabulous.

396
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:20,836
It's ok.

397
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:23,523
Last time I ever patronize that greasy
spoon, I can promise you that.

398
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:26,091
C'mon sweetheart. There's a girl.
Get it all out.

399
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:33,766
I'll lift you back in. We'll get you
some soup or something at the next stop.

400
00:46:24,778 --> 00:46:26,130
Something wrong?

401
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:28,726
Hey, buddy!

402
00:46:29,258 --> 00:46:30,486
What?

403
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:38,974
I musta dozed off.
Yeah, I was driving...

404
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,139
Well, that's good.

405
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,079
We find too many of you
boys taking pills to

406
00:46:46,105 --> 00:46:48,143
keep yourselves going
all day and all night.

407
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:50,729
Thanks.

408
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:53,258
Next time, though, try to pick
a better spot to pull over.

409
00:46:53,284 --> 00:46:54,564
This road's kind of narrow.

410
00:46:56,302 --> 00:46:58,452
Oh, thanks. I will.
Sorry.

411
00:46:59,823 --> 00:47:01,255
OK. Have a nice day.

412
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:27,574
Hi.

413
00:47:27,827 --> 00:47:29,657
- Hi. where are you going?
- Montrea. Where are you going?

414
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,699
- Same place.
- Great.

415
00:47:35,707 --> 00:47:38,267
I was beginning to think
I'd never get back home again.

416
00:47:57,351 --> 00:48:00,741
Claude Lapointe, Quebec Bureau of
Health, official business.

417
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:02,219
Sorry, boys.

418
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:05,266
You can't go in unless you're
willing to stay.

419
00:48:05,712 --> 00:48:07,943
The whole station's
under quarantine.

420
00:48:08,272 --> 00:48:10,423
We think we've got an epidemic.

421
00:48:11,393 --> 00:48:12,621
Hello, Mindy?

422
00:48:14,554 --> 00:48:15,782
How are you?

423
00:48:16,234 --> 00:48:17,462
Good.

424
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:21,789
Listen, I thought that Rose might try
to get in touch with you.

425
00:48:23,155 --> 00:48:24,827
Yeah. She what? She called you?

426
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:28,371
She's on her way over?
That's incredible.

427
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:36,627
You wouldn't believe what's been
happening. It's crazy time.

428
00:48:41,357 --> 00:48:44,274
Well, listen. When she gets there,
tell her

429
00:48:44,418 --> 00:48:47,836
I'll be stuck in the Camelford cop shop
for at least forty-eight hours.

430
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:51,711
When she gets there
you'll keep here for me.

431
00:48:52,919 --> 00:48:56,074
Ok, Mindy. Bye.

432
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,236
Hey, anybody here seen Eddy?
He's got the lead

433
00:49:20,262 --> 00:49:22,268
truck and I can't find
the son of a bitch.

434
00:49:22,684 --> 00:49:23,827
I think I've seeb him
in the back before.

435
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:24,993
He didn't look too good.

436
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,236
Whaddya mean he didn't look too good?
Smooth Eddy always looks good.

437
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,820
He looked sick.
Like, nauseous.

438
00:49:30,044 --> 00:49:32,684
What the fuck we runnin' here,
a nursery?

439
00:49:50,807 --> 00:49:52,018
Eddy!

440
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:53,567
Hey, Eddy, you in there?

441
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:59,444
God damn truck drivers,
you can't trust them...

442
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:25,584
<i>...and health officials have said they
consider the outbreak</i>

443
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,498
<i>of the new strain of rabies as being
potentially 'the worst of this century.'</i>

444
00:50:28,785 --> 00:50:31,534
<i>At the police station in Camelford,
Kathy Draper talked to</i>

445
00:50:31,558 --> 00:50:34,840
<i>Quebec Bureau of Health official
Claude Lapointe.</i>

446
00:50:36,331 --> 00:50:40,359
<i>This is not just a question of swine flu
or something like that.</i>

447
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:45,319
<i>We have already several deaths on
our hands in this one small area alone,</i>

448
00:50:45,563 --> 00:50:48,646
<i>and the main problem is... we don't
know what we're up against.</i>

449
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:51,401
<i>Are you saying that this is not
an outbreak of rabies?</i>

450
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:53,755
<i>I'm not saying that. I'm not
saying that, exactly.</i>

451
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:56,555
<i>But it must be a new strain of rabies,
because there are symptoms involved</i>

452
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,144
<i>which we and even
the world health</i>

453
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,520
<i>community do not seem
to be familiar with.</i>

454
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,961
<i>What are these symptoms?</i>

455
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:07,934
<i>Well, the period of incubation of
this disease is very brief,</i>

456
00:51:08,176 --> 00:51:10,324
<i>maybe six to eight hours at the most.</i>

457
00:51:10,563 --> 00:51:13,800
<i>Now, that's quick, much quicker
than normal rabies.</i>

458
00:51:14,162 --> 00:51:19,245
<i>Then the victim begins to sweat,
to shake, to foam at the mouth.</i>

459
00:51:19,483 --> 00:51:22,249
<i>That's not so rare.
What is rare is that</i>

460
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:26,909
<i>the victim always with this new disease
becomes violent</i>

461
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:29,565
<i>and wants to bite somebody new.</i>

462
00:51:30,124 --> 00:51:32,820
<i>And this crazy phase
is followed by a coma</i>

463
00:51:32,846 --> 00:51:35,514
<i>and then, in every case
we know, by death.</i>

464
00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:37,004
<i>It's very strange.</i>

465
00:51:37,245 --> 00:51:39,189
<i>What advice would you give
to our viewers?</i>

466
00:51:40,452 --> 00:51:42,785
<i>The disease spreads
through the saliva of the</i>

467
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:45,141
<i>victim... the saliva
is very contagious.</i>

468
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:49,599
<i>It dribbles into open wounds and cuts
and causes immediate infection.</i>

469
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:51,708
<i>So?</i>

470
00:51:51,994 --> 00:51:55,075
<i>So... don't let anybody bite you.
And if somebody does,</i>

471
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:59,659
<i>find a doctor who can give you
rabies shots immediately.</i>

472
00:51:59,693 --> 00:52:02,063
<i>I heard you mention the
Black Plague of London just</i>

473
00:52:02,087 --> 00:52:05,407
<i>before we went on the air.
Is that what you mean by...?</i>

474
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:12,796
Surprise. I'm amongst the living.

475
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:21,677
Got anything in there I might want
to read?

476
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:30,238
I'm starting to go stir crazy already.

477
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:34,125
It's actually pretty exciting stuff
if you know how to interpret it.

478
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:36,075
Really.

479
00:52:40,888 --> 00:52:42,764
I can't see straight.

480
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:45,283
I'm just going on automatic pilot.

481
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:48,595
Oh, boy.

482
00:52:50,647 --> 00:52:52,718
I just can't believe
they're all dead...

483
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:57,563
George, for God's sake! Can't you
understand what I'm saying?

484
00:52:58,288 --> 00:52:59,687
Stay back!

485
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:02,436
Sit on the floor and put your
hands on your head.

486
00:53:03,008 --> 00:53:04,762
Get into the cell.
Do what I tell you!

487
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:08,205
Gimme room. I'm coming in quick.

488
00:53:27,928 --> 00:53:29,883
They gave him rabies shots.

489
00:53:30,408 --> 00:53:35,003
He got bitten up at that facelift place
and they gave him his shots right away.

490
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:37,881
They didn't do him any damn good,
did they?

491
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:47,525
Where are you going?

492
00:53:48,127 --> 00:53:49,881
I think I have to go out for a while.

493
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,399
Rosie, I feel so stupid.

494
00:53:54,408 --> 00:53:56,602
I haven't been much of a hostess.

495
00:53:57,089 --> 00:53:59,044
Why don't you stay here?
There must be

496
00:53:59,056 --> 00:54:01,023
something in the fridge
I can tempt you with.

497
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:02,611
Thanks, Mindy, but it's not that.

498
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:05,684
I just have to get out
into the fresh air again.

499
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:08,363
It's a real experience for me
just to walk down a street.

500
00:54:08,608 --> 00:54:12,520
- Let me come with you. - No. You
stay here and finish your laundry.

501
00:54:12,767 --> 00:54:15,885
- I won't be gone too long.
- OK, Rosie.

502
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:18,602
If you get dizzy or anything,
call me.

503
00:54:18,847 --> 00:54:22,035
Ok, I will. Don't worry.

504
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:12,522
'Scuse me. I didn't mean
to touch you.

505
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:22,718
Well, pardon me for existing.

506
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:26,878
I thought you did it on purpose.

507
00:56:28,727 --> 00:56:32,686
No. Really. I was taking my jacket
off and it brushed against you.

508
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,275
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

509
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:39,960
I like seeing these movies
but men are always bothering me.

510
00:56:40,207 --> 00:56:41,845
I guess I'm a little paranoid.

511
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:44,075
Well, look.

512
00:56:44,928 --> 00:56:47,203
If I come and sit beside
you everybody will think

513
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:52,325
we're together and you'll be
able to watch in peace.

514
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:56,960
All I ask is a couple
handfuls of popcorn.

515
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:00,560
Ok.

516
00:57:02,807 --> 00:57:04,035
C'mon.

517
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:38,595
I'm going, Rosie.

518
00:59:39,566 --> 00:59:43,320
I've left you some coffee on the stove.
Turn it off if you go out, OK?

519
00:59:46,647 --> 00:59:48,477
OK. 'Bye.

520
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,279
Aren't you going to wish me luck?

521
00:59:54,527 --> 00:59:55,754
Are you OK?

522
00:59:57,847 --> 00:59:59,519
Brushing my teeth.

523
01:00:00,126 --> 01:00:01,355
Bye.

524
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:03,995
Good luck.

525
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:05,474
Thanks.

526
01:00:06,407 --> 01:00:07,635
See you later.

527
01:01:48,107 --> 01:01:50,861
You'll pardon me, Mr. McLaren,
but I think

528
01:01:50,867 --> 01:01:54,061
the mayor should be taking this
epidemic more seriously than he is.

529
01:01:54,788 --> 01:01:56,732
A city is a complex
machine, Mr. Lapointe.

530
01:01:56,744 --> 01:01:58,501
Needs constant attention.

531
01:01:59,227 --> 01:02:03,743
The mayor will listen to you, but you're
not the only one. It takes time...

532
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:08,859
- Why have we stopped, Clark? - There
is no way to get around this truck.

533
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:11,184
Well, isn't there anyone around?

534
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:14,282
- Do we have to turn around?
- Oh, here is somebody, sir.

535
01:02:14,787 --> 01:02:17,963
Clark... roll down your window and
ask them why the road is blocked.

536
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:20,706
- It may be strike trouble. Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

537
01:02:25,546 --> 01:02:27,584
They've got the disease!
Look at their eyes!

538
01:03:00,128 --> 01:03:02,309
<i>...we spoke with a director
of the World Health</i>

539
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:03,655
<i>Organization who had just
arrived from England</i>

540
01:03:03,707 --> 01:03:08,985
<i>to take charge of liaison with Health
Bureaus in Western European countries.</i>

541
01:03:13,467 --> 01:03:17,903
Dr. Gentry, do you honestly feel that
this is a time for martial law?

542
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:21,043
I don't think there's any question
that martial law is needed

543
01:03:21,067 --> 01:03:23,978
in the city of Montreal
at this point in time.

544
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:26,464
It's a necessity.

545
01:03:26,707 --> 01:03:31,018
It has already been established
that victims of the disease

546
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:34,225
- and it is not rabies, though it may be
related to the rabies virus -

547
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:37,823
victims of the disease are
beyond medical help

548
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:41,527
once it has established itself to
the degree of inducing violent behavior.

549
01:03:42,187 --> 01:03:46,100
What you're saying, then, Dr. Gentry,
is that...

550
01:03:46,347 --> 01:03:51,705
What I'm saying is very simple. It may
not be very palatable for your viewers.

551
01:03:53,267 --> 01:03:55,690
Shooting down victims
of the disease is as

552
01:03:55,702 --> 01:03:58,136
good a way of handling
them as we've got.

553
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:04,220
If we lock them up, they immediately go
into a coma and die shortly afterwards.

554
01:04:04,587 --> 01:04:08,626
<i>We've now got a vaccine that we think
will work in a preventative way,</i>

555
01:04:09,027 --> 01:04:12,099
<i>but for those who are alread
incubating the disease...</i>

556
01:04:13,107 --> 01:04:16,986
- C'mon. Rose is waitin' for me.
- OK, kid. Let's go.

557
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:24,531
<i>All those receiving
shots of the new</i>

558
01:04:24,543 --> 01:04:27,099
<i>vaccine are being issued
plastic ID cards.</i>

559
01:04:28,187 --> 01:04:32,339
<i>Viewers are urged not to leave their
homes unless absolutely necessary,</i>

560
01:04:32,587 --> 01:04:34,691
<i>and are reminded
that if they do they</i>

561
01:04:34,703 --> 01:04:36,818
<i>must carry their vaccine
cards with them.</i>

562
01:04:37,067 --> 01:04:40,537
<i>Police, army, and militia officers
may demand to see them.</i>

563
01:04:43,187 --> 01:04:44,799
- Give me the keys.
- Here you are.

564
01:04:45,786 --> 01:04:47,694
Remember to keep your
windows up and your

565
01:04:47,706 --> 01:04:49,625
doors locked once you
get into the city.

566
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:51,717
Maybe the bug can't get
you now, but that...

567
01:04:51,729 --> 01:04:53,791
...that won't protect
you from the crazies.

568
01:04:54,027 --> 01:04:55,540
- Take care now.
- Thank you.

569
01:04:55,787 --> 01:04:57,015
Bye.

570
01:06:27,907 --> 01:06:29,135
Hi.

571
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:32,295
Mind if I sit down?

572
01:06:33,507 --> 01:06:34,735
I don't mind.

573
01:06:45,427 --> 01:06:47,224
Nothing like Christmas, huh?

574
01:06:54,707 --> 01:06:56,026
Ah... you smoke?

575
01:06:57,187 --> 01:06:58,620
You know... cigarettes?

576
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:03,455
Do you want a cigarette?

577
01:07:17,107 --> 01:07:18,335
Have you got a light?

578
01:07:21,307 --> 01:07:22,786
I lighter?

579
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:30,244
I'll ask that guy over
there for a light.

580
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:33,580
I'll be right back.

581
01:07:38,748 --> 01:07:39,975
You gotta light, buddy?

582
01:07:47,907 --> 01:07:50,023
Stop or I'll shot!

583
01:07:51,907 --> 01:07:53,136
Stop!

584
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:56,095
Get out of the way!

585
01:07:57,268 --> 01:07:58,495
Stop!

586
01:08:16,347 --> 01:08:17,576
Christ!

587
01:08:18,548 --> 01:08:21,255
Rose, are you home?

588
01:08:21,827 --> 01:08:24,434
You never guess what happened to me
on the subway today.

589
01:08:24,827 --> 01:08:26,155
The whole city's gone crazy.

590
01:08:33,787 --> 01:08:35,015
Have you been out?

591
01:08:36,707 --> 01:08:37,940
Have you gotten your shot?

592
01:08:41,348 --> 01:08:42,575
I can't go out.

593
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:45,415
I can't go out.

594
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:51,135
What's been going on?

595
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:53,908
What's the matter with you?

596
01:08:57,148 --> 01:08:58,375
Poor kid.

597
01:09:01,627 --> 01:09:02,855
Well, don't worry.

598
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:06,338
I'm here and going to
take care of you.

599
01:09:09,987 --> 01:09:12,871
<i>...and the crisis has now
been officially granted</i>

600
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:15,778
<i>epidemic status by
officials of the WHO.</i>

601
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:20,384
<i>The Prime Minister was reluctant to
officially declare a state of emergency,</i>

602
01:09:20,627 --> 01:09:22,691
<i>but as any citizen in
the streets can tell</i>

603
01:09:22,703 --> 01:09:24,779
<i>you, martial law has
come to Montreal.</i>

604
01:10:34,746 --> 01:10:36,703
How long are wee gonna be stuck here?

605
01:11:06,347 --> 01:11:07,825
I can't believe it.

606
01:11:08,627 --> 01:11:10,025
It's like we were at war.

607
01:11:10,787 --> 01:11:14,223
Listen, Hart. We're going
to my place first.

608
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:18,264
I'm not going to relax until
I know that everything there's OK.

609
01:11:19,106 --> 01:11:22,898
Once we're there, I'll give you the keys
to the car and you can go get your girl.

610
01:11:23,027 --> 01:11:24,255
OK. Thanks.

611
01:12:01,146 --> 01:12:02,375
Listen,

612
01:12:03,547 --> 01:12:06,459
- phone me when you get there.
- Yeah, I will.

613
01:12:14,867 --> 01:12:18,418
Look, maybe you should bring Rose
back here with you

614
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:21,462
until this thing blows over.

615
01:12:24,027 --> 01:12:25,255
Yeah, ok.

616
01:12:27,586 --> 01:12:29,862
- Listen, Murray.
- Yeah?

617
01:12:32,467 --> 01:12:34,298
Thanks for the car, right.

618
01:12:35,827 --> 01:12:38,705
- Don't forget to lock the door.
- Yeah.

619
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:41,297
- I'll see you soon.
- I'll call you.

620
01:12:56,867 --> 01:12:58,095
Cecile!

621
01:13:12,547 --> 01:13:13,775
I'm home.

622
01:13:17,027 --> 01:13:18,255
Honey.

623
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:21,786
Cecile? I'm home.

624
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,335
Cecile!

625
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,295
Hey sweetie!

626
01:13:30,467 --> 01:13:31,695
Cecile?

627
01:13:35,947 --> 01:13:37,175
Cecile!

628
01:13:43,227 --> 01:13:44,455
Honey!

629
01:13:47,147 --> 01:13:48,466
I'm home.

630
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,255
Cecile?

631
01:14:19,748 --> 01:14:20,975
Honey?

632
01:15:00,867 --> 01:15:02,095
Oh, God!

633
01:15:50,987 --> 01:15:52,215
That's it, Rosie.

634
01:15:53,828 --> 01:15:56,580
You just get as much sleep
as you need.

635
01:16:05,267 --> 01:16:06,620
Don't think about anything.

636
01:16:11,787 --> 01:16:13,823
Let your mind drift.

637
01:16:26,027 --> 01:16:28,530
<i>And so after using
some rather elaborate</i>

638
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,056
<i>tracking procedures and
applying them to a map</i>

639
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:33,053
<i>we find that the disease
does in fact seem</i>

640
01:16:33,065 --> 01:16:34,914
<i>to have a very specific
place of origin.</i>

641
01:16:35,067 --> 01:16:36,295
<i>Which is...?</i>

642
01:16:36,547 --> 01:16:39,294
<i>Which is the Keloid Clinic
of Cosmetic Surgery,</i>

643
01:16:39,306 --> 01:16:42,065
<i>a few miles outside the
town of Camelford.</i>

644
01:16:42,827 --> 01:16:45,881
<i>You can see with your own eyes</i>

645
01:16:45,907 --> 01:16:49,746
<i>how everything has spread out from there
in geometrically increasing proportions.</i>

646
01:16:50,031 --> 01:16:51,975
<i>Now this pattern, in
conjunction with some</i>

647
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:53,906
<i>of our other statistics,
indicates that</i>

648
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:57,050
<i>hthere is a strong
possibility that there is a</i>

649
01:16:57,062 --> 01:17:00,056
<i>special factor at work in
the spread of the disease.</i>

650
01:17:00,307 --> 01:17:01,535
<i>You mean a carrier.</i>

651
01:17:01,787 --> 01:17:05,859
<i>Well, at the risk of setting off
a futile witch hunt... Yes.</i>

652
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:10,942
<i>Someone like the infamous Typhoid
Mary who incubates the disease</i>

653
01:17:10,966 --> 01:17:14,255
<i>and transmits it, but
is herself immune to it.</i>

654
01:17:14,507 --> 01:17:17,305
<i>What were they doing at the Keloid
Clinic, Dr. Gentry?</i>

655
01:18:21,027 --> 01:18:22,242
Ok, Jack. I got another.

656
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:41,218
Oh, no!

657
01:19:41,713 --> 01:19:44,718
Rose, you can't!

658
01:19:45,249 --> 01:19:46,655
It's dangerous out there.

659
01:19:46,897 --> 01:19:49,263
Mindy. I don't want it
to be you.

660
01:19:50,634 --> 01:19:52,200
Of course it should be me.

661
01:19:53,447 --> 01:19:55,608
Who else but your best friend, Rose?

662
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,345
I'll take care of you.

663
01:19:57,829 --> 01:19:59,508
Oh, I ache all over.

664
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:03,008
I'm hurting from the inside out.

665
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:08,358
Well then, what you need is a nice,
deep, hot bath.

666
01:20:09,242 --> 01:20:12,649
It'll seep in and relax you.
It won't ache anymore.

667
01:21:13,224 --> 01:21:14,550
It's not my fault.

668
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:20,567
It's you.

669
01:21:28,215 --> 01:21:31,746
- It's been you all along.
- What are you talking about?

670
01:21:35,489 --> 01:21:39,261
You carry the plague. You've killed
hundreds of people.

671
01:21:40,878 --> 01:21:43,343
No... no... you don't know
what you're talking about.

672
01:21:43,367 --> 01:21:44,600
I'm still me.

673
01:21:46,663 --> 01:21:49,908
- I'm still Rose.
- No, you are not Rose!

674
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:56,342
What did they do to you at the clinic?
What did they turn you into?

675
01:21:57,152 --> 01:21:58,591
I have to have blood.

676
01:22:00,487 --> 01:22:01,928
It's all I can eat.

677
01:22:03,824 --> 01:22:05,057
And it's my fault.

678
01:22:06,194 --> 01:22:07,635
It's your fault!

679
01:22:08,445 --> 01:22:10,525
- It's all your fault.
- Stop!

680
01:22:18,452 --> 01:22:20,453
There must be some way to fix this...

681
01:22:21,226 --> 01:22:23,626
- We'll go to the police...
- No.

682
01:22:25,365 --> 01:22:26,690
We'll go to the hospital...

683
01:22:26,932 --> 01:22:28,693
No, we won't. Just leave me alone.

684
01:22:30,027 --> 01:22:31,505
- Wait!
- No!

685
01:22:32,467 --> 01:22:35,775
- Wait!
- Leave me alone! Let me go!

686
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,680
Rose, listen to me.

687
01:22:39,027 --> 01:22:40,779
Listen to me, you're right.

688
01:22:40,827 --> 01:22:43,924
We're in it together. We'll figure
it all out together...

689
01:24:18,107 --> 01:24:19,335
Hi.

690
01:24:20,427 --> 01:24:22,228
I've seen you around
before, haven't I?

691
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:28,343
I just moved out of this building.
They keep sending my mail here.

692
01:24:30,907 --> 01:24:33,375
I... yes, I'm a friend of Mindy Kent.

693
01:24:34,227 --> 01:24:38,106
I was supposed to meet her here,
but she must have gone out.

694
01:25:36,667 --> 01:25:38,147
<i>- Hello?
- Hart.</i>

695
01:25:39,107 --> 01:25:40,460
It's me.

696
01:25:41,187 --> 01:25:43,782
I'm glad I managed to get you.

697
01:25:44,187 --> 01:25:45,415
Rose, where are you?

698
01:25:45,787 --> 01:25:47,140
Are you all right?

699
01:25:48,147 --> 01:25:49,422
Did I hurt you?

700
01:25:49,868 --> 01:25:52,746
We should be together.
Please, tell me where you are.

701
01:25:53,788 --> 01:25:57,097
Well, what you said to me hurt me.

702
01:25:57,747 --> 01:25:59,465
It scared me.

703
01:26:00,547 --> 01:26:05,746
It scared me because I suddenly
knew you might be right.

704
01:26:07,067 --> 01:26:10,822
And if you were right, about my being
a carrier, I mean...

705
01:26:11,788 --> 01:26:17,578
I murdered Mindy.
I murdered a lot of people.

706
01:26:18,027 --> 01:26:19,255
Rose!

707
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:22,793
So I decided to try a
little experiment to

708
01:26:22,805 --> 01:26:25,262
prove that you were
wrong about all that.

709
01:26:26,947 --> 01:26:30,384
You see? I'm being very positive,
aren't I?

710
01:26:31,267 --> 01:26:35,340
So I found myself a partner
for my experiment,

711
01:26:38,307 --> 01:26:40,696
a normal, healthy guy,

712
01:26:41,587 --> 01:26:44,660
and I took a little of his blood...
just a bit...

713
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:48,359
and I've locked myself in with him.

714
01:26:51,107 --> 01:26:54,567
I'm going to stay here with him until
I'm sure he's not going to get sick.

715
01:26:56,387 --> 01:27:02,019
And then I'll know that I'm not
the one who started it all.

716
01:27:02,947 --> 01:27:06,383
Rose, look. You gotta get out
of there, right away.

717
01:27:07,228 --> 01:27:09,582
You're commiting suicide,
you know that?

718
01:27:11,067 --> 01:27:15,026
Hart, I just want you to be with me
over the phone...

719
01:27:15,267 --> 01:27:17,019
I mean just a few hours,

720
01:27:17,467 --> 01:27:20,460
just until I find out.

721
01:27:20,787 --> 01:27:25,099
I mean we can live together
over the phone, can't we?

722
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,379
Oh, please. Listen.

723
01:27:30,947 --> 01:27:32,266
Please.

724
01:27:33,987 --> 01:27:35,545
Rose! Get out of there!

725
01:27:37,707 --> 01:27:42,783
<i>Please, Rose, just drop the phone
and walk over to the door</i>

726
01:27:43,187 --> 01:27:45,225
and run outta that place
as fast as you can.

727
01:27:46,507 --> 01:27:48,816
<i>You're not giving us enough time...</i>

728
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:50,895
No, Hart.

729
01:27:51,907 --> 01:27:53,977
Listen...

730
01:27:55,267 --> 01:27:56,495
Hart...

731
01:27:58,627 --> 01:27:59,855
<i>Get out of there!</i>

732
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,635
- I'm afraid.
- Run!

733
01:28:03,347 --> 01:28:04,575
Hart!

734
01:29:41,299 --> 01:29:46,299
