1
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:28,865
- Hi. 
- Hi!

2
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,105
- So sorry, did I keep you waiting? 
- No, no, it's okay.

3
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:38,098
- Where are you coming from? 
- There's a park through there on the other side...

4
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:40,281
- Look at you! 
- I know.

5
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:43,585
- I'm gigantic, and it happened really fast... 
- No, you look great!

6
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:46,576
- Tricia, with child... holy fuck! 
- Yeah, I know.

7
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:49,086
- Great.
- Yeah, me too.

8
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,151
- Well, let's get you inside. 
- Yeah, good idea.

9
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,424
- So your drive was...? 
- It was gorgeous, everyone should do it once.

10
00:03:57,524 --> 00:04:01,907
- And you took the... you went...? 
- The southern route, the real 66

11
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,440
- Texas was just fucking...
- ...fucking forever....

12
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,692
Right yeah. I know. 
I'm so sorry, I was out and...

13
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:11,586
I didn't expect you until tonight, 
maybe this afternoon at the earliest.

14
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:16,700
Yeah, I drove all night, Once I hit 
Tucson it was just.. aIl about here.

15
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,575
Yeah, it's the last of them, I figured just...
you know... use them, and then...

16
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:30,055
- tonight maybe we can do something kinda formal, to... 
- Of course.

17
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:34,274
- It's really good to see you. 
- It's really good to see you.

18
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:41,188
- The bed is amazing. 
- Yes, it's fine.

19
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:45,091
- It's like almost real quality mattress. 
- It's fine, I've slept on worse.

20
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:46,782
We both know.

21
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:52,029
So... I brought some stuff for 
the little nephew, niece, or whatever.

22
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,949
- Oh, Callie. 
- Don't get too excited. It's all from Goodwill.

23
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,706
In New Mexico.

24
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:02,625
Nothing special, but... I wanted to.

25
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,714
You sure you don't mind? 
I don't want to make you feel...

26
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,112
No, I'm fine with my soda juice.

27
00:05:17,782 --> 00:05:20,774
And you're sure it doesn't violate the trems of your ...

28
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:24,744
- We're good. 
- Then by all means, get blasted.

29
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:30,894
I'm really glad that you're here. 
As opposed to... I mean, I know about Vermont...

30
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,678
...and Pennsylvania. And then 
mom said something...

31
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:35,600
...about North Dakota? 
- Yeah...

32
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,938
I lived out in my car, in the Badlands for a hike.

33
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,968
That was something. But mostly Worcester.

34
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:44,912
- Ohio? 
- Ohio for the longest, a few months.

35
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,356
And then Louisiana, which I tell you... complete 
- Oh, yeah I know.

36
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:52,645
- Even after the whole... it's amazing. 
- Yeah.

37
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:57,283
And what was the good clinic, right? Louisiana?

38
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:01,495
Alright, so spill it, pregnant. Come on.

39
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,847
No, easy, sister. 
- Who was he? Some random hottie?

40
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,683
A pool boy? Gardener? 
Did mom totallt freak out, or was she ok?

41
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:12,836
No, mom was thrilled actually happy. 
I haven't told dad yet.

42
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:15,986
Fuck him, anyway. 
I mean, if you can find him.

43
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:19,765
- I'm just damn curious. 
- Alright well, we'll talk about it later.

44
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:24,401
- I'm going to go clean up the kitchen. 
- Ok... you giant whore!

45
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,547
You giant drug addict.

46
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:34,343
So it all basically looks the 
same since I was here last.

47
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:39,461
- God, was that five years ago? 
- It was right before you took off, so ...

48
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,586
Oh, you took you wedding pictures down.

49
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:44,173
I didn't want to change anything at first.

50
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:47,401
Just... you know, in case 
he walked in one day.

51
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:52,163
And then later on, I didnt want 
to change things, in case...

52
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,405
- I don't know. 
- Sure.

53
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:05,605
- Death in absentia... 
- I know, it sounds really...

54
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:08,362
I knew there was going to be 
paperwork, I just didn't realize...

55
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,826
Oh yeah, big time.

56
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,171
The paperwork goes in,

57
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:23,930
And then that with the police statements, 
they'll issue you a death certificate, which...

58
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,534
then I give that to the insurance 
companies, and then a few creditors.

59
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:32,230
And it affects a lot, you know, 
like car insurance, his registration...

60
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,297
- life insurance, his 401K... 
- They didn't think...

61
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:38,322
...that maybe after seven years 
he wasn't going to come back?

62
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:42,479
Once you declare someone 
dead, it's a different deal.

63
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:47,050
You know, missing, dead... it's tough 
to come back from that one.

64
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,150
So that's why they make you 
wait so long, seven years...

65
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,380
Yeah, I get it. There's no need.

66
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,884
So the posters?

67
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:59,896
I printed out so many and it's just 
a habit to go out and change them out.

68
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:04,011
- Rather than watch them rot off the trees and poles... 
- You put up new ones?

69
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:08,799
Just the last of the run. 
The last ones...

70
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,868
Can I ask you...?

71
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:34,369
You know, if it is not...

72
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,441
- Ask. 
- What ...

73
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:43,582
What do you think, you know, 
all said and done?

74
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:51,989
I used to think he left 
because we were fighting.

75
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:57,052
Marriage growing pains. 
Then I thought amnesia.

76
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:04,526
He wanders off, no memory. 
Starts over, lands,,, and he's happy.

77
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,898
And he thinks of me, doesn't know why.

78
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:15,942
I had a million of 'em. He was an NSA agent.

79
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:19,914
Couldn't tell me what he did 
for a living, to keep me safe.

80
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,323
But then his cover got blown, 
so he had to underground.

81
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:25,949
But he still checks in, all the time.

82
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:27,750
Drive.

83
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:33,556
That whole first year, that's all it 
was about, just what happened.

84
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:39,037
Kidnapping, runaway, alien abduction.

85
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,365
Anything.

86
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:56,833
He was so sweet to me. 
He called me "kid" and...

87
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:59,084
He didn't stare.

88
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:04,409
And make fun of me, 
or tease me about dating...

89
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,552
I liked him.

90
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:11,989
He'd be proud you cleaned up so well.

91
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,116
Yeah... I know he would.

92
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:20,898
So I'm going to go with 
whichever version has him...

93
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:26,143
...sitting on the porch, watching the sunset, 
happy and alive and Ok.

94
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,992
And I'm here to help you 
file that paperwork and...

95
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:35,078
- ...pack your stuff up for a new place. 
- Which I'm working on, I will find one.

96
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:39,000
Sure. I'll hold your hands throughout 
the ultrasounds and whatever...

97
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,846
I'm here.

98
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:47,410
And then what? 
Where do you land, Calls?

99
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,042
Danny?

100
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:56,529
Honey?

101
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:04,479
- Fuck me. 
- Please...

102
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:05,980
- Sorry... 
- Please...

103
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,441
- I'm sorry, I don't have anything. 
- Do you see me?

104
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:12,292
- I don't have anything to give you. 
- Wait, wait ...

105
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:19,139
It's sleeping.

106
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,643
- What? 
- I don't know.

107
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:25,655
- I'm sorry, I did not mean to wake you. 
- I'm here...

108
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,320
I... I...

109
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:32,821
- Trade. 
- What?

110
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:36,677
No, I really don't have anything. I'm sorry.

111
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,329
- Walter. 
- Walter?

112
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,536
- I'll bring you something later. 
- Please ...

113
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:43,683
I'll come back and I'll bring 
something for you, ok?

114
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,214
Wait, wait!

115
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:48,814
My son! My boy...

116
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:51,214
Jamie!

117
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,010
Can you tell him?

118
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:11,498
Sorry, I just... never mind. Hi.

119
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:15,814
Hi. Callie, my sister, this is Detective Mallory.

120
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:19,030
He's... was on Daniel's case.

121
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:23,219
Hi. Not the guy I first met when you...

122
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,549
The old guy with the suede...

123
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:27,871
No. I got assigned a couple of years ago.

124
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:29,830
They moved those guys onto newer...

125
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,761
Anyway, I'm glad to meet you, miss. 
I've heard a lot about you.

126
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:34,630
Really, why?

127
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,418
- I'm just heading to... 
- There was a robbery...

128
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:39,986
Up the street, a waste of paperwork actually...

129
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:43,066
There was just a bracelet, almost worthless.
They left the expensive stuff.

130
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,729
We have some petty burglaries, 
just keep the door locked.

131
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:49,156
It happens way too much in this neighborhood. 
I've been after your sister

132
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:51,540
...to move for years, even 
just a couple of exits

133
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,238
Just bring that to the attorney...

134
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,562
...and it says everything they 
need to move forward.

135
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:59,802
- I have it. 
- I'm going to shower, I smell like an armpits asshole.

136
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:01,614
Nice to meet.

137
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:05,036
- Yeah, you weren't kidding. 
- Yeah, right?

138
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:12,748
You'll call me when you're 
finished with the lawyer?

139
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:14,505
I'll call.

140
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:23,129
- Do you need anything for the... 
- I'm fine. We're fine.

141
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:28,931
Alright. Because I can get whatever, 
for anyone that's bothering you.

142
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,827
- I got my taser. 
- Taser, huh? Big man.

143
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:36,263
I know what you did.

144
00:18:57,488 --> 00:18:59,253
Oh, shit!

145
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,660
Is there any food for another plate? 
Or do you have a paper plate?

146
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,401
- Are you still hungry? 
- No, there's this guy in the...

147
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:10,422
Never mind. It is a Christian thing.

148
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:13,547
Yeah. I was going to ask you 
about this new Christian thing.

149
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,492
Can I borrow your Tupperware, please?

150
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:18,633
Yeah.

151
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,487
Trish, you want help?

152
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:46,642
I just... maybe not 
tonight, you know?

153
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:52,044
Tomorrow, it can wait. Technically, it usually 
waits until you've actually signed a lease on...

154
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:55,237
I'm on it, ok? I'm working on it.

155
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:03,882
Lord, please help me get my shit together. 
In Jesus' name, amen.

156
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:53,572
Callie?

157
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,261
It's normal.

158
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:37,068
Well, fuck normal then, I guess.

159
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:41,724
These, let's call them lucid
 dreams, that you're having.

160
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:45,357
They started about the time you decided 
to declare him dead in absentia?

161
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:48,347
I know that we said we knew that 
would do something with me, but...

162
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:52,782
Because it's big. And we 
knew to expect something.

163
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:54,601
Not this.

164
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:57,115
Not this.

165
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:19,676
You describing lucid dreams. They're...

166
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:25,953
visual, auditory, even olfactory, tactile halucinations.

167
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:31,772
And not unusual for someone negotiating 
the kind of stress you're living with.

168
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:35,737
Ok. This is good, keep going.

169
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:40,860
How does seeing him, hearing 
him this way make you feel?

170
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:51,076
The first time it was like he was devastated.

171
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:54,609
- Furious. 
- Because you...

172
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:57,878
Because I'm declaring him dead.

173
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:04,989
- And then? 
- Then it was like he was just enraged.

174
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:09,889
- At me and... 
- At the baby.

175
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:11,857
At the baby.

176
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:19,164
The mind cannot immediately 
deal with... trauma.

177
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:22,167
With grief, guilt.

178
00:24:23,122 --> 00:24:26,911
It's sometimes easier to create 
something to help us to process it.

179
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:32,084
But it is you, Tricia, not him...

180
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:35,010
And you're telling yourself how you feel.

181
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:39,300
Ok well, when will that stop?

182
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:44,248
You're the only one who can answer that.

183
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:49,001
- You're still meditating? It's still helping with... 
- Yeah.

184
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:52,057
- Yeah, absolutely. 
- Good.

185
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,401
Don't.

186
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,316
I'm sorry?

187
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:50,063
Don't leave those there.

188
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:54,322
They're not mine, I'm returning them.

189
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:18,223
Just don't.

190
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:36,503
This looks good.

191
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:42,457
- Do you need anything else from the police? 
- No. This is good.

192
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:47,888
He's been missing from his home or usual 
residence for a period of seven years.

193
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:51,555
Such absence has been continuous 
and without explanation, and we took

194
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:55,187
the adequate safeguards concerning 
property. I think you did it great.

195
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:03,073
- So what happens now? 
- We file. And I think they'll issue the death certificate.

196
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:05,745
I need you to sign 
the last line of the petition.

197
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:27,737
Yes.

198
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:33,336
That's it.

199
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,260
Hey.

200
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,160
Hey.

201
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:52,234
- I'm getting kinda tired. 
- You sleep, I'm minutes away.

202
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:53,534
Ok.

203
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:55,349
- Good night. 
- Good night.

204
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,871
Oh Shit!

205
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:07,673
Gross.

206
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:11,256
God bless you too, nephew 
or niece, whoever you are.

207
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,878
- Is that's all of them? 
- Looks like it.

208
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:36,168
- With some of these we can't be sure... 
- Copy that.

209
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:40,263
- Some of them? 
- Some of them match descriptions of the items.

210
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:42,678
Yeah? 
- Like I said, can't be sure.

211
00:31:43,563 --> 00:31:46,412
Sure. Can I borrow that from you? 
Thank you.

212
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:53,425
- The door was locked. 
- I think so.

213
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:57,986
We've discussed this. Always in this 
neighborhood, you lock the door.

214
00:31:58,086 --> 00:32:00,462
No, I told her. 
I'm sure it was locked.

215
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:02,957
There's no sign of forced entry, so...

216
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:08,698
- There was, earlier, another incident. 
- I'm sorry, what incident?

217
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:11,593
- A man in the tunnel, you said? 
- Yes, I'm trying to remember...

218
00:32:11,693 --> 00:32:14,839
I can't remember he said his name was. 
He was talking....

219
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,124
- ...nonsense, anyway. 
- The crazy, nonsense-talking tunnel guy...

220
00:32:18,224 --> 00:32:22,741
...that you fed was in my apartment? 
That's great, Callie, really wonderful.

221
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:26,920
I told you. For two years I told you. 
Anywhere but here.

222
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,152
- They got a nickname for this neighborhood in the precinct. 
- I know. calm down.

223
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:34,009
- No. Now we talk seriously. 
- I'm packing, ok? I've been packing.

224
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:36,762
To go where?

225
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:42,818
You've been packing for six months. 
Leave, walk out of here.

226
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:45,768
- You can just stay with me. 
- Detective!

227
00:33:28,864 --> 00:33:32,198
- Hi, sir. 
- Hi, I just wanted to check in. You doing ok over there?

228
00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:36,283
I'm fine. The door's locked.
 No worries, just packing.

229
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:43,867
- What time are you coming home again? 
- Around seven. You ok until then?

230
00:33:44,663 --> 00:33:47,537
- Yeah, I'm good. 
- Alright, bye.

231
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:24,333
Hello?

232
00:34:33,183 --> 00:34:34,483
Hey.

233
00:34:37,197 --> 00:34:38,857
What's that?

234
00:34:52,561 --> 00:34:54,552
I think I'll go to bed, if that's ok.

235
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:02,531
Ok.

236
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,932
Good night.

237
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,831
Get up!

238
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:44,766
Hi, it's me.

239
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:47,855
I found a place.

240
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:53,519
No, Callie made me.

241
00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:02,590
So since the cat's kinda 
out of the bag with her...

242
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:10,090
I was wondering if you might like to go out?

243
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,564
Like for real.

244
00:37:19,577 --> 00:37:22,372
Ok, great.

245
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:26,626
Ok, bye.

246
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:35,075
Well ok. Alright, then.

247
00:37:35,175 --> 00:37:38,345
- Don't get all excited. 
- No! I think it's great, I just...

248
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:41,246
- It's time, right? 
- Yeah.

249
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:51,864
- What about this?
 - Maybe a trimester and twenty pounds ago.

250
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:54,968
Right. Maternity clothes only.

251
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,482
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

252
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:08,405
You did this for me on my first date.

253
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,704
Oh my god, that kid with the giant ears.

254
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:13,755
- Kevin. 
- Kevin, yeah.

255
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:17,381
Oh god, mom was horrified 
you put makeup on me.

256
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:19,711
- The beginning of the end? 
- Right?

257
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,009
- Hot? 
- Yeah.

258
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:35,996
- What do think I should do with my hair? 
- Back.

259
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:38,447
Move it a little just here.

260
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:40,165
Ok.

261
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:45,574
- Hi. 
- Hi.

262
00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:48,074
- Detective. 
- Miss.

263
00:38:49,947 --> 00:38:53,861
Callie, you look terrific.

264
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:56,663
I can feel the face 
you're making, you little rat.

265
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:59,245
So, I'm going to run upstairs, I'll be 
right back down and then we can go.

266
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:07,751
So, how long have you been 
trying to get her to go out with you?

267
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:13,028
Let's just call it a while.

268
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:19,627
- Ready. 
- Great.

269
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:23,568
- Lock that. 
- I got it!

270
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:27,687
Do you need anything? 
Do you need money for dinner?

271
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:29,971
Please, go and have fun, ok?

272
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:31,371
Please.

273
00:39:31,712 --> 00:39:33,278
Ok, see you later.

274
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:35,879
- Callie. 
- Detective.

275
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:45,386
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah.

276
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:54,516
No.

277
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:02,642
Hey.

278
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,728
Hey!

279
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,429
Hey!

280
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,502
Tricia, make a call. 
Call an ambulance!

281
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:20,348
Tricia, Look at me. 
Are you ok?

282
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:26,112
It's ok. I got you.

283
00:40:26,178 --> 00:40:28,839
Oh, God!

284
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,939
Hi, Ruth. It's Tricia.

285
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,348
I don't know how to say this...

286
00:40:52,402 --> 00:40:56,940
except to say first that I'm not 
doing this to be cruel or dishonest.

287
00:40:58,476 --> 00:41:03,112
Tonight... it was 19.30... 
- Squeeze my hand, Daniel.

288
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:05,428
Daniel came home.

289
00:41:05,908 --> 00:41:11,020
Ok, that's good. Let go of my hand, Daniel.

290
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:13,037
You can see me?

291
00:41:15,926 --> 00:41:18,121
Yeah, I can see you.

292
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,860
David admitted him to Sacred Heart Hospital.

293
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,417
Severly malnourished.

294
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:29,367
They're treating him for 
dehydration and malnutrition.

295
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:31,301
- I'm not sure exactly what caused that.

296
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:34,992
- But he hasn't said anything. 
- It looks like it might be from a chronic lack of sunlight exposure.

297
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,734
I'm sorry, but that's all I know right now.

298
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,419
We're looking at his abdominal X-rays. 
There's an ill-defined mass in his stomach.

299
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:42,526
I'm sorry, that's all I know.

300
00:41:44,314 --> 00:41:47,009
Tomorrow, hopefully, or the next day.

301
00:41:49,948 --> 00:41:51,312
No, I'm here.

302
00:41:53,531 --> 00:41:57,090
No, call when you know 
your flight info. Bye.

303
00:42:05,514 --> 00:42:07,170
She was laughing.

304
00:42:08,267 --> 00:42:12,726
Did you tell her about what the 
doctor said, about the trauma...?

305
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:19,738
She's still wrapping her head around her son 
being alive, She doesn't need to wonder about...

306
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:25,107
...what kind of results 
his body's undergone.

307
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:31,044
I know this is hard right now.

308
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:32,944
But...

309
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:37,183
We've got to figure
 out where you've been.

310
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:48,237
Daniel, the doctor said that you 
show signs of significant physical...

311
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,475
...abuse.

312
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:56,010
We're trying to figure 
out who did that to you.

313
00:42:56,605 --> 00:42:59,638
We've been looking for you for 
more than seven years, Daniel.

314
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:11,205
- I was underneath. 
- Underneath where, Daniel?

315
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:14,268
Stay with me.
Underneath where?

316
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,643
Oh, Tricia.

317
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:57,380
It's ok.

318
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,870
I'll get you some fresh clothes.

319
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,893
Hey...

320
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:13,588
You want to lay down 
or you want a glass of water?

321
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:16,171
Sleep.

322
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:47,553
His parents will be here tomorrow.

323
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:51,307
This isn't real.

324
00:45:07,473 --> 00:45:09,964
- Hi. 
- Hi.

325
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:16,302
I'm sorry to stop by.
We tried to call.

326
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:18,812
- I had unplugged the phone. 
- It was crazy.

327
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:23,600
We talked to the doctor. 
We'd like to talk to Daniel again.

328
00:45:25,332 --> 00:45:29,548
- He's asleep. 
- We can wait a while.

329
00:45:29,648 --> 00:45:32,113
You talked to him ay the hospital. 
He didn't say anything.

330
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:35,996
We were hoping if we talked to him again, 
some place he was more comfortable, then...

331
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:43,427
Daniel!

332
00:45:48,393 --> 00:45:49,846
He's in here.

333
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:07,111
How are you feeling, Daniel?

334
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:15,048
Your doctor called. They figured out what 
those light bits sere in your X-rays.

335
00:46:17,635 --> 00:46:23,403
You had animal bones in your stomach, Daniel. 
You want to explain that one to me?

336
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:28,243
The hospital also released the clothes you 
were wearing when you were admitted.

337
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:31,520
They were the same clothes you 
were wearing when you disappeared.

338
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,348
So does that mean that in all this time 
you haven't been to a hospital,

339
00:46:37,499 --> 00:46:40,826
- ...a shelter?
 - I don't know.

340
00:46:40,947 --> 00:46:42,646
You see, Daniel...

341
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:48,256
You do, because someone fed you.

342
00:46:49,315 --> 00:46:52,690
- As recently as yesterday morning. 
- Daniel, please.

343
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:57,170
And you still had your wallet.

344
00:46:58,842 --> 00:47:02,905
Seven years on the street, 
no one took your wallet?

345
00:47:07,511 --> 00:47:10,408
There's a lot of people 
trying very hard to find you.

346
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:15,411
And if you're telling me you don't know where 
you had breakfast yesterday, you're a liar.

347
00:47:15,747 --> 00:47:18,354
- Liar! 
- That's enough.

348
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,395
For now.

349
00:47:31,536 --> 00:47:33,440
I'm sorry about all this, ma'am.

350
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,339
We're just relieved that 
your husband is alive.

351
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,738
We'll figure everything out in time.

352
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:44,358
- But in the meantime, if you need anything, please don't... 
- I got it.

353
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:54,161
I'll stop by after ten. Can you talk?

354
00:47:55,403 --> 00:47:58,500
- I don't know. 
- Just to talk. Will you?

355
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:02,969
- Yeah. 
- After ten.

356
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,223
Hi.

357
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:31,926
Last time you saw me, I was 
barely driving, remember?

358
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,249
You disappeared too.

359
00:48:40,008 --> 00:48:42,711
Yeah, that's right. I did.

360
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:50,414
I was chasing a guy and a few dragons.

361
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:56,378
I saw plenty I never 
want to think about again.

362
00:48:58,085 --> 00:48:59,812
How did you get out?

363
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,093
I don't know.

364
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:09,116
Can we have a minute?

365
00:49:09,726 --> 00:49:11,722
Of course.

366
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:17,937
If you ever want to talk...

367
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:42,650
Well?

368
00:50:12,334 --> 00:50:13,633
No.

369
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:17,933
No.

370
00:50:18,033 --> 00:50:21,912
Where the fuck were you?

371
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:56,503
I'm here.

372
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:30,743
I'm not asking you to 
make any decisions today.

373
00:51:30,843 --> 00:51:33,526
And I will not add any 
more pressure to your life.

374
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:38,144
- It's impossible, this whole situation. 
- I just need to say that I'm devoted.

375
00:51:38,244 --> 00:51:40,540
I will never quit, 
I will never leave.

376
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,305
I will provide, and I will 
protect you and the baby.

377
00:51:43,405 --> 00:51:45,981
I will do everything I can 
to get help for Daniel.

378
00:51:46,081 --> 00:51:50,509
I am still the same guy. 
But he is not.

379
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:52,478
He is not the same as when left.

380
00:51:52,578 --> 00:51:55,721
- And remember, things weren't that great then, from what you said. 
- Don't...

381
00:51:55,821 --> 00:52:00,772
I'm sorry, I just need to say
 that that death certificate ...

382
00:52:00,872 --> 00:52:03,308
...is accurate.

383
00:52:03,408 --> 00:52:05,396
Even if he is upstairs.

384
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:15,098
Jesus!

385
00:52:16,613 --> 00:52:17,897
Are you ok?

386
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:23,640
It's not what it looks like though.

387
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,505
It's more like an insect.

388
00:52:30,865 --> 00:52:32,951
A skin like silver fish.

389
00:52:35,787 --> 00:52:37,046
Tricia!

390
00:52:39,554 --> 00:52:41,367
You traded with it.

391
00:52:42,255 --> 00:52:44,617
I wish you hadn't traded with it.

392
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:46,119
It fixates.

393
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,487
Daniel, I think you should go back into your room...

394
00:52:50,588 --> 00:52:52,187
...and wait for Tricia.

395
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:56,114
Oh no. I can't go back in there.

396
00:52:57,728 --> 00:52:59,946
It's in one of the walls in there.

397
00:53:13,182 --> 00:53:15,275
Maybe it'll go away.

398
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,504
No more!

399
00:53:36,176 --> 00:53:37,375
No more!

400
00:53:37,439 --> 00:53:39,167
Be quiet, Daniel.

401
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:48,787
It stops... us.

402
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:58,218
I'll make sure that you're as involved 
as you ever want to be with the baby.

403
00:54:59,232 --> 00:55:03,021
- Tricia... 
- You always said you'd bring him back to me.

404
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:08,768
And you did. 
I love you for it.

405
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,883
I understand.

406
00:55:13,966 --> 00:55:16,084
I used to clam up.

407
00:55:17,886 --> 00:55:21,971
I used to just disappear for a 
weekend, or a week at a time.

408
00:55:23,357 --> 00:55:27,118
And sleep under the stars and...

409
00:55:27,218 --> 00:55:32,118
no one would know or 
care if I was coming back.

410
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:33,664
I understand...

411
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:40,249
I understand wanting 
to just walk away...

412
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:43,694
...and just leave the mess and say 
"fuck it". It would be so just...

413
00:55:45,896 --> 00:55:47,895
Wouldn't it just...?

414
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:09,165
Ryan?

415
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:13,386
- Did you...? 
- No!

416
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:18,993
Tricia!

417
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:25,889
Tricia! He's gone!

418
00:56:26,866 --> 00:56:30,062
He's gone! He's gone!

419
00:56:31,563 --> 00:56:33,462
It's gone!

420
00:56:51,419 --> 00:56:55,882
No one goes back in there. They'll 
be here in five. What happened?

421
00:57:11,758 --> 00:57:13,831
Daniel, Daniel!

422
00:57:32,527 --> 00:57:33,927
Daniel!

423
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:07,720
Callie?

424
00:58:40,314 --> 00:58:41,714
Daniel!

425
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:55,543
I know how that sounds but I swear 
to you, I could hear him in the walls.

426
00:58:55,644 --> 00:58:57,149
Daniel!

427
00:58:57,249 --> 00:59:01,912
- He'd been dragged. 
- It's ok, alright?

428
00:59:02,013 --> 00:59:03,314
Daniel!

429
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,519
Do me a favor, ok?

430
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,020
Look me in the eyes real quick.

431
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:11,911
No big deal.

432
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,201
Booze tonight? Anything I 
should know about?

433
00:59:24,004 --> 00:59:26,129
I had some wine earlier.

434
00:59:31,877 --> 00:59:33,177
Ok.

435
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:39,213
- I'm going to need to talk to you again, ok? 
- Yeah.

436
00:59:43,585 --> 00:59:45,277
Fucking asshole.

437
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,245
I got it.

438
00:59:57,796 --> 01:00:00,195
- You see her eyes? 
- Yeah, her pupils, I know.

439
01:00:00,295 --> 01:00:02,937
- But still, doesn't mean she was loaded. 
- No, I want the unies searching the park...

440
01:00:03,037 --> 01:00:06,685
...the highways, I don't care where you... 
- Yeah, they cast a big net, ok?

441
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:12,840
- I do not love that you were here tonight with this. 
- I know.

442
01:00:15,923 --> 01:00:17,579
I'm going to need a statement.

443
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:20,212
And it's going to change 
some things for this...

444
01:00:20,312 --> 01:00:21,745
I know.

445
01:00:21,845 --> 01:00:25,507
So, you want me to take her...

446
01:00:25,608 --> 01:00:26,908
...report?

447
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:33,267
No. That much I can do.

448
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,667
If anyone's going to ask her 
to do this again it should be me.

449
01:00:39,395 --> 01:00:41,591
I need to...

450
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:49,966
I don't even know how to tell 
you... how sorry I am to...

451
01:00:55,408 --> 01:00:59,344
Oh, Jesus. You mean...?

452
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:02,839
I need you to file a 
missing persons report.

453
01:01:16,825 --> 01:01:19,957
- Tricia, my god, I'm so sorry. 
- Shut your mouth!

454
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:26,164
Hey!

455
01:01:26,165 --> 01:01:29,157
I saw your eyes, you were orbiting 
the apartment! Where is it?

456
01:01:29,257 --> 01:01:31,736
Who the fuck do you think...?
No. Look, I saw it!

457
01:01:31,836 --> 01:01:35,202
- You hallucinated it! 
- I saw it. Jesus!

458
01:01:35,302 --> 01:01:38,381
Can't we have enough tragedy for one 
evening without Callie's gutted acid trip!

459
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:41,880
It happened! I wouldn't 
have believed it either. No!

460
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,979
Fine!

461
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,128
What happened if it wasn't what I said?

462
01:01:47,228 --> 01:01:49,361
While you were wherever,
doing whatever.

463
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:51,511
What happened then, Tricia?

464
01:02:10,942 --> 01:02:14,380
I do not know! But I heard that 
fucking giant bug story before...

465
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,907
last time you were under 
your skin, remember?

466
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:27,009
Fine, but it happened! 
- Nothing ever fucking changes!

467
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:28,975
Dad leaves, mom's a mess...

468
01:02:29,075 --> 01:02:31,333
...and brand new Callie decides
 to retreat into a needle!

469
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:36,044
And at least I didn't decide to retreat into a marriage 
with that high school boyfriend I didn't really...

470
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:38,181
Hi, Ruth, it's Tricia. You're probably 
on the plane right now, but...

471
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:41,305
listen...

472
01:04:15,235 --> 01:04:16,534
Hey...

473
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:20,993
Hey...

474
01:04:21,093 --> 01:04:25,732
I'm sorry about... 
- No, it was senseless. All of it.

475
01:04:29,127 --> 01:04:32,126
I think I can make 
some sense out of it.

476
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:36,945
Ok. Walter Lambert lived 
three doors down from us...

477
01:04:37,045 --> 01:04:39,644
...went missing in 1995, walking to work.

478
01:04:39,745 --> 01:04:42,544
Guess which way. Left behind a son, 
who still lives here apparently.

479
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,376
It says his dad was 
taken away by a monster.

480
01:04:45,477 --> 01:04:47,877
They declared Walter dead in 2002.

481
01:04:47,978 --> 01:04:50,778
I ran into him just last week. 
Guess where?

482
01:04:50,824 --> 01:04:54,986
Which would just be, you know, except 
he's not the only one, not even close.

483
01:04:55,093 --> 01:04:58,436
Five others from this neighborhood 
just in the last 100 years.

484
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:01,061
- The tunnel wasn't there 100 years ago. 
- Right.

485
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:03,650
The freeway was built in the 
early fifties, but before then...

486
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,798
and I'm not kidding, 
it was a natural sinkhole,

487
01:05:05,899 --> 01:05:07,799
They built a footbridge over it, 
and you know what?

488
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:09,298
People went missing.

489
01:05:09,471 --> 01:05:13,569
In 1928, Charles Ashford goes to 
fetch water from his family well.

490
01:05:13,669 --> 01:05:17,257
Crosses the footbridge, his family 
goes looking for him. No sign.

491
01:05:17,357 --> 01:05:20,552
His footprints in the dirt 
lead halfway up to the well.

492
01:05:20,652 --> 01:05:24,647
Not enough? Three students made 
the covers of The LA Times,

493
01:05:24,747 --> 01:05:27,819
...after going missing in what they 
called a series of underground caves,

494
01:05:27,919 --> 01:05:32,436
near the Verdugo hills, but emerge 
through a long tunnel in the valley.

495
01:05:32,536 --> 01:05:34,367
They couldn't find the 
tunnel, the students...

496
01:05:34,467 --> 01:05:38,686
Listen! This is important. 
They said it was under the city.

497
01:05:38,786 --> 01:05:42,824
- Not underground, but like an underworld. 
- Jesus, Callie.

498
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:47,341
No, look. 1968, David Stone...

499
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:49,736
...goes to a party, three
 blocks from here...

500
01:05:49,837 --> 01:05:52,430
starts acting strangely, wanders
 into his neighbor's yard...

501
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:56,608
...doesn't know where he's going, what he's doing. 
All he can say is that it's after him.

502
01:05:56,708 --> 01:06:00,974
Callie, when the mind can't 
process a horrifying situation ...

503
01:06:01,074 --> 01:06:04,967
Did you know that there are 109,000 active 
missing persons cases in this country?

504
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:08,684
- Guess how many disappeared in tunnels. 
- The mind creates patterns...

505
01:06:08,784 --> 01:06:10,847
I was seeing things too, Ok?

506
01:06:10,947 --> 01:06:13,179
Awful things, they felt so real.

507
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:17,118
- There are myths, legends, folklore. 
- It's easier to imagine the most horrifying fantasy...

508
01:06:17,157 --> 01:06:20,216
...than to accept the truth. 
- Tricia, every culture in the history of our species...

509
01:06:20,259 --> 01:06:24,422
...has had mythology about 
creatures that spirit people away.

510
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:28,066
That take them into some unreal 
underworld, enslave them, brutalize them...

511
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:31,760
It is easier to embrace a 
nightmare than to accept...

512
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,965
how stupid, how simple 
reality is sometimes.

513
01:06:35,065 --> 01:06:39,670
The Scandinavian troll legends, the Egyptian insect demons, the banshee, the Wendigo.

514
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:42,835
There's a common thread
 to all this! There just ...

515
01:06:43,078 --> 01:06:45,420
...finding ... Ok...

516
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:50,421
Dark matter, tangential dimensions...

517
01:06:50,521 --> 01:06:52,371
If everything is made of atoms,

518
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:56,420
and atoms are mostly empty 
space, how is anything really solid?

519
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:02,419
Things go missing in this neighborhood, 
and have for as long as history has recorded it.

520
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,784
And those things turn up in one place.

521
01:07:08,388 --> 01:07:10,145
I love you, Callie.

522
01:07:21,893 --> 01:07:23,092
Tricia.

523
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:27,635
I still can't... 
Where is he?

524
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,239
- Hi Ruth... Mitch... 
- Daniel!

525
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:39,451
I have to tell you guys. Come in and sit down ...

526
01:07:39,652 --> 01:07:40,951
You just sit down...

527
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:18,132
- What's happening? 
- I need to speak to your younger sister for a minute.

528
01:09:18,232 --> 01:09:20,930
- What's happening? 
- They found a body in the tunnel...

529
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:23,264
and I need her to identify... 
No, ma'am, come back, please!

530
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:24,565
Don't go there!

531
01:09:55,053 --> 01:09:56,976
What happened? Oh, God!

532
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,910
Oh, God!

533
01:10:02,856 --> 01:10:05,326
That's him. That's Walter Lambert.

534
01:10:14,941 --> 01:10:17,775
- Hold him back! 
- I'm sorry!

535
01:10:17,951 --> 01:10:19,750
But you have to stand still! Hold it!

536
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,800
Hold him back.

537
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:27,812
Holy shit!

538
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:30,195
Hey.

539
01:10:57,028 --> 01:10:58,798
I don't want to keep 
you here another minute.

540
01:11:04,755 --> 01:11:08,343
- And your father... 
- I told you he wasn't dead.

541
01:11:11,419 --> 01:11:16,720
I'm sorry. There have been a lot of animals 
disappearing in your neighborhood,

542
01:11:16,823 --> 01:11:20,372
and I need to know why I 
found you with a dog in a bag?

543
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:25,588
- I just wanna go home. 
- I need to know that I can go to your neighbors...

544
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:30,078
and I can ask about all of these break-ins, and I can 
ask them about all of these animals disappearing....

545
01:11:30,178 --> 01:11:33,935
...and they're going to tell me 
Jamie Lambert is a good guy.

546
01:11:34,036 --> 01:11:36,401
I just want to go to sleep.

547
01:11:38,201 --> 01:11:40,950
And I need you to give me anything.

548
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:45,558
Anything at all that's going to 
send you home, or get you help,

549
01:11:47,055 --> 01:11:49,106
If you need it.

550
01:11:54,705 --> 01:12:00,361
I came to you for help, 
and you couldn't help me.

551
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:07,354
If you want to help, can you help me just...

552
01:12:08,594 --> 01:12:14,254
...get out of here so I can get on 
with burying my father, please.

553
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:20,261
Yeah, I can help you do that.

554
01:12:21,426 --> 01:12:23,128
Ok, we're done.

555
01:12:34,627 --> 01:12:35,826
Hey.

556
01:12:36,327 --> 01:12:37,627
Hey, sir.

557
01:12:39,007 --> 01:12:44,647
- How's the Buddha shit? 
- It's good. Come and sit with me.

558
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:56,197
- So you just sit here and think? 
- Kind of.

559
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:00,241
You try...

560
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:03,439
Really you try to...

561
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:06,315
...free yourself of attachments...

562
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:08,284
...the sources of suffering.

563
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:16,040
Then you try to find, I don't know, nirvana.

564
01:13:17,283 --> 01:13:19,251
What is nothing, right?

565
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:24,730
Don't underestimate the ​​attraction of oblivion.

566
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:27,356
Not until you've lived a little longer.

567
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:38,621
Even when I close my eyes, all I can 
see is that body tangled up like that.

568
01:13:38,721 --> 01:13:43,166
Yeah, I know, I thought so too. 
But now, it could have been him.

569
01:13:45,105 --> 01:13:47,800
It could have been Daniel like that.

570
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,808
All twisted up like that.

571
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:55,172
Poor Daniel.

572
01:13:57,131 --> 01:13:59,395
You know the Church says that...

573
01:13:59,494 --> 01:14:05,037
- ...there are some people called "victim souls"? 
- Do they?

574
01:14:06,624 --> 01:14:11,338
Some people that God lets...

575
01:14:11,438 --> 01:14:15,673
He lets the devil and 
the demons do their thing.

576
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:20,117
They're destined for torment...

577
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:23,064
...with some great 
reward in heaven.

578
01:14:27,932 --> 01:14:32,250
I didn't mean to call you prodigal...

579
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:34,254
...or hit you.

580
01:14:36,519 --> 01:14:40,132
I know. I am though.

581
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:48,746
I think you had the 
right ideas sometimes.

582
01:14:49,988 --> 01:14:53,856
You just pull yourself towards 
some unknown horizon...

583
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:56,592
...and just try 
to get untangled.

584
01:15:00,894 --> 01:15:04,693
I never thought less of you for whatever 
types of escape you were able to find.

585
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:17,431
I think I'm just so fucking done.

586
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:19,052
With this one.

587
01:15:22,146 --> 01:15:25,581
It's just so night and fucking day,
 from what I set out for.

588
01:15:36,224 --> 01:15:40,520
How was I to supposed to 
know  it would end up like this?

589
01:15:46,633 --> 01:15:49,396
How the hell are 
we suposed to know?

590
01:16:28,794 --> 01:16:30,499
Tricia.

591
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:08,254
Yeah, I know.

592
01:17:15,368 --> 01:17:18,063
- Fucking drink? 
- Can't.

593
01:17:26,027 --> 01:17:28,027
Ryan.

594
01:17:45,991 --> 01:17:47,692
Ok?

595
01:17:48,592 --> 01:17:50,292
One more time, miss.

596
01:18:30,326 --> 01:18:31,623
Ok...

597
01:18:38,031 --> 01:18:43,627
I need to understand something. 
The unies found up in your room a locker...

598
01:18:43,836 --> 01:18:47,931
You think I hadn't heard about you.
 The company you keep.

599
01:18:50,275 --> 01:18:53,675
What, did the deal go bad?
 No, did the deal go bad?

600
01:18:55,492 --> 01:18:57,042
I can do what I want.

601
01:19:01,418 --> 01:19:04,311
So... we're going to need 
to test your blood.

602
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:08,764
And question you a lot... more.

603
01:19:10,565 --> 01:19:13,864
Right now, you're only 
a person of interest.

604
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:18,987
- You have any plans on leaving town soon? 
- No.

605
01:19:19,697 --> 01:19:23,996
- Never stopped her before. 
- Ok. Now we're going to continue, but...

606
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,769
...before we get to
 the meat of it all...

607
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:32,205
...I need you to file a 
missing persons report.

608
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,489
Stay close, miss.

609
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,272
Trade!

610
01:23:39,871 --> 01:23:41,271
Trade!

611
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,469
Trade!

612
01:24:31,195 --> 01:24:32,661
Trade!

613
01:26:37,261 --> 01:26:38,560
Ryan.

614
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:43,330
Ryan.

615
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,734
You know, just because...

616
01:26:47,278 --> 01:26:49,803
- I know you don't need me to tell you this, but ... 
- I know.

617
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:51,778
We'll keep the case open.

618
01:26:53,085 --> 01:26:56,641
- Indefinitely. Whatever it takes. 
- I know.

619
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:01,616
Hey, you said it yourself. 
It's not about speculating.

620
01:27:03,097 --> 01:27:06,652
It's about what we know
 and... we don't know.

621
01:27:10,845 --> 01:27:14,432
We know that they lived 
down the street from a man...

622
01:27:14,532 --> 01:27:17,680
who exhibited the textbook
 signs of a serial killer.

623
01:27:18,202 --> 01:27:20,999
And it's only a matter of time...

624
01:27:21,099 --> 01:27:23,263
from animals to...

625
01:27:29,141 --> 01:27:33,475
When all the bills are piled up, we know the 
pressure was immense. We know...

626
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:38,295
...she could just walk 
away, just leave the mess

627
01:27:38,395 --> 01:27:41,007
...and just say "fuck it". 
It would be so just...

628
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,277
Wouldn't it just...?
- She could live on the land. 

629
01:27:46,377 --> 01:27:49,484
- I used to camp.
- She used to camp. She could just vanish...

630
01:27:49,584 --> 01:27:52,784
...be on her own,	and 
camp and be just fine.

631
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:02,085
Whereas her sister?

632
01:28:04,507 --> 01:28:06,817
History of drugs, the 
drugs in the apartment...

633
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:12,861
She's a runaway. With almost no 
bagage, she dropped back.

634
01:28:12,961 --> 01:28:15,040
Maybe they took off together.

635
01:28:24,854 --> 01:28:26,690
No.

636
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:28,990
No.

637
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:32,326
Just because I can't think of a 
scenario that leads from the open... 

638
01:28:32,426 --> 01:28:35,295
door of that appartment to Tricia Riley living 
off the radar, baby in arms, happy and free...

639
01:28:35,395 --> 01:28:39,157
- I know. 
- ...living with no money, no credit cards and no vehicle.

640
01:28:39,799 --> 01:28:42,463
It doesn't mean that 
scenario doesn't exist.

641
01:28:42,563 --> 01:28:44,535
Of course it does.

642
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:50,599
Stranger things have happened. 
People get lost, people get found.

643
01:28:53,343 --> 01:28:55,545
No one will think the worst of her.

644
01:28:56,578 --> 01:28:58,282
Not of her.

645
01:29:01,661 --> 01:29:03,073
Not of them.
