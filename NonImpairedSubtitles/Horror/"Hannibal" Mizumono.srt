1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,768
<i>Previously on Hannibal.</i>

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,104
We're just alike.
This gives you the capacity

3
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:08,440
to deceive me
and be deceived by me.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,380
Have you been firing a gun?
I told you I was feeling

5
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:17,049
paranoid.
All I want to do is catch him.

6
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,051
- He's given me nothing.
- I know what to expect

7
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,253
from lung cancer.
And there will be a time

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:25,391
when there is nothing
you can do.

9
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:27,526
No.
What are you up to?

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,162
I want you to come with me.

11
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,599
Alana Bloom isn't harbouring any doubts. She's
convinced that he murdered Freddie Lounds.

12
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,568
- How was my funeral?
- We're gonna get caught.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,771
Jack already suspects
you killed Freddie Lounds.

14
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:42,207
- That means he suspects you.
- I know. - You should give him

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,077
what he wants. Give him
the Chesapeake ripper.

16
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,587
Dr. Hannibal Lecter requests
the pleasure

17
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,723
of my company for dinner.

18
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,729
You sit in that chair, Will,

19
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,399
as you have
so many times before.

20
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:46,271
It holds among its molecules
the vibrations

21
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:51,443
of all our conversations
ever held in its presence.

22
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,546
All the exchanges,

23
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:58,617
the petty irritations,

24
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,887
deadly revelations,

25
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:06,758
flat announcements of disaster.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,294
The grunts and poetry of life.

27
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,198
Everything we've ever said.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,267
Listen.

29
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,439
What do you hear?

30
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:25,244
(whispering voices)

31
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:28,213
A melody.

32
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,749
We're orchestrations of carbon.

33
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,420
You and me.

34
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,828
And Jack.

35
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,332
And Jack.

36
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,735
All our destinies
flying and swimming

37
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:53,338
in blood and emptiness.

38
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:02,414
Everybody's settling
in for dinner.

39
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,416
I'm wearing a wire.
I have sharp shooters

40
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,219
on the roofs of neighbouring
houses with lines of site

41
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,888
to all the windows.
He'll try to kill you

42
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,759
in the kitchen.
For convenience.

43
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:18,363
Make it easier
to prepare the tartar.

44
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,702
Jack won't be easy to kill.

45
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:28,207
He'll be armed.

46
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,244
He's strong,
well-trained.

47
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,980
We can't hesitate.

48
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:41,253
Hannibal thinks
you are his man in the room.

49
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:45,591
I think you're mine.

50
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:48,527
<i>When a fox hears a rabbit</i>
<i>scream, he comes running.</i>

51
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:51,330
But not to help.

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,602
When you hear Jack scream,
why will you come running?

53
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,742
When the moment comes.

54
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,777
When the moment comes.

55
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,950
Will you do
what needs to be done?

56
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,493
Oh yes.

57
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,330
(dogs barking)

58
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,935
(growling)

59
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,574
Shhhh.

60
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:37,769
See?
See.

61
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,664
(haggard breathing)

62
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,436
Forgiveness is such a profound,

63
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:15,140
conscious and unconscious
state of affairs.

64
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,614
You can't actually choose to do it.
Mmhm.

65
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:26,551
It simply happens to you.

66
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,723
Does forgiveness happen to you?

67
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:40,766
I died.

68
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,703
I'm between deaths.

69
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,875
The punctuation
at the end of a sentence

70
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:54,746
gives meaning to every word,
every space that proceeded it.

71
00:06:54,748 --> 00:07:02,120
They moved my punctuation
mark, Dr. Lecter.

72
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:07,692
You moved my meaning.

73
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:12,464
(coughing)

74
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,892
I'm not here
because I want to be here.

75
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:44,029
You saw to that.

76
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:48,467
I'm here...

77
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:53,071
because I can't abandon Jack.

78
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,907
Not again.

79
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,945
Love and death
are the great hinges

80
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:05,650
on which all
human sympathies turn.

81
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,886
What we do for ourselves
dies with us.

82
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,055
What we do for others...
That's beyond us.

83
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,024
You saved me for Jack.

84
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:22,634
Will you save him for me,

85
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,805
when I'm gone?

86
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,007
Hmm.

87
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,549
I'm going to enjoy
my resurrection.

88
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,887
Nothing sells better
than a survival story.

89
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:45,757
I wouldn't count us
as survivors just yet, Freddie.

90
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,728
Counting me as a survivor?
I started as a cancer editor

91
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,730
at a supermarket tabloid.

92
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:56,034
Cancer is very lucrative media.

93
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:02,040
"New Cures for Cancer,"
"Cancer Miracle Cure."

94
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,543
We're all desperate
for a little hope.

95
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,786
I want to ask you to do
something for me, Freddie.

96
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,855
Or rather, don't.

97
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,932
Don't write about Abigail.

98
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:30,335
You can write about me.

99
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,938
You can write about Hannibal.

100
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,675
But, leave Abigail alone?

101
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,348
You really don't know
if you're going

102
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,984
to survive him, do you?

103
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,923
Just let her rest in peace.

104
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,116
These are your notes on me.

105
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,621
So they are.

106
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,699
Don't your patients need these
after you're gone?

107
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:11,302
The FBI will pore over
my notes if I left them intact.

108
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,239
I will spare
my patients the scrutiny.

109
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:19,978
I'm dismantling who I was
and moving it brick by brick.

110
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,688
When we've gone from this life,

111
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,824
Jack Crawford
and the FBI behind us,

112
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,927
I will always have this place.

113
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,897
In your memory palace?

114
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,333
My palace is vast,
even by medieval standards.

115
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:46,071
The foyer is
of Norman Chapel in Palermo.

116
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:50,341
Severe, beautiful and timeless.

117
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,712
With a single reminder
of mortality.

118
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:59,417
A skull.
Graven in the floor.

119
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,826
All I need is...
a stream.

120
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,995
In those moments
where you can't overcome

121
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:16,301
your surroundings,
you can make it all go away.

122
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:19,738
Put my head back,
close my eyes,

123
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,108
wade into the quiet
of the stream.

124
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,917
If I'm ever apprehended,
my memory palace

125
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,521
will serve as more
than a mnemonic system.

126
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,790
I will live there.

127
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,128
Could you be happy there?

128
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,531
All the path's chambers
are not lovely,

129
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,533
light and bright.

130
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:52,871
In the walls of our hearts
and brains, danger waits.

131
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:56,207
There are holes
in the floor of the mind.

132
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:18,523
<i>In the few jerky seconds</i>
<i>of sleep I do get,</i>

133
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:26,331
<i>all I see is dark,</i>
<i>swarming behind my eyelids.</i>

134
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,872
<i>I dream darkness comes into me.</i>

135
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:37,075
<i>It comes and it's insidious.</i>

136
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,014
<i>Up my nose into my ears.</i>

137
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,023
<i>I feel poisoned.</i>

138
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,933
We're all poisoned.

139
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:05,169
You saw what no one else could.

140
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:16,247
All it took was the, uh,
traumatic.

141
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,450
We're still in the thick of it.

142
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,524
We're getting through
the worst of it.

143
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,669
You've set some sort of trap

144
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,305
and you're goading
Hannibal into it.

145
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,079
How can you be sure
he's not goading you?

146
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,485
I can't.

147
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:39,063
Do you know what
an imago is, Will?

148
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:42,433
It's a flying insect.

149
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,571
It's the last stage
of a transformation.

150
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:50,675
When you become
who you will be?

151
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,677
It's also a term

152
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,446
from the dead religion
of psychoanalysis.

153
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:59,350
An imago is an image
of a loved one,

154
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,520
buried in the unconscious,

155
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,156
carried with us all our lives.

156
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:08,493
An ideal.

157
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:13,264
The concept of an ideal...

158
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,566
I have a concept of you,

159
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,568
just as you have
a concept of me.

160
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,571
Neither of us ideal.

161
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,680
Both of us are too curious

162
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:33,117
about too many things
for any ideals.

163
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:43,461
Is it ideal that Jack die?

164
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,667
It's necessary.

165
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:54,472
What happens to Jack
has been preordained.

166
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,613
We could disappear now.

167
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,682
Tonight.

168
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,522
Feed your dogs,

169
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:15,493
leave a note for Alana
and never see her or Jack again.

170
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,432
Almost polite.

171
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,505
Then this would be
our last supper.

172
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,845
Of this life.

173
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:39,517
We'll serve lamb.
Sacrificial.

174
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,656
I don't need a sacrifice,

175
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,860
do you?

176
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:52,263
I need him to know.

177
00:18:55,567 --> 00:19:00,338
If I confess to Jack Crawford
right now,

178
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,276
I would forgive you.

179
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,783
If Jack were to tell you
all is forgiven,

180
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,687
would you accept
his forgiveness?

181
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,931
Jack isn't offering
forgiveness.

182
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:32,303
He wants... justice.

183
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,643
He wants to see you,

184
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,812
see who you are.

185
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:45,449
See what I've become.

186
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,725
He wants the truth.

187
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:11,475
Tell the truth, then.

188
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,478
And all its consequences.

189
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,997
This is entrapment, Jack.

190
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,966
You can't entrap someone

191
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,535
into committing
premeditated murder.

192
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:40,504
Yes, you can.
You're doing it.

193
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:43,241
You conspired to violate
Dr. Lecter's property

194
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,477
and personal rights.
And for the record,

195
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,280
the only one involved
in this investigation

196
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:53,484
we can confirm actually having
killed someone is Will Graham.

197
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,520
It was self defense.

198
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,661
Hannibal Lecter is being
induced to commit murder

199
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:07,298
by an undercover FBI informant.

200
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,501
This is outrageous
government conduct.

201
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,337
You would never
get a conviction.

202
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,339
You're not thinking
clearly, Jack.

203
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,475
We are as close as we are
ever going to get

204
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,977
to catching this man.

205
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:25,049
I understand that your wife
is very ill.

206
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:28,919
You're distracted.
After an inquiry,

207
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,722
I'm putting you on forced
compassionate leave.

208
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:44,595
This is just staggering.

209
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:47,598
What are you going to do
about Hannibal Lecter?

210
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,734
What Jack should have done.

211
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,736
We've frozen his passport

212
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,971
and we're getting
a search warrant.

213
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,073
Hannibal already opened
his doors to the FBI,

214
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,075
there won't be
physical evidence.

215
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,478
The only way to catch him
is in the act.

216
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,615
Are you saying we should have
just let Jack hang himself?

217
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,084
And everyone else
in his department?

218
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,620
No. But Will and Jack
are still your best chance

219
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:12,923
to catch Hannibal.

220
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:18,562
This man that Will Graham
killed in self defense...

221
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,066
he was mutilated.
At a certain point,

222
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,102
self defense stops.
Will Graham didn't stop.

223
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:30,040
Jack Crawford sanctioned this
and then he hid it from us.

224
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:34,478
I have to believe
that Will was trying

225
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,514
to maintain his cover identity.

226
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,783
Reality doesn't go away

227
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:41,519
because you stop
believing in it.

228
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:44,054
It's stubborn like that.
The reality of this situation

229
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:47,124
is Jack Crawford misused
the power of his office.

230
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,627
Mrs. Prurnell,

231
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,530
they are desperate.

232
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:56,000
They are breaking the law.

233
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,672
I'm bringing these men
up on charges.

234
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:05,009
They're not going to stop.

235
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:08,212
That's why they're being
brought into custody.

236
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,514
Jack knows what you'll find.

237
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,550
He knows what you have to do.

238
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:16,454
That won't stop him
from doing what he has to do.

239
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,774
(phone ringing)

240
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,612
Hello?

241
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,948
[It's Alana.
Is Jack with you?]

242
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,218
No, why?

243
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,888
They've issued a warrant
for your arrest, Will.

244
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,092
For acting as an accessory
to entrapment

245
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,528
(dogs barking)

246
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,130
[and for the murder
of Randall Tier.]

247
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,669
[They're going to arrest
Jack as well.]

248
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,574
[Will?]

249
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,210
Goodbye, Alana.

250
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:28,025
(phone rings)

251
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,661
Hello?

252
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:36,300
They know.

253
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:07,731
Hello, Jack.
You're early.

254
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:11,168
I couldn't wait to get here.

255
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,206
Would you care
to sous-chef?

256
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:23,180
I want to thank you
for your friendship, Hannibal.

257
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,653
The most beautiful quality
of a true friendship

258
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,822
is to understand them.

259
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,358
Be understood
with absolute clarity.

260
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,032
And this is...

261
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:45,336
the clearest moment
of our friendship.

262
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,134
Argh!

263
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,421
I'd like to report gunshots.

264
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,882
Hannibal.

265
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,123
Hannibal!

266
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,265
Where's Jack?

267
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:34,037
In the pantry.

268
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,977
I was hoping you and I
wouldn't have to say goodbye.

269
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:43,547
Nothing seen nor said.

270
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,252
You may have found that rude.

271
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,888
STOP!

272
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:57,261
I was so blind.

273
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:01,999
In your defense,
I worked very hard to blind you.

274
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:06,537
You can stay blind.

275
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:10,541
You can hide from this.

276
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:14,845
Walk away, I'll make no plans
to call on you.

277
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:17,815
But if you stay,
I will kill you.

278
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,225
Be blind, Alana.
Don't be brave.

279
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,203
(clicks)

280
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,375
I took your bullets.
(Alana whimpering)

281
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,125
I found more bullets!

282
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,921
Abigail?

283
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,258
I'm so sorry.

284
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,228
(medieval music)

285
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,628
This is Will Graham,
I need ERT.

286
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,234
Jack is inside.

287
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,443
Go...

288
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,334
(choking sounds)

289
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,715
(footsteps)

290
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,837
Abigail?

291
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:10,841
I didn't know
what else to do, so...

292
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:14,544
I just did what he told me.

293
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,149
Where is he?

294
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:36,199
Y... you were supposed...
to leave.

295
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,607
We couldn't leave without you.

296
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,526
Ah!

297
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:17,207
Time did reverse

298
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:21,244
the teacup that I shattered
there to come together.

299
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:27,484
The place was made
for Abigail and your world.

300
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:29,853
Do you understand?

301
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:37,194
The place was made
for all of us, together.

302
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,733
I wanted to surprise you.

303
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,972
And you...

304
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,508
you wanted to surprise me.

305
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,317
(sputtering)

306
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,920
I have let you know me.

307
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,327
See me.

308
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,529
I gave you a rare gift.

309
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:19,002
But you didn't want it.
Didn't I?

310
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,874
- You would deny me my life.
- N... no. No.

311
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,977
Not your life, no.

312
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:29,379
My freedom then,
you would take that from me.

313
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:34,284
Come find me in a prison cell.

314
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,527
Do you believe
you could change me,

315
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:47,597
the way I've changed you?

316
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,700
I already did.

317
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,044
Fate and circumstance
have returned us to this moment

318
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:07,651
when the teacup shatters.

319
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,791
I forgive you, Will.

320
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,330
Will you forgive me?

321
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:24,768
Don, don't...,

322
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,504
No. No.

323
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,075
N... no. No. No.

324
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,344
Abigale, come to me.

325
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,357
(gulping)

326
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,973
You can make it all go away.

327
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:07,110
Put your head back.

328
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:10,013
Close your eyes.

329
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,884
Wade into the quiet
