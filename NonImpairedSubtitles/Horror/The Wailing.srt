1
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,860
Where are you off to so early in the morning?

2
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,260
Somebody died...

3
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,270
Who?

4
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,270
Si-power pembudi ginseng, Jo-ssi it...

5
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,680
His wife died.

6
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,480
It is really coming down.

7
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,150
Hey, where are you going?

8
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,290
Someone died.

9
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,020
Who?

10
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,890
Wife said Jo-ssi, ginseng growers.

11
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,890
I don't know all the details yet.

12
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,430
You mean that girl that lives there?

13
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,300
Uh~huh.

14
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Even still, you should eat some breakfast before you leave.

15
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,170
I got to go.

16
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,770
Have a spoonful at least.

17
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,710
What difference does it make? They're dead, its not like you can save them.

18
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,040
I have to get there now.

19
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,310
Eat something first and then go.

20
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,310
Come on.

21
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,320
So what happened?

22
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,990
I do not know.

23
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,720
Sounds like murder.

24
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,790
What kind of bastard could do such a thing?

25
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,460
What an animal...

26
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
Did someone die?

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Eat something.

28
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,540
Who was it?

29
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,850
Jong Goo!

30
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,580
You got a raincoat?

31
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,180
Why are you so late?!

32
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,180
We got people dying!

33
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,450
Is the boss here yet?

34
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
He is in Seoul.

35
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
Ak ok.

36
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,990
Follow me.

37
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,060
Okay.

38
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,950
<i>Why did you leave me?!</i>

39
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,550
<i>I'm here, look at me!</i>

40
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,030
<i>Let me go you bastards!</i>

41
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,490
<i>All of you sons of bitches!</i>

42
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,900
<i>Get off me!</i>

43
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,700
<i>You bastard!</i>

44
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,630
<i>Sergeant!</i>

45
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,510
<i>It wasn't me! Let me go!</i>

46
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,180
You're finally here?

47
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,060
<i>It looks like they were stabbed.</i>

48
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,190
<i>Around 20 stab wounds.</i>

49
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,930
What is that over there?

50
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,340
I don't think they were killed here.

51
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,600
He was dragged for a while...

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,470
Very brutal.

53
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,010
Is that Jo-ssi?

54
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,140
Yes, looks that way.

55
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,950
What the...

56
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,550
What about the son?

57
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,420
They took him to the family house.

58
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,160
What's wrong with him?

59
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,700
He doesn't smell of alcohol and he's not talking.
I think he ate some wild mushrooms.

60
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,230
They say he just suddenly got like that.

61
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,240
<i>Where have you been?</i>

62
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
Oh hey!

63
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,310
Sorry we're late.

64
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,510
<i>You bastard! Let me go!</i>

65
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,790
This guy... What a prick. Could have just used navigation.

66
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,330
But nope...

67
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,660
Isn't that it right there?

68
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,670
Over here!

69
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,340
Come on.

70
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,400
Alright.

71
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,410
Jong Goo, come this way.

72
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,740
Hurry up and open the gate.

73
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,080
Good.

74
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,150
Go in.

75
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
<i>What is that smell?!</i>

76
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,020
OMG... So this is where Jo-ssi died.

77
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,290
Dammit... What the hell is all this?

78
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,830
So he called Jo-ssi in here to kill her and after he stabbed her repeatedly

79
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,100
he put her inside a burlap sack and dragged her all the way home.

80
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
That is what it looks like.

81
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,370
<i>Really psychopathic killer.
Psychopath!</i>

82
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,170
<i>Coroner, come get photos of this.</i>

83
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,580
<i>Over here, there and also inside.</i>

84
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,480
Segeant!

85
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,610
Over here!

86
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,750
Sergeant, come over here.

87
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,560
Dammit.

88
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,224
Son of a bitch...

89
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:25,348
<i>What exactly was this guy into?</i>

90
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:49,460
The Wailing

91
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,290
Let's see here...

92
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,560
Some scary shit, right?

93
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,100
Scary my ass...

94
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,640
Anyways...
That is the rumor.

95
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,780
Rumor?
Who told you that?

96
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,980
Hyeon Gi Hyeong.

97
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,450
Oh that guy... I mean really...

98
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,120
I see he's even gabbing to you now...

99
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,130
Maybe it is just gossip
but he isn't the only one saying it.

100
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,600
Who else?

101
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,400
By the bridge, you know Chil Seong?

102
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
He runs the shop over there,

103
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,670
Eun Gook also said something.

104
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,400
And?

105
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,140
All this stuff started to happen...
when that old Jap showed up...

106
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,950
I can't believe what I'm... The ignorance...
You talking like this...

107
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,820
What do you mean? Talking like what?!

108
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,230
Listen you dumb ass, they did the autopsy,
ran all kinds of tests,

109
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,370
they were talking about how he probably
ate some bad mushrooms...

110
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,170
<i>What?</i>

111
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,100
You know those mushrooms that make you go crazy...

112
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,170
They found large quantities of it in his blood sample.

113
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,380
They also found some at his house,
dried up and untouched.

114
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,040
Sergeant, do you really believe that?

115
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,910
The tests results are in!

116
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,910
Sergeant, have you ever tried those kinds of mushrooms?

117
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,980
Never tried it you dick...

118
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,790
Mushrooms don't do that to people,

119
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,050
you saw the condition he was in!

120
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
<i>You think mushrooms did that?!?</i>

121
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,400
Anyways, I still think I'm right...

122
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,000
<i>There has to be a reason why that rumor spread so quickly.
A reason... A reason </i>

123
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,550
Shit!

124
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,750
The electricity is out.

125
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,690
Nobody does any maintenance around here.

126
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,300
If only we had the money...
we could get an electrician...

127
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,230
Nobody ever listens...

128
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,500
What is that?!?

129
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,100
<i>What is what?! What?!
What's wrong?!</i>

130
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,770
What is that?!

131
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,500
Outside!

132
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,700
<i>Outside? What?!</i>

133
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,040
What is it dammit?!?

134
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,170
Dammit!

135
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,380
Go out there!

136
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,850
<i>Go outside?!? Do what?!</i>

137
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,050
Get out there!
Take a look dammit!

138
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,450
<i>Who was that?!</i>

139
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,590
Get out there!

140
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,990
Shit!

141
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,720
You bitch.!!!

142
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,770
A lot in there...

143
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,400
Heavy...

144
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,210
I finally came.

145
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,610
Such big talk...

146
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,550
And I'm always hearing stories about
husbands going for hours...

147
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,490
Maybe if you got me a tonic or something...

148
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,090
I'm having nightmares every night.

149
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,430
What are you doing?

150
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,160
Dammit! What are you doing?! Get out of here!

151
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,470
Don't open it!

152
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,100
This girl dammit!

153
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,180
Daddy...

154
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,050
Daddy...

155
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,590
Look.

156
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,260
What do you think?

157
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,790
Pretty.

158
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Too pretty.

159
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,760
So how long were you watching us?

160
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,630
How much did you see?

161
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,640
Don't worry about it.

162
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm not going to tell people.

163
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,980
So you saw everything...

164
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,380
Don't worry!

165
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,980
That wasn't even the first time.

166
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,120
What?

167
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,860
Drink.

168
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,460
What?

169
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,200
It's okay, drink.

170
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,490
Quick! Quick!

171
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,660
Move!

172
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,500
You!

173
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,700
Hey.

174
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,770
Where were you?
You didn't answer your phone.

175
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,110
My mother in law suddenly got sick...

176
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,110
You're using your mother in law...
as an excuse?

177
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,710
Come with me!

178
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,520
It's not like that...

179
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,390
What did you take?!

180
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:53,890
Ma아m....ma아m...

181
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,070
Ma아m...

182
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,540
Jang Goo! What are you waiting for!
Make yourself useful!

183
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,550
Please come out of there.

184
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,550
You go!

185
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,320
Hey, officer Lee come get this woman out of here!

186
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,220
Ready!

187
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,420
Move aside, make room!

188
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,890
Everyone move back!

189
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,620
Please step aside!

190
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,030
What is wrong with... What the...

191
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,170
Settle down...

192
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,470
Look at this idiot...

193
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,750
Ma아m...

194
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Hyeongnim, you should go clean yourself off.

195
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,640
That is embarrassing,
they're going to be talking about that one for a while...

196
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,380
Rolling around screaming and moaning...

197
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,780
Give me a break...

198
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,850
<i>Hello everyone!</i>

199
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,320
Hyo Jin is here!

200
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,380
Yes.

201
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,720
Is everything good?

202
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,790
Yes.

203
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,990
Did you bring your father some clothes?

204
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,320
Yes.

205
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,460
Mom told me to bring this to you.

206
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,200
Some new underwear...

207
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,330
Thank you.

208
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,870
Go clean up.

209
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,940
I got it...
Go...

210
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,280
Didn't even eat your food...
Good job, good job....

211
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,410
I got it, okay? You don't have to lecture me.

212
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,420
Can't you your dad is at work?

213
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,160
I'm leaving. Okay?

214
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,960
Bye everyone!

215
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,630
Be safe, bye!

216
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,380
She can be so careless.

217
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,860
Seong Bok?

218
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,060
Yes?

219
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,060
I remember now...

220
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,060
What?

221
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,200
That woman...

222
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,800
The one from the burned down house...
we just came from.

223
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,470
I knew I saw her somewhere before.

224
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,810
That woman from last night,
standing here butt naked!

225
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,140
What?

226
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,210
When the lights went out! That's her!

227
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,160
You guys are crazy.

228
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,400
She died from knife wounds, she wasn't hung.

229
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,870
All 3 of them?

230
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,670
Yes... I was also a bit surprised.

231
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,750
The woman who was hung...
Her husband is the suspect.

232
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,760
What is happening around here?

233
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,830
I wonder that myself.

234
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,360
Hey!

235
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,100
Come over here!

236
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,160
Yes.

237
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Through there!

238
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,840
Lift it a little higher!

239
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,980
I found it!

240
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,380
And you're just going to pick it up...
with your hands?

241
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,390
Are you retarded?

242
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,320
This is evidence.

243
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,930
We need to pick it up with a towel...
or something like that.

244
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,400
Right?

245
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,200
<i>Any new information?</i>

246
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,870
<i>Come on! Give us something!</i>

247
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,980
So that woman killed everyone?

248
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,490
Looks that way.

249
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,430
Shit that is crazy. What could have...

250
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,890
So why did you call me here?

251
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,230
You know I'm busy.

252
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,760
I called you because of that thing I told you about.

253
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,040
Do you remember what I said?

254
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,240
What?

255
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,980
About that Japanese guy,
he was trying to touch up on that woman!

256
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,530
You filthy bitch in heat...

257
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,070
That woman -- she is the one.

258
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,940
What are you talking about?!

259
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,470
The woman I told you about with the Japanese guy!

260
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,410
She is the one from the fire!

261
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm telling you it's like she suddenly just lost her mind

262
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,950
going out in the middle of the night completely naked!

263
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,560
Even my wife saw it several times.

264
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,100
Her whole body was all red and infected,

265
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,770
screaming at people and jumping at them like!

266
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,770
Hyeongnim, you haven't lost your marbles have you?

267
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:25,050
We better round up all the bums...
for the interrogation room...

268
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,720
You idiot, it's a bit too late for that now,
they're dead!

269
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,390
I was just kidding around,

270
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,390
even if it압 true who the hell is going to believe this nonsense?

271
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,930
Doesn't matter,
you were right about it and I've given it a lot of thought.

272
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,730
It is definitely not some bad mushrooms.

273
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,000
You are getting really paranoid.

274
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,540
What are you looking at?

275
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,220
Go!

276
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,750
She's relentless.

277
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,360
Been here since morning.

278
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,030
Crazy ass...

279
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,030
Hey you should go check out all the clinics around the area.

280
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,900
See if there's any medical records on Park Byeong Wook.

281
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,770
Hey stop throwing rocks!

282
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,770
Hyeongnim, this is so pointless.

283
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,580
This is important you moron.

284
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,580
An infection, it has something to do with festering infections, we can track that down.

285
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,590
Just go already!

286
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,070
Stop throwing those, you can hurt somebody!

287
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,690
Ah goddammit! You really have nothing else to do?!

288
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,500
Where is your house?

289
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,840
Do you live around here?

290
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,320
Don't come any closer.

291
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,930
The woman killed them all...

292
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,270
Huh?

293
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,130
Inside that --

294
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,670
She killed them all in the room.

295
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,210
What are you talking about?

296
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,510
Halmeoni said if we don't do something soon...

297
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,980
She will die and...

298
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,150
She didn't want to...

299
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,490
And so she killed them....

300
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,290
Are you family?

301
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,160
I'm not.

302
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,770
Then who are you?

303
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,430
Follow me.

304
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,040
You're not supposed to...

305
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,050
It's okay.

306
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,190
Come here.

307
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,330
Right here is where she killed them.

308
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,800
Halmeoni died the most painfully.

309
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,210
Tried to fight back but they all died...

310
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,080
And you saw this?

311
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,020
Yeah. I watched it.

312
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,620
How?

313
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,960
Halmeoni said that Japanese man is actually a ghost.

314
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,300
He sucks on your blood and kills you.

315
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,770
The stranger?

316
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,840
Yes.
That Japanese man from the mountain.

317
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,580
So have you seen him?

318
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,510
How many times?

319
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,520
Once or twice...

320
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,120
Beware!

321
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,590
Why?!

322
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,660
Halmeoni said if you're seeing him quite often...

323
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,990
it's probably because he's stalking you...

324
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,600
So he can suck your blood...
And kill you...

325
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,480
You wait here, don't move!

326
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,020
Get back here fast!

327
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,690
I said to get back here fast!

328
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,020
What are you talking about? I just got here.

329
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,160
I have and eye-witness! A Witness!

330
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,500
Hurry back here!

331
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,840
Where...

332
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,570
It's like you visit hell every night by yourself.

333
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,440
Not just once or twice either...

334
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,980
Are you sick?

335
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,510
Why do I keep having nightmares?

336
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,920
Is someone sick?

337
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,520
Hyo Jin isn't well.

338
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,990
Couldn't even go to school.

339
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,600
She's burning up!

340
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,000
What the hell have you been doing this whole time?!

341
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,200
We need to get some help.

342
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,540
Well you see I bought the medicine!

343
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,610
Damn, why didn't you take her to the hospital?!

344
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,890
What the...

345
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,690
<i>You idiot... </i>

346
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,100
<i>The other side!
OMG...</i>

347
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,240
Aw man...
Finally arriving for work are we?

348
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,240
Hyo Jin isn't feeling too good...

349
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,580
I see you're using your daughter as an excuse now...

350
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,780
No!

351
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,520
You really found a witness?

352
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,980
No...

353
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,120
I want you to search the entire neighborhood thoroughly!

354
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,390
Working like this do you really expect a promotion?

355
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,860
Seong Bok and I worked our asses off...
 searching all over the place...

356
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,730
So you're sticking together...
Just look at this!

357
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,670
First he gets the brush all dirty,

358
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,170
and then he cleans with it...

359
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,730
Imbeciles...

360
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,940
Hey!
They're expecting results!

361
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,470
Whether you lost the witness or lied about it,

362
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,210
this is on you!
I have to report back.

363
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,750
...

364
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,290
Aw man... Nothing to look at.

365
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,760
I can't believe the way he talks to us...

366
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,430
Here, take a look at this.

367
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,130
Family dies horribly in a wild mushroom tragedy.

368
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,570
What did the hospital say?
Mushrooms?

369
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,380
They're not sure.

370
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,110
They recommend us to a larger hospital.

371
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,720
You really think there's a chance it could be fungus?

372
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,120
There is a possibility...

373
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,790
Remember what you told you me about Byeong Jae?

374
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,660
Did I?

375
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,730
About the tumble he had on the mountain...
Hit his head on a rock...

376
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,600
Give it a rest!

377
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,270
Why do you listen to all these stories?
Gossip!?

378
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,810
I don't want any doubt.

379
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,940
You know him right?

380
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,150
This side...

381
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:06,830
It may be hard to believe but
I saw it with my own two eyes.

382
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,830
See that?

383
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,500
Yes, I see.

384
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,970
22 stitches from that.

385
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,240
You sure you weren't drinking?

386
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,380
Is that what you think?

387
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,110
I've had my days already.

388
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,250
I can't afford to live that carelessly.

389
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,380
Is there evidence?

390
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,590
Evidence?
I guess, see for yourself.

391
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,060
You don't believe me, you want proof...

392
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,990
Come here!

393
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,000
Don't act surpised now.

394
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,200
I'm opening it!

395
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,600
Take a look.

396
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,340
Take a look. Empty right?

397
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,880
Aw man..
Since that day I haven't been back to the mountain.

398
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,550
My shop is losing money because of it!

399
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,550
How can you call that evidence?

400
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,690
You don't believe me...

401
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,560
That's not important anyway.

402
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,430
When I woke up after hitting my head,

403
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:18,230
I saw him crawling around on all fours like an animal
wearing nothing but some sort of diaper.

404
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,170
Diapers?

405
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,500
Yes.

406
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,300
Adults?

407
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,370
Yes!

408
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,500
Adults can wear diapers.

409
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,170
...

410
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,240
They get old and can't take care of themselves.
Lot of them use it...

411
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,640
So are you saying you actually want to
look into this?

412
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,850
You guys came here to question me...

413
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,980
but instead you're questioning each other.

414
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:44,260
He had his face in it, his whole body.
He was caked in blood!

415
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:50,630
His eyes were bright red and he slowly fixed his gaze on me...

416
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:52,654
Then all of a sudden he!

417
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,270
OMG...
I can't get any sleep at night.

418
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,880
Pulling at it like a tiger.

419
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,810
You saw him eating raw meat, right?

420
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,520
Yes!

421
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:14,020
Look, look, goosebumps!

422
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,490
This guy, you think this is funny?

423
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,360
Where exactly does he live?

424
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,830
Why? You wanna' go?

425
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,160
I think I need to meet him.

426
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,430
Don't go, trust me on this...

427
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,300
It is my opinion...

428
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:37,380
he has something to do with all these people dying in the village.

429
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,580
He is not a human...

430
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,650
So what is his address?

431
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,650
You're going to look for an adress in the woods?

432
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,050
You can give us an approximate location...

433
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,260
You don't need directions for that...

434
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,790
it's in the in corner of that valley over there.

435
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,690
How much farther from here?

436
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,690
Not too far.

437
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,990
OMG, damn it!

438
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,860
What? What's wrong?

439
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,800
Over there!
There!

440
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,270
What am I looking at?

441
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,140
Look at that, look!

442
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,480
Is that a tiger?!

443
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,950
You were telling the truth?

444
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,350
That's what I've been saying over and over
this entire time. God dammit!

445
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,220
Shit.
It was all real...

446
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,230
We gotta' go!

447
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,960
We gotta' get out of here!

448
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,500
We can go down this way.

449
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,040
Where are you going?

450
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,510
You have to show us...

451
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,910
It's right there, go up the hill,

452
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,110
I don't want to get any deeper,

453
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,480
I'm going now.

454
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,520
You're here anyway,
just see it through!

455
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,650
Let me go!
I have to leave!

456
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,860
How are you just going to leave now?

457
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,460
Let go!

458
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,800
Shit!

459
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,670
Byeong Jae!

460
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,470
Byeong Jae!

461
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,600
Byeong Jae!

462
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,540
Are you okay?

463
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,750
You bastard!

464
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,020
Sorry...

465
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,560
Die you bastards!

466
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,030
You guys go die if you want,

467
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,690
leave me the hell out of it!

468
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,960
I'm really sorry!

469
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,300
Go die!
You talk too goddamn much you asshole...

470
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,060
Where are you going?

471
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,330
Did he just get...

472
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,730
Hey!

473
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,480
He's been hunting and feeding himself his whole life,
rain or not.

474
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,690
Almost died by getting struck by lightning...

475
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,560
How do you end up getting struck by lightning!?

476
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,440
What are the odds...

477
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:06,050
Fortunately he's strong from
eating all that meat everyday,

478
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,310
it's why he's still breathing.

479
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,850
Over here! Over here! Over here!

480
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,190
Patient number 302 Park Byeong Gyoo!

481
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,990
Come to the room right now please!

482
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,870
We need help over here!

483
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,750
Gwajang-nim!

484
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,970
What is this!

485
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,870
All this...

486
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,890
What am I supposed to make of it?

487
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,240
Tomorrow we need to go that house.

488
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,310
There is definitely something up there.

489
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,060
Another glass!

490
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,020
Hyo Jin!

491
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,690
Hyo Jin!

492
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,490
Hyo Jin!

493
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,760
Dad is here, look daddy is here!

494
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,100
Dad is here!

495
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,170
Hyo Jin, open your eyes!

496
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,370
Hyo Jin.

497
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,840
Look at daddy! Look at me!

498
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,310
Daddy!

499
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,850
Daddy... I'm here! I'm here!

500
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,990
Please make it stop!

501
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,590
What is it? What is wrong?

502
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:45,200
Someone was knocking on our door trying to get in!

503
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,730
Who?

504
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,940
There was a man trying to come inside!

505
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,820
It's okay, it's okay.

506
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,700
Hyo Jin!

507
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,970
Hyo Jin!

508
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,450
What?

509
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,720
All good?

510
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,720
Good morning father.

511
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,070
Her whole life she barely eats anything,

512
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:55,530
she doesn't even like fish...

513
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,140
There is something different about her.

514
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,670
I heard everything she said last night...
 when she woke up.

515
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,680
Halmeoni next door says...
 we need to get in touch with a shaman.

516
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,620
I'm going to meet him, I'm just letting you know.

517
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,430
Yes, I understand...

518
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:43,880
We ready to go?

519
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,650
Yes.

520
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,720
Hello!

521
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,920
This is my nephew.

522
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,390
Is he a pastor?

523
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,700
No, he's a deacon. Assistant to the pastor.

524
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,730
I was thinking about it...

525
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,340
and we need someone to translate
if we're going to talk to him.

526
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,540
You speak Japanese?

527
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,410
A little bit, little bit.

528
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,810
He lived in Japan as a child...

529
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:15,350
What is this around you neck?

530
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,680
Aw man...
Trying all sorts of things are we?

531
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,620
What is your name?

532
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,490
Yi San.

533
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,690
In Bongpyeong?

534
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:27,630
Yes.

535
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:29,900
Come on!

536
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,340
Anyone here? ...anyone?

537
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,850
Perverted...

538
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,000
You know this is against the law.

539
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,930
I know.

540
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,530
Then what are you doing?

541
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,870
Don't do this, okay?

542
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:14,930
If you're not going to help then
just wait outside...

543
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,730
<i>...easy, boy!</i>

544
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,740
<i>OK... just go outside!</i>

545
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,250
What are you staring at?

546
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,620
Making people uncomfortable.

547
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,160
Go look at something over there!

548
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,940
What the fuck!?

549
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,310
Damn dog! Get off of me!

550
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,310
Get it off! Get it off!

551
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,010
What were you doing?!
How'd you get him so pissed off!

552
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:05,100
Hey help us with this dog!

553
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,440
Block it!

554
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,640
Seong Bok! Help!

555
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,840
Block it!

556
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,910
Get up you idiot!

557
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,250
Fuck!

558
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,260
Where is it?

559
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,860
Where did he go?

560
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,930
Seong Bok, he's here...

561
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,680
Seong Bok.

562
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,280
Sorry.

563
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,690
Are you okay?

564
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,700
Yes.

565
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,430
What's wrong with you?
You were acting weird.

566
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,770
You saw something?

567
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,040
Answer me! Dammit!

568
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,240
Shit!

569
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,640
It's him...

570
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,180
What are you saying?

571
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,710
Get yourself together!

572
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,120
It's not just one or two people...

573
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,450
He takes pictures of them before they turn into...

574
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,720
And he takes pictures of them when they die.

575
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,260
He goes back to photograph them...

576
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,190
What the fuck are you babbling about?!?

577
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,060
You're not making any sense!

578
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,800
He is the one responsible...

579
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,800
That is enough.

580
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,270
We'll talk later.

581
00:56:49,270 --> 00:57:01,150
He had the belongings of living people... Why?

582
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,350
What exactly did you see?

583
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,620
I asked you what you saw!

584
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,560
Hyo Jin

585
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,510
You're getting soaked!

586
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,440
Where is Hyo Jin?

587
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,640
In the house.

588
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,720
Hyo Jin!

589
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,260
Home early?

590
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,660
Did you lose a shoe?

591
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,330
No, what do you mean?

592
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,270
So, what this is?

593
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,610
It's not mine.

594
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:06,950
This isn't your handwriting?

595
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,020
I said it's not mine.

596
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:18,160
You know there is a Japanese man
living in the village right?

597
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,260
Clothes are completely soaked...

598
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,570
Answer me!

599
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,570
You know him, right?

600
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,440
You met him, right?

601
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,510
Answer me now!

602
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,050
What is this about?

603
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,250
Go outside.

604
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,790
I'm dealing with something right now,
go outside.

605
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,860
Your father is a cop.

606
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,600
I'll know if you're lying.

607
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,470
You met him, right?

608
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:10,610
Tell me!

609
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,810
What?

610
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,280
Everything.

611
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,480
Where did you meet him?

612
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,680
What did you guys do?

613
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,020
Why should I tell you?

614
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,620
This is serious!

615
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,960
Why is it so serious?

616
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,220
You're going to be like this!

617
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,630
What is the big deal?

618
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,840
What is so serious?

619
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,170
What?... What!!!

620
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,840
Is that really so important?!

621
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:50,250
You insignificant piece of...

622
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,120
Loser, a total loser...

623
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,290
What are you doing right now?

624
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,220
I thought you were asleep.

625
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,820
What are you doing?

626
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,830
Sitting there looking up your daughter's skirt,

627
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:47,170
what do you think you're doing?

628
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,510
Can't speak?

629
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:01,850
Speak you piece of shit!

630
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,250
I said speak you piece son of a bitch!

631
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,120
Fuck!

632
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,130
Don't look at me you piece of shit!

633
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:17,730
How can you speak to your father like that?!

634
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,530
Don't fucking look at me!

635
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,870
You're going to keep this up?

636
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,140
That압 your father!

637
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:28,040
I'm going to kill him!

638
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,960
I spoke to the shaman.

639
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,160
He said we have a ghost in our house.

640
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,770
It looks it has taken over Hyo Jin.

641
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,770
We could all die if we don't do anything.

642
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:02,840
He's a well known shaman.

643
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,990
Who is it?!

644
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,520
Why you don't answer your phone?

645
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,130
Come outside...

646
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,590
we have somewhere to go.

647
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:38,940
Where'd all that stuff go that was inside?

648
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:43,480
The stuff you had in there, where is it now?

649
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:50,420
What stuff?

650
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,350
He wants to know what I'm talking about.

651
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,490
Tell him we saw everything.

652
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:59,220
The property you had in your house earlier,
where is it?

653
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,690
<i>Photos?</i>

654
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,230
He said photo.
Yes! Photos!

655
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,700
Photo!

656
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,630
Yes.

657
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:10,570
I burned it.

658
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,300
What?

659
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,640
I said I burned it.

660
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,450
He said burned it.

661
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,520
Where?

662
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,320
Where?

663
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,120
In the kitchen.

664
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,990
<i>In the kitchen.</i>

665
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,670
This fucking guy...

666
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:56,610
What is your purpose here?

667
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,750
What is your reason for being here?

668
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,290
Ask him again.

669
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:12,100
Why are you here?

670
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,040
Yoko...

671
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,770
...

672
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:26,110
This fucking...
Tell him to be specific!

673
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:31,320
Can you be more specific?

674
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,730
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you...

675
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:45,200
He says whatever he has to
say, you won't believe him...

676
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,740
Translate this exactly:

677
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:57,340
You piece of shit!
You sick son of a bitch!

678
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,610
You're an old man!

679
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:01,880
And you're hanging up pictures of dead
women in your house?

680
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:05,750
Why was this in your house?

681
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:06,680
...

682
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,220
Who are you? What are you up to?

683
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,290
<i>Who are you?</i>

684
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,560
I know everything that you're doing.

685
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,290
I saw what was in your house.

686
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:21,770
And I know what you did to my daughter you fuck!

687
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,370
I would really feel better if you moved away,

688
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:33,510
just leave this village in peace, truly.

689
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,850
Please leave this place quietly.

690
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:40,450
This is Gokseong, my home.

691
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,060
Don't get yourself killed doing stupid shit,

692
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,920
just leave!

693
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,130
<i>If you do not leave you will die.</i>

694
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:56,870
When someone is talking to you shake your head
or nod you son of a bitch!

695
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:58,600
<i>Please answer.</i>

696
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,080
Really?
You think I'm all talk...

697
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,680
Shut up you fucking dog!

698
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,420
You think I'm all talk?

699
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,750
Then what choice do I have...

700
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,560
You think I wont do anyting?!

701
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:25,160
I tried to reason with you didn't I?

702
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:27,170
Right?

703
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,570
Even if you told me I wouldn't believe you...

704
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,770
What is all this?

705
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,310
Dammit what is all this shit!

706
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:43,050
What is all this!

707
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:44,550
Put a fucking head in here...

708
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:49,850
Come to my village...

709
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,460
You son of a bitch!

710
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,330
Son of a bitch!

711
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,770
<i>Boy...</i>

712
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,730
What now?

713
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,200
Believe now?

714
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,680
I'll give you 3 days.

715
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,340
You got 3 days to pack up and get out of here.

716
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:23,150
Or you'll end up just like the dog.

717
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,950
Translate it to him!

718
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,820
Translate it!

719
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,450
How long has she been like this?

720
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,250
Couple days now.

721
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,360
So?

722
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,230
Her symptoms are identical to the others.

723
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,840
There must be a reason for it...

724
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,100
Some sort of an explanation for the symptoms.

725
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,110
He said he doesn't know what it is...

726
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,750
Honey! Honey!

727
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,820
Who did this?

728
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:53,300
Honey! Honey! Are you okay?

729
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,630
Are you okay?

730
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,240
Do you drink a lot of alcohol?

731
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,040
Nothing serious.

732
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,780
About 20 minutes without moving.

733
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:13,750
Drink less.

734
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:15,720
Before you have a real stroke...

735
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:24,260
This is just the beginning.

736
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,800
Your mind has to be strong.

737
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,800
That guy I told you about...

738
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,070
he'll begin tomorrow.

739
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,470
Where is Hyo Jin now?

740
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:36,810
Pay attention to what I'm saying!

741
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,340
Have the money ready!

742
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,950
Where is Hyo Jin?

743
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,680
She's at home!. Where else would she be!

744
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,950
Halmeoni next door said she'll watch her.

745
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,220
And why are you both here and not with our kid?

746
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,020
Do you even care?

747
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:52,190
Stop moving around!

748
01:13:56,290 --> 01:14:00,830
Something is wrong...

749
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,840
Baby!

750
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,640
What happened?

751
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:19,650
Hyo Jin! Hyo Jin!

752
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,720
What is this?!

753
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,920
Don't cry, look!

754
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,120
Don't cry! It's okay!

755
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:29,660
It's okay!

756
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:33,400
It's okay!

757
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,400
<i>Are you okay?</i>

758
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:38,070
<i>This is because of her dad!</i>

759
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,600
<i>Where else would she learn?</i>

760
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,480
<i>That child learned from the father!</i>

761
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:48,750
<i>The father!</i>

762
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:55,020
<i>Look at this!</i>

763
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,830
He is responsible for this...
I'm  sure of it.

764
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,830
When we were at his house...

765
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:15,570
I felt my body react, so hot and unsettling...

766
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,540
A man living on the mountain...

767
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,520
He doesn't seem like a living person.

768
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,850
Whatever it is, we have to do something.

769
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:35,460
If not, the same things awaits us.

770
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:40,860
Close that door dammit!

771
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,780
What is inside that vat?

772
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:39,180
Which one?

773
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:41,320
The one with the red top.

774
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,990
Oh... Just bean paste.

775
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,530
Here. Bring it here.

776
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,930
What's the problem?
Are you deaf?

777
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:04,010
That's good, move! Move!

778
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,030
<i>What is it?</i>

779
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:23,530
<i>Damn!</i>

780
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:31,500
We got a real nasty one.

781
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:13,280
Hyo Jin!

782
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,800
Hyo Jin!

783
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,370
She came into contact with something recently, right?

784
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:57,650
I'm not sure I understand what you...

785
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:03,520
Is there anyone that could have touched her?

786
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:12,600
This is the most powerful ghost I have ever encountered...

787
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,670
You disturbed it.

788
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:19,000
Then what are we supposed to do?

789
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:21,410
Who is it?

790
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,880
Has she been in contact with anyone...

791
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,710
If you know say something!

792
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:37,960
A Japanese person...

793
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:45,700
I knew as much.

794
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:50,740
That man is not a person.

795
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:54,364
That stranger is a ghost.

796
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:07,180
<i>Get a move on!</i>

797
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:18,930
All those people in your village...

798
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:21,500
they've been taken over by the ghost.

799
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:28,010
If we don't do anything about it...
 your daughter won't be only one that suffers.

800
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:32,540
Everything on two legs will die in your village.

801
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,010
<i>On my count!</i>

802
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:36,280
<i>One, two, three!</i>

803
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:44,020
This man is a farmer, named Park Chon Bae.
He is the owner of this house.

804
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,690
He killed his own wife?

805
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:50,030
Is seems that way.

806
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:52,160
What did you say this bastard's name was?

807
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,570
<i>Park Chon Bae. Park Chon Bae.</i>

808
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:57,370
And then what?

809
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:58,970
What do you mean <i>and then what?!</i>

810
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:01,370
We have to get rid of it!

811
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:04,840
Throw him out of the village,

812
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,580
or kill him.

813
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:21,660
Tomorrow night I am going to do a ritual...
to get rid of this ghost.

814
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,600
Good.

815
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:28,200
You have the money?

816
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:30,070
How much?

817
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:32,340
Do you have at least 10 million Won?

818
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,270
Yes, just tell me when you need it.

819
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,680
Good.

820
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,820
Listen carefully!

821
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:53,160
The ritual I am going to do tomorrow...
It's not your average ritual.

822
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:56,090
It is out-of-body.

823
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,500
The ritual is very dangerous...
and people have gone crazy from it.

824
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:02,100
No matter what happens you cannot interrupt it.

825
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:08,640
Be extra careful tomorrow, no visitors,
no eating and no drinking.

826
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:12,380
If you fail to follow my instructions
the results are on you.

827
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,080
Yes.

828
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,250
It's settled then.
Go home now.

829
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:30,660
I had something I wanted to ask you...

830
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,200
About?

831
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,470
About the Japanese man.

832
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:41,340
You said he was a ghost...

833
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:42,670
And?

834
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:45,740
How can a living man be a ghost?

835
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,610
It doesn't make sense...

836
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,950
That's because he's not a living man.

837
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:04,290
He's been dead for a long time now.

838
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:08,570
I'm sure he was a person at some point...

839
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:11,370
but he's not anymore...

840
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:20,580
Just takes over the body like a possession?

841
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,850
At first it was.

842
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:32,460
As long as you can breathe, speak and move...
you're among the living...

843
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,990
but precisely because of that...
 the village is overrun with dead bodies.

844
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:41,530
This ghost...

845
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:47,400
if it isn't stopped it will devour the entire village
and move on a wild ghost.

846
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,040
A wild ghost?

847
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:51,270
It's a wild ghost,

848
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:55,150
it can move and roam freely... they are the most malevolent.

849
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:07,290
Okay then why... why?
My daughter --

850
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:09,160
Your daughter possessed?

851
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,100
What could she possibly have done...

852
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,230
Yes...

853
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:21,440
When you go fishing,
do you always know what you're going drag out?

854
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:23,240
No.

855
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:27,650
This is ghost is just fishing...

856
01:26:27,774 --> 01:26:31,774
it doesn't know what it'll pull out either.

857
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:35,720
Threw out the bait

858
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:39,590
and your daughter just happened to notice it.

859
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:43,990
That's all there is to it!

860
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:54,540
<i>Park Chon Bae.</i>

861
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,630
This one?

862
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:16,430
Not this one?

863
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:17,490
No.

864
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,830
Pay.

865
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,630
Twenty-one thousand Won.

866
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:24,700
What are you?!

867
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,100
I would like this one.

868
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,570
...

869
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,650
I'm going to die!

870
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,740
Hyo Jin!

871
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:33,940
Darling! Darling!

872
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,490
Hyo Jin! Hyo Jin!

873
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:04,170
Hyo Jin! Hyo Jin!

874
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:45,270
Hyo Jin!

875
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:29,050
Stop it.. Make it stop...
Please...

876
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:31,850
Put an end to all of this!

877
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:37,330
Hyo Jin! Hyo Jin!

878
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:48,400
Daddy!... Daddy!...

879
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:58,010
Daddy!... Daddy!

880
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:04,820
Hyo Jin! Hyo Jin!

881
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,400
That's enough you bastards!

882
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:24,040
You bastard!

883
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,980
Stop it!

884
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:36,450
Enough of this!
 Stop before I start arresting you bastards!

885
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,190
Stop! Go!

886
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,590
Get out!

887
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:07,340
She's been like this since that night?

888
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:19,490
I think we should talk to the pastor.

889
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:27,500
Is everything you just told me the truth?

890
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,900
Yes.

891
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:40,310
From what that shaman told you...

892
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:42,980
the perspective for someone like him...

893
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:47,920
ghosts are spirits of people
who have died, right?

894
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:51,520
And yet the man is living...

895
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:56,590
I heard about him several times myself actually.

896
01:38:57,130 --> 01:39:00,200
Some say he is a well-known
university professor...

897
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,000
others say he is kind of scary.

898
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:05,800
I've also heard that he is a monk.

899
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:10,340
But all this...
It's just gossip.

900
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:11,010
How can you believe in --

901
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:15,010
Pastor, it's really not that simple.

902
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,320
Still insisting...

903
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:25,290
This spirit, have you seen it?

904
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:29,160
You didn't see this spirit...

905
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,830
so...how do you believe in it?

906
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:37,300
You need to go back to the hospital,
trust in the doctor,

907
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:40,240
don't listen to anyone else.

908
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:44,240
<i>The church can not offer any assistance.</i>

909
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,980
Come with me so we can go talk to him.

910
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:56,390
Whether he's a ghost or not...

911
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:59,320
I just really need to see it with my own eyes.

912
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:07,460
If he is a ghost...
Can he not die by my hands?

913
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:44,830
<i>Not everyone can do it.</i>

914
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:45,630
<i>What's up.</i>

915
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:46,970
Hey.

916
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:48,970
What did you call us in for
this early in the morning?

917
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:51,810
Hyeon Cheol is having a baby.
He couldn't come.

918
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:55,380
What happened to your face?!

919
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:17,800
You're not fucking around with me right?

920
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:22,740
You're serious?

921
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:25,270
Yes.

922
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:27,010
How far do we need to walk?

923
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:29,680
Dumb ass!

924
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,480
At times like this...
Idiot!

925
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:46,230
Let's go!

926
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:07,450
Did you look?

927
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:09,450
What are you doing just standing there?

928
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:10,790
Go look around!

929
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,240
What is that?

930
01:43:00,570 --> 01:43:02,970
Park Chon Bae,
this piece of shit!

931
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:10,180
<i>Jong Goo! Jong Goo!
Jong Goo!</i>

932
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:11,650
You found him?

933
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,250
That way!

934
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:14,320
You guys follow me!

935
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:16,320
Where?

936
01:43:23,390 --> 01:43:25,130
What is that??

937
01:43:25,130 --> 01:43:26,730
What is it?

938
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:31,930
Shit!

939
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:36,470
Stay back!
Stay back!

940
01:43:59,830 --> 01:44:02,500
Hey! Hey! That's enough!

941
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:04,500
What are you trying to kill him?

942
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:08,370
Sorry about that!

943
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:20,780
What are you doing?!

944
01:44:21,450 --> 01:44:24,250
Stop! Stop!

945
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:25,850
Let go of the stick!

946
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:27,190
Yi San!

947
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:47,600
<i>Abeoji!</i>

948
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,940
There's someone over there...

949
01:47:08,950 --> 01:47:10,420
That's him!

950
01:47:12,150 --> 01:47:14,560
Get him!

951
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,960
Where are you going!

952
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:22,830
Bastard!

953
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:25,230
Don't lose him!

954
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:30,510
Son of a bitch!

955
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,650
There!

956
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:46,380
What is it?

957
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:48,380
Why'd we stop?

958
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:50,250
What the...

959
01:48:51,050 --> 01:48:52,920
Look here!

960
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:02,800
Where?

961
01:49:04,930 --> 01:49:08,270
Hey! Hey!

962
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:09,740
Hey!

963
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:11,070
<i>Hey!</i>

964
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,740
<i>Hey, Jong Goo!</i>

965
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:21,620
I gotta' catch him...

966
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:35,100
I have to save Hyo jin,

967
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,570
Hyo Jin...

968
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:38,970
He must be caught so
that Hyo Jin can be saved.

969
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:44,840
Stop it with that.

970
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:48,840
Hyeon Gi... Hyeon Gi...
I have to save Hyo Jin.

971
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:50,710
Yes.

972
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:59,390
I have to save Hyo Jin!

973
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:06,860
I have to catch that bastard!

974
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:09,000
Don't cry you son of a bitch.

975
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:24,870
Answer the phone...

976
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:03,970
What is it? Shit!

977
01:53:03,970 --> 01:53:05,710
Was it a person?

978
01:55:56,540 --> 01:56:02,950
The fool has taken the bait...

979
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,470
Are you okay baby?

980
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:06,250
You're okay?

981
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:11,950
Come here!

982
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,570
Doesn't hurt anymore?

983
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:52,660
Drink this.
Good.

984
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,490
Just leave it as it is.

985
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,100
Because it's too messy.

986
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:28,830
Leave it be.

987
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:31,100
All of this because of that man.

988
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:34,570
Go and rest,
you must be tired.

989
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,650
Completely clueless...

990
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:33,730
She's the owner of the house.

991
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:37,170
It looks like he's on some drugs.

992
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:39,970
It's got everyone all worked up.

993
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:43,300
They're going to take him away.

994
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:45,570
He needs a lawyer,

995
01:59:45,570 --> 01:59:47,580
get everything prepared.

996
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:49,310
I guess you could say...

997
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:52,650
Samchon is the victim here...

998
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:24,550

Don't ask me any questions and go to your daughter now.

02:04:46,940 --> 02:04:51,480
You.. I'm telling you to go straight home!

1017
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,550
Enough already,

1018
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:54,950
just tell me what you'tr going to tell me.

1019
02:04:57,080 --> 02:05:01,890
I... I made a mistake...

1020
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:03,620
<i>All of it...</i>

1021
02:05:04,690 --> 02:05:06,690
It's the wrong person.

1022
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:09,760
What are you talking about?

1023
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:13,500
I was just there to tell you in person,

1024
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:17,240
in front of your house I saw a woman...

1025
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:18,310
I...

1026
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:21,240
I made a big mistake!

1027
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:28,980
It's not the Japanese guy,

1028
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:31,250
the woman is the ghost!

1029
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:33,650
She's causing all of this!

1030
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:35,660
So you need to get home right now!

1031
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:37,660
I'm also on my way there.

1032
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:42,730
Then...
What about the Japanese guy?

1033
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,730
He was trying to catch her and kill her,

1034
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:50,870
trying to save all the people that bitch was killing.

1035
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:55,140
That Japanese man,

1036
02:05:56,610 --> 02:05:58,880
is like me, a shaman!

1037
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:09,820
Tell me, was that woman wearing white?

1038
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:15,160
Yes.
So you've seen her...

1039
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:21,570
She's a young girl right?

1040
02:06:21,970 --> 02:06:24,640
That's right.

1041
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:39,720
(Praying.)

1042
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:05,210
Where's my daughter?

1043
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:09,750
Where is Hyo Jin!

1044
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:06,340
Hyo Jin!

1045
02:08:15,950 --> 02:08:17,150
What the?

1046
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:23,160
Where are you going in the middle of the night?

1047
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:36,240
Where are you going right now?

1048
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:39,570
Where is my daughter?

1049
02:08:41,580 --> 02:08:43,710
Where is my daughter?

1050
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:50,120
About this tall?

1051
02:08:57,860 --> 02:08:59,190
Hyo Jin?

1052
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:05,330
It's because that ghost seduced her.

1053
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:09,870
Halmeoni said that stranger is a ghost,

1054
02:09:10,670 --> 02:09:12,270
that man abused her...

1055
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:14,140
Stop with the bullshit!

1056
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:17,340
Tell me you bitch!

1057
02:09:17,610 --> 02:09:19,210
Where is Hyo Jin?

1058
02:09:20,550 --> 02:09:21,750
That stranger is --

1059
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:24,290
I asked you where Hyo Jin is!

1060
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:27,090
Your child is at your house. Where else.

1061
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:28,290
She's not home.

1062
02:09:28,290 --> 02:09:29,890
She's there.

1063
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,830
I just saw her.

1064
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:39,900
Don't go home...

1065
02:09:40,970 --> 02:09:42,970
If you go home everyone will die.

1066
02:09:42,970 --> 02:09:46,040
If you go home now everyone in your family will die!

1067
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:55,920
What are you saying?

1068
02:10:18,210 --> 02:10:21,680
That stranger is waiting for you to come home.

1069
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:25,550
Using your family as bait.

1070
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:29,550
He died already...

1071
02:10:29,550 --> 02:10:31,150
He's not dead.

1072
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:35,690
He's not something that dies.

1073
02:10:38,890 --> 02:10:40,490
Very soon now,

1074
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:43,030
a ghost will enter your house.

1075
02:10:45,030 --> 02:10:47,170
You saw the ghost I'm talking about right?

1076
02:10:49,170 --> 02:10:53,040
Didn't you see it behind that woman's house?

1077
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:01,050
It was a dream.

1078
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:03,320
Not a dream.

1079
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:41,360
I set a trap... Just wait until he's caught.

1080
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,490
That's all you have to do.

1081
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:50,700
You... what are you?

1082
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:56,300
A person or a ghost?

1083
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:58,840
Why do you ask?

1084
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:00,840
I have to know.

1085
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:03,780
If I'm going to trust you...

1086
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:05,650
Just believe it.

1087
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:07,510
If you want to save your family.

1088
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:09,650
What are you?!

1089
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:28,070
Just trying to save your daughter, I am just some...

1090
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:32,470
woman.

1091
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:38,880
I called Mi Sook, she didn't come by.

1092
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:46,490
Hyo Jin! Hyo Jin!

1093
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:52,890
What the...

1094
02:13:07,310 --> 02:13:10,640
When is that ghost coming?

1095
02:13:12,110 --> 02:13:13,980
He's already there.

1096
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:25,990
Hyo Jin.

1097
02:13:26,930 --> 02:13:28,260
He's already there?

1098
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:42,540
I want to ask you something...

1099
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:48,680
What... Are you?

1100
02:14:31,390 --> 02:14:34,060
What do you think?

1101
02:14:34,060 --> 02:14:35,530
Devil.

1102
02:14:36,460 --> 02:14:38,330
You are the devil.

1103
02:14:42,070 --> 02:14:43,940
Aren't you going to say something?

1104
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:46,340
I don't know what to say,

1105
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,680
you just told me I'm the devil.

1106
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:54,750
(Il Gwang.)

1107
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:05,560
I'm getting close,

1108
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:07,690
Where are you? You're at home right?

1109
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:12,100
I'm with her...

1110
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:15,600
Do not... DO NOT!

1111
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:18,540
Listen to anything she tells you.

1112
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:22,240
No matter what she says you have to go home to your daughter right now.

1113
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:24,240
Do you understand me?

1114
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:29,320
Do you understand!

1115
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:34,520
Is it that monk?

1116
02:15:39,190 --> 02:15:41,200
You can't trust him.

1117
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
He's just a pawn.

1118
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,600
Is that so?

1119
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:51,870
You think I am the devil now...

1120
02:15:52,810 --> 02:15:55,210
And that is why you came here,

1121
02:15:55,340 --> 02:15:57,340
carrying that...

1122
02:16:06,690 --> 02:16:08,820
It doesn't matter what I say,

1123
02:16:09,490 --> 02:16:11,890
I'm just a stranger here and people can't accept me,

1124
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:14,290
things will never change...

1125
02:16:14,290 --> 02:16:15,230
No,

1126
02:16:16,270 --> 02:16:18,100
that's not what this is...

1127
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:20,640
That's what you say but we both know it's true,

1128
02:16:20,864 --> 02:16:26,664
<i>you've come here to kill me
and you're calling me the devil, isn't that --</i>

1129
02:16:27,140 --> 02:16:28,610
Enough!

1130
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:32,580
If...

1131
02:16:32,710 --> 02:16:36,980
If you're not devil then

1132
02:16:37,650 --> 02:16:40,320
just tell me who you are,

1133
02:16:42,590 --> 02:16:44,730
tell me that
and I'll leave here without doing anything...

1134
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:49,660
When the ghost is caught in the trap,

1135
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:54,330
You will hear a rooster crow 3 times...

1136
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:59,140
Just be patient until then.

1137
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:09,020
So you won't do anything to me

1138
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:11,020
and you'll just leave?

1139
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:13,950
That's right.

1140
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:20,630
You have two left.

1141
02:17:25,430 --> 02:17:27,300
Don't waver.

1142
02:17:31,570 --> 02:17:33,710
You'll go home without doing anything to me?

1143
02:17:33,970 --> 02:17:38,110
That's right,
I'll go home without doing anything...

1144
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,870
<i>Who says I'm going to let you go?</i>

1145
02:18:06,270 --> 02:18:07,740
Well...

1146
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:10,680
I just want to know one thing...

1147
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:11,750
What?

1148
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:13,210
All of this, why?

1149
02:18:14,150 --> 02:18:16,680
Why is all of this happening?!

1150
02:18:17,220 --> 02:18:21,360
The father of the daughter did something wrong...

1151
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:23,620
What?

1152
02:18:25,230 --> 02:18:27,360
What did I do?!

1153
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:34,170
The father of the daughter sinned,
he has even tried to kill.

1154
02:18:34,570 --> 02:18:36,840
And he has killed...

1155
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:38,700
It's because...

1156
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:41,780
My daughter...

1157
02:18:42,710 --> 02:18:48,050
My daughter... My daughter...
It was because she got so sick!

1158
02:18:48,050 --> 02:18:50,050
What was I supposed to do?!

1159
02:18:57,790 --> 02:18:59,130
What am I supposed to?

1160
02:18:59,130 --> 02:19:03,000
Now, one left.

1161
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:12,740
What was I supposed to...

1162
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:35,030
Don't go.

1163
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:38,770
What do you mean?

1164
02:19:39,970 --> 02:19:43,700
What you perceive to be that is flesh and bone,

1165
02:19:52,910 --> 02:19:55,320
<i>go ahead, touch it!</i>

1166
02:19:59,590 --> 02:20:04,260
A ghost cannot be flesh or bone,

1167
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:07,430
but as you can clearly see...

1168
02:20:10,030 --> 02:20:13,730
This one is!

1169
02:20:40,830 --> 02:20:44,970
No. It's not...

1170
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:48,700
It's you...

1171
02:20:48,970 --> 02:20:50,300
No.

1172
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:52,570
<i>Is it really you doing all this?!</i>

1173
02:20:57,640 --> 02:20:58,580
Don't go!

1174
02:20:58,580 --> 02:21:00,450
Hyo Jin...

1175
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:03,520
Don't go.

1176
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:04,720
Hyo Jin!

1177
02:21:05,390 --> 02:21:08,590
DON'T GO!

1178
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:20,600
What are you doing?

1179
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:23,940
What are you?

1180
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:26,610
<i>Why would you be afraid?</i>

1181
02:21:51,970 --> 02:21:54,370
Hyo Jin!

1182

<i>Why is there still doubt in your heart?</i>

1193

<i>You know if daddy is a cop, right?</i>

1200
02:29:52,850 --> 02:29:58,450
<i>Daddy will figure it all out.</i>
