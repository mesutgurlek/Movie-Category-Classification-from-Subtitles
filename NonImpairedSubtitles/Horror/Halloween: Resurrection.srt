1
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,359
You've heard of the tunnel.

2
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,376
The one we all go through
sooner or later.

3
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,772
At the end, there's a door.

4
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,581
And waiting for you on
the other side of that door...

5
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,350
is either heaven...

6
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,448
or hell.

7
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,591
This is that door.

8
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,782
Why is this patient
in lockdown?

9
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,582
They didn't tell you
about Laurie Strode?

10
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,781
No.

11
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,257
You must have heard of her.
Sister of Michael Myers?

12
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,556
Michael Myers,
the serial killer?

13
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,392
Well, you'll hear
all the gossip soon enough.

14
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,488
For now, let's just get...

15
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,193
No, no, no, wait.
Tell me about her.

16
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,798
She decapitated a man.

17
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,064
Aah!

18
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,039
Oh, my God. Why?

19
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:36,343
Halloween.
Three years ago.

20
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,407
Twenty years after
the first murders...

21
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,544
her brother finally found her.

22
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,920
Tracked her down to the school
where she was working.

23
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,958
There were several murders.

24
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,994
Lots of confusion.

25
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,146
Guys, over here!

26
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,854
Oh, my God.
She killed the wrong person.

27
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,457
Unh!

28
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,433
Father of three.

29
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,099
Why didn't the paramedic
say something?

30
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:49,249
His larynx had been crushed.

31
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,813
Don't let on you know.

32
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,495
Hello, Miss Strode.
Did you enjoy your dinner?

33
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,627
She hasn't said a word in years.

34
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,538
Extreme disassociative disorder.

35
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:12,169
The doctors think
she's a suicide threat.

36
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,442
They found her up
on the roof more than once.

37
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,850
Must be the guilt.

38
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,481
Now all she does
is stare out that window.

39
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,354
God knows
what she sees out there.

40
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,559
Hello?

41
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,064
Anyone out there?

42
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,913
Boooo!

43
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,684
- Holy shit!
- Ha ha ha!

44
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,259
Harold, are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

45
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,850
No.

46
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,759
How the hell
did you get out again?

47
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,265
And who are you
supposed to be today?

48
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,064
Oh. John Wayne Gacy.

49
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,332
Born in Chicago, Illinois,
on March 17, 1942.

50
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,340
Come on, big guy.

51
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,842
Killed 33 people.
Buried them under his house.

52
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,173
I know, Harold.

53
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,839
- He was executed on May 7...
- I know, Harold.

54
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,211
Willie, I'm not trying
to criticize your work...

55
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,518
but if you put Harold
in his room...

56
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,581
how come I see him
in the basement?

57
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,594
L... But just
two seconds ago, he was...

58
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,891
Come on. Let's go get him.

59
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,762
How many times
do I have to tell you?

60
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,927
You gotta be sure
what you're doing.

61
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,552
Willie?
What are you doing?

62
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,593
I skipped dinner.

63
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,186
- Hurry up.
- OK.

64
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,695
Harold?

65
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,404
Harold,
what are you doing down here?

66
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,508
What's gotten into you?

67
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,252
Aah! Aah!

68
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,187
Aah! Unh!

69
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,659
Aah!

70
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,845
Hmm. Ted Bundy.

71
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,378
Born November 24, 19...

72
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,629
Hello, Michael.

73
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,726
I knew you'd come for me
sooner or later.

74
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,092
What took you so long?

75
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,637
You failed, Michael.

76
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,043
You want to know why?

77
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,252
Because I'm not afraid of you.

78
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,223
But what about you?

79
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,994
Are you afraid of me?

80
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,598
Are you afraid to die, Michael?

81
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,302
I just have to be sure.

82
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,161
Unh! Unh!

83
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,221
Aah!

84
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,857
Aah!

85
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,061
Aah!

86
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,264
Aah!

87
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,420
I'll see you in hell.

88
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,908
Michael Myers.

89
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:51,473
Born October 19, 1957.

90
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:56,181
Killed his older sister,
October 31, 1963.

91
00:15:56,255 --> 00:16:01,124
Killed 3 high school students,
October 31, 1978.

92
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:05,630
Also killed three nurses
and a paramedic, same night.

93
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,960
Was believed to be dead,
then killed four students...

94
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,095
Was believed to be dead,
then killed four students...

95
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,639
Hillcrest Academy, 1998.

96
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:19,144
Has been missing, unheard of,
last three years.

97
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,477
Now he's back.

98
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,274
Carl Jung tells us...

99
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,174
that the human psyche
contains...

100
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,609
a figment of ourselves...

101
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,048
that even the collective
unconscious denies.

102
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,108
Good morning, Paul.
It's nice to see you in class.

103
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,880
Am I keeping you up?

104
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,752
What do I mean by all this,
people?

105
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,156
I mean that inside all of us...

106
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,596
there lurks
a dark, malevolent figure.

107
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:17,260
A kind of boogeyman,
if you will...

108
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,998
that Jung called what?

109
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,801
Stick with me, people.

110
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,604
Take that Kierkegaardian
leap of faith.

111
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,682
Jung said we must
face down our fears...

112
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,812
and face up to the figure
he called... what?

113
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,951
- The shadow.
- The shadow.

114
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,254
Yes, Sara, very good.
Thank you.

115
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,227
I'm glad somebody was awake.
Wow, what a class.

116
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,929
Hey, Sara!

117
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,595
Sara, wait up!

118
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,536
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

119
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,939
Guess what?

120
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,706
Uh-uh. What did you
sign us up for this time?

121
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,748
Eee, ha ha!
We gotta find Rudy. Come on.

122
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,625
Hey, Rudy.

123
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,394
Don't distract me.

124
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,629
I can't help myself.

125
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,434
I am distracting.

126
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,099
Have you checked your email?

127
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,473
No.

128
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,239
Why?
Did you send me something?

129
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,146
We're in!
They picked all three of us!

130
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,117
- What? Are you serious?
- Uh-huh!

131
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,985
Oh, God! Yes!

132
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,421
All right. That is all good.

133
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,959
This isn't one of
your little jokes, is it?

134
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,325
No, but Sara doesn't want to go.

135
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,296
I might go.
I just haven't decided yet.

136
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,129
No, no, no.
That is unacceptable.

137
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,260
It is unacceptable.

138
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,430
We're gonna be bigger
than "The Osbournes."

139
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,303
We're gonna be large.

140
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,467
Every time I let you two
talk me into something...

141
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,874
I live to regret it.

142
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,708
Listen, without me,
you would die of boredom.

143
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,477
Us! Without us,
you would die of boredom.

144
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,418
Whatever.

145
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,223
Are you sure they're not
just putting us in some house...

146
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,350
with hidden cameras
in the shower?

147
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,428
No.

148
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,724
It's like we're
investigative reporters...

149
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,231
searching a crime scene.

150
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,857
And look at the scholarship.

151
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,799
Yeah.

152
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,464
Besides that,
thousands of people...

153
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,008
are going to see my face...

154
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,703
our face.

155
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,469
Don't do it.

156
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,778
That's the house
where it all started.

157
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:48,877
He walked its hallways,
hid in its closets...

158
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,216
dreamed in its bedrooms...

159
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,483
helped his mother
in the kitchen...

160
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,287
watched TV in the living room
with his dad...

161
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,857
played in his sister's bedroom.

162
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,726
Then one day,
he picked up a knife...

163
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,431
and he never put it down again.

164
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,479
That guy's fucking weird.

165
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,218
Don't pay attention to him.
He's trying to scare us.

166
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,817
I just need to send
a quick email.

167
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,632
"Deckard...

168
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,262
"you'll never believe
what I got myself into."

169
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,171
Deckard? Who's Deckard?

170
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,870
Oh, it's my screen name.

171
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,777
Sara needed some tech support
setting up her offline reader...

172
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,041
so I, uh...

173
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,346
You told her
you're a graduate student?

174
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,445
- Graduate of what, junior high?
- Shut up, all right?

175
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,514
We talk every day.
It's kind of like we're dating.

176
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,059
She's never even seen you...

177
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,061
and Yahoo chat rooms
do not count.

178
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,030
Yes, they do count.
Did you know in the old days...

179
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,794
knights used to spend
their entire lives...

180
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,732
courting ladies that
they would never even touch?

181
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:14,169
They would just send
each other sonnets and stuff.

182
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,208
That's before
internet porn, man.

183
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,574
Whatever.

184
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,340
Now what are you doing?

185
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,005
Just give me a second,
all right?

186
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,030
I hope Sara shows up.

187
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,259
And wearing
something acceptable.

188
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,701
She can't still be mad at us
for the last time.

189
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:49,138
Here she is. Hey!

190
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,107
OK, everybody listen up!

191
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,838
Sara, are you gonna wear this?

192
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,211
I thought I told you
we were gonna be on camera.

193
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:01,652
I'd like to start this off
by saying the search is over.

194
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,018
You six have been selected...

195
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,819
to explore
America's worst nightmare...

196
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,985
tomorrow night, Halloween...

197
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,086
live, in front of the whole
entire internet universe.

198
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,428
You six will enter
the birthplace of evil...

199
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,865
in its purest form...

200
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,496
the childhood home of
our most brutal mass murderer...

201
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,064
Michael Myers.

202
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:29,475
Thank you. Thank you.

203
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,210
So, what do you hope to find
in the house tomorrow night?

204
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,445
My way into
network broadcasting.

205
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,679
Pfft!

206
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,688
I just want to say
that Michael Myers...

207
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,384
is not just
a man behind a mask...

208
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,618
he's a legend.

209
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,093
I'm interested
in how Michael Myers...

210
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,392
embodies
the politics of violence...

211
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,160
embedded in pop mythology.

212
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,999
Never underestimate
the effect of a poor diet.

213
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,163
Too much protein, not enough
zinc, next thing you know...

214
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,365
you're cutting up bodies
in your bathtub.

215
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,034
Look at Hitler.
He was a vegetarian.

216
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,169
The brother
was seriously malnourished.

217
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,214
You don't have to go far
to find Michael Myers.

218
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,944
He is the great white shark
of our unconscious.

219
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,852
He is the dark-eyed child
of our spirits.

220
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,515
He's every murderous impulse
we've ever had.

221
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,059
He's the little voice
that whispers to us...

222
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,458
to strangle the old lady...

223
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,257
taking too long
at the checkout counter.

224
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,695
Get to know him, baby.

225
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,394
He's you.

226
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:27,199
Tell us, Sara, why do
ordinary people turn to murder?

227
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,469
Well, I, um...

228
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,205
I think it has something
to do with upbringing.

229
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,679
Aah!

230
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,376
Damn! That girl can sing.

231
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:46,522
That's what
I'm looking for. Ooh.

232
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,583
Ha! Hunh!

233
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,787
Hyah!

234
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,127
Get his ass! Get his ass!
Get his ass!

235
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,469
Who's better than Wat Chun Lee?

236
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,937
Whoopin' everybody ass
while he's smokin' a cigarette.

237
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,266
Oh, shit. Who's knockin'
on my door this late?

238
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,675
Whoever this is
is distracting me...

239
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,681
from seeing Wat Chun Lee
whoop some ass.

240
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,309
Sara? Ooh.

241
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,050
Sara, what are you doing here?
It's late.

242
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,749
I'm dropping out.

243
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,291
What?

244
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,723
I'm sorry.

245
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,421
It's just I'm so freaked out
I can't even sleep.

246
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,464
Slow down, slow down.
What's the problem?

247
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,865
Can't you see
I'm not like the others?

248
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,995
I know
you're not like the others.

249
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,834
You know
you're not like the others.

250
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,771
The others ain't nothin'
but a bunch...

251
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,606
of smart-ass, wise-crackin',
posin' wannabes.

252
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,010
You are the real deal.

253
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,310
Every existing element
about you...

254
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,477
is what the internet audience
really wants.

255
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,247
I don't want to be famous.

256
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,255
What do you mean
you don't want to be famous?

257
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,019
That's the American dream.

258
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,253
I think I'm just scared.

259
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,659
It's OK to be scared.

260
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,823
Being scared is good.
Fear is good.

261
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,196
Fear motivates.

262
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,862
Fear gives you
the feeling of being alive.

263
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,199
Fear makes me want to throw up.

264
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,172
Trust me, please.

265
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,072
When it's all said and done,
at the end of the day...

266
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,633
you'd be surprised of
how much you surprise yourself.

267
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,374
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just...

268
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,008
It's OK. Do me a favor.
Sleep on it.

269
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,985
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
You can sweat it tonight, man.

270
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,613
Now take your tail on outta here
and go to bed.

271
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,958
Ol' Freddie boy, damn, you good.

272
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,825
Shit you come up with
off the top of your head, boy.

273
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,664
Why don't you just
pat yourself on your back?

274
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,999
Oh, Wat Chun Lee! Oh!

275
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,346
Now, are you coming out soon...

276
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,974
or are you
planning on subletting?

277
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:58,886
Mmm! Sexy girl! Ha ha!

278
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,982
Don't you think
it's a bit too revealing?

279
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:04,220
I think
it's perfectly revealing.

280
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,455
Aah!

281
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,092
What?

282
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,199
Are you OK?

283
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,601
Did you see the
boogeyman or something?

284
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:17,438
The boogeyman?
How very Jungian.

285
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,070
Dr. Mixter's class?
I'm taking that course, too.

286
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,171
I hope they have this in black.

287
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,479
- Thrift stores.
- Oh, how marvelous, darling.

288
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,715
Ahh, there she is.

289
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,052
Oh, my God,
you've been pussy-whipped.

290
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,422
What's worse,
you've been cyber-whipped.

291
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,051
By the way,
where's your costume?

292
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,653
I can't go out tonight.

293
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,664
I promised Sara
I would watch her first episode.

294
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,394
She's really nervous about it.

295
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:47,905
No, Mickey Stern's party
is tonight, and you know that.

296
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:51,101
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, man.
I guess I forgot.

297
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,872
Forgot?
Do you have any idea...

298
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,810
what it means for
two freshmen to get invited?

299
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,404
It's never happened before!

300
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,575
Your sister invited us...

301
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,709
so you wouldn't tell
your mother about her tattoo.

302
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,276
That's besides the point,
Myles Barton.

303
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,119
You can sit here in your little
dream fantasy world...

304
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,126
or you can come with me
to this party...

305
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,957
and learn to walk like a man.

306
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,996
What's it gonna be?

307
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,101
All right, let's go.

308
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,365
Ahh, chat room romance?

309
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,269
He's just a friend.

310
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,002
He's probably fifty and bald,
with a bad toupee.

311
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:30,173
- Jen.
- Probably collects human skin.

312
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,943
Give me a break, Jen.

313
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,575
OK, everybody listen up.

314
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,449
I'd like to start off
by saying...

315
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,249
the home that
you will be entering tonight...

316
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,846
has been rigged up
with several cameras...

317
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,151
but for the most part...

318
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:44,491
the audience will see
only what you see.

319
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,688
See these cameras right here?

320
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,288
I kinda like these cameras.

321
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,801
They can pretty much be
clipped on to anything.

322
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,997
A hat, shirt collar,
your coat collar.

323
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,733
The viewers
can pretty much control...

324
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,004
what they want to watch...

325
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,444
switch around
from camera to camera...

326
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,244
depending on what seems to be
the most intriguing to them.

327
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,480
So if you guys want
to be stars for the night...

328
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,522
I suggest you do something
that is very interesting...

329
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,682
so that it's worth the while
of the viewers...

330
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,319
to want to keep
their cameras on you.

331
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,829
Cameras are so phallic.

332
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,093
Is that good or bad?

333
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,657
Depends who's watching.

334
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:47,486
Hey, Orson Welles,
pick a placement and move on.

335
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,721
Look, low angles... scary.

336
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,528
High angles... scary.

337
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:00,298
Medium angles... boring.

338
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,633
I bet you learned that
shooting...

339
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,264
all those weddings
and bar mitzvahs.

340
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,740
Hey, hey!

341
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,711
I went to Long Beach State.
Same as Spielberg.

342
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,873
Charley,
we're on a schedule here.

343
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,247
Tell Max to rig a camera
in the sister's room.

344
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,378
Max is back at the hotel
helping Freddie.

345
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,479
OK.

346
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,009
Freddie!

347
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,343
Baby, calm down.
It's all good. Just relax.

348
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,508
I got it all under control.

349
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,680
There was this Firebird
parked in front of the house.

350
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,120
Totally about to ruin
the establishing shot...

351
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,420
but I called a tow truck.

352
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,118
Yep, it's on its way.

353
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,662
All righty. Bye.

354
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,334
Look at you, Charley.
That's a nice angle, boy.

355
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,604
Look, there he is now.

356
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,837
All right, here we go.

357
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,243
Mr. Harris!

358
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,281
Can we ask you
a few questions, Mr. Harris?

359
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,681
- Right over here.
- I got one word for you.

360
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,184
- What's that?
- Product placement.

361
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,379
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

362
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,513
Product placement,
I like the sound of that.

363
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,420
While we're going
around the house...

364
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,186
discovering the secrets
of Michael Myers...

365
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:40,560
we could be drinking Pepsi
or sporting The Gap, right?

366
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:45,535
Nice sexy thinking.
I kind of like that.

367
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,127
How's everyone doing
this evening?

368
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,230
We'll get it started
like this, see?

369
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,797
In the next ten minutes...

370
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,137
we are going to enter
a mystery...

371
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,440
wrapped up inside of a riddle
inside of an enigma.

372
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,777
Now, remember this.
Everything you see...

373
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,716
absolutely everything
you see is real.

374
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,582
There's no actors...

375
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,713
none of the components
or contents in the house...

376
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,723
have been messed with,
mixed up, diluted...

377
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:10,750
or tampered with in any shape,
form, or fashion whatsoever.

378
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,558
Now, I'm not exactly sure
what's gonna happen...

379
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,566
but what I do know is
that no one will be allowed...

380
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,625
to leave
until the show is over.

381
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,570
Our state-of-the-art
camera surveillance system...

382
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,903
will pick up
anyone who tries to sneak out.

383
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,175
Let the Dangertainment begin
out this motherfucker.

384
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,517
Well, people, let's do it.

385
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,436
Rudy!

386
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:09,752
Way to go.
This is gonna be fun.

387
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,609
I read that
after the murders...

388
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,940
the family
just sealed it up...

389
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,504
and left without
taking anything with them.

390
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:41,541
It's not exactly
a house you put on the market.

391
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,211
Yeah, but I'll bet it has...

392
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,188
one of those big nice
old kitchens, you know?

393
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,284
Where are you going?

394
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,884
I'm gonna check it out.

395
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,896
What are we gonna do?

396
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,899
We don't have to do anything.

397
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,366
Technically,
we just have to be in the house.

398
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,700
Aren't we supposed
to be looking for answers?

399
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,536
The devil made him do it.
I'm done.

400
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,876
We owe it
to the people watching...

401
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:10,311
to at least take a look around.

402
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,712
Oh, that's cute.

403
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,513
You're already worried
about your fan base?

404
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,722
You are this close
to getting voted off the island.

405
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,130
Hey, check this out.

406
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,360
You want something
tasty and delicious?

407
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,236
You ever tasted
forty-year-old fennel?

408
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,502
Eww, don't.
It's got to be rotten.

409
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,566
- That's strange.
- What?

410
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,307
- It smells fresh.
- Yeah, it does.

411
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,576
You know, Donna,
you got great legs.

412
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,281
What time do they open?

413
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,090
That'd be 1:00?

414
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,758
God damn.

415
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,923
Sara.

416
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,665
You think this is the one
that he used to do his thing?

417
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,936
No. They'd keep that in
an evidence locker somewhere.

418
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,374
Whew.

419
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,881
- Boo.
- Aah!

420
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,288
- What, are you scared?
- No.

421
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,757
What's in here?

422
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,760
What is that?

423
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,204
OK, so I admit...

424
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,505
that this place
is a little creepy, OK?

425
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,808
No, no, no.
You have no idea.

426
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,373
- Look at this.
- Wow, a chair.

427
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,679
My God.

428
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,744
Do you think they actually
kept him in this?

429
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,717
What is that?

430
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,658
Looks like the medieval key
to Sara's chastity belt.

431
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,992
- Rudy!
- OK, yeah.

432
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,964
Maybe we should
poke around a bit...

433
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,466
see what else we can find.

434
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,732
Ha! Aye-aye, captain.

435
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:18,235
Why are you touching me?

436
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,901
Don't.

437
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,476
Go poke.

438
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,307
Hey, what's going on?

439
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,077
Sexy.

440
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,815
Look at you!

441
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,215
Scott, what are we doing here?

442
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,955
Hey, come on, man,
be cool, all right?

443
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,896
Relax. Have fun. Shit.

444
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,767
Hey, Myles,
do you think anyone will know...

445
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,132
we're supposed to be
from "Pulp Fiction"?

446
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,055
- Huhh!
- Huhh!

447
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,703
Today, you're scared of
the boogeyman.

448
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,636
Ha ha ha!

449
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,164
He's gonna get you.
He's coming behind you.

450
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,608
Boogeyman!

451
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,158
Ohh! Shit!

452
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,170
Careful, Jen.

453
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,002
Ahem. Hands off, bud.

454
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,421
Bet this is Judith's room.

455
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,988
You know, the older sister.

456
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,433
The one he killed
when he was six years old.

457
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:10,406
Hey! Keep the camera
on the money here.

458
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:13,272
I think it happened
when she was right there.

459
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,443
Poor little Judith...

460
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,449
helpless...

461
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,782
brushing her hair...

462
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:26,550
young... and naked.

463
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,226
Yeah, because
that's gonna happen, right?

464
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,261
Come on, Jen.

465
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,058
One flash,
and you could light up...

466
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,998
a thousand computer screens.

467
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,762
Launch your whole career.

468
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,477
You think?

469
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,507
You crack me up.

470
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,508
It's a good wardrobe
for you, Jen.

471
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,456
Wait! No! There was
somebody else in the hall!

472
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,631
Come on.

473
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,644
Come on, lover boy.

474
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,306
- Whoa!
- Aah!

475
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,546
What are you doing,
you big perv?

476
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,020
They're exploring the house
of a mass murderer... live.

477
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,215
You want to watch?

478
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,190
- No way.
- Sure.

479
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,884
Oh, OK.

480
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,586
Impulse control disorder.

481
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,390
Huh?

482
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,261
That's my theory.

483
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:20,133
I think Michael Myers
had fits of rage...

484
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,729
that he could not control.

485
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:28,711
Kind of like a klepto
or a nympho or a pyro.

486
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,042
So, instead of
stealing silverware...

487
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,485
he slashes the necks
of teenage girls, huh?

488
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,080
Oh, come on...

489
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,593
haven't you ever had an impulse
that you could not control?

490
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:47,095
- Continuously.
- You mean continually.

491
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,598
"Continuous" means
continuing uninterrupted...

492
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,693
while "continual" means
reoccurring periodically.

493
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,604
Donna, when are you gonna
get out of your head...

494
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,073
and start thinking
with your body?

495
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,167
Please.

496
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,768
Does that line
ever actually work...

497
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,540
on the chicks
in the music department?

498
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:07,277
Art history, too.
Sometimes even poli sci.

499
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,946
Well, it doesn't cut it
with critical studies.

500
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,180
Bummer.

501
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,156
Besides,
screwing a music major...

502
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,492
would be tantamount
to lesbianism.

503
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,088
I could get into that.

504
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,838
Sara, I'm telling you,
it's in the food.

505
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,604
Remember that guy
who was on trial...

506
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,076
for murder in San Francisco?

507
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,612
All he ate was Twinkies.

508
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,013
Rudy, do you ever think about
anything other than food?

509
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,779
Wouldn't you like to know?

510
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,982
Jen?

511
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,363
Jen?

512
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,556
What's going on?

513
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:55,996
- What happened?
- I don't know.

514
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,727
I turned my back for a second
and she was gone.

515
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,995
Jen!

516
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,661
Jen?

517
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,004
Jen?

518
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,673
Jen.

519
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,344
Jen?

520
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,055
Jen?

521
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:26,521
Jen?

522
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,131
Turn it down!

523
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,297
- Gotcha!
- God, you bitch.

524
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,533
Slut!

525
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,135
That's not right, OK?
You're foul.

526
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,179
Uhh, so foul.

527
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:47,946
This is to us,
for successfully...

528
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,680
let me give you
a little more...

529
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,687
puttin' together
something collectively...

530
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,781
so ingenious
as a team and a duo...

531
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,122
that we should definitely
be able to secure...

532
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,161
a lot of food on the table
for ourselves...

533
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,493
as long as everything
goes as nicely...

534
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,998
as it's goin' right now.

535
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:13,072
I'm gonna get her back
for that.

536
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,303
Watch me.

537
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:19,008
Oh, my God!

538
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,641
Cheers.

539
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,318
Oh, no! No!

540
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:32,689
Mm. Mm.

541
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,195
Wait, what just happened?

542
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,665
- We just lost Bill's camera.
- Oh, shit.

543
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,601
He must've dropped it.
Fucking idiot.

544
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,263
Find another view quickly,
please.

545
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,170
Freddie, relax.

546
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,141
I think
this is going really well.

547
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,144
- Really, baby?
- Yes.

548
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,804
We are doing our thing.

549
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,040
OK.

550
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,413
To Dangertainment.

551
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,419
Salute. Heh heh heh.

552
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,753
And this must be the bed
where he was conceived.

553
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,054
Stop showing off, Jen.

554
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:30,918
Aaaah!

555
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,455
Aaaah!

556
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,320
Rudy!

557
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,222
- Sara!
- Jen, help me!

558
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:37,486
Are you OK?

559
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:43,465
Rudy, help. Sara!

560
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,765
Ewww.

561
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,101
- God.
- What happened?

562
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,505
What is that thing?

563
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:01,249
Hey, is this
that Michael Myers thing?

564
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,649
Yeah.

565
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,051
A'ight, cool.

566
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,553
Yeah, OK.

567
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,367
What is this?

568
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:29,575
Oh. Sorry.

569
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,511
Are you?

570
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,880
You're such a Lothario.

571
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,748
Um...

572
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,720
I don't know what that
means exactly, but...

573
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,313
Just go with it.

574
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,256
Hold on.
I just thought of something.

575
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:48,397
Hold on?

576
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,466
You've got to be kidding me.

577
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,730
What, are you
looking for "Playboys"?

578
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,439
This ain't right.

579
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:07,074
Well, it's obvious
that the boy was subject...

580
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:10,678
to emotional and physical abuse.

581
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,484
No, all of this.
It's not right.

582
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,491
It's too easy.

583
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:18,561
Why is all this stuff
still here?

584
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,028
Answer that, Nancy Drew.

585
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:24,067
Where's Bill?

586
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,533
He's probably
still mad at me.

587
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:31,063
He's gonna jump out
of somewhere and scare me.

588
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,608
You watch.

589
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,343
You watch.

590
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:05,808
Jim? Uh.

591
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:22,185
You know, if I'm keeping you
from something...

592
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,520
just let me know.

593
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,889
Look.

594
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,671
- Voilà.
- Clever boy.

595
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,317
See,
they're looking for clues.

596
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:50,512
Something that might explain
why Michael Myers went bad.

597
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,748
- Oh.
- Jeez.

598
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,313
Hey, Scott. What's up?

599
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,757
God, nice costume.

600
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,687
Whoa.

601
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:34,660
Hey, you think
they kept him down here?

602
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:38,030
Maybe. Look at this.

603
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:42,060
What? What is it?

604
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,607
It's some sort
of weird harness.

605
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:49,907
This whole place looks like
some sadistic playpen.

606
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,517
Ah ha ha.

607
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,645
And you know what
that makes me think?

608
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,053
What?

609
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,718
There's definitely
no cameras down here.

610
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,414
I could be a camera.

611
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,886
Say something smart.

612
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,733
Existence precedes essence.

613
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,602
God, you are sexy.

614
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:19,727
Whoa! Oh, shit!

615
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,410
That worked perfectly!

616
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,345
Whoa! That is
what I'm talking about.

617
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,585
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! All his victims!

618
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,450
It's a mass grave!

619
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,887
Oh, my God!

620
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,819
Oh, God.

621
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,990
All of his victims. Oh!

622
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,195
Shit. Look at this.

623
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,330
I don't
fucking believe this.

624
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,805
What?

625
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,672
Made in fucking Taiwan.

626
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:11,173
Oh, shit, man!

627
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,273
Charley,
where the fuck you been?

628
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,012
We've been lookin' all over
this motherfucker for you!

629
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,281
And why the hell are you
dressed like me anyway?

630
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,255
I ain't payin' you
to be Michael Myers.

631
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:22,052
I'm playin' Michael Myers!

632
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,649
If them kids come around...

633
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,625
and see us dressed up
in the same shit...

634
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:29,096
you'll ruin the whole effect,
God damn it.

635
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:31,463
What the hell
is wrong with you?

636
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,435
What you lookin' at me
like that for?

637
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,064
Huh? You don't get it?

638
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,267
Your shit ain't workin'
up there?

639
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,505
Take your ass in the back
of the garage with Nora.

640
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:43,841
That's your job.

641
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,643
Go back there with Nora
and help her ass out.

642
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:47,911
Go do your job.

643
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:51,511
I left the back door
unlocked for your ass...

644
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,523
to go out the back
into the garage.

645
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:55,785
That's what I did.

646
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,588
You need to get the hell
outta here.

647
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,629
Go on, scoot! Skedaddle!

648
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,790
Get the fuck out of Dodge!

649
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:13,034
God damn. What the hell's
somebody gotta do...

650
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:15,475
to get a little decent help
up in this motherfucker?

651
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,740
God damn it. Come on.

652
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,147
Let's go find Freddie.

653
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,022
This is bullshit.

654
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,296
Hey, Jim?

655
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,603
You gotta see this.

656
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,894
Gross.

657
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,863
Hey, Freddie.

658
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,403
Is this all part of the setup?

659
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,687
"Laurie Strode,
sister of Michael Myers...

660
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,419
"survives Halloween night
massacre."

661
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,836
Heh. Nice prop.

662
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:27,638
Aah!

663
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,405
Oh, my God!

664
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,812
Oh, my God!

665
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:38,115
Is anybody else seeing this?

666
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,423
Jim?

667
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,630
Aaah!

668
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,396
Aaah!

669
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,628
Aah! Oh, my God!

670
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,297
No!

671
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,604
Help! Somebody!

672
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,276
Someone help! Oh, my God!

673
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,616
This isn't funny anymore!

674
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,781
Help me! Somebody help!

675
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:17,985
This is not funny!

676
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,199
Oh, my God!

677
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,828
Stay away from me! Aah!

678
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:32,602
Aah! Aah!

679
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,700
Aah!

680
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,349
Aah!

681
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,338
That was so fake.

682
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,072
No, no, wait.
Wait, you guys.

683
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:13,411
That really happened.
She was just killed.

684
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,910
Man, you're gullible.

685
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:19,454
Get outta here.

686
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:30,131
It's a good thing
there's no cameras in here.

687
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,637
We're wearing cameras.

688
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,901
Whoosh.

689
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,607
Aaaah!

690
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,905
Michael's here!

691
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,071
I saw him!
He's in the house!

692
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,671
He's here!

693
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,143
Oh, my God.

694
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:23,651
What's going on?
What you talking about?

695
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,982
Don't do this, girl.

696
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,954
You're bringing me down
on this beautiful evening.

697
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,514
There's nobody here.
You're just bugging out.

698
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,820
It's not funny, OK?

699
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:33,418
- Stop it, OK?
- He's down in that room.

700
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:37,397
There is 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 people in the house.

701
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,628
There's no Michael Myers here.
There's nobody.

702
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:42,262
Listen,
I saw him right over there.

703
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,568
He's in here?
Ooh. Michael Myers.

704
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,767
Where's Michael Myers?

705
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,707
Michael Myers!
I don't see nothing.

706
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:50,405
- He was in here.
- You're bringing me down.

707
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,607
Rudy, I saw... Aaaah!

708
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,411
Rudy!

709
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,510
Uhh! Uhh!

710
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,350
- Fucker!
- Whoa, whoa!

711
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,913
Turn off the cameras!

712
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,357
- Get it back online.
- What's wrong?

713
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,018
Cut to
a different camera angle.

714
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:09,792
It's me. Freddie.

715
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:12,300
Freddie.
What the fuck are you doing?

716
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:13,994
Damn, man, you hit me...

717
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,766
like I murdered
your fuckin' mother.

718
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,397
Relax, man.

719
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:20,840
I'm only tryin'
to give America a good show.

720
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,674
So none of
this shit is real, right?

721
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,043
Like the furniture...

722
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,311
the photos,
all the fucked up toys?

723
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,180
It's all fake.
We've been set up.

724
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,379
You knew you didn't have
a show anyone would watch...

725
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,888
so you set us all up
at our fucking expense, huh?

726
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,924
What expense
are you talkin' about?

727
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,722
You ain't contributed a dime
to settin' up this shit.

728
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:41,353
Besides, don't nobody
want to see any of y'all...

729
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,159
runnin' around
no empty house...

730
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,666
possibly comin' up
with nothing any-damn-way.

731
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,066
America don't like reality,
first of all.

732
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,300
Second of all,
they think the shit is boring.

733
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,638
They want
a little razzle-dazzle...

734
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,577
a little pizazz,
a little thrill in their life.

735
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,443
And us being the ones
that give it to 'em...

736
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,506
I don't see
nothin' wrong with that.

737
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,642
I did not sign up for this.

738
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,983
Y'all need to do me a favor,
all right?

739
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:08,455
Go along with this shit.
Don't blow it. Not now.

740
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,583
You really have no idea...

741
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,490
of how nicely
I worked things out...

742
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,153
so that we all can receive...

743
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:17,391
somewhat of a robust back end
when this shit is all over.

744
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,027
I don't know what you want to do
about your share...

745
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,968
but please
don't fuck it up for me.

746
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,165
I want my money, a'ight?

747
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,107
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go...

748
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,440
scare the shit out of some more
of these motherfuckers...

749
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:32,345
so, I'm gonna get it crackin'.

750
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:34,747
Y'all do what
the fuck y'all gotta do.

751
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,342
See y'all. Ha ha ha ha!

752
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,945
- All right.
- We have it.

753
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,286
- Turn up the sound.
- Where'd everybody go?

754
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,644
Ohh.

755
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:08,706
There you are, Bill.

756
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,447
So what
do you guys want to do?

757
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:14,615
I don't know.
I could use the money.

758
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,989
No. Fuck that.
I'm out.

759
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,493
Me too. I quit.

760
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,495
Boo!

761
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,099
She must be going
for the first internet Emmy.

762
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:36,109
You can't scare us, Jen.

763
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,510
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

764
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,017
You too, Freddie.

765
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:53,318
Aaaaaaah!

766
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,734
- Eww!
- How'd they do that?

767
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:08,743
- Digital effects.
- No, it isn't!

768
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:11,473
Hello. 911?

769
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,411
Oh, my God.

770
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:23,084
- It's locked!
- Fuck.

771
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,820
Go in there!
Go in there now!

772
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,814
Jim, run! Run!

773
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,579
Ah!

774
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:52,644
Oh! Aah!

775
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,689
Uhh.

776
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:27,180
Hey, Michael!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

777
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,224
You want a piece of me?

778
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:49,342
You should try a little less
protein in your diet.

779
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,573
Control some
of that aggression, huh?

780
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:11,692
Want some of this, huh?

781
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:15,363
I know what 911 is for!

782
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:17,497
This is an emergency.
It's not a hoax.

783
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,034
Motherfucker, come on.
Trying to fucking kill me?

784
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,672
Come on!
You like sushi, motherfucker?!

785
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,843
You gonna fucking kill me?

786
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,180
Oh, shit.

787
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:28,338
Somebody...

788
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,242
somebody out there,
please help us.

789
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,940
Somebody, please help us.

790
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,008
She really is
a very talented actress.

791
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:51,529
Deckard.

792
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,966
Deckard, if you're there,
please let me know.

793
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,831
Who's Deckard?
Myles is Deckard.

794
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,033
What do you mean?

795
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:09,275
Deckard,
he's killing all of us.

796
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,648
He's killing us.

797
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:11,879
There he is!
Upper right!

798
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:14,184
- Zoom in!
- Go to the other camera.

799
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,746
Tell her
he's coming up the stairs.

800
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,658
This isn't funny anymore!
Do something!

801
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,074
Aah!

802
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,542
- He heard her!
- Oh, my God.

803
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,821
He's at the door!

804
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:50,483
Get her out!

805
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,818
Oh, my God.

806
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,952
- No!
- It's too high!

807
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:40,934
No!

808
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,010
Aaah!

809
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,195
I can't see you!

810
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,970
Deckard, where is he?

811
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:42,563
Tell her to go!

812
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,663
- Now's her chance.
- Come on, go!

813
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,748
My God. Everybody's dead.

814
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:36,290
Where is he?

815
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,326
I don't know.

816
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:42,353
We got to get the fuck
outta here now.

817
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,056
Come on. Let's go.

818
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,810
Oh, shit.

819
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:07,719
Aaah!

820
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,631
So, you want to be
on Dangertainment?

821
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,642
Let's see what you got.

822
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,406
Waa... hyah!

823
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,251
Hyah!

824
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:52,623
Aah!

825
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,969
Yo, Mike, come see me.

826
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:59,405
Michael, come and see me!
Look at me!

827
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:06,573
You wanna fuck with me, huh?

828
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,583
You motherfucker.

829
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,242
Haaa-yah!

830
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:47,013
Let's get outta here.
Come on.

831
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,886
You all right?

832
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,790
I saw his room.

833
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:54,590
He's been living underneath
this fucking house...

834
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,254
for who knows how long.

835
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:58,265
Probably the last 20 years.

836
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,630
Come on.

837
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,700
I swear on my soul...

838
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,209
I had no idea.

839
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,178
I swear.

840
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:19,784
Aw, shit.

841
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,823
Come on. Let's go.

842
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:27,621
Oh, my God.
He cut the cable.

843
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:30,323
Where the fuck is he?

844
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,761
This is bad.

845
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:39,703
Deckard, where is he?

846
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:52,016
- No!
- Run! Oh!

847
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,798
Aah!

848
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,637
No.

849
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,388
Uhh.

850
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,260
Oh, no.

851
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,717
Aaaah!

852
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,586
Uhh!

853
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,143
Aah!

854
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:01,045
Aah!

855
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,756
Uhh.

856
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,341
You bastard!

857
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,716
This is for Jen!

858
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:14,815
This is for Rudy!

859
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:20,319
For all of them!

860
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:33,738
Oh, shit.

861
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,374
Aah!

862
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,751
Aah!

863
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:57,954
Trick or treat, motherfucker.

864
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:02,588
Aaaah!

865
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:15,769
No!

866
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:18,470
No!

867
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:19,673
Aah!

868
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,025
Uhh!

869
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,225
Aaah!

870
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:40,893
Ohh!

871
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:57,846
Burn, motherfucker! Burn!

872
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,556
Sara!

873
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,520
Come on, come on!

874
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:06,787
Uhh!

875
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:10,296
Hey, Mikey!
Happy fucking Halloween!

876
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:02,945
Sara? Sara Moyer?

877
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:05,953
- Sara?
- Can we get a statement?

878
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:07,545
Hey, we can go live now.

879
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:09,783
What happened
with Michael Myers?

880
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:13,350
Thank you, Deckard.
You saved my life.

881
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:23,668
What's it feel like
to be a hero, Sara?

882
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:25,467
How does it feel now
that it's all over?

883
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,474
What makes you so sure
it's over?

884
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:28,770
Excuse me.

885
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:31,073
- Watch the camera!
- No more cameras!

886
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,637
Dangertainment
is off the air.

887
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,546
Why don't
y'all show some respect?

888
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,482
Mr. Harris, would you like
to make a statement?

889
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:39,315
What can you tell us
about Michael Myers?

890
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,981
Michael Myers
is not a sound bite...

891
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:46,619
a spin-off, a tie-in,
some celebrity scandal.

892
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:51,927
Michael Myers is a killer shark
in baggy-ass overalls...

893
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,763
that gets his kicks
off of killing...

894
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:56,303
everything and everyone
that he comes across.

895
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:58,305
That's all.

896
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,739
We're done dancing
for these cameras.

897
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,276
Let's get outta here, Sara.

898
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,211
But how are you
feeling right now?

899
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:07,077
Heh.

900
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,342
How am I feelin' now?

901
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,180
You wanna know how
I'm feelin' right now?

902
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:12,514
Feel this!

903
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,782
My camera!

904
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:26,399
That's him, isn't it?

905
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,527
I want to see his face.

906
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:33,563
I want to warn you, ma'am,
it's not a pretty sight.

907
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,845
All right.

908
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,153
Come on, back it off.
Let's go.

909
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:50,521
Wow.

910
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:53,152
You're lookin' a little crispy
over there, Mikey.

911
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,957
Like some chicken-fried
motherfucker.

912
01:23:56,064 --> 01:24:00,728
Well, may he never,
ever rest in peace.

913
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,737
Hey, how's it going?

914
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,645
You've gotta be kidding me.

915
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,115
Another one?

916
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:17,617
It's your lucky night.

917
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:19,050
You got a celebrity.

918
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,146
Ooh, let me get
my autograph book.

919
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:25,386
I'm not kidding.
It's Michael Myers.

920
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:26,687
What?

921
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:32,732
Get me a copy
of that autograph.

922
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,234
- Yeah, sure.
- Ha ha!

923
01:24:34,302 --> 01:24:35,792
It's cracking me up.
