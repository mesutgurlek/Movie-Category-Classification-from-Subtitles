1
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,100
Attention, boils and ghouls,

2
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,100
it's time for Dr. Wolfenstein's

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,100
"Creature Feature Show."

4
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,600
Ah-hhh.

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
The doctor is in.

6
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,800
Don't scream. Don't move.

7
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,900
Stay tuned for Channel 68's

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,400
Halloween Eve movie marathon.

9
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm your host,
your ghost host

10
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,900
with the most,
Dr. Wolfenstein.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,100
I will be with you

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,600
until the end.

13
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,600
Howdy folks.
Black Blood.

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Violence.
Freaks of Nature.

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Come on down to Captain Spaulding's

16
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,700
Museum of Monsters and Madmen.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,700
See the Alligator Boy.

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,500
Ride my famous Murder Ride.

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,000
Most of all,
don't forget to take home

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,300
some of my tasty fried chicken.

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,800
It just tastes so damn good.

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,900
...with a meat cleaver.

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,900
See it, hear it,
and actually feel it.

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Coming after you
to rip your flesh apart.

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,400
Unbelievable but true.

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,400
See it, hear it,
and actually feel it.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Shit, I can't do nothin' with this.
I can't get rid of this.

28
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,000
It ain't worth nothin',
my name's all over it.

29
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
I was fixing it to trade it
to Jackie Cobb.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,700
That retard that hangs out
at Molly's Fruit Stand?

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
- Yeah.
- For the life of me

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,900
I cannot understand why
you hang out with that asshole.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
He's one horny retard.

34
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,300
Well, ain't they all?
All they wanna do is eat and fuck.

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,400
If you knew him,
you might understand his urges.

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,200
Worse than a rabid-ass baboon.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,000
You know what his favorite thing is
next to whacking his weasel?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He takes a sharpened pencil

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,200
and sticks it in his eyeball
and twists it.

40
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,200
- What?
- He doesn't hurt himself though,

41
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,100
he kind of twists it
right next to his eyeball.

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,800
He'd been putting that pencil
someplace other than his eyeball.

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,300
He don't do nothin' like that.
Although, once he got caught

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,600
with a "Planet of the Apes" doll
stuck up his asshole.

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,000
Goddamn.

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,100
They had to take him
to the hospital.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,100
Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck
halfway up his butt.

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,300
Couldn't get it out.

49
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,800
- Did you fix the toilet?
- Yes, I did,

50
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,300
and I don't want you stuffing any
goddamn paper towels down there.

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
I had to snake
the shit out that thing.

52
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,100
Here you go.

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
You bust that crapper
and I'm gonna bust your ass.

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,800
I hear ya.

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,300
Mary, fucking Moses,
ya'll get the fuck outta here.

56
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,100
Hold it, clowney.
Keep your paws where I can see them.

57
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,700
Don't move.
I'll blast a hole the size of

58
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,500
a Kansas City watermelon
through your ugly ass, Bozo face.

59
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,700
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
Go grab that other asshole
out of the shitter

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,000
- and drag his ass back in here.
- Right.

62
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,700
You miserable motherfu...
I ought to jump over this counter

63
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
and bash your fucking balls in.

64
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,400
All right, Tippy,
hand over the cash box

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,500
and I might leave
your brains inside your skull.

66
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,900
I'll tell you what, Ski King,

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,500
why don't you just take
your mama home some chicken

68
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,400
and then I won't have to stuff
my boot all up in ya ass!

69
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,400
I don't like chicken!

70
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,200
And I hate clowns!

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,600
Put that shit down.
Put it down!

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,700
That is it!

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,200
I'm gonna count to 10 and you're
gonna hand over all the cash,

74
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,400
or I'm gonna splatter
your grease-paint mug

75
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,200
across the state line.

76
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,400
- One...
- Fuck yo mama.

77
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,400
- Two...
- Fuck yo sister.

78
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,100
What are we gonna do?

79
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
I know you, you work
at the hardware store, right?

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,100
- Richard Wick, right?
- Shut your trap.

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Quiet down, both of you!

82
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,200
- Three...
- Fuck yo grandma.

83
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,400
I remember now.
All the guys made fun of you.

84
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,300
- Called you Little Dick Wick.
- Shut up!

85
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,200
Stop singing,
I hate that song.

86
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,700
Put your fucking mask back on.

87
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400
Fuck it!

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Most of all,
fuck you!

89
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Goddamn motherfucker got
blood all over my best clown suit.

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How many want
to touch this afternoon?

91
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Raise your hand if you want
God to touch you.

92
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,800
I'm gonna pray that God
will give you a divine touch...

93
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
...the US Department of Agriculture

94
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,600
is checking whether
state meat and poultry inspectors

95
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,600
are good enough to allow the
product to go on sale nationally.

96
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,100
The USDA has said...

97
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,300
Man, some of these
Manson chicks are really hot.

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,700
Shit, how are we
almost out of gas?

99
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,200
And this squeaky, right here,
now that's a girl you would date.

100
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,700
- Jerry, how much did you put in?
- I don't know? Two, three bucks.

101
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,900
Two, three bucks?
I told you to fill...

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,600
- Bill, feel me, am I made of money?
- Get off. Jesus Christ, Jerry.

103
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,900
Don't panic yourself there
way too much, caffeine guy.

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I wouldn't be drinking
so much coffee

105
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,000
if you did your share
of the driving.

106
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,900
- You know I don't have nightvision.
- Oh, not this again.

107
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,100
Seriously, I can't even make out
the lines in the road.

108
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,100
If you wanna pull the car over,
I'll be more than happy

109
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
to kill us out
in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,700
Besides, there's a billboard
right there.

111
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Captain Spaulding's Museum
of Monsters and Madmen.

112
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,900
- Awesome, great!
- Fried chicken and gasoline.

113
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,400
Next exit, there you go,
problem solved

114
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,700
and we didn't have to freak out.
It was a real big deal.

115
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,000
Dick.

116
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,900
All right.

117
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,400
I'll pump the gas. Go inside
and see if it's worth checking out.

118
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,100
Okay, Mr. Cranky.

119
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,900
Holy... crap!

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,100
You gotta see this place.
It's boss.

121
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
- How boss?
- Really fucking boss.

122
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,400
Like, wake up the chicks
and break out the camera boss?

123
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,900
Hell, yeah.

124
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,000
Wakey, wakey!
Eggs and bacon.

125
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,000
Hey, sweetie, come on.

126
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Grab Mary and get your stuff
and come on inside.

127
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,000
Bill and I found a kick-ass place.
Come on, move, move!

128
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Let's go.

129
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,000
Come on, Sleeping Beauty,
it's time to go to work.

130
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
What's in that case over there?

131
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,700
Hairless monkey.

132
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,700
Did you see the crocodile boy?

133
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,100
How'd you like to find
that in your pants?

134
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,700
- Excuse me, sir? Howdy.
- Hi.

135
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
I love this place. How long have
you been running this place?

136
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, uhm...
How long's a piece of string?

137
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,700
I don't know.

138
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Too goddamn long,
that's how long.

139
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,500
Too goddamn long,
that's right.

140
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,300
Right, I hear that,
but how long, actually?

141
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,600
Oh, shit, I don't know exactly.

142
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I took over for my pa,
right after the Duke damned Oscar.

143
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,900
- Oh, you mean John Wayne.
- Hell, son.

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,100
How many dukes do you know about?

145
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,700
- Greatest American ever lived.
- Look at that.

146
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,400
"Circle up the wagons, pilgrims."

147
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,400
"Whatever you say, cowboy."

148
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,400
I'm not that much of a Western fan.

149
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,200
I like science-fiction.

150
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,200
Ah-hhh. Space boy.

151
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,500
- I figured as much.

152
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,500
Let me ask you something.

153
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,900
How come you're asking
so many jackassy questions?

154
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
My friends and I,
we're driving across country

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,500
writing this book on off-beat
roadside attractions,

156
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,400
the crazy shit you see when
you're driving across the country.

157
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
I don't drive cross country.

158
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
But if you did.

159
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,900
But I don't.

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,100
Yeah, but supposing
for a second that you did.

161
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,100
You little dickens, you.

162
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,300
I know what your problem is.

163
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,100
What's that?

164
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Ya'll think us folks from the
country's funny-like, don't you?

165
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,400
- Jerry...
- Well, saddle up the mule, ma.

166
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,800
Slide me some grits,
I's got to get me some education.

167
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,300
- Jerry...
- You asshole.

168
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,900
No, I'm really very interested,
I'm not trying to make fun.

169
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Gotcha!

170
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,000
You are such a bad clown.

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
Oh, fuck me, Side Sally,

172
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,000
who the hell'd wanna read about
all this horseshit anyway?

173
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,500
You'd be surprised.

174
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,100
Son, look around.

175
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,300
Would I be surprised?

176
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,400
Finally. Great, great. Come on, we
paid for the tickets.

177
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- What tickets?

178
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,700
This isn't everything.
There is actually a murder ride.

179
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
A murder ride?
I don't want to go on a murder ride.

180
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,500
- Yes, you do wanna go on a...
- No, I don't.

181
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,300
Hey, how about
if we skip the murder ride?

182
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,100
Hey, how about if we go?

183
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,400
Anytime this year, people.
Tour is about to begin.

184
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,800
Okay, we'll see you inside
the murder ride, we'll be back. Bye.

185
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

186
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,200
children of all ages,

187
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,500
you are about to enter
the world of darkness,

188
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,800
a world where life
and death are meaningless,

189
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,900
and pain is God.

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,600
- Pain!
- Billy, let's go.

191
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,700
- Quit that, sport.
- Sorry, Captain Spaulding.

192
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,900
We gonna have a good time now.

193
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,100
On your right, you will see

194
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,000
the infamous
Albert... Fish.

195
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,600
Masochist, sadist,

196
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
child killer and most importantly,

197
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,200
cannibal.

198
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,100
Mr. Fish, born 1870
and enjoyed spankings

199
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
with nail-studded paddles,

200
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,500
stuffing needles
deep into his groin.

201
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,300
- I have a question. How many...
- Hold all questions.

202
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,900
No, no, help.

203
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Lizzie fucking Borden.

204
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Now, one of our most famous crazies,

205
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,600
the psycho of Plainsfield,
Mr. Ed Gein.

206
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,400
Murderer, cannibal,

207
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,700
Mr. Gein used to take
great pleasure

208
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,100
of playing with
dead bodies of women,

209
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,000
especially, their sexual organs.

210
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,900
Now, one of our local heroes,

211
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
S. Quentin Quale,

212
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,900
aka Dr. Satan.

213
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,900
Oh shit!

214
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,100
Murderer, torturer,
but most of all, master surgeon.

215
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,100
Mr. Quail was an intern

216
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,300
at Willows County Mental Hospital,

217
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
nicknamed Weeping Willows

218
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
for the neverending cries of pain.

219
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,700
Through primitive brain surgery...

220
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
- Jerry, stop it.
- Mr. Quail believed

221
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
that he could create
a race of superhumans

222
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,400
from the mentally ill.

223
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,800
Vigilante justice prevailed.

224
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,800
They took his ass out and hung him.

225
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,800
And that infamous hanging tree

226
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,000
is no more than a stone's throw away

227
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,400
from where y'alls' ass
is now seated.

228
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,500
But the next day

229
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,700
his body was found
to be missing.

230
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
Until today

231
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,400
no trace of Dr. Satan

232
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
has ever been discovered.

233
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,300
But then, who knows?

234
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,300
Maybe he lives next door to you.

235
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,700
Tour's over.
Exit through the doors.

236
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,400
That was so bad-ass.

237
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,800
Dr. Satan. Ah-hhh,
Dr. Satan.

238
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,000
Maybe he lives next door to you.

239
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,600
Calm down, it was all right.

240
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,600
Do you think maybe we could go now?

241
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm gonna go call my dad.
I'll be right back.

242
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
I love you.

243
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,600
What do you mean,
it was all right?

244
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,000
It was cool,
but it wasn't that great.

245
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,900
Dude, you don't have to play it
down in front of your chick.

246
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
- Oh.
- Thank you.

247
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,400
- Don't move a muscle, an artery,

248
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,200
Or a vein.

249
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
- Hello?
- Hey, Dad.

250
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,800
- Wow, Denise.
- We stopped for gas

251
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,700
at this place
called Captain Spaulding's,

252
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,800
somewhere outside
of Ruggsville.

253
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,800
It turned into this whole big thing,
so we're behind schedule.

254
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,100
Don't be too late.

255
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,000
I forgot to tell you that Halloween
falls on a school night

256
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,900
so they're
trick-or-treating tonight.

257
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,400
Your left hand shows your past;

258
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,900
your right hand shows your future.

259
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,300
Good evening.
I'm Lance Brockwell

260
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,900
and this is the 7:00 news.
And our top story tonight,

261
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,700
investigators still have no leads
to the strange disappearance

262
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,600
of the five cheerleaders
from Ruggsville High School.

263
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Cindy Thompson, Karen Murphy,

264
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,900
Allison Cole, Valarie Green,
and Dawn Baker

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,800
were last seen four days ago
leaving a football game.

266
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,900
I know it seems stupid,
but I really wanna see this tree.

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,400
Do yourself a favor, son,
just forget about it.

268
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,100
Oh, come on,
I live for this shit.

269
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,800
Okay, all right,
I'll draw you a damn map.

270
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,800
- Thank you.
- I still say it's a waste of time.

271
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,100
You are here.
Go straight up this road.

272
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
Make the first right.
First left.

273
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,500
Come straight across
and down.

274
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Can't find it? Tough.

275
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,400
- Here's your map.
- Right on.

276
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
- Here's your complimentary chicken.
- Oh, wow.

277
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,700
Don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

278
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
You're gonna get
a great write-up for this.

279
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,600
Here's an idea, let's just skip it.
It's probably nothing anyway.

280
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,000
Christ, Jerry, Bill is right,
we can't see anything.

281
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,200
What's that?

282
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Hitchhiker.

283
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
- What? Should we stop?
- We can't leave her in the rain.

284
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,700
Stick her in the front
if you wanna pick her up so bad.

285
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,400
So, uh,

286
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,300
- where ya headed?
- I was just going home.

287
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,900
- Home, where's that?
- A couple miles up the road.

288
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
- So, you live around here?
- Yeah.

289
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,700
Do you know where
this Dr. Satan tree's at?

290
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,300
Yeah. You know where that's at?
It's right by my house.

291
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,300
- I can show you.
- Really?

292
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,000
- So, it is a real thing.
- Fuck you.

293
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,400
So, a tree?
Where's it at?

294
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,900
- What tree?
- Okay, this is crazy.

295
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
She obviously doesn't
know anything.

296
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,200
Oh, I know,
I'll show you where it's at.

297
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,200
Whatever you need to do, you do it.

298
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,100
There is no wrong.

299
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,300
If someone needs to be killed,
you kill 'em.

300
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,900
That's the way.

301
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,200
Fuck.

302
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,500
I think we blew a tire.

303
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,000
- Oh poop.
- Oh, hell.

304
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,700
At least we got that spare.

305
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
You filled it up
like I asked, right?

306
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,200
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Okay, what if I forgot
to put it back in the trunk?

308
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
What would plan B entail?

309
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,300
- Jesus Christ, Jerry.
- Technically I did what you said.

310
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,800
Oh for fucking sake, Jerry,
what're we gonna do now?

311
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,600
I can't rightly
say if I know, me ladies.

312
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,500
Wait, I love this song.

313
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,300
Would you turn
the radio off, please?!

314
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,200
God!

315
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,100
We can walk to my house from here.

316
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,900
What?

317
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
My brother's got a tow truck.
He can come get your car.

318
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,300
- I'll go, it's my fault.
- Forget it, I'm going.

319
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,400
- No, Bill, l...
- You guys stay here.

320
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
There's no sense in everyone
getting drenched.

321
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,800
Returning to the news,
local authorities still have no lead

322
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
in the mysterious disappearance
of the five cheerleaders

323
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,700
from Ruggsville.
The girls were last seen

324
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,500
leaving a cheering competition...

325
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,900
lt was loud enough
to wake the dead.

326
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
- That's an idea.
- What is?

327
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,400
Wouldn't it be dramatic? Supposing
the people inside were dead,

328
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,000
all stretched out with the lights
quietly burning about them.

329
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm sure it would be very amusing.

330
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,100
Why you ask?
Why is not the question.

331
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,900
How?

332
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,200
Now, that is a question
worth examining.

333
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,800
How could I,

334
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,300
being born of such

335
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,500
conventional stock,

336
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,700
arrive a leader of the rebellion?

337
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,900
An escapist from a conformist world,
destined to find happiness

338
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,900
only in that which
cannot be explained.

339
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,300
I brought you here for a reason.

340
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,900
But unfortunately,
you and your sentimental minds

341
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,600
are doing me no good.

342
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
My brain is frozen,

343
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,300
locked.

344
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
I have to break free

345
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
from this culture
of mechanical reproductions

346
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,000
and the thick incrustations

347
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,800
dying on the surface.

348
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Oh, Christ.

349
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,800
Fuck it.

350
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
These are all my dolls.

351
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,600
I used to chop their heads off
and their arms

352
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
and stick them up on the wall.

353
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,600
The door's locked,
I gotta go around.

354
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,500
Just wait here.

355
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,700
Jesus Christ!
Don't do that.

356
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,000
You scared the shit out of me.

357
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,800
You ain't seen nothing yet.

358
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,700
- Is your brother ready to go?
- Yeah, he already left.

359
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,200
- Come on, inside.
- What? He left?

360
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,800
Come on and get toasty.

361
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,800
Don't worry about it, he's fine.

362
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,100
I just don't understand why...

363
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,400
What was that?

364
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,900
What? I didn't hear anything.

365
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,900
Turn the radio off.

366
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,800
Now listen.

367
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,000
I still don't hear anything.

368
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,000
I swear to God,
I heard some weird...

369
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Turn on the headlights,
see if something's out there.

370
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,400
Calm down, calm down.

371
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,300
Jesus H. Christ.

372
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,700
It's the fucking tow truck guy.

373
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
So,

374
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,600
you live alone here?

375
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,900
I mean,
just you and your brother?

376
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,500
Nah, there's a bunch of us
around somewhere.

377
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,500
I think Otis is upstairs
messing around or something.

378
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,000
You gotta have the marshmallows.

379
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,700
That's what makes it fun.

380
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah, I guess.

381
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,600
You sure do a lot of guessing.

382
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

383
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,100
Wow.

384
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,100
Look at him.

385
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,100
He must've been going pretty fast
to smash through that wall.

386
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,700
You sure are silly
for a guy with glasses.

387
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,900
- I like that.
- Okay, hey.

388
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
Need those to see, thank you.

389
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,300
How do I look?

390
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Terrific, really.

391
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,400
Tasty.

392
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Ain't the only thing
tasty in this house.

393
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,800
Okay, okay.

394
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
I wonder what time...

395
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,200
- it's getting kind of late.
- Don't worry, sugar.

396
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,800
It ain't past my bedtime

397
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
Are you flirting with me?

398
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,600
What? Oh, no.

399
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,300
Great! They're back.

400
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,200
Whoppie-fucking-do.

401
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,300
Excuse me?

402
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,400
I gotta call my dad
and tell him we're gonna be late.

403
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,400
Can I use your phone, please?

404
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,400
Hello?

405
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Ain't got one.

406
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,400
- Oh, hi.
- Goodness.

407
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,300
You really don't have a phone?

408
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,400
No.

409
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,600
I once had one back in '57,

410
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,500
but...

411
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,100
I don't quite remember.
There's nobody round here.

412
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,700
I feel like jaw-flapping at no more.

413
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,900
Do you think the guy with the tow
truck could drive us to a phone?

414
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,200
His name is Rufus,
Rufus Jr.

415
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,500
But we all call him

416
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,500
- RJ.
- Makes sense.

417
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,800
What do they call you, sweetie?

418
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,300
I am Qualsnarg of the Crab Nebula.

419
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,300
But you humans can call me Jerry.

420
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,000
Jerry.

421
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,700
Baby, go on and see how RJ's doin'
with these nice folks' automobile.

422
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,300
Why don't you just all make
yourselves to home?

423
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,700
What brings you kids way out here?

424
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,600
Haven't you got something better
to do on Halloween

425
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
than wander around
out in the sticks?

426
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,700
I thought maybe
we'd take in a hoedown.

427
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,000
No, he's just joking.

428
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,800
- You are?
- I'm sorry, I'm messing with you.

429
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,900
Shut up, dude.

430
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,800
Oh, I get it.

431
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,500
Y'all just think you're too good

432
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,600
for the simple pleasures
of Halloween.

433
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,800
No, just a little too old.

434
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,300
Oh really? I hope something
changes your mind

435
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,300
someday.

436
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,200
- Mama, Tiny's home.
- What about RJ?

437
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,000
He was gone before I seen him.

438
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,400
But Tiny saw him and said he said
he was going down to the yard

439
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,600
to get a new wheel.

440
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,000
How long is that gonna take?

441
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,800
Probably be back
in a couple of hours.

442
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,600
A couple of hours? What?

443
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,700
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?

444
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,500
Tiny ain't got no car,

445
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,700
he ain't even got a bicycle.

446
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,400
Even though I know
that you think it is childish,

447
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,200
tonight is Halloween Eve,

448
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,800
and to us

449
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,800
it is special.

450
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,300
So you are all invited to dinner.

451
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,000
I hope to Christ she don't expect
us to wear these things.

452
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,700
What ever it is, just do it.

453
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,300
The more we play along the faster
we'll get the hell out of here.

454
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Now is not the time to make waves.
Jerry.

455
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,000
You'll have to forgive Tiny.

456
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,200
He can't hear so much.

457
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,600
That poor baby.

458
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,600
It's his daddy's fault.

459
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,500
Earl wasn't a bad man,

460
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,300
he never hit me
or nothing like that.

461
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,600
One day he just up
and went devil on us all.

462
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,900
- What happened?
- He tried to burn down the house.

463
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,000
He said it was
possessed by the spirits.

464
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,200
And Tiny was sleeping in the
basement where the fire started.

465
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,300
But I don't think Earl
ever meant to harm us.

466
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,600
Tiny was badly burnt,
his ears were destroyed

467
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,100
and most of his skin.

468
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,900
- Is that why he wears the mask?
- Yeah.

469
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,600
My baby boy gets
shy around new people,

470
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,600
but he'll warm up to you,

471
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,800
especially the girls.

472
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
He's a real lady-killer.

473
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,900
You're gonna miss
a good show tonight.

474
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
That's your tough luck.

475
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,800
I thought you kids
were all about team spirit.

476
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,500
You ain't done fuck-all
to cheer me up since you got here.

477
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,700
Give me a B. Give me an A.

478
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,200
Give me a B. Give me a Y.

479
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,800
What's that spell?
What's that spell?!

480
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,700
What's that spell?!

481
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,500
Baby.

482
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,700
You're damn right.

483
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,000
Okay now.
Everybody put on your masks.

484
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,700
Can't very well eat our desserts
with our everyday faces exposed.

485
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,300
Can we?

486
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Gosh, kid, put it on.

487
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,200
She ain't gonna let
any of us touch dessert

488
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,300
unless you're wearing
this damn thing.

489
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,700
Mrs. Firefly?

490
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,700
Do you know anything
about the legend of Dr. Satan?

491
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
- Here we go.
- Shut up.

492
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,100
I'm not much for gossip
and this and that,

493
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
- but I have heard...
- I know all about

494
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,300
what you wanna know all about.

495
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,100
Otis.

496
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,300
I can't believe you decided

497
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,800
to come down and join us.

498
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,100
And you brought Little Wolf.

499
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,100
Oh, my baby.

500
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,100
Oh my God.

501
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,000
It's such a special night for me.

502
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,600
I don't know

503
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,100
who told you your fairy fables
about Dr. Satan.

504
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,500
We heard it from a Captain Spaulding

505
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,500
up the road at...

506
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,700
That old bitch hog don't know shit.

507
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,300
Tells this cute little tattle-tales
to sell his junk,

508
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,300
but he don't sell
no Yankee boys no truth.

509
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,000
Something happened, right? It had
to be based on some real incident.

510
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,800
Are you, Jimmy Olsen,
cub reporter for the Daily Asshole?

511
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,600
- Grampa, watch your language.
- I don't think you need to know.

512
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,100
Better you leave here
with your head still full

513
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,800
of kitty cats and puppy dogs.

514
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,800
- I really would like to know...
- Hey, he'd really like to know.

515
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,700
Enlighten him.

516
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,900
I bet you'd stick your head in fire
if I told ya you could see hell.

517
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,100
Meanwhile, you're too stupid
to realize

518
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
you got a demon
sticking out your ass

519
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,300
singing, "Holy Miss Moley,"

520
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,200
"Got me a live one."

521
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,300
Can we change the subject, please?

522
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,800
Dinner's over.

523
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Ladies and germs,

524
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,300
it's show time!

525
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,500
Tell you a little story...

526
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,800
Eat your wife's pussy...

527
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,300
I mean jam your face in it!

528
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,200
...starts licking and chomping
on her pussy

529
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,500
and she's screamin'
and yellin' and she just...

530
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,100
Ah-hhh!

531
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,700
The old battleaxe at home's
liable to crush my balls!

532
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,100
Would you be quiet?

533
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,100
You're gonna wake up grandma.

534
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,400
Bravo, man.

535
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,100
Hey, hey, hey, don't be moving now,
don't be moving.

536
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,500
We got something real special
for you men out there.

537
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,600
- Wow!

538
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,800
- All right.

539
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,000
Jerry.

540
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,200
- Get off him.

541
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,600
I said get the fuck off him,
you stupid fucking whore!

542
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,200
- Fucking slut!
- You shouldn't have done that.

543
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Oh, really? Are you gonna
do something about it?

544
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,000
- I'll do something, motherfucker.
- Yeah, come on.

545
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,600
I'll fucking cut your tits off
and shove them down your throat.

546
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,600
- Baby, stop!
- Come on, Ma,

547
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,900
- this bitch has got it coming.
- No, I told you, remember?

548
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,000
- Car's done.
- Thank God.

549
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,200
I suggest that you kids leave.

550
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
We're gone.

551
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
Fuck you!

552
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,000
- I love you, Mama.
- I know.

553
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
- Lock the fucking doors!
- Hurry up.

554
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Jesus Christ, you think she
was really gonna cut you.

555
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,000
Of course she was gonna cut me,
she's a fucking nut.

556
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,300
I knew she was crazy from
the second we picked her up.

557
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Okay. That's that.

558
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,400
Let's get out
of this fucking nuthouse.

559
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,600
What're you doing?
Why are you stopping?

560
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,000
- I gotta open the gate!
- For Christ's sake, hurry up!

561
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,200
Oh, shit!

562
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100

Somebody help him!

563
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,900
- Oh shit!
- What are they doing to him?

564
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,700
Who's that?

565
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,700
Oh my God!

566
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,900
- Shut the fucking door!
- Oh, no!

567
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,600
Somebody help us!

568
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,100
Oh my God! Get away from us!

569
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,100
No, please.

570
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,600
Oh my God!

571
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,100
No-ooo!

572
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,800
Oh my God!

573
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,200
Help me! Help me!

574
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,300
Rock and roll this morning
with some Led Zeppelin...

575
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,200
...kinda wild around
the radio station today,

576
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,700
it being a holiday.

577
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,000
It's kinda like
a ghost town around here.

578
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,300
It's kinda nice though,
it's kinda kick back.

579
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,300
Maybe time to get away with stuff.

580
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,500
Huston.

581
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Donald Willis.

582
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,400
- Don Willis, how the hell are you?
- Listen, Frank,

583
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,800
I'm a little worried about Denise.

584
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,500
She called me last night
from the road near Ruggsville,

585
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,400
a place called Spaulding's.

586
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Yeah, I know the joint.

587
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,700
She said she'd be here about 11:00,
but she never showed up.

588
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,700
I'll run a check on up there
by Spaulding's

589
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,800
and see if there's any accidents,
or road closings.

590
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,900
It was raining like
a son of a bitch here last night.

591
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,100
They're probably just stuck
in the mud someplace.

592
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,100
Shut your mouth!

593
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,600
I said, shut your fucking mouth!

594
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,000
Listen, you Malibu middleclass
Barbie piece of shit,

595
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,600
I'm trying to work here!

596
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,400
Work! You ever work?

597
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,300
Yeah, I'll bet you have.

598
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,400
Scooping ice cream to your shitheel
friends on summer break.

599
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,600
I ain't talking about
no goddamn white socks

600
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,700
with Mickey Mouse on one side
and Donald Duck on the other.

601
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,300
I ain't readin'
no funny books, Mama.

602
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,300
Our bodies come and go,
but this blood is forever.

603
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,700
I'm gonna remove your gag,

604
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,600
but if you make so much
as a fucking peep

605
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,100
I'm gonna cut you like a pig

606
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,300
and make you eat your own
fucking intestines. You got me?

607
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,700
Why are you doing this to me?

608
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,300
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

609
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,800
Messy up your day?

610
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,400
Where's Bill?

611
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,200
- Where's Bill?
- Bill?

612
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,500
Is he okay?

613
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,900
He's a good guy.

614
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,600
He's been a great help to me.
A real blessin'.

615
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,400
I couldn't have asked
for a better specimen.

616
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,100
You don't know

617
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,600
what kind of dry spell I've had,

618
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,200
total block, total block.

619
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,400
But Bill,

620
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,200
he's okay.

621
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Where is he?

622
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,700
Hi.

623
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,000
Where is he?
Can I see him?

624
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,500
Can I see Bill, please?

625
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,600
Let's go see.

626
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,500
Behold...

627
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,000
- Fish-boy!
- Oh my God!

628
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,300
Oh my God, Bill.

629
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,700
No, no, this can't be real.
This can't be real.

630
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,500
This can't be real,
this can't be real.

631
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,500
Oh, it's real.

632
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,000
Real as I want it to be, Mama.

633
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,400
Fuck you, you fucking freak!

634
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,700
- Well...

635
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,200
Let's see if the nut that runs
this place can help us.

636
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,400
Take a look at all this crap.

637
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,000
I'd red flag anybody
running a joint like this.

638
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,500
Sweet baby Jesus.

639
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,400
Whoever's jerking off on that bell
better be gone when I come out,

640
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,200
or I'm gonna rip your nuts off.

641
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,300
Officers, officers,
what can I do for you?

642
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,700
I ain't fired up the birds yet

643
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,700
if that's what you've been
ring-a-ding-dinging about.

644
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,300
I need you to answer some questions
about some missing kids.

645
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,900
Oh, I don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

646
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,600
I'm the kind of guy that
just minds his own business,

647
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,200
if you get what I'm saying.

648
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,600
You seen this girl?
Say in the last 24 hours?

649
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,700
Yeah, yeah, a cute kid.

650
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,700
Ain't my type though.

651
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,300
I like 'em with a little
more meat on 'em.

652
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,600
The bigger the cushion,
the sweeter the pushin'.

653
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Look, clown-ass,
just answer the damn question.

654
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,700
We ain't interested
in your love life, all right?

655
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,200
Cut the crap, Spaulding
and get with the facts.

656
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,400
Huh?

657
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,600
What did you see?
Who was she with?

658
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,600
- Where was she going?
- I don't know.

659
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,400
She was with some stupid kids.
They's nosing around,

660
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,500
asking a bunch
of stupid questions.

661
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
- Questions about what?
- I don't know.

662
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,200
This and that. Mostly a bunch
of tired Dr. Satan bullshit.

663
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,200
They caught a gander
at the display in the back

664
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,700
and they figured
they's gonna run out

665
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,100
and solve
the great Deadwood mystery.

666
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,900
And how'd they get that idea?

667
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,200
I wrote 'em a map.

668
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,400
Out to the old farm road.

669
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
I figured, what the hell?
It wouldn't do no harm.

670
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,300
'Sides, it's good
for my tourist trade.

671
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,000
You can shit 10 bricks
for all I care.

672
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,200
What else?

673
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,900
Nothin'.

674
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,400
Stupid-ass kids probably
got themselves

675
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,600
turned around ass-backwards
and got theyself lost.

676
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:39,100
Is that all? And I want you
to think real hard.

677
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,200
Well,
I don't rightly know.

678
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,300
They wasn't here
long enough for me

679
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,300
to get up close
and personal with 'em,

680
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,700
like I do most assholes
that come wandering in here.

681
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,900
How about you write them same
directions out for me then?

682
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,200
All right, all right. Don't get all
"True Grit" on my ass.

683
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,900
You can knock yourself
silly for all I care.

684
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,500
Enough talk!
Write.

685
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,500
I don't know where
that skunk ape sleeps.

686
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,700
All I know is, that he had
impure relations with my wife.

687
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,300
That's true, he performed lurid
acts upon me and my person.

688
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
Hold up the picture.

689
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,300
I'm gonna kill that skunk ape.

690
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,100
Please, Tiny.
Please let me go.

691
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
Let me go.
Help me.

692
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,400
Please, God, please.

693
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Thank you.
Thank you.

694
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,700
I'm just gonna go now.

695
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,900
I'm just gonna go home.

696
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,400
I'm just gonna go home now.

697
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm just gonna go home now.

698
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,200
I'm just gonna go now.

699
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,800
I'm just going home now.

700
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,500
Where the fuck do you think
you're getting to?

701
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,500
No, no, no...

702
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,500
Playtime is over.

703
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,000
It matches.

704
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,200
Call it in.

705
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,500
- I think we found 'em.
- Yeah.

706
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,500
Hey, poopie pants.
What's new?

707
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,300
Where the fuck is Bill? Where's
Denise? You can't keep us here.

708
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,100
Shut up!

709
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,600
Wanna play a guessing game?

710
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,300
Guess what number I'm thinking of.

711
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,400
Eat shit and die.

712
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,900
No, wait, please. Come on, stop it.
What do you want from me?

713
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,300
- What do you want from...
- Be quiet. I don't wanna slip.

714
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Okay, one more.

715
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,100
You get this right,
I'll let you go.

716
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,600
If you get it wrong,
you are fucked!

717
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,700
Who's my favorite movie star?

718
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,100
I don't know.

719
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,300
Marilyn Monroe.

720
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,000
No, Betty Davis.
Sorry, you lose!

721
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,700
Ah-hhh!

722
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,600
Jesus, somebody
had themselves a field day

723
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,700
beating the shit out this thing,
didn't they?

724
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,000
Yeah.

725
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,700
No mercy shown here.

726
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,300
Didn't find any bodies, did ya?

727
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,500
- Not yet.
- Holy Christ.

728
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,800
What could these kids have done
to bring this much hell down on 'em?

729
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,200
- I found something.
- What's that?

730
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,200
Keys.

731
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,200
Don't stand there like some
prize dog, Dick, open the trunk.

732
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,500
- Yes, sir.
- Toss them here.

733
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,300
- Oh, Goddamn.
- You got something, Georgie?

734
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,700
Yeah.

735
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,300
We found something.

736
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,600
People come, people go,

737
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,400
but how many ever stop
to take a look

738
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,700
at the underbelly of the beast?

739
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,900
I make 'em stop
and I make 'em look.

740
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,500
Hope you like what you see.

741
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,900
Hope you like what you see!

742
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Just hold it a minute, Grandpa.

743
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,700
At a time
like this, you're taking pictures?

744
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
I just couldn't help it.

745
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,300
You look so natural
sitting in that box.

746
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,000
Put me behind the wheel of that
bitch, I'll show you drivin'.

747
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:08,900
You useless fuck. You couldn't
even get your big ass in that seat.

748
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,100
You ungrateful...

749
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,000
Don't start with me, Hugo.

750
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,200
Get off the damn car,
this ain't your living room.

751
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,600
Goddamn grease monkey.

752
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,000
You sure this guy is supposed
to ride with us... in this car?

753
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,500
Mm-hmm.

754
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
This doesn't seem right to me.

755
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,800
It ain't up to us, Chief said pick
him up and take him with us.

756
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,200
Guy's an ex-cop,
figures he can be of some help.

757
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,200
I just hope he doesn't
get in my way, is all I'm sayin'.

758
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,300
This must be him.

759
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,200
- Mr. Willis?
- Yes, sir.

760
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,900
- I'm Wydell, this is Nash.
- How you doin', sir?

761
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,900
Donald Willis.
Any leads?

762
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,200
We were on our way out
to check on a couple of farms

763
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,700
out on the edge of town.

764
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,600
That's about our only lead
up to this point.

765
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,800
What about this body you found?

766
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,900
You know about that?

767
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,100
Local girl.
Karen Murphy.

768
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,100
One of the cheerleaders
that went missing last week.

769
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,100
That's it?

770
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,100
We know the kids
were on their way out

771
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,900
to a place the locals
call Deadwood.

772
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,800
They wanted to play Nancy Drew
with this local legend

773
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,400
people call Dr. Satan.

774
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,800
- This is insane.
- Don't you worry about it.

775
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,500
We'll find her, all right?

776
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,000
My name is Lewis Dover

777
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,800
and I'm no rich man,
but I know the truth.

778
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,800
You don't have to go to hell.

779
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,500
You're in hell... this is hell.

780
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,000
This is hell.
This is hell.

781
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,700
I'm gonna see if anybody's home.
You and Mr. Willis

782
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,300
check around,
see if you see anything.

783
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,600
Come with me.

784
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,900
I hate fucked up families!

785
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,200
- It's just a dip.
- Otis!

786
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,200
Otis, come quick.
There's cops out there.

787
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,300
- What? Damn!
- How many?

788
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,400
- Don't worry about it.
- I don't know. I only saw one.

789
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,200
Fucking pigs always travel in packs.

790
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,300
- Take this.
- What should I do?

791
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,700
Go downstairs and play nice.

792
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,600
I'll go round back and take control
like I always fucking do.

793
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,900
Goddamn.

794
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,800
These packrats throw anything away?

795
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,200
- I don't think so.
- Hold this thing.

796
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:26,200
Hello? Hello?

797
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,500
You'd think these son of bitches
would have a yard sale, don't you?

798
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,900
Yeah.

799
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,200
Hello?

800
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,600
Oh my God!

801
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,500
- Oh my God!
- Calm down, Barney!

802
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,500
Don't even start
with that "Mayberry" shit.

803
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,600
It's only a dog.

804
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,500
I was bit by a cocker spaniel
when I was eight years old.

805
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,100
- Hello, Officer.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

806
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,400
I'm Lieutenant Wydell. I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

807
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,600
Why, heck, I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

808
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,700
I appreciate the cooperation, ma'am.

809
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,100
I'm looking for a missing girl.

810
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,400
I'm serious. It was a big
cocker spaniel... big teeth.

811
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,100
It was my ex-girlfriend's.
Almost bit off my pinky toe.

812
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

813
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,200
Shh, you hear that?

814
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,200
Yeah.

815
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,400
Yeah, I hear it. Where do
you think it's coming from?

816
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,900
Out this way.

817
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,700
All right, hold on,
hold on one second here.

818
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,400
Hey, hey!

819
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,400
Sheriff's Department, open up.

820
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,700
- No, I ain't seen her, sorry.
- Ma'am...

821
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,600
If I could just
come in for a minute.

822
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,300
I have some other pictures
I'd like you to look at.

823
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,700
It might stir something up.

824
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,700
No. I don't think so.

825
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,400
Ma'am.

826
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,600
It'll only take a minute.

827
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,900
Oh, all right.

828
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,900
I guess I can trust you,

829
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,800
being a man of the law.

830
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,300
Yes, ma'am.

831
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,700
Thank you, ma'am.

832
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,700
Oh, this one looks familiar.
Is he on the TV?

833
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,500
No, ma'am,
I don't believe he is.

834
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,200
- Wydell?
- Excuse me, ma'am.

835
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,000
- Wydell, over! Wydell, over!
- Wydell, over.

836
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,500
Let me take a guess here.
Y'all havin' a Halloween Party.

837
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,500
What makes you think that,
big boy?

838
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,300
You sure are buying a whole mess
of holy water for two people.

839
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,200
We like to get fucked up
and do fucked up shit.

840
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,200
- You know what I mean?
- I like to get fucked up too.

841
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,400
- Do some fucked up shit.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

842
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,500
How much we owe ya, goober?

843
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,200
Actually it's G. Ober,
for Gerry Ober,

844
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,700
but the new guy, Romald in the back,
he drew in that other O

845
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,300
and made Goober.
Fucking asshole.

846
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,900
Great story, Goober.
How much we owe ya?

847
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,900
The damage is quite severe.

848
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
- $185.
- That ain't gonna break my bank.

849
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,500
Here, keep the change and go
get yourself a new name, Goober.

850
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,200
Holy dog, I will, thank you.

851
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:04,000
You all drive safe. Thanks for
comin' in to Red Hot Pussy Liquor.

852
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,400
Where's Otis? Where's Otis?

853
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,700
He's comin'. He's got
something real special this year.

854
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,200
Otis, Otis, Otis...

855
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,200
I'm the one who brings
the Christmas candy.

856
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,200
Now tell me,

857
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,300
who's your daddy?

858
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,400
I'm the one who brings
the devil's brandy.

859
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,300
Who's your daddy?!

860
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,300
I'm the one who beats you
when you're bad.

861
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,100
- Who's your Daddy?!
- Who's your Daddy?!

862
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,900
Come on, sweetie,
give the old man some sugar.

863
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,100
Daddy, Daddy.

864
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,300
And I'm the one who loves ya

865
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,900
when you're fucking dead.

866
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,400
Who's your Daddy?!
Who's your Daddy?!

867
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,100
Well, I say my little darlings.

868
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,000
Maybe it ain't a good idea to be
prancing around

869
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,700
where you don't belong.

870
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,100
And you,
the great rusher of fools,

871
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,000
what was it that you were after?

872
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,500
Come on, speak to me, boy.
I remember now.

873
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,200
Dr. Satan.

874
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,200
Goddamn it, everybody
got to know about Dr. Satan.

875
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,800
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna do you a favor.

876
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,900
I'm gonna let you
meet the old bastard.

877
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,900
It's all true.

878
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,600
The bogeyman is real
and you found him.

879
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,000
And you found him...

880
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,600
Hey, happy boy,
step your ass up here.

881
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,600
Take his gag out.
It's more fun with the screaming.

882
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:57,900
I like that too. That screaming
is much more exciting that way.

883
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,600
Please don't kill us,
please don't kill us.

884
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,700
Please don't kill us...
nah... please don't kill us.

885
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:09,000
Shut your mouth
and get your shit in the box.

886
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,600
- Get in now.
- Wait, wait, wait...

887
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,800
I wanna say goodbye.

888
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,700
Goodbye, sweetie.

889
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,600
We could've been great.

890
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,800
Just let us go, I swear to God
we won't tell anyone.

891
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:38,300
- I swear...
- Honey, you know I can't do that.

892
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,100
I swear to God,
we won't tell. I swear to God.

893
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,000
Ain't we just having a fucking hoot?

894
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,100
Get your fucking ass up, boy.

895
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,200
Come on, we aint' got all night.

896
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,700
Where does she think
she's gonna run to?

897
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,200
- She gonna run all the way home?
- No, let me get her.

898
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,700
All right, go get her.

899
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,900
Huntin' humans,
ain't nothin' but nothin'.

900
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,500
They all run like
scared little rabbits.

901
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,300
Run, rabbit, run.

902
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,900
Run, rabbit.

903
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,500
Run, rabbit. Run, rabbit.

904
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,500
Run, rabbit, run!

905
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,000
Run, rabbit!

906
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,700
There once was a woman

907
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,000
who lived with her daughter
in a cabbage garden.

908
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,800
Along came a rabbit
and ate up all the cabbages.

909
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,700
The woman said, "Go into the garden
and drive out the rabbit."

910
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,000
Mary.

911
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,000
Told you.
I'm gonna get you.

912
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,100
Mary.

913
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,700
Mary...

914
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,600
I'm gonna get you.
I'm coming to get you.

915
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,400
"Shoo, shoo," said the maiden.

916
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,600
"Come, maiden," said the rabbit.

917
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,800
"Sit on my tail and go with me
to my rabbit hutch."

918
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,100
No-ooo, no!

919
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,200
No hanky-panky.
Rufus, put the lid on.

920
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,300
No-ooo!

921
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,000
No-ooo!

922
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,200
Oh, no!

923
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,100
No!

924
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,000
No, no, no!

925
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,800
Stop! No!

926
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,200
No!

927
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,300
No-ooo!

928
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,300
No, no-ooo!

929
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,700
Bury me in a nameless grave.

930
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,800
Bury me in a nameless grave.

931
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:41,700
Jerry, wake up, wake...

932
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,400
Jerry, wake up, wake up, wake up.

933
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,400
Bury me in a nameless grave.

934
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,200
Bury me in a nameless grave.

935
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,600
Oh my God!

936
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,600
- No-ooo!
- Jerry!

937
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,700
No, Jerry!

938
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,400
Please! Help!

939
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,200
Help me!

940
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,500
I can't see anything!

941
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,800
Jerry? Is that you?

942
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,300
Jerry?

943
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,600
Jerry? Thank God.

944
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,700
Please help me.

945
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,600
God!

946
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,100
Jerry?

947
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,200
Oh, God, no, no, no...

948
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,000
No!

949
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,300
No-ooo!

950
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,700
No!

951
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,100
God, no, no.

952
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,800
No, no!

953
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,700
No-ooo!

954
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,200
Go away!

955
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,900
Go away!

956
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,400
Sweet baby Jesus, girl.
What the hell happened to you?

957
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,300
I got away.

958
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,800
I recognize you.

959
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,500
There's a whole bunch of people
been looking for your ass.

960
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,000
- I gotta get to a doctor.
- All right, all right.

961
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Just sit back and relax.

962
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,300
I'll get you to a doctor.

963
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,000
Come on... that's it,
that's it.

964
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,600
I'll get you there,
yeah, yeah.

965
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,200
Oh, yeah!

966
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:57,900
