1
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:13,569
- Swing?
- No.

2
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:16,269
A sock?

3
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:18,269
Sports?

4
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:20,224
Are you sure?

5
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:23,272
Yes, I have just seen that
begins with the letter "S".

6
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:24,867
That's impossible!
I have everything listed.

7
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:26,990
It is not. Papa `s fart!

8
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:29,990
That is not fair.
That was 15 minutes ago.

9
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,150
And it must be something that you can see, like ...

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,671
For example ...

11
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:37,867
I see something that starts with the letter ...

12
00:00:38,194 --> 00:00:38,671
"Z"

13
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:42,352
- The sun?
- Very good.

14
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:43,469
My turn! My turn!

15
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:47,272
I see something that starts with the letter "W".

16
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,672
- The desert?
- No.

17
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:57,272
Stop, Mum!

18
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:58,589
Stop!

19
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:01,463
Where are the wipers?

20
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:02,749
At your left hand!

21
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:16,229
What the hell ...?

22
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:24,582
Has anyone seen anything?

23
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,192
Fortunately, it is a rental car.

24
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:29,792
Bick!

25
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:35,912
Bick!

26
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,910
Bick, come here, man.

27
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:43,990
Where are you, dude?

28
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:49,912
- Get in the car.
- Why?

29
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:51,308
Because I said so.

30
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,309
Bick?

31
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:06,189
Honey?

32
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:17,629
Oh, my God!

33
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,312
Mama, Mama, Mom ...

34
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:29,751
I see it.
We get help for Bick!

35
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:33,703
Come on, dude!

36
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:04,303
Translation: PvdB © 2006

37
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:19,909
From my own kitchen ...

38
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:21,502
pure ...

39
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,027
composed with MGMA.

40
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:28,348
I feel obliged to your users
these drugs that they might ...

41
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:34,032
confusion, disorientation, blurred images
and hallucinations can get.

42
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:36,549
Be warned.

43
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,346
How do I know that these are real?

44
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,073
That is proof enough for me.

45
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,589
Stay here!

46
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:25,589
So ...

47
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,513
going to "Arial 52"?

48
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:30,113
Yes, we have come a bit late.

49
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:39,783
Note the movement!

50
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:48,312
- So, we ...
- We are awaiting one.

51
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:52,313
- Is this the right group?
- You must have Trip.

52
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:54,426
The only real!
Nelsen how are you?

53
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:58,223
- This cookie is Jack ...
- And Gratchen.

54
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:01,507
Cookie, Jack, Gratchen.
Cookie, Jack, Gratchen ... Gotcha.

55
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:05,628
Please, hands and feet within
keep the vehicle.

56
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:08,833
Sanitary stops according insight
the driver made.

57
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:13,144
And if someone asks whether we are already in place,
on such a crazy fun show ...

58
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:14,629
He runs the rest of the trip.

59
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:19,546
Are we there yet?

60
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,947
Have you ever been in "Arial 52" been?

61
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,147
- I am last year.
- And?

62
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:35,945
It is by far the best festival in the desert.

63
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:38,874
I have made recordings.
You would have to see them.

64
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:43,067
- And you, Grächen?
- I have my friend know.

65
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:47,584
I've heard that too
mad university teacher.

66
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:51,467
- How do you know Gratchen?
- She is one of my discussion leaders.

67
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:53,462
And how about you, Trip?

68
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:58,071
There are there of those girls that their bodies
with berries and painting around topless.

69
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:00,466
You would die if you saw it, dude.

70
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:01,908
Tits sky.

71
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,506
- Make me ridiculous.
- Why?

72
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:06,703
I can not see.

73
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:08,708
Really?

74
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,103
I am blind.

75
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:18,107
That is a good one.
Do you exercise at home?

76
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:21,182
What happened?

77
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:25,631
A mess tick ... when I was 6.

78
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:30,034
After my accident they stopped
with that tag.

79
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:31,513
What, were you?

80
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:33,707
You know, that plastic was not fun anymore.

81
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:34,704
They were worthless.

82
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,506
Well, you can thank my brother there.

83
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,109
- Excuse me.
- No ...

84
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,749
Really?

85
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:52,144
Can someone nominate me men?

86
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:54,953
Of course, this way.

87
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:06,267
About our journey ...
we are in situations that ...

88
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:08,352
Jack can take care of.

89
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:11,343
This guy is good.

90
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:17,753
- Asshole.
- I was not.

91
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:20,749
Is he really ...?

92
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:27,590
I think I can make.
Listen to this.

93
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:32,789
That you do not?

94
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:34,549
Yes, I did.

95
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:37,592
Let me never in a
room with someone or something.

96
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:39,462
That guy is crazy.

97
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:42,394
He lost his medical license
sleeping with a ... body.

98
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,187
Oh yes, that is.

99
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,313
And he was the one who murdered her.

100
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:49,189
This legend is too much for just one person.

101
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:50,389
Who was that?

102
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,790
And what he does not know can
me no harm.

103
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:01,585
Maybe I'm crazy but I am not an idiot.
I tell you one word ...

104
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,629
- Webcam.
- I do not know what you are talking about.

105
00:09:04,874 --> 00:09:09,106
Shut up, you enormous mountain of shit.

106
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:10,829
You took my pills.

107
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:12,833
Threw them in your blue bag ...

108
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,310
and rode away with your friends.

109
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,431
Now I'll be back, I miss them very much!

110
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:24,231
"Arial 52" in Kilton about 2 hours.
If you are not you dead.

111
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:29,233
And, dude, but after question.
I am always after my promises.

112
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:34,229
Who was that?

113
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:38,822
Wrong number.

114
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:45,863
How did you get that nickname?

115
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:50,350
The guys at my house were my Trip
call because I always was.

116
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,552
And where does cookie come from?

117
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:55,747
My parents gave me a name
out when I was 3.

118
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:58,870
If my parents gave me a name
out at that age ...

119
00:09:58,954 --> 00:10:00,273
I would have called fire engine.

120
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:02,873
I would have called Piewie.

121
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:04,833
10 years!

122
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:06,586
- You would be nice to me.
- Why?

123
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:10,384
Because ...
Daddy can make your day.

124
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,870
- Are those drugs?
- Oh, yes ...

125
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,393
And many more where
this came from.

126
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,672
- Why?
- My backpack.

127
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:19,828
What then?

128
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:22,792
Enough for you, me,
for everyone in this car ...

129
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:25,713
and hundreds of our best friends.

130
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:34,028
What?

131
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:38,503
Do not be afraid.

132
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:41,508
I want a good time, but ...

133
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:43,828
No time there?

134
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:45,909
Exactly.

135
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,222
I do not throw it away ...

136
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,629
We are talking about 20 thousand, at least.

137
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,427
Good, but find other transport.

138
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:01,747
- You can not leave me here.
- Call anyone!

139
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:10,194
- I have no reception here.
- While you fix this ...

140
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:11,946
I take a pee act.

141
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:14,230
- You have just been.
- I have just a little bladder.

142
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:22,266
I do not even know what the problem is.

143
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,747
Nelsen, help me with this.

144
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:27,542
Thanks for your support!

145
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:34,747
We have no reception.

146
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,782
$ 50 to bet that the dollar was a 5.2.
Who does it?

147
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:46,264
If the heat does not kill me, his
the earthquakes are.

148
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:50,787
- You can not him to leave.
- Gratchen, come on!

149
00:11:52,314 --> 00:11:52,871
Well ...

150
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:55,784
I take you back to the restaurant.
But that is all.

151
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:03,983
Have you felt that?

152
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:10,989
Fucking music!

153
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,467
Come on, give me a choice.

154
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:19,705
On the way to the biggest festival and listen
to old songs is not for you?

155
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:21,193
Music is a part of life ...

156
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:24,102
There is a perfect song for each
event and it is not.

157
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:27,312
- What for a graduation?
- "The Greatest Day of Your Live"

158
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:30,387
That was easy ...
What to uitzeiken a jade?

159
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:33,387
"Survivor, Eye of the Tiger"

160
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:35,430
And what for "left in the
desert, dying of thirst "

161
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:38,907
Chaupens "Funurel March"

162
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:41,629
- It is a cliché.
- Oh, and not die?

163
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:42,704
O My God!

164
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:52,825
What?

165
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:58,227
Looks like an accident.

166
00:12:58,314 --> 00:12:59,224
Call 112.

167
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:01,229
No reception!

168
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:04,423
Okay, then we stop.

169
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:06,153
But my action starts in an hour.

170
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,152
Listen ...

171
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:13,947
When accidents and police
we now have.

172
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,753
It has been arranged.
Someone will be called.

173
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,946
That is good to know.

174
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:22,633
Because you never know what the next
day ... following minute occurs.

175
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:26,873
Leave it for this weekend.

176
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:42,273
What is this? No goodbye?

177
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:44,872
You can call me grateful that I have
to have here.

178
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,865
Do this to me!
I want a ballot.

179
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:12,912
Looks like your gas pipe
is cut.

180
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:15,909
Cut?

181
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:17,303
Got Duck Tape?

182
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:20,788
Should it?
I have patches in the trunk.

183
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:25,190
Look in my backpack, sit back condoms.
I have this hole shut.

184
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,144
You are kidding?

185
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,986
Whether you have a better idea?

186
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,509
A whole box?

187
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:38,503
You never know.

188
00:14:40,074 --> 00:14:41,507
What are you complacent.

189
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:44,310
Probably if I knew what it meant.

190
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:47,309
Look what you?

191
00:14:48,674 --> 00:14:49,868
Have you stolen from Trip?

192
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:52,832
It is not a steal if you
can not give.

193
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:54,823
Yes, it will do.

194
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:05,230
- Does it?
- Yes, I'm okay.

195
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:15,423
There is something in the air.

196
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:23,469
Made.

197
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:28,143
I am sorry that I am suspicious.
But I prefer to take no risk 's.

198
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,946
Hi, I'm Trip. Your opposite.

199
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:36,069
- What is the verdict?
- We need petrol.

200
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:39,867
- The petrol station is closed.
- Then what we borrow.

201
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:46,869
Where is Jack?

202
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:00,782
Please do not tell me that we
that blind guy lost his.

203
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,392
I hear nothing.

204
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,787
Is he still deaf?

205
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:11,789
Are we in the same restaurant?

206
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:14,789
Hello?

207
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:16,783
Is someone here?

208
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:18,983
Where is everybody gone?

209
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:24,187
Oh, you can even specify that meatloaf?

210
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,343
We can use their phone.

211
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,994
He must not use.
There is no dial tone.

212
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,826
What is on here?

213
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:37,307
Everyone here has a dish.

214
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:39,830
700 one hundred channels,
the American dream, right?

215
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,829
And we have nothing?

216
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:51,784
Is anyone there?

217
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:53,432
We need help with our car.

218
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:20,949
Still nothing!

219
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:28,152
- Did you hear that?
- Opus?

220
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:29,949
Wait, go back!

221
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:31,749
Trip, do not move!

222
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:36,789
What?

223
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,793
There is some disaster in progress.

224
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,787
They have the roads closed!

225
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:51,906
- I heard Bayo!
- From Cantrex?

226
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:53,586
That explains the busy tone.

227
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:56,909
I hope no one is injured.

228
00:17:57,554 --> 00:18:00,512
Okay, let's not respond.
We certainly do not know what they said.

229
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:05,708
So we are here for tonight?

230
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:07,707
We have no other choice.

231
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,107
We must be the phones
monitor.

232
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:12,113
Well, I take the first watch.

233
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:22,109
- The water does not work.
- The bed does.

234
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:26,224
Where else have you get some
entertainment for a penny?

235
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,233
You are funny for a blind guy.

236
00:18:31,754 --> 00:18:32,425
Thank you.

237
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:48,631
What?

238
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,150
Coffee machine, duster and slippers?

239
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:55,149
Oh, no ...

240
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:03,424
I am not the biggest party
miss the west coast ...

241
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:05,106
I have the whole school to watch.

242
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:07,662
And if I do not go, I have a large
problem if you want to know.

243
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:11,947
There must be somewhere
petrol ones!

244
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:18,953
It may be even worse!
Maybe this is the house we wrestlers.

245
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,750
Is there in the brochure
2 nice girls ...

246
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:24,271
beer ...

247
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:26,944
Jesus Christ!

248
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:30,989
Look at this mess!

249
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:32,588
What the hell is that?

250
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:37,068
You never know who you find.

251
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:38,389
Yes, okay.

252
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:41,869
Look at this post.

253
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:44,393
Is this a ...

254
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:46,269
A light dart gun.

255
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:48,271
Nice.

256
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,267
Mad!

257
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,305
Come on!

258
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:47,349
Hello.

259
00:21:08,394 --> 00:21:09,349
Damn!

260
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:12,347
Let's go.
Here is one!

261
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,342
Are you afraid of the dark?

262
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:20,149
No, I'm afraid of crazy desert people
to hunt small animals with gardening.

263
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:22,667
We still have this angle
not searched.

264
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:28,073
You do that but then I go back
to the girls and beer.

265
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:31,582
Is the parent child afraid?

266
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:36,586
This is not normal here.
Soon, we find someone head.

267
00:21:49,954 --> 00:21:51,103
So what?

268
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:05,106
Look, this is a classic.

269
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:09,065
Where do you doing to
in order to stalk people.

270
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:13,113
In a flower shop know you do not really
when people besluipt.

271
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:17,109
Nelsen ...

272
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:20,827
love the girls in the holes.
I'm going to save us.

273
00:22:23,874 --> 00:22:25,307
Do you think this means anything?

274
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:29,824
Yes ... that was crazy here
too much time to kill.

275
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:32,546
Who wrote this is a fool.

276
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,025
This is just not really a 5 star hotel ...

277
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:37,826
So I stay in my tent tonight.

278
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:40,626
I walk a little road
and look around.

279
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,627
I do not think that way
should go.

280
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:46,034
Thank you, Madam jitterbug,
but it's not "we" but I do.

281
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:48,744
If you're lucky to get to
petrol back if not then ...

282
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:51,352
look forward to the light arrow!

283
00:22:56,394 --> 00:22:58,430
- There was rotting meat, or not?
- Yes.

284
00:22:58,994 --> 00:22:59,744
Good nose.

285
00:23:00,594 --> 00:23:02,744
We have hit someone
collection of animals found.

286
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:08,147
Would you hold my hand?

287
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:11,549
You seem like nice but I
'm not that way!

288
00:23:12,314 --> 00:23:13,952
You are truly an idiot!

289
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:19,465
No, with the hands is difficult.
Let me hold your arm and point the way.

290
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,468
Grab on!

291
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:26,345
I'm still a
role thread to me ...

292
00:23:26,714 --> 00:23:29,353
As soon as we have been strangely
I place the wire ...

293
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:32,471
so I do not have to count my steps ...
No surprises.

294
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:35,744
So I always did the first years.

295
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:37,665
- Smart solution for the blind.
- Exactly.

296
00:23:38,714 --> 00:23:41,182
We have decided to strip all
"worried" to do.

297
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:42,992
- We start with the cooler.
- Come on.

298
00:24:10,354 --> 00:24:11,503
Be careful that it does not burn!

299
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:12,989
Can you smell that?

300
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:15,306
I must save my
other senses.

301
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:19,222
You know that smell the first
sense after the birth ...

302
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:22,105
and the last sense is if you die.

303
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,109
You are now no
tell ghost stories, do you?

304
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,905
Because I ... have meaning to dance.

305
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:33,626
Have you seen news of the week?

306
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:36,914
The FBI is looking for a cook.

307
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:40,311
Its special ingredient is the
flesh of his victims.

308
00:24:42,354 --> 00:24:44,310
He was last seen
working in the restaurant ...

309
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:46,309
in the desert ...

310
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:49,349
"Half Way" ...

311
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:52,829
to the 2 lane ...

312
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:54,150
Highway!

313
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:57,823
There is someone!

314
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:00,145
Who?

315
00:25:01,194 --> 00:25:02,547
In the restaurant I saw someone.

316
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:04,023
Are you sure?

317
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:07,152
I hope that you look at me!

318
00:25:08,194 --> 00:25:10,150
I still have to Jack if you
want to see.

319
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:17,752
He was just there!

320
00:25:22,794 --> 00:25:23,749
Anybody home?

321
00:25:29,114 --> 00:25:30,547
I will have imagined it.

322
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,067
I should have known better.

323
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:40,991
Never pills foreign adoption!

324
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:46,992
Would you like a drink of a guy
you already know a half day?

325
00:26:03,754 --> 00:26:04,266
Cookie?

326
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,709
Yes, I do the same what you will.

327
00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:33,709
Hello?

328
00:26:35,354 --> 00:26:36,707
Hello, I said hello.

329
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:41,022
All lines are dead!

330
00:27:01,314 --> 00:27:03,544
We have no petrol
and lost.

331
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:07,073
We wanted it all back!

332
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,073
Here ...
Take this.

333
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:16,547
Let me not have to use!

334
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:25,272
What is the last thing you saw?

335
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:27,669
The blue sky.

336
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:29,669
I remember the color blue.

337
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,667
But which do they need?

338
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:36,072
Your eyes take you
more often in the leg.

339
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,024
Now we are talking about ...

340
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,991
I go to Nelsen and cookie look.

341
00:28:34,674 --> 00:28:35,550
Yes?

342
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:11,866
I love Gratchen 's accent.

343
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:16,467
I love that they
nobody picked up.

344
00:29:18,314 --> 00:29:20,464
Oh, God. She is a rock in the surf!

345
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:23,787
Is it not a South African?

346
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:26,582
And Jack is the sweetest!

347
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:31,671
If he could see I would both
thumbs up stabbing.

348
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:36,146
You wil not easy?

349
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,988
I know a lovely bed
so the corner.

350
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:01,993
Have they found him?

351
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:04,508
I think they have invented
alone can be.

352
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,509
Were they both?

353
00:30:08,554 --> 00:30:09,509
Yes, why?

354
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:11,711
Nothing.

355
00:30:13,754 --> 00:30:14,709
Nothing, what?

356
00:30:16,754 --> 00:30:18,426
Nothing, I thought what I smoke.

357
00:30:19,674 --> 00:30:21,312
Smoke, like an animal?

358
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:25,952
Just as that was on 2 legs.

359
00:30:42,994 --> 00:30:45,952
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

360
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:47,947
I know that you are!

361
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:02,754
I am looking for my wife,
Rose Stakkisch. She is a ...

362
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:05,346
pretty blonde in a indianenjas.

363
00:31:06,434 --> 00:31:08,072
Have you seen her?

364
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,789
No ...

365
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:12,269
No, I ...

366
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:15,389
I have a few friends who
few km away wait ...

367
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:17,790
You know ...

368
00:31:18,234 --> 00:31:19,792
If not I'll be back soon,
they find me.

369
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:21,789
Clear.

370
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:25,665
Come closer and
let me see you.

371
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,311
You're the first person
I see in hours.

372
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:49,511
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

373
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:54,422
- And you?
- Yes, it can not be better.

374
00:31:55,474 --> 00:31:57,430
Come on, climb in it than I give you a lift.

375
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:01,706
No, it does not I'm okay.

376
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:03,909
Are you sure?

377
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:06,631
You never know what you're here
all come across.

378
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:19,629
Can I try?

379
00:32:20,194 --> 00:32:21,627
Nothing but silence.

380
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:26,426
It is all just weird
here tonight.

381
00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:28,427
Even with the roads.

382
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:32,429
What about roads?

383
00:32:33,474 --> 00:32:34,429
Closed!

384
00:32:37,114 --> 00:32:38,467
Shit, it becomes clear.

385
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:41,469
Breaker, Breaker!

386
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:44,951
Hello?

387
00:32:46,994 --> 00:32:48,871
You can try until you
lips are blue ...

388
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:50,542
There is nobody out there.

389
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:04,067
You said you waited on your friends?

390
00:33:05,114 --> 00:33:07,867
Yes. Yeah, at the crossroads.
You can not miss.

391
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:11,784
Do not worry.
I bring you back safe and sound.

392
00:33:20,114 --> 00:33:21,069
There is someone!

393
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:27,108
Finally!

394
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:39,107
Where are Nelsen and cookie?

395
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:41,510
- They have a chamber.
- They pay per hour.

396
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:43,903
- Is everyone okay?
- Yes, why?

397
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:47,234
Well, I want you in the eye
keep. Do you know?

398
00:33:48,274 --> 00:33:49,184
Are you okay?

399
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:52,710
Yes, it is perfect to me.
Everything is all right.

400
00:33:53,274 --> 00:33:54,229
Oh, this is ...

401
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:57,432
- Oh, Henry, Henry Stakkisch.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

402
00:33:57,754 --> 00:33:58,823
Henry ... Gratchen, Jack.

403
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:01,230
Jack is blind.

404
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,230
Tell me, where are you from?

405
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:07,226
I drove in circles.

406
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:13,114
- Are you okay?
- Yes, this is it. They did.

407
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:16,424
- He search for his wife.
- Yes.

408
00:34:16,874 --> 00:34:18,148
When did you last seen her?

409
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:22,147
This morning.
It was decided this morning.

410
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,749
What happened?

411
00:34:25,794 --> 00:34:27,352
I have problems with ...

412
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:29,749
my memory.

413
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:32,546
I got those empty spots and ...

414
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:36,028
I did not tell Rose.
Its not alarm ...

415
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,985
She's okay, I know for sure.

416
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:42,032
They are waiting at a petrol station
until the roads reopen.

417
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:44,826
Okay, great. Enough hot-air.

418
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:47,065
Ok.

419
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:51,072
- That was weird!
- Listen, I want to sleep here, okay?

420
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:54,024
Trip has just seen.

421
00:34:54,114 --> 00:34:56,867
Make it easy and close the door, okay.
Call if you need anything.

422
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:07,549
Hold on!

423
00:35:10,914 --> 00:35:11,551
Hey ...

424
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:12,589
I check me.

425
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:13,869
Have you found something?

426
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:16,065
Yes, an old man in a camper.

427
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:18,994
- Are all the roads open?
- No, he will stay here tonight.

428
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,673
- Everything OK with you?
- Can not be better.

429
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:24,667
Well, then I locked the door.

430
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:25,664
What is wrong?

431
00:35:26,314 --> 00:35:29,272
Let no one inside and call
me as strange as you like.

432
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:40,273
- Why is he suddenly so strange?
- He takes us in the leg.

433
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:43,509
- Why?
- Because it is so.

434
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:45,986
Well, there he is good at it.

435
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:47,311
Yes.

436
00:35:58,354 --> 00:36:00,310
Help me!
Somebody, help!

437
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:11,507
What happened, man?

438
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:15,424
I'm awake!
Get me out of here!

439
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,827
Come on!

440
00:36:19,874 --> 00:36:20,829
Jesus!

441
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:10,189
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

442
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:15,188
Did you ...

443
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:17,188
anything?

444
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:18,184
No.

445
00:37:19,234 --> 00:37:20,189
You?

446
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:23,072
No ... no.

447
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,108
Where you looking at?

448
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:38,310
Who are you?

449
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:42,303
What did you do to him?

450
00:37:44,354 --> 00:37:45,707
You've seen him?

451
00:37:47,354 --> 00:37:48,104
Yes.

452
00:37:49,674 --> 00:37:50,709
You saw the people dying.

453
00:37:52,754 --> 00:37:53,709
People?

454
00:37:54,754 --> 00:37:56,107
Are there any more?

455
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:05,510
A couple on the weather ...
or what their left.

456
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:08,832
I wanted to help them but I could not do anything.

457
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:11,829
And that guy ...

458
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,550
Oh, God. The boy was scalped ...

459
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:16,743
There was blood everywhere!

460
00:38:21,794 --> 00:38:22,988
It was a trucker ...

461
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:24,746
I saw a trucker, a semi trucker.

462
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:33,227
I am afraid that one ...

463
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,270
this is my Rose has.

464
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:38,871
Wait ...

465
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:40,747
give us some petrol so that way we can.

466
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,708
No, I needed every drop
for my wife to find.

467
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:46,262
But you are welcome to me
to find the morning.

468
00:38:59,634 --> 00:39:01,272
Are we still your prisoner?

469
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:04,874
I want you in mind.
On both of you!

470
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,470
- What happened out there?
- I do not know.

471
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,070
Maybe I have someone
very angry, made ...

472
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:13,263
or maybe I am just crazy.

473
00:39:14,034 --> 00:39:15,228
You owe me one ...

474
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:19,068
- I am beginning to be tired.
- Okay, wait a minute.

475
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:21,591
Hey ...

476
00:39:22,114 --> 00:39:24,582
- Can you scream?
- If no other.

477
00:39:25,434 --> 00:39:26,583
Okay, use it if necessary.

478
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,784
I wonder if anyone knows
we missing?

479
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,472
Joshua, you will find.

480
00:40:57,514 --> 00:40:59,982
You say that with much conviction,
while your roommate is.

481
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:02,786
- He is your friend.
- No.

482
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:04,587
To answer your question.

483
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:08,187
No, he will not find me.
He does not know that I'll visit him.

484
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:09,468
I wanted to surprise him.

485
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:14,270
It is not so good between
you two, either.

486
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:17,790
It is never really gone.

487
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:22,783
- Did he tell you?
- No, the walls are very thin.

488
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,313
I think he sees someone else.

489
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:28,309
But he does not allow.

490
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,912
I wanted to confront him on it this weekend.

491
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:37,912
- There are better.
- That is all.

492
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:32,947
I have a stupid question ...

493
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:35,673
would you want you could see?

494
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,072
- Some things.
- Like what?

495
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:41,069
Jou.

496
00:42:44,114 --> 00:42:47,026
I remember how all normal
things look like ...

497
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:49,992
such as people, buildings, nature,
friendliness ...

498
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:54,792
They have never had a woman appreciated.

499
00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:57,987
You looked into her eyes and you
it could drown.

500
00:42:58,714 --> 00:43:01,865
I was 7 years. Then me
it is not so much.

501
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:08,991
Sweet.

502
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:14,270
Your tent is about ...
3 steps to the left.

503
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:16,308
I now sleep.

504
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:23,505
Tomorrow ...

505
00:43:24,554 --> 00:43:26,784
we go on the road.
Tomorrow we are.

506
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:28,789
Yes.

507
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:44,752
Yes?

508
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:46,187
Help, there is an accident!

509
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:29,229
Mongol!

510
00:45:56,394 --> 00:45:57,827
Then, sick bitch!

511
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:23,263
What do you want from me?

512
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:24,749
Where are you?

513
00:46:25,794 --> 00:46:27,671
We can fix this!
In Redfort!

514
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:44,269
Wait!

515
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:45,984
No ...

516
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:48,983
I gotta pee!

517
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:52,184
Oh, you and your bladder ...

518
00:46:53,234 --> 00:46:54,713
Can I what to do.

519
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,709
- Go to pee!
- This is broken!

520
00:46:59,954 --> 00:47:01,512
I'm back.

521
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:04,704
Ok.

522
00:47:06,754 --> 00:47:08,187
Try not been ...

523
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:10,383
to masturbate!

524
00:47:13,034 --> 00:47:13,705
Ok.

525
00:49:44,914 --> 00:49:45,869
Help! Help!

526
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:46,864
Help!

527
00:49:48,394 --> 00:49:49,873
Anyone!

528
00:49:55,914 --> 00:49:57,188
Do something, someone!

529
00:49:58,714 --> 00:50:00,067
Anyone! Help me!

530
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:45,985

531
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:03,584

00:52:22,074 --> 00:52:23,029
Are you there?

00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:54,424
Cookie ...

535
00:53:07,594 --> 00:53:09,266
Jesus, stop with the stalk!

536
00:53:09,794 --> 00:53:10,544
Sorry.

537
00:53:11,194 --> 00:53:12,547
Have you seen cookie?

538
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:14,265
No.

539
00:53:14,794 --> 00:53:15,863
And I is not heard.

540
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:17,343
Is not yours?

541
00:53:18,634 --> 00:53:20,989
Gratchen sleep and I got them
not be heard.

542
00:53:24,514 --> 00:53:25,469
Where's Trip?

543
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:29,788
You think they Trip is?

544
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:35,665
- He would not ...
- He is your friend!

545
00:53:36,234 --> 00:53:37,667
I check the phone.

546
00:54:07,754 --> 00:54:08,504
Cookie ...

547
00:54:14,954 --> 00:54:15,704
Cookie ...

548
00:54:21,794 --> 00:54:22,704
Cookie ...

549
00:54:22,794 --> 00:54:24,546
Shh ... Be quiet, be quiet!

550
00:54:28,594 --> 00:54:29,549
I can hear you!

551
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:36,549
Bastard! Bastard!

552
00:54:38,594 --> 00:54:40,550
- 112, you say it.
- Hello ...

553
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:42,306
- Help us.
- Okay, lady.

554
00:54:42,394 --> 00:54:44,783
- Help!
- Okay, Madam, calm down and ...

555
00:54:44,874 --> 00:54:48,344
I do not know what happened,
there is an accident ...

556
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:50,313
- Hello?
- Is anyone hurt?

557
00:54:50,394 --> 00:54:52,828
We need help.
We are halfway Highway 90.

558
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,348
We are about half.
We need help!

559
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:52,429
He does not mind.

560
00:55:53,874 --> 00:55:55,432
Okay, so it is enough!

561
00:55:55,674 --> 00:55:56,629
I got along!

562
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,223
Keep your convenience once!

563
00:57:03,314 --> 00:57:04,269
What the hell ...

564
00:57:45,554 --> 00:57:46,828
Is everyone okay?

565
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:22,471
Nelsen ...

566
00:58:23,994 --> 00:58:24,744
Nelsen ...

567
00:58:26,394 --> 00:58:28,066
Nelsen, wake up!

568
00:58:33,634 --> 00:58:35,067
Nelsen, is everything okay?

569
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:38,394
- Jack, I think he ...
- What?

570
00:58:40,634 --> 00:58:42,067
He is ...

571
00:58:43,634 --> 00:58:45,067
What, dead?

572
00:58:53,514 --> 00:58:55,982
He was in the search cookie.
He thought they would have to strip.

573
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:03,584
Cookie ...

574
00:59:08,154 --> 00:59:08,904
Trip ...

575
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:17,904
Jack ...

576
00:59:19,274 --> 00:59:20,707
Your hand, are you okay?

577
00:59:26,754 --> 00:59:27,709
I have a ...

578
00:59:29,754 --> 00:59:30,823
deer were found.

579
00:59:43,874 --> 00:59:45,546
How can he sleep through all this?

580
00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:52,553
I do not think he sleeps.

581
01:00:06,994 --> 01:00:09,269
- He is dead.
- What happened?

582
01:00:10,314 --> 01:00:12,270
There are no visible wounds
if you want to know.

583
01:00:13,794 --> 01:00:15,671
Think roadblocks
this agenda?

584
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:16,664
Yes.

585
01:00:18,714 --> 01:00:19,669
Go sit down!

586
01:00:21,194 --> 01:00:23,150
Here is a station ...
Check all channels!

587
01:00:24,194 --> 01:00:25,343
I Trip and cookie search.

588
01:00:28,234 --> 01:00:29,462
You sound really scared!

589
01:00:30,314 --> 01:00:32,987
I am from Johannesburg. There must be very
what happen to me to get scared.

590
01:00:53,554 --> 01:00:54,304
Cookie ...

591
01:00:55,954 --> 01:00:56,704
Trip ...

592
01:01:07,754 --> 01:01:08,709
Hello ...

593
01:01:10,954 --> 01:01:11,909
Is anyone there?

594
01:01:16,474 --> 01:01:18,510
Mayday ...
We need help!

595
01:01:24,074 --> 01:01:28,511
We have an emergency in the
"Half Way" motel on Highway 90. Help!

596
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:02,549
Is anyone there?

597
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:04,549
We need help!

598
01:02:16,634 --> 01:02:17,589
What do you want?

599
01:02:24,034 --> 01:02:24,989
Who is this?

600
01:02:35,354 --> 01:02:36,104
Gratchen ...

601
01:02:40,354 --> 01:02:41,912
There is also a hope that I
not fear.

602
01:02:43,954 --> 01:02:45,387
I have talked with
dead guy in there.

603
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:30,429
Does your not me!

604
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:29,507
This is the mystery ...

605
01:04:30,554 --> 01:04:32,909
the difference between the
light and darkness.

606
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:34,909
Night and day ...

607
01:04:35,954 --> 01:04:37,103
Life and death ...

608
01:04:39,154 --> 01:04:41,714
Resistance can not or you will ...

609
01:04:42,354 --> 01:04:43,309
die here!

610
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,349
"Here I am"

611
01:05:03,394 --> 01:05:04,349
"Help me"

612
01:05:06,674 --> 01:05:07,424
"Jack"

613
01:05:08,874 --> 01:05:09,829
"Help me"

614
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,024
"Jack"

615
01:05:12,114 --> 01:05:12,830
"Help me"

616
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:20,432
Okay, I was graduated!

617
01:05:21,514 --> 01:05:23,072
So you can stop now!

618
01:05:24,114 --> 01:05:26,469
Okay, I understand.
Everyone is now dead.

619
01:05:36,794 --> 01:05:38,466
You are all bastards!

620
01:05:39,794 --> 01:05:41,546
And you Gratchen,
I thought you had more sense.

621
01:05:45,434 --> 01:05:46,992
Leave me the fuck alone!

622
01:06:22,034 --> 01:06:22,784
Gratchen ...

623
01:06:24,274 --> 01:06:25,024
Gratchen ...

624
01:06:28,074 --> 01:06:28,824
Gratchen ...

625
01:06:36,274 --> 01:06:37,024
Jack ...

626
01:06:48,274 --> 01:06:49,024
Shit!

627
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:03,224
Gratchen ...

628
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,064
Hello ...

629
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,069
Gratchen ...

630
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:26,464
Jack ...

631
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:28,269
Run!

632
01:07:44,154 --> 01:07:46,588
Come on!
We go back!

633
01:07:55,634 --> 01:07:56,589
Jesus, Jack ...

634
01:07:57,634 --> 01:07:58,783
Are you okay?

635
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:01,187
My heart is still there.

636
01:08:02,234 --> 01:08:03,189
What happened?

637
01:08:03,554 --> 01:08:04,509
My arm is off!

638
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:07,151
- You make a joke.
- I would want.

639
01:08:07,234 --> 01:08:09,031
- Is he kidding?
- Not this time.

640
01:08:15,074 --> 01:08:18,032
That guy in the room below me
taken an overdose.

641
01:08:19,754 --> 01:08:21,312
His body was found after a week.

642
01:08:23,874 --> 01:08:24,511
His ...

643
01:08:25,074 --> 01:08:25,711
body ...

644
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:28,230
was fluid.
As he began to melt.

645
01:08:29,074 --> 01:08:30,223
That smell ...

646
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,753
was going through the floor.

647
01:08:33,594 --> 01:08:35,027
I never can forget.

648
01:08:36,074 --> 01:08:37,223
That is the stench of ...

649
01:08:37,794 --> 01:08:38,544
"death".

650
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:45,148
So, what do we do?

651
01:08:45,994 --> 01:08:47,143
You can do nothing to death.

652
01:08:48,194 --> 01:08:50,025
It is just when it suits.

653
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:53,146
Jesus Trip.
You should lie down!

654
01:08:53,394 --> 01:08:55,669
No, I'm not going down without a fight!

655
01:08:55,994 --> 01:08:57,268
You will not go!

656
01:08:58,314 --> 01:08:59,667
I do not get the morning ...

657
01:09:00,714 --> 01:09:01,942
So what does that phrase?

658
01:09:04,714 --> 01:09:05,942
But at least you can still see!

659
01:09:06,794 --> 01:09:08,546
And you can still deduct your own.

660
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:11,663
Use your other arm.

661
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:16,673
Do you think that I have not tried?
It is just a stranger to you about it.

662
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,673
It is impossible!

663
01:09:29,714 --> 01:09:30,669
Run!

664
01:10:41,394 --> 01:10:42,349
Take this!

665
01:10:44,914 --> 01:10:46,870
If you do smell ...
shoot you!

666
01:10:47,914 --> 01:10:49,870
A blind is a gun show
a sign of desperation!

667
01:10:50,194 --> 01:10:51,673
Better than you drive.

668
01:11:19,034 --> 01:11:19,864
Come on!

669
01:11:21,714 --> 01:11:22,624
Damn!

670
01:11:22,714 --> 01:11:23,863
Are we there yet?

671
01:11:28,634 --> 01:11:30,113
We have a few hours
to sunrise ...

672
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:32,306
the roads will not be forever
remain closed.

673
01:11:33,354 --> 01:11:34,707
We need to sit!

674
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,187
There is a jerrycan at about 10 meters.

675
01:11:50,274 --> 01:11:51,229
At 9 pm!

676
01:11:56,274 --> 01:11:57,229
It is gone!

677
01:12:01,274 --> 01:12:03,629
- Let us assume that the thing is dead ...
- We are too young to die.

678
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:12,949
On 4 hours!

679
01:12:16,674 --> 01:12:18,744
This thing keeps coming ...
how we stop it?

680
01:12:24,074 --> 01:12:25,746
If you want to live you may not
afraid to die.

681
01:12:27,394 --> 01:12:28,747
Aristotle said that.

682
01:12:30,794 --> 01:12:32,147
Or maybe it was Jerry Gassia.

683
01:12:42,714 --> 01:12:43,669
Have you ever ...

684
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:47,470
sex on top of a camper and had a
doorgedraaide monster you want murder?

685
01:12:49,514 --> 01:12:50,663
No, you do?

686
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:53,670
Yes, once.
But when I was young.

687
01:12:55,034 --> 01:12:56,149
It was not really great.

688
01:12:57,914 --> 01:12:59,188
I would not mind to
have a try.

689
01:13:00,234 --> 01:13:01,462
You're a rat!

690
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:05,469
Jack ...

691
01:13:06,514 --> 01:13:07,469
Jack?

692
01:13:14,034 --> 01:13:16,184
- Are you okay?
- I forgot where we were.

693
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:23,192
What a disaster!

694
01:13:24,954 --> 01:13:27,309
We have that movie?
Can we still earn money.

695
01:13:29,834 --> 01:13:30,391
Damn!

696
01:13:36,034 --> 01:13:36,511
Here ...

697
01:13:37,034 --> 01:13:37,910
take my hand.

698
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:41,910
Okay, last tree ...
quiet!

699
01:13:42,754 --> 01:13:43,311
Ok.

700
01:14:26,394 --> 01:14:27,065
Hey ...

701
01:14:28,114 --> 01:14:29,342
leave him alone!

702
01:14:47,914 --> 01:14:48,664
Jack ...

703
01:14:51,034 --> 01:14:51,864
say something!

704
01:14:57,234 --> 01:14:58,462
Brown eyes ...

705
01:15:01,234 --> 01:15:01,905
Ok.

706
01:15:02,554 --> 01:15:03,509
It is good!

707
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:05,904
I get us out of here.
It is all good!

708
01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:22,909
Happy!

709
01:15:28,554 --> 01:15:29,304
No!

710
01:15:32,354 --> 01:15:34,914
Three are not met.
Are there others?

711
01:17:28,794 --> 01:17:29,749
Hang on!

712
01:18:16,914 --> 01:18:18,393
How did you know that my eyes are brown?

713
01:19:50,514 --> 01:19:51,469
If you want to live ...

714
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:53,262
Do not be afraid to die.

715
01:20:48,874 --> 01:20:49,545
Let me ...

716
01:20:51,394 --> 01:20:53,191
Resistance ... opposition against you is not me!

717
01:20:53,274 --> 01:20:55,230
It is well with you.
Take just a deep breath!

718
01:20:56,794 --> 01:20:58,227
Why did you not help?

719
01:20:58,594 --> 01:20:59,549
I did!

720
01:20:59,994 --> 01:21:00,949
All is well with you.

721
01:21:08,474 --> 01:21:09,953
You have saved lives today.

722
01:21:11,474 --> 01:21:14,432
M, light brown hair,
flown through the windscreen.

723
01:21:15,194 --> 01:21:16,149
Cut throat.

724
01:21:16,874 --> 01:21:19,832
Woman, blond hair,
in 20, internal injuries.

725
01:21:20,914 --> 01:21:21,869
Also deceased.

726
01:21:24,514 --> 01:21:25,663
Dr. Beer, Dr. Baile ...

727
01:21:26,914 --> 01:21:28,142
What's going on?

728
01:21:29,794 --> 01:21:31,466
This is my third fatal accident today.

729
01:21:32,194 --> 01:21:34,594
A few miles away ramde a
truck a car ...

730
01:21:34,594 --> 01:21:35,947
the driver fell asleep behind the wheel.

731
01:21:36,514 --> 01:21:37,947
The entire family has not survived.

732
01:21:38,514 --> 01:21:42,143
- I do not know how much I could have.
- We also have one that has survived.

733
01:21:43,914 --> 01:21:44,664
Madam ...

734
01:21:47,714 --> 01:21:50,865
He drove and when to hold his chest ...

735
01:21:51,434 --> 01:21:54,634
he has heart problems.
I thought it was a heart attack.

736
01:21:54,634 --> 01:21:56,784
And ... when he lost power
on the wheel.

737
01:21:59,834 --> 01:22:02,189
We are talking about 20 thousand, at least.

738
01:22:02,434 --> 01:22:03,787
Good, but find other transport.

739
01:22:05,114 --> 01:22:07,867
- You can not leave me here.
- Call anyone!

740
01:22:08,914 --> 01:22:11,587
- I have no reception here.
- I take a pee act.

741
01:22:32,834 --> 01:22:34,506
They did not even arrive!

742
01:22:48,554 --> 01:22:49,828
"I thought it was a heart attack"

743
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:51,629
"I have no reception here"

744
01:22:51,954 --> 01:22:52,909
"We have no host

745
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:55,623
"I take a pee consult"

746
01:22:55,874 --> 01:22:57,074
"I have to pee"

747
01:22:57,074 --> 01:22:58,507
"Woman, internal injuries"

748
01:22:59,554 --> 01:23:01,354
"Come on, give me an option"

749
01:23:01,354 --> 01:23:03,026
"Light hair,
flown through the windshield "

750
01:23:03,674 --> 01:23:04,629
"Mess tick"

751
01:23:06,674 --> 01:23:09,142
"That is the stench of death ..."

752
01:23:26,194 --> 01:23:28,150
Help ...
there is an accident!

753
01:23:47,434 --> 01:23:49,265
Do you remember anything of the accident?

754
01:23:50,634 --> 01:23:51,271
No ...

755
01:23:52,314 --> 01:23:54,314
Only the collision,
and that was weird ...

756
01:23:54,314 --> 01:23:54,871
I ...

757
01:23:55,714 --> 01:23:56,863
thought I could see.

758
01:23:57,914 --> 01:23:58,983
And I saw you.

759
01:24:00,314 --> 01:24:01,463
And you? 

760
01:24:02,514 --> 01:24:03,469
Nothing.
