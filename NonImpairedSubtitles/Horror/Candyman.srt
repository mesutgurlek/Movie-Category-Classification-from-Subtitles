00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:11,718
(Man) 'They will say that I have shed
innocent blood.

2
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:16,802
'What's blood for
if not for shedding?

3
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,485
'With my hook for a hand

00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:24,526
'l'll split you from your groin
to your gullet.

5
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:47,956
'l came for you.'

6
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:56,438
(Woman) This is the scariest story
I've ever heard

7
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:58,199
and it's totally true.

8
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:01,956
'lt happened a few years ago
near Moses lake in lndiana.

9
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:04,596
'Clara was baby-sitting
for the Johnsons

on his motorcycle.

going out with Billy.

12
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,443
'She was going out with Michael
for about six months

13
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,799
'but she always kind of had
the hots for Billy

14
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,839
'because he was like a bad boy

15
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,646
'and Michael was...
he was just so nice.

16
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,481
'So anyway, she decides
that tonight's the night

17
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:27,646
'that she's going to give Billy
what she never gave to Michael.'

18
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,838
Have you ever heard of Candyman?

19
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:30,803
No.

20
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,316
His right hand is sawn off.

21
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:38,163
He has a hook jammed
in the bloody stump

22
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:40,761
and if you look in the mirror

23
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:43,600
and you say his name five times

24
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:47,396
he'll appear behind you,
breathing down your neck.

25
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,200
You want to try it?

26
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:54,645
'So Billy began.

Candyman...

Candyman...

31
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:08,606
Candyman...

32
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:17,087
No one ever
got past four.

33
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,806
Not here.

34
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:25,196
Go downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

35
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,198
'She looked in the mirror

36
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,198
'and I don't know why

37
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,437
'but she said his name
the last time.'

38
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,165
Candyman.

39
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,403
'She turned out the lights...'

40
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,398
(Clara screaming)

41
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:49,725
...and what he saw turned
his hair white from shock.

42
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:52,395
Killed her.

43
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:54,279
Split her open with his hook

44
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,403
and then killed the baby too.

45
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,603
And Billy got away

46
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:01,605
but soon after,
he went crazy.

47
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,761
My...my roommate's
boyfriend knows him.

48
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:14,882
So when did you first hear this story?

49
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,685
My friend heard it on the radio.

50
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:17,962
It's true. Sick, huh?

51
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:21,005
The baby-sitter just roasted the kid
like it was a turkey or something.

52
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:24,360
So, what's the deal?

53
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,400
You guys doing a page
on serial killers?

54
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,319
Something like that.

55
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:31,205
Well, that's it.
We're done.

56
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,961
- Thanks.
- No problem.

57
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:36,243
See you.

58
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:37,806
See you.

59
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,845
(lmitates young man)
See you.

60
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,235
(Chuckles)

61
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,160
Seems like they're getting
younger every day.

62
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,802
(Man) Does anybody remember
the craze for the pet baby alligators?

63
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:54,715
(Woman) When they got too large to keep
people flushed them down the toilet.

64
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,357
They live in the sewers.
Some or them are 30 feet long.

65
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,440
- Where did this happen?
- In Miami.

66
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:04,440
They went blind and albino
from living in the dark.

67
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:05,596
(Audience laughs)

68
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:09,242
(Boy) It wasn't Miami. It was New York.
I read it in the paper.

69
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,206
Then it must be true.

70
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:12,601
(Audience laughs)

71
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:14,797
Why would Danny and Diane

72
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:17,805
both be suffering
from the same delusion

73
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,600
in two cities
over 1 ,000 miles apart?

74
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:23,163
Let's face it, folks.

75
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,918
There are no alligators in the sewers.

76
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:32,002
No, it's...it's round the campfire.
It's bedtime stories.

77
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:37,003
See, these stories are...
modern oral folklore.

78
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:41,604
They are the unselfconscious reflection
of the fears of urban society.

79
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,246
(Bell ringing)

80
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:44,800
That's lunch.

81
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:05,446
(Man) Like the primordial reptile
it's formed into a monster. Why?

82
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,839
Ouch! Oh...

83
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:14,766
- The dashing professor.
- The lovely wife.

84
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:17,045
Helen, you
know everybody?

85
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:21,598
Crème de la crème...
Harold, Diane, Danny, Stacey.

86
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:24,002
- Hi.
- Hello.

87
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:27,557
So, keep up the good work.
Thank you for your contributions.

88
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:29,160
- Thanks. Bye.
- Awesome lecture.

89
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:32,516
Bye.

90
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:37,802
See ya.

91
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:44,878
So, you want to tell me
about this girl?

92
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,356
What's her name? Stacey.

93
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,683
She could barely look me
in the eyes, Trevor

94
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,565
and she was blushing.

95
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:55,436
Well, I guess it's because
she's madly in love with me.

96
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:58,565
All those bursting
adolescent hormones.

97
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:03,042
- You don't really think...
- No, of course not.

98
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,118
Good. I should hope not.

99
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:08,324
So, what's the matter?

100
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,916
Trevor, you promised
you wouldn't do

101
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:13,515
the urban legends lecture
until next semester.

102
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:16,804
You knew Bernadette and I
were gathering data.

103
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,764
Why did you have to ruin it?

104
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:22,317
I love you dearly
but I can't hold up their education

105
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:25,325
while the two of you
complete your thesis.

106
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:26,761
I have a curriculum
to follow here.

107
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:28,155
Yes, I know.

108
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:30,636
Well...so don't
be mad at me.

109
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:38,756
(Woman) 'lf you look in the mirror
and say his name five times

110
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:41,560
'he'll appear behind you,
breathing down your neck.'

111
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:44,439
(Typing)

112
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:52,199
Can I clean your room?

113
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,925
Oh, sure. Don't mind me.

114
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:55,406
'So Billy began.

115
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:57,122
'He looked in the mirror

116
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,246
'and he said, "Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman..."'

117
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:05,322
Candyman, huh?

118
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,924
Yes. Have you heard of him?

119
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:12,319
- You doing a study on him?
- Yes, I am.

120
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:13,761
What have you heard?

121
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,439
Everybody scared of him
once it get dark.

122
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:20,405
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.

123
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,676
Cabrini Green?

124
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,075
Yeah, in the Projects.

125
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:26,637
I live on the South Side
so I don't know much about it.

126
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:29,759
But my friend know all about it.
Her cousin live at Cabrini.

127
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:31,759
They say he killed a lady.

128
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,320
Can I talk to your friend?

129
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:34,755
Sure.

130
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,196
Kitty?

131
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:45,042
- Yeah, what do you want?
- Lady down here want to talk to you.

132
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:46,401
All right.

133
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,878
She coming.

134
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:55,436
I'm Helen Lyle.

135
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,837
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.

136
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,565
And this is Kitty Culver.

137
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:02,480
Tell her what you told me
about the Candyman.

138
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:07,966
All I know is there was some lady in a tub,
and she heard a noise.

139
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:09,765
Do you remember her name?

140
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:12,236
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

141
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:16,366
She heard banging and smashing like
somebody was making a hole in the wall.

142
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:18,882
So Ruthie called 91 1 .

143
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,918
She said, "Somebody is coming
through the wall."

144
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,038
And they didn't believe her.

145
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,198
They thought the lady
was crazy, right?

146
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:28,837
So she called 91 1 again
and they still didn't believe her.

147
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:32,560
When they finally got
there, she was dead.

148
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:34,001
Was she shot?

149
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,883
No.

150
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:40,244
She was killed with a hook. Schhht!

151
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,486
(Henrietta) It's true.

152
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,524
Yeah, I read it in the papers.

153
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:48,918
(Henrietta) Candyman killed her.

154
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:50,042
(Kitty) Yeah, but...

155
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:52,925
I don't know nothing about that.

156
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:51,081
(Bernadette) Helen, this is sick.

157
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:53,767
This isn't one of your fairy tales.
The woman got killed here.

158
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:57,279
That's not the half of it.

159
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:02,275
That's Cabrini Green
not that you'd recognise it today.

160
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:03,601
Yeah, no kidding.

161
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:05,524
I won't even drive
past there.

162
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:09,196
- A kid got shot there the other day.
- Everyday.

163
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:12,404
OK, now look carefully
at this picture

164
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:14,085
and then this one.

165
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,004
You spot it?

166
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:23,640
No.

167
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,877
That's not Cabrini Green.

168
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:29,084
That's this building,
Lincoln village.

169
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:32,557
My apartment was built
as a housing project.

170
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:33,961
No.

171
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:35,162
Yeah.

172
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,437
Now take a look at this.

173
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:49,681
Once finished the city realised
there was no barrier

174
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:51,678
between here and the Gold Coast.

175
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,963
Unlike over there
where the highway

176
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:56,515
and the el train
keep the ghetto cut off.

177
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:58,683
So they made some
minor alterations.

178
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:01,281
They covered the cinder block
in plaster

179
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,039
and sold the lot off
as condos.

180
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:05,757
How much did you pay
for this place?

181
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:06,922
Don't ask.

182
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:11,877
Now, wait till you see this.

183
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:15,606
Here's the proof.

184
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:22,277
The killer, or killers...

185
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:23,840
they don't know which...

186
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:27,204
smashed their way through
the back of this cabinet.

187
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,005
See? There's no wall there.

188
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:30,998
There's only a medicine chest

189
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,078
separating us from
the other apartment.

190
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,000
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There could be somebody on the toilet.

191
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:40,079
- No, the apartment is vacant.
- Are you sure?

192
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:42,917
There.

193
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,406
OK, now take a look.

194
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:51,321
(Bernadette) That is amazing.

195
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,126
- What?
- There's somebody there. I saw a light.

196
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:55,481
There's nobody there.

197
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:56,517
Psych.

198
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,200
That's not funny.

199
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,717
- You didn't scare me at all.
- Yeah, right.

200
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:08,526
Ow.

201
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:11,722
You don't believe
all that nonsense, do you?

202
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:13,918
I don't. Do you?

203
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:15,117
No.

204
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,636
All right.

205
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:24,561
(Both) Candyman, Candyman,
Candyman, Candyman...

206
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:30,166
...Candyman.

207
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:32,677
Oh, you chicken!

208
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:34,718
You have to do it five times.
Come on.

209
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:38,243
- (Helen) I did it.
- (Bernadette) Better safe than sorry.

210
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:55,841
(Rattling)

211
00:14:57,607 --> 00:14:59,245
Trevor?

212
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,525
No, no!

213
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:10,439
What's the matter?

214
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,319
Oh, Trevor!

215
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:14,239
Who were you expecting?

216
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,125
What time is it?

217
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:20,836
It's late and I'm smashed.

218
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,759
Sorry I scared you.

219
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:57,079
What's with the arsenal,
Bernadette?

220
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:58,476
We're only going eight blocks.

221
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:01,280
You're the one who got us
dressed up like cops.

222
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,204
I just said dress conservatively.

223
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,356
We look like cops.

224
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,164
Why are you trying to scare me?

225
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,477
I'm not trying to scare you.
I just want you to think.

226
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:11,598
The gangs hold
this neighbourhood hostage.

227
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,764
OK, let's just turn around then.

228
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,521
Let's just go back
and we can write a boring thesis

229
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,121
regurgitating the usual crap
on urban legend.

230
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:29,482
We've got a real shot here,
Bernadette.

231
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:31,276
An entire community

232
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:35,281
starts attributing the daily horrors
of their lives to a mythical figure.

233
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:39,559
Now, if Trevor and Archie were in on this
do you think they'd chicken out?

234
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:41,206
In a second.

235
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,597
Exactly.

236
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,325
All right.

237
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:30,518
- You want to wait here for me?
- No.

238
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:32,801
Well, let's go.

239
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,517
(Helen) And lock the car.

240
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:45,406
(Man) Hey now.

241
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,038
Want something, baby?

242
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:50,004
I got it for you.

243
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:54,326
Yo, baby...

244
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,366
Which way you going?

245
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,482
Just going inside.

246
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:00,602
Yeah?

247
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:02,724
Hey, come up in here.

248
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:04,639
Who you looking for?

249
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,240
A friend of ours.

250
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,125
Sure you not the police?

251
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:10,438
Look like five-oh to me.

252
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:13,326
Ask blondie where she going.

253
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,443
Who you going to see?

254
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:19,361
Let's take the stairs.
Come on.

255
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:24,281
(Boy whistling)

256
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,041
Hands up, people!

257
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:28,767
Five-oh coming up
the back door.

258
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:30,918
It's OK
they think we're cops.

259
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,800
They're not going to follow us.

260
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:40,840
Hang on.

261
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,002
Look at this.

262
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:05,606
This is great.

263
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:09,525
(Bernadette) "Sweets to..."

264
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,639
(Helen) "...to the sweet."

265
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:14,638
(Bernadette) "Sweets to the sweet."

266
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,525
Hurry up, Helen.

267
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,797
Let me just get the door.

268
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,599
(Barking)

269
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,001
Sorry.

270
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,321
Jesus, Helen.

271
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:34,318
- Here it is.
- Don't go in there.

272
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:35,846
Come on.

273
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:39,442
Come on.

274
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,762
Jesus, it stinks.

275
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:53,882
See, I was right.

276
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,884
The layout is identical

277
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:58,845
which means the bathroom
is over there.

278
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:01,077
- Helen...
- What's the problem?

279
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:04,085
A woman died in there.
Leave it.

280
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:14,240
It's all right.
There's nothing to see.

281
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,566
Wait a minute.

282
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,962
This is where he crawled
through, right?

283
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:28,879
Yeah.

284
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:35,684
Well, we found it.
Let's go.

285
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:36,876
Wait a second.

286
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,359
OK, hang onto this.

287
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,477
What?

288
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,319
I'm just going to go through

289
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,398
and when I get back,
we're out of here.

290
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:52,205
You've got to be kidding.

291
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:53,925
It's just a derelict apartment.

292
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,078
What if somebody's
packing drugs in there?

293
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:58,084
You just going to apologise
and give them your card?

294
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:01,685
All right, let's listen.

295
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,316
(Helen) There's nobody in there.

296
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:12,121
OK, but hurry up.

297
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,084
Be careful.

298
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:24,720
Give me the camera.

299
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,678
You've got five minutes.

300
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,479
OK, five.

301
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,679
(Camera motor winding)

302
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:28,559
Dammit.

303
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:28,356
Bernadette...

304
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,519
I ran out of film. I've got to back.

305
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:33,598
- No way.
- You can't believe...

306
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,678
No way, Helen.
We're out of here.

307
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:46,796
What you all doing in there?

308
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,276
We're just leaving.

309
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:51,875
You here for the sweep?

310
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,360
No. We're not cops.

311
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:55,165
We're from the university.

312
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:57,477
Well, you don't
belong here, lady...

313
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,360
going through
people's apartments and things.

314
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:03,087
I'm Helen Lyle
and this is Bernadette Walsh.

315
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:04,396
We're doing a thesis

316
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,479
and were wondering if we could
talk to you for a few minutes.

317
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:10,277
Here, this is my card.

318
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:14,400
(Baby crying)

319
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,522
My baby.

320
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,325
Come on.

321
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:19,085
Come on, let's go.

322
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:26,882
You know, whites don't never come
here except to cause us a problem.

323
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,356
Believe me that's not what we want to do.

324
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:35,721
Let's go in.

325
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:48,207
So you say you're doing a study?

326
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,164
What you gonna say?

327
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:52,716
That we bad?

328
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:54,800
We steal?

329
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,565
We gang-bang?

330
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,557
We all on drugs, right?

331
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:03,240
We ain't all like them
assholes downstairs, you know?

332
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:06,847
I just want to raise my child good.

333
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,005
He's a beautiful little boy.

334
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,522
And he's all I got.

335
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:15,236
- What's his name?
- Anthony.

336
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:18,801
I'm Anne-Marie.

337
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:23,241
Anne-Marie McCoy.

338
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:24,442
Nice to meet you.

339
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,006
Sorry we disturbed you.

340
00:25:26,447 --> 00:25:28,244
We'll just get out of your way.

341
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,682
It's OK.

342
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:31,997
I mean, I don't mean
to be rude, and it's...

343
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,236
you know, it's just...

344
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,523
the white folks
that come around here

345
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:38,076
ain't too hand-shaking
with us, you know?

346
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:39,601
(Spitting up)

347
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:42,600
- Hey, what you doing?
- Let me help you.

348
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:47,158
You making
a mess here?

349
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:48,322
Thank you.

350
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:50,245
Thanks.

351
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:51,522
You got kids?

352
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:53,638
No, but I'd love one.

353
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:55,240
Hey.

354
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,876
Got my eye on this one big time.

355
00:25:58,047 --> 00:25:59,036
Yeah.

356
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,959
They're not going to get him.

357
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:12,796
You want to know
about Ruthie Jean?

358
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:16,045
They all been here,
you know.

359
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:20,236
Newspapers, cops,
case workers...

360
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:22,796
They all want to know.

361
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:26,405
I heard her screaming.

362
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:30,677
I heard right through the walls.

363
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,962
I dialled 91 1 .

364
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,879
Nobody came.

365
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:38,878
Nobody came.

366
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:40,878
Everybody scared.

367
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:42,082
He could come

368
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:44,442
right through these walls,
you know?

369
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:46,325
I'm scared.

370
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:52,276
Scared for my child.

371
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:54,597
They ain't never gonna catch him.

372
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:57,884
- Who?
- Candyman.

373
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:02,085
(Man laughing)

374
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:07,959
(Man) lf they asked for something, if they
saw something they liked, and you point...

375
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,925
They thought
it was rude to point.

376
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,366
So what did
they do?

377
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:13,960
(Grunting)

378
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:15,276
Spat over people.

379
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:17,125
It was quite extraordinary.

380
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,763
- Be nice.
- I am being nice.

381
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:24,285
So, how are the two most beautiful
graduate students getting along?

382
00:27:24,887 --> 00:27:28,846
Trevor tells me you've been
dabbling in my favourite subject.

383
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:34,958
I can't wait to review your data.
I can fit you in tomorrow morning.

384
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:36,355
We're not ready yet.

385
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:39,479
That's precisely the moment

386
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:42,365
in which I can be
of greatest assistance

387
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,963
before you disappear down
a path to academic Bolivia.

388
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:48,755
(Trevor) I've been there.

389
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:51,680
Actually, Purcell,
we're about to bury you.

390
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:53,678
- Helen...
- What?

391
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:58,566
We'll have something
in a week or so.

392
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,241
It's just that we only
went to Cabrini today...

393
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:04,604
Ah! Cabrini Green?

394
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:05,995
Candyman country.

395
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:08,921
Well, if you're after
the hook man, Helen,

396
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:12,796
you must read the paper
I wrote about him ten years ago.

397
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:15,361
You do know the story,
don't you?

398
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,006
No.

399
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:28,397
Then how are you going
to bury me?

400
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:34,245
The legend first appeared
in 1 890.

401
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,036
Candyman was
the son of a slave.

402
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:42,597
His father had amassed
a considerable fortune

403
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:44,558
from designing a device

404
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:48,726
for the mass producing of shoes
after the civil war.

405
00:28:48,887 --> 00:28:52,004
Candyman had been sent
to all the best schools

406
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,203
and had grown up
in polite society.

407
00:28:55,007 --> 00:28:58,966
He had a prodigious talent
as an artist

408
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:02,237
and was much sought after

409
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,398
when it came to
the documenting

410
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:08,799
of one's wealth and position
in society in a portrait.

411
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:11,800
Well, it was in this
latter capacity

412
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:15,801
that he was commissioned
by a wealthy landowner

413
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:19,403
to capture his daughter's
virginal beauty.

414
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:22,564
Well, of course,
they fell deeply in love

415
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:25,360
and she became pregnant.

416
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,555
Poor Candyman.

417
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:37,160
Her father executed
a terrible revenge.

418
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:43,243
He paid a pack of
brutal hooligans to do the deed.

419
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:48,043
They chased Candyman
through the town to Cabrini Green

420
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:52,041
where they proceeded
to saw off his right hand

421
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,959
with a rusty blade.

422
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,244
No one came to his aid.

423
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,686
(Distant screaming)

424
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:01,077
But this was just the beginning
of his ordeal.

425
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:04,557
Nearby there was
an apiary.

426
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:07,639
Dozens of hives,
filled with hungry bees.

427
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,803
(Distant crying and pleading)

428
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:13,880
They smashed the hives
and stole the honeycomb

429
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:17,005
and smeared it over
his prone, naked body.

430
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:22,358
Candyman was stung
to death by the bees.

431
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:27,199
They burned his body
on a giant pyre

432
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,795
then scattered his ashes
over Cabrini Green.

433
00:30:43,727 --> 00:30:44,842
Hello.

434
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:50,406
Anne-Marie ain't in.

435
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:53,240
Are you sure?

436
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:56,200
Yeah. She said you'd be back.

437
00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:06,083
What's your name?

438
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:07,322
Jake.

439
00:31:09,607 --> 00:31:12,485
Listen, Jake, maybe
you can help me out.

440
00:31:12,647 --> 00:31:15,639
I wanted to find out about
that woman who got killed.

441
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,525
Do you know
anything about that?

442
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:20,155
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

443
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:22,283
I don't know nothing.

444
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,082
Did anybody else talk about it?

445
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:32,958
You know, it's OK
to talk to me, Jake...

446
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:36,838
because I'm not a cop

447
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:39,726
so nobody's going
to get in trouble.

448
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:41,957
I can't say nothing

449
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:44,641
or Candyman will get me.

450
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:46,475
Candyman?

451
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:49,926
You scared of him?

452
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:52,840
I ain't scared of nobody

453
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:55,845
but you're crazy
walking here on your own.

454
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:57,878
It ain't safe around here.

455
00:31:58,047 --> 00:31:59,765
Yeah, I know.

456
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:05,363
But I don't scare
too easy either, Jake.

457
00:32:07,047 --> 00:32:09,766
You know,
you don't have to tell me.

458
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,082
You could just show me.

459
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:15,523
And if you show me
where Candyman is

460
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:17,439
I'll make you a promise.

461
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:20,836
It will be our secret.

462
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:27,277
Unless you're too scared.

463
00:32:37,687 --> 00:32:39,962
Somebody building
a bonfire?

464
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:42,597
Yeah, for the party.

465
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:00,646
In there.

466
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:02,559
Candyman's in there?

467
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:04,643
My friend Charlie say so.

468
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:07,037
A boy got killed there.

469
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:12,284
- Who was he?
- Ain't sure.

470
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:14,483
Charlie tell me he was weird.

471
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,598
He was crazy?

472
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:18,598
No, a retard.

473
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:21,526
His mom was in the store...

474
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:25,646
and the boy, he need to go,
you know, to the bathroom.

475
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,520
His mom was
taking her time

476
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:30,200
choosing this,
looking at that

477
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:32,722
so the boy start moaning.

478
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:34,684
His mom get mad at him

479
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,565
send him across the street.

480
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,485
His mom is at the checkout.

481
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:39,841
She hears her boy screaming.

482
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:41,599
(Screaming) Mommy!

483
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:42,882
Mommy!

484
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,203
There's a big tough guy.

485
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,158
He runs over to check it out.

486
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:51,605
He come out of there
shaking and crying.

487
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:54,082
He only been in there five seconds.

488
00:33:54,247 --> 00:33:58,320
Come out of there
and his hair turned white.

489
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:02,160
I mean, it turned white
just like that.

490
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:03,840
Was the boy murdered?

491
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:05,162
Worse.

492
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:09,240
He's lying on the floor
in a pool of blood holding himself.

493
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:13,440
(Screaming) Mommy! Mommy!

494
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:17,435
They found it floating
in the toilet.

495
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:18,841
Can't fix that.

496
00:34:19,047 --> 00:34:20,366
Better off dead.

497
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:23,360
Did Candyman do this?

498
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:32,157
Listen, you wait here for me, OK?

499
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:33,442
OK.

500
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:51,755
Hello?

501
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:04,200
(Coughing)

502
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:51,404
(Buzzing)

503
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:06,923
Candyman.

504
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:25,883
Oh, excuse me.
I'm done here.

505
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,038
I'll just get out of your way.

506
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:37,079
Listen, I don't want
to interfere with your business.

507
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:38,965
I'm not a cop.

508
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:41,641
I'm from the University of Illinois.

509
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:46,038
I'll just get out of your way.

510
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:48,042
Come on!

511
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,481
Let me go!

512
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:50,841
You're not being very smart.

513
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:52,565
My colleagues know where I am

514
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:54,160
and they're expecting me back.

515
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:55,476
Now let me go!

516
00:36:58,447 --> 00:37:01,280
I hear you looking
for Candyman, bitch.

517
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:04,838
Well, you found him.

518
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,759
(Helen moaning)

519
00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:13,324
(Men laughing)

520
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:23,719
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

521
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:25,525
Step back.

522
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,236
Number four

523
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,318
step forward
and say the line.

524
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:34,245
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

525
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:35,476
Step back.

526
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:39,236
Number five

527
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,125
step forward
and say the line.

528
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:43,721
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

529
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:44,962
Step back.

530
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:46,196
Take 'em out.

531
00:37:57,287 --> 00:37:59,118
It's number five.

532
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:00,521
Good work.

533
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:06,326
How d'you catch him?

534
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:07,926
We swept the place.

535
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:10,322
We start from the top floor
and work our way down.

536
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:12,403
That way you can
flush 'em all out.

537
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:14,717
Whole of Cabrini
is locked down now.

538
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:17,236
You're very lucky to be alive,
Ms Lyle.

539
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:22,245
Did he kill Ruthie Jean?

540
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:23,476
No question.

541
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:25,399
Killed that poor kid as well.

542
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:28,041
He ran the overlords.

543
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:30,163
We knew everything about him.

544
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:32,602
Only reason why we didn't
bring him in before

545
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,763
because we couldn't find
anyone to testify.

546
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:37,600
We can't protect them
down at Cabrini Green

547
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:40,156
and they knew that.

548
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:42,363
What about
the little boy...Jake?

549
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:44,279
We don't need him.

550
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,039
We have you.

551
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:53,406
Hey, Jake.

552
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,646
I just wanted
to thank you for saving my life.

553
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,525
I wanna go home.

554
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,325
We'll get you out of here.

555
00:39:06,447 --> 00:39:08,039
You did good.

556
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,920
You said it was our secret.
You lied!

557
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:13,043
It still is, Jake.

558
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:14,276
You won't have
to go to court.

559
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:19,802
Candyman will get me.

560
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:22,999
Candyman isn't real.

561
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,436
He's just a story.

562
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:26,716
You know, like Dracula

563
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:28,639
or...or Frankenstein.

564
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:33,915
A bad man took his name
so he could scare us.

565
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:36,396
But now he's locked up
everything's going to be OK.

566
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:39,604
Candyman ain't real?

567
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:41,642
No.

568
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,002
Hey there!

569
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,282
Whoa. Slow down.

570
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,199
You're supposed
to be the invalid here.

571
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,323
Look, see?
It's much better today.

572
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,636
Yeah, it looks great.

573
00:39:56,807 --> 00:39:57,922
Come sit down.

574
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:14,279
You haven't eaten already?

575
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:16,398
No, of course not.

576
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:18,279
OK, good.

577
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:36,880
(Bernadette) Hey!

578
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:38,520
Welcome back.

579
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:39,676
Thanks.

580
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:40,922
Let me see.

581
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:44,761
I'm so glad you're OK.

582
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:47,680
But you know what bugs me
about the whole thing?

583
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:50,964
Two people get brutally murdered
and the cops do nothing.

584
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:54,437
A white woman gets attacked
and they lock the place down.

585
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,245
This was a bad guy.

586
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:58,875
You got him put away.
That's what matters.

587
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,646
Oh! I've got
a surprise for you.

588
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:03,001
What?

589
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:05,601
You're not going to believe it.

590
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:06,802
The pictures.

591
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,003
My friend in
the photography department

592
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,759
managed to save most of them.

593
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,002
I'd written them off.

594
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,395
The camera was smashed.

595
00:41:13,527 --> 00:41:14,642
(Door opens)

596
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,798
I've been talking
to some publishers

597
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:18,639
and there's a lot of interest

598
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:21,002
since you made the local section.

599
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:22,839
We're going to be published.

600
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,517
I'll come over
tomorrow at 9:00.

601
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:27,643
- We'll get started?
- Yeah.

602
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:40,085
(Horn honks)

603
00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:08,444
(Deep, resonating voice) Helen...

604
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,640
Yes?

605
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:14,361
Helen...

606
00:42:20,767 --> 00:42:22,359
Who is that?

607
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:27,678
Who is that?

608
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,439
Helen...

609
00:42:31,607 --> 00:42:34,280
I came for you.

610
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,045
Do I know you?

611
00:42:55,247 --> 00:42:58,125
No...no...

612
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:00,317
but you doubted me.

613
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:01,795
I'm sorry.

614
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:03,115
I have to go.

615
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:05,676
No need to leave yet.

616
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,401
But I'm late.

617
00:43:12,607 --> 00:43:16,805
You were not content
with the stories

618
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:19,083
so I was obliged to come.

619
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:26,839
Be my victim.

620
00:43:30,647 --> 00:43:32,922
Be my victim.

621
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:38,795
I am the writing on the wall

622
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:41,885
the whisper in the classroom.

623
00:43:42,047 --> 00:43:45,403
Without these things
I am nothing

624
00:43:45,607 --> 00:43:49,122
so now I must shed
innocent blood.

625
00:43:49,287 --> 00:43:50,515
Come with me.

626
00:43:50,647 --> 00:43:54,276
(Woman screaming)

627
00:43:54,647 --> 00:43:56,877
(lncoherent screaming)

628
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:03,244
(Hysterical crying)

629
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,762
(Woman) No!

630
00:44:05,887 --> 00:44:08,321
(Hysterical crying)

631
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:22,637
Anthony!

632
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,638
Anthony!

633
00:44:26,127 --> 00:44:29,722
No! No! No!

634
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:32,042
No, Anthony!

635
00:44:32,247 --> 00:44:34,556
Anthony!

636
00:44:34,727 --> 00:44:39,676
(Hysterical screaming)

637
00:44:41,047 --> 00:44:43,356
Anthony!

638
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:45,320
Anne-Marie?

639
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:46,636
No! You did it!

640
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:48,519
You! You did it!

641
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:49,915
You murdered my baby!

642
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:53,039
(Screaming)

643
00:44:54,007 --> 00:44:55,440
You murderer!

644
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:58,197
No! No!

645
00:44:58,367 --> 00:44:59,641
Stop! Please, stop!

646
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,402
(Screaming)

647
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:06,682
Now stop!

648
00:45:06,847 --> 00:45:08,246
Stop!

649
00:45:08,407 --> 00:45:10,045
Police! Open up!

650
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,998
All right,
hold it right there!

651
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,156
Back away! Now!

652
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:15,002
(Screams)

653
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,202
Look out!

654
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:20,798
(Helicopter flying overhead)

655
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:35,675
Remove your sweater.

656
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:37,240
(Weeping)

657
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,676
Drop it and slide it over to me.

658
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:49,485
Take off your brassiere.

659
00:45:51,807 --> 00:45:55,038
Can I please take a shower?

660
00:45:55,207 --> 00:45:57,004
Oh...

661
00:45:58,007 --> 00:45:59,679
Oh, God...

662
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:04,002
Drop it,
slide it over to me.

663
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:09,201
Lift up your arms.

664
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,517
(Crying)

665
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:14,326
Lift your left breast.

666
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:15,476
Your right.

667
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:21,841
Remove your underwear.

668
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:26,000
Can I please speak
with detective Valento?

669
00:46:26,087 --> 00:46:27,998
Remove your underwear.

670
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:32,681
Frank.

671
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,117
Ms Lyle, you're under arrest.

672
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:43,606
Do you understand?

673
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:50,163
Please let me explain.

674
00:46:50,327 --> 00:46:52,079
Do you understand?

675
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:54,760
Yes, but...

676
00:46:54,927 --> 00:46:56,042
You have the right

677
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:57,725
to remain silent.

678
00:46:57,887 --> 00:46:59,559
Do you understand?

679
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:02,287
This is crazy.
I was attacked.

680
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:03,846
Respond to the question.

681
00:47:06,647 --> 00:47:08,444
I understand.

682
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:10,962
(Frank) At approximately 1 0:00 pm.

683
00:47:11,487 --> 00:47:14,559
Anne-Marie McCoy
returned to her apartment.

684
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:18,442
She discovered her dog
with its head cut off.

685
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:20,325
She cried for assistance

686
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:23,957
at which point you attacked her
with a meat cleaver.

687
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:26,926
You were still in possession
of this weapon

688
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:30,636
when the arresting officers
came to her aid.

689
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:34,243
(O'Malley) Where's the baby?

690
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:36,085
I...l don't know.

691
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:37,435
You're sick.

692
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:46,675
(Frank) Before I ask any
further questions

693
00:47:46,807 --> 00:47:48,843
would you like
to have counsel?

694
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:50,122
(Pounds hand on table)

695
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:52,477
Yes or no?

696
00:47:54,727 --> 00:47:56,683
I...l'd like to make a phone call.

697
00:47:56,847 --> 00:47:58,997
(Ringing)

698
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:10,318
(Phone continues ringing)

699
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,206
(Trevor) I'm sorry,
we can't take your call.

700
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:15,961
Please leave a message
after the tone.

701
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,116
(Tone beeps)

702
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:19,596
Trevor, are you there?
Pick up.

703
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:23,159
It's an emergency, Trevor.

704
00:48:23,327 --> 00:48:24,396
Pick up the phone.

705
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:27,161
I've been arrested.

706
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:29,597
I'm at the 1 8th district.

707
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:33,043
Can you...
can you please come pick me up?

708
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:35,755
That's it.

709
00:48:35,887 --> 00:48:39,436
Do you know what time it is?

710
00:48:39,607 --> 00:48:42,326
3:00 am.

711
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:44,000
(Door clangs shut)

712
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:45,725
(Keys jingling)

713
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:14,197
(Cooing)

714
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:17,200
(Anne-Marie crying hysterically)
Noooo!

715
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:19,597
No!

716
00:49:21,487 --> 00:49:23,443
(Door being unlocked)

717
00:49:25,407 --> 00:49:26,522
Oh, God.

718
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:29,917
There's got to be
another way out.

719
00:49:30,087 --> 00:49:32,317
(Attorney) Cover her face.
Don't say anything.

720
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:34,686
(Trevor) OK.

721
00:49:34,807 --> 00:49:35,796
(Attorney) All right.

722
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:37,923
You'll be fine.

723
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:39,759
(Reporters shouting)

724
00:49:41,807 --> 00:49:43,240
Just keep your head down.

725
00:49:43,407 --> 00:49:44,965
It's going to be fine.

726
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:50,442
All right, people,
back off, back off!

727
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:51,756
We have no comment.

728
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:53,599
No comment.
Nothing to say.

729
00:49:53,807 --> 00:49:55,638
Do you know
the baby's whereabouts?

730
00:49:55,807 --> 00:49:57,286
My client has
not been charged

731
00:49:57,407 --> 00:49:58,442
with a thing!

732
00:49:58,607 --> 00:50:00,165
(Woman) lnformation has indicated

733
00:50:00,327 --> 00:50:03,364
that baby Anthony was abducted
and may still be alive.

734
00:50:03,607 --> 00:50:05,757
The blood may have come
from the dog.

735
00:50:05,927 --> 00:50:07,519
A suspect was released

736
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:09,359
this morning after questioning

737
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:11,876
and I guess we'll just
have to follow this one...

738
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:16,560
Well, at least they didn't
mention your name.

739
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:18,080
That's good.

740
00:50:21,007 --> 00:50:24,238
Now, they haven't charged you,
because they think

741
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:25,641
they'll find the body

742
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:27,286
which means, I'm afraid

743
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:29,204
they're shooting for murder one,

744
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:31,358
but I don't think they have a chance.

745
00:50:34,807 --> 00:50:36,638
Do you think I did it?

746
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,246
No. Nobody believes that.

747
00:50:40,047 --> 00:50:41,799
But it's crossed your mind?

748
00:50:46,407 --> 00:50:47,760
Is there anything,

749
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:51,044
any detail, however small,
that you can recall,

750
00:50:51,207 --> 00:50:55,041
that would help us substantiate
your version of events?

751
00:50:55,207 --> 00:50:57,084
I...l blacked out.

752
00:50:57,247 --> 00:50:59,477
I mean,
I don't know what happened.

753
00:50:59,607 --> 00:51:03,805
I just woke up in that place
and there was blood everywhere.

754
00:51:21,807 --> 00:51:23,001
Can I get you anything?

755
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:28,998
Are you sure?

756
00:51:39,407 --> 00:51:40,283
Look, honey...

757
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:43,405
I was supposed to go to the campus
and pick up some work.

758
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,035
I'm concerned about
leaving you alone though.

759
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:49,563
I'll only be
about 20 minutes.

760
00:51:49,727 --> 00:51:50,637
Trevor...

761
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:56,635
Where were you last night?

762
00:51:56,807 --> 00:51:59,241
I was here.
I was fast asleep.

763
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,683
I thought you were
with Bernadette.

764
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:06,325
Look, honey...

765
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:07,920
I'm going to stand by you.

766
00:52:08,087 --> 00:52:11,079
We're going to get through this OK?

767
00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:14,286
I'll be right back.

768
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:22,920
(Door closes)

769
00:55:28,447 --> 00:55:29,562
(Screams)

770
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:31,524
Believe in me.

771
00:55:31,687 --> 00:55:32,722
Be my victim.

772
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:50,359
Do you believe in me?

773
00:55:51,327 --> 00:55:52,885
Keep away from me.

774
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:54,526
I have the child.

775
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:58,760
Allow me to take you
or he will die in your place.

776
00:56:03,007 --> 00:56:04,076
Your disbelief

777
00:56:04,247 --> 00:56:07,398
destroyed the faith
of my congregation.

778
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:09,797
Without them,
I am nothing.

779
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:12,959
So I was obliged to come.

780
00:56:13,127 --> 00:56:15,800
And now I must kill you.

781
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:20,596
Your death will be a tale
to frighten children,

782
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:24,362
to make lovers cling closer
in their rapture.

783
00:56:24,487 --> 00:56:28,685
Come with me
and be immortal.

784
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:30,963
(Groans)

785
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:42,962
Helen?

786
00:56:49,527 --> 00:56:51,358
Bernadette...

787
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,006
Bernadette, go.

788
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:57,236
Helen?

789
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:00,236
Helen, honey.

790
00:57:00,407 --> 00:57:01,601
It's Bernadette.

791
00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:02,836
Let me in.

792
00:57:03,007 --> 00:57:04,042
He's here.

793
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:15,321
Bernadette, go!

794
00:57:15,967 --> 00:57:17,639
Helen!

795
00:57:17,807 --> 00:57:19,286
Helen?

796
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:21,563
(Helen) Go! Get out!

797
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,797
(Moans)

798
00:57:24,927 --> 00:57:27,964
(Helen) Oh, no, no....

799
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,763
(Bernadette screaming)

800
00:57:33,927 --> 00:57:36,316
(Flesh ripping)

801
00:57:36,447 --> 00:57:39,041
(Candyman grunting)

802
00:57:45,207 --> 00:57:47,004
(Footsteps approaching)

803
00:57:53,247 --> 00:57:54,919
Trevor...

804
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:57,277
Trevor, he's here.

805
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,159
He's here. He's...

806
00:57:59,327 --> 00:58:00,806
...here.

807
00:58:05,207 --> 00:58:07,038
(Thinking) Don't let him kill me.

808
00:58:11,127 --> 00:58:12,276
Trevor...

809
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:22,280
Trevor...

810
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:26,596
Trevor...

811
00:58:28,247 --> 00:58:29,441
Trevor!

812
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:33,076
Trevor!

813
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:36,478
Trevor! Trevor!

814
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:37,682
(Moans)

815
00:58:44,847 --> 00:58:45,836
Take her outside.

816
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:50,879
Trevor...

817
00:58:51,047 --> 00:58:52,799
Hold me, Trevor, please?

818
00:59:02,647 --> 00:59:04,126
(Dispatcher) 'That's correct.

819
00:59:08,207 --> 00:59:10,198
'Unit 212, come in, please.'

820
00:59:14,247 --> 00:59:17,717
(Candyman) 'Why do you want to live?

821
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:20,361
'lf you had learned
just a little from me

822

830
01:00:05,847 --> 01:00:07,166
(Helen) 'Please, God,

831
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:10,080
'don't let him kill the baby.'

832
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:36,601
Trevor!

833
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,962
Trevor?

834
01:00:42,327 --> 01:00:43,646
Trevor!

835
01:00:59,207 --> 01:01:01,641
Where are you going?

836
01:01:01,807 --> 01:01:03,559
No, you can't leave me here.

837
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:06,400
I can't defend myself!

838
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,399
No.

839
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:32,005
What do the good know

840
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:35,477
except what the bad teach them
by their excesses?

841
01:01:35,647 --> 01:01:37,603
Murderer.

842
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:39,883
Allow me at least a kiss.

843
01:01:40,047 --> 01:01:43,005
Just one exquisite kiss.

844
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:44,805
(Crying)

845
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,446
Murderer!

846
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:47,835
Help!

847
01:01:47,967 --> 01:01:49,878
Listen, he's under the bed!

848
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,839
Bring me 1 ,000 mils!

849
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:55,559
Listen, he's here.

850
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,001
He's under the bed!

851
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:58,759
No, don't.

852
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:19,999
(Baby cooing)

853
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:58,244
(Coughing)

854
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:01,205
She's coming around.

855
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:02,680
Good morning.

856
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:04,838
I'd like to speak
to my husband.

857
01:03:05,007 --> 01:03:05,996
(Chuckles)

858
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:07,401
So would l.

859
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:08,477
Here we go.

860
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:10,126
What time is it?

861
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,039
Where are we going?

862
01:03:12,207 --> 01:03:13,845
We're going to Disneyland.

863
01:03:26,527 --> 01:03:28,597
Clyde, open it up.

864
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,677
Winley?

865
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,439
Clyde, open it up.

866
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,246
What the hell you all
doing back there, huh?

867
01:03:34,407 --> 01:03:35,760
A little reading?

868
01:03:37,407 --> 01:03:38,999
Break.

869
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:43,839
Dr Burke?

870
01:03:44,047 --> 01:03:45,002
Yes?

871
01:03:49,047 --> 01:03:51,277
Miss Lyle,
I'm Dr Burke.

872
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:59,846
(Door opens, closes)

873
01:04:00,047 --> 01:04:02,402
I'd like to speak to my husband.

874
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:04,478
I'm sure we can arrange a visit.

875
01:04:04,647 --> 01:04:06,160
A visit?

876
01:04:06,327 --> 01:04:07,919
Have I been committed?

877
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:17,077
Do you really think
these restraints are necessary?

878
01:04:20,167 --> 01:04:22,442
Helen, this...

879
01:04:22,607 --> 01:04:24,165
is a writ of detention

880
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,557
from the state
attorney's office.

881
01:04:26,727 --> 01:04:28,445
Now, for
the past month...

882
01:04:28,607 --> 01:04:30,916
- Month?
- Yes.

883
01:04:31,047 --> 01:04:35,086
...we have been stabilizing you
on a heavy dosage of Thorazine.

884
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:38,205
You probably remember
very little or nothing.

885
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:40,198
Get me my attorney.

886
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:42,437
I'm working for
your defence.

887
01:04:42,647 --> 01:04:45,923
We have to assess
your ability to stand trial.

888
01:04:46,087 --> 01:04:50,444
Helen, you've been charged
with first-degree murder.

889
01:04:59,407 --> 01:05:02,365
Why don't you tell me
what happened in your apartment?

890
01:05:27,847 --> 01:05:29,041
'Oh!'

891
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:33,565
The night
you were admitted

892
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:36,195
did the killer
appear to you?

893
01:05:36,327 --> 01:05:38,158
'Murderer!

894
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:39,396
'Murderer!

895
01:05:39,527 --> 01:05:41,324
'Murderer!

896
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:42,886
'Help me!

897
01:05:43,047 --> 01:05:44,366
(Grunting)

898
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:46,677
'He's here!

899
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:48,326
'He's under the bed!

900
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:49,761
'No!

901
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:51,121
'Help me!'

902
01:05:51,287 --> 01:05:52,606
I don't understand.

903
01:05:52,727 --> 01:05:54,877
'Help! Please!

904
01:05:55,087 --> 01:05:56,076
'He's here!

905
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:58,198
'Help me! Help me!

906
01:05:58,327 --> 01:05:59,442
'Please!

907
01:06:00,527 --> 01:06:01,676
'He's under the bed!

908
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:02,876
'He's under the bed!'

909
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:04,281
That's not possible.

910
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:06,079
(Man) 'Bring me 1 ,000 mils!'

911
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:12,606
Bernadette...

912
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:24,398
I'm not capable of that.

913
01:06:30,327 --> 01:06:33,399
No matter what's going wrong...

914
01:06:33,847 --> 01:06:35,280
I know one thing...

915
01:06:35,447 --> 01:06:37,165
...that no part of me,

916
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,397
no matter how hidden

917
01:06:39,527 --> 01:06:41,006
is capable of that.

918
01:06:47,847 --> 01:06:49,200
I can prove it.

919
01:06:49,327 --> 01:06:50,555
How?

920
01:06:53,527 --> 01:06:55,006
I can call him.

921
01:07:05,887 --> 01:07:07,286
Candyman...

922
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:08,880
Candyman...

923
01:07:09,047 --> 01:07:10,844
Candyman...

924
01:07:10,967 --> 01:07:12,400
Candyman...

925
01:07:22,127 --> 01:07:24,322
...Candyman.

926
01:07:41,287 --> 01:07:42,515
(Grunts)

927
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:44,200
(Flesh ripping)

928
01:07:44,367 --> 01:07:45,959
Oh! Oh!

929
01:07:46,327 --> 01:07:49,524
(Yelling)

930
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,401
(Grunting)

931
01:07:57,727 --> 01:08:00,036
You're mine now.

932
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:05,605
Tonight our congregation
shall witness a new...miracle.

933
01:08:05,727 --> 01:08:07,206
(Flesh tearing)

934
01:08:22,527 --> 01:08:24,199
(Alarm ringing)

935
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:25,516
(Woman) Dr Burke?

936
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:29,922
(Knocking)

937
01:08:30,087 --> 01:08:31,759
Dr Burke?

938
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:33,519
Dr Burke!

939
01:08:33,687 --> 01:08:35,917
Please answer us!

940
01:08:36,087 --> 01:08:38,123
Dr Burke!

941
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:53,646
(Grunts)

942
01:09:07,127 --> 01:09:10,403
Code nine to ward b-5, stat.

943
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:18,005
Check the west wing.

944
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:22,401
Let's go!

945
01:09:22,567 --> 01:09:23,795
Go, go, go!

946
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:28,799
Do we have a direction on this one?
Where is she?

947
01:09:28,967 --> 01:09:30,195
(Elevator bell rings)

948
01:09:49,447 --> 01:09:51,244
Please be home, Trevor.

949
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:52,641
Please be home.

950
01:10:07,007 --> 01:10:09,441
(Creaking)

951
01:10:47,967 --> 01:10:49,400
Get out of my home.

952
01:10:52,007 --> 01:10:53,804
(Agitated) Trevor!

953
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:55,639
What's the matter, sweetie pie?

954
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:57,798
Did you make another little boo-boo?

955
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:01,083
What are you doing here?

956
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:03,886
I live here, remember?

957
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:05,605
Call the hospital.

958
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:11,643
Don't touch the phone.

959
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:26,759
What's the matter, Trevor?

960
01:11:29,047 --> 01:11:31,163
Scared of something?

961
01:11:42,647 --> 01:11:45,241
I hate the color scheme.

962
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:49,600
What were you going to do?

963
01:11:49,767 --> 01:11:51,962
Wait till I got out
before you told me?!

964
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:53,961
Helen...

965
01:11:54,127 --> 01:11:56,482
But you knew
I was never coming out,

966
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:57,841
didn't you?

967
01:11:59,047 --> 01:12:01,436
I think we should call the hospital.

968
01:12:04,807 --> 01:12:06,206
OK.

969
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:09,196
(Dial tone)

970
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,277
Go on.

971
01:12:12,327 --> 01:12:13,601
Go on.

972
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:15,559
Is that what you want to do?

973
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:19,886
Call them.

974
01:12:44,087 --> 01:12:47,124
I'm not a murderer.

975
01:12:47,647 --> 01:12:49,877
I'm not.

976
01:12:50,447 --> 01:12:53,996
Trevor, you were all I had left.

977
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:57,241
Oh...

978
01:13:01,647 --> 01:13:04,081
(Fast busy signal)

979
01:13:15,047 --> 01:13:16,366
It's over.

980
01:13:26,447 --> 01:13:27,880
(Busy signal stops)

981
01:13:28,047 --> 01:13:31,357
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

982
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:54,082
(Candyman) They will all abandon you.

983
01:14:04,247 --> 01:14:09,480
All you have left
is my desire for you.

984
01:14:29,087 --> 01:14:31,043
(Laughing and chattering)

985
01:16:26,047 --> 01:16:30,165
(Many voices in the distance
shouting "Candyman!")

986
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:37,921
(Laughter and shouting
in the distance)

987
01:16:52,887 --> 01:16:54,639
(Rasping, heavy breathing)

988
01:17:49,407 --> 01:17:50,840
Helen.

989
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:55,397
You came to me.

990
01:17:57,567 --> 01:17:59,000
The child.

991
01:18:01,207 --> 01:18:02,959
We had a deal.

992
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:05,476
Surrender to me now

993
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,764
and he shall be unharmed.

994
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:21,885
We have a bargain.

995
01:18:22,047 --> 01:18:23,844
But I'm afraid.

996
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:26,686
Do you fear the pain
or what is beyond?

997
01:18:26,847 --> 01:18:28,280
Both.

998
01:18:28,447 --> 01:18:32,156
The pain, I can assure you,
will be exquisite.

999
01:18:32,327 --> 01:18:35,876
As for our deaths,
there is nothing to fear.

1000
01:18:36,047 --> 01:18:40,040
Our names will be written
on a thousand walls.

1001
01:18:40,207 --> 01:18:41,959
Our crimes told

1002
01:18:42,127 --> 01:18:45,676
and retold
by our faithful believers.

1003
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:49,760
We shall die together
in front of their very eyes

1004
01:18:49,927 --> 01:18:52,202
and give them something

1005
01:18:52,367 --> 01:18:54,164
to be haunted by.

1006
01:18:54,287 --> 01:18:55,766
Come with me

1007
01:18:56,847 --> 01:18:59,281
and be immortal.

1008
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:08,079
(Screaming)

1009
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:13,396
No!

1010
01:19:21,807 --> 01:19:23,798
No!

1011
01:19:25,887 --> 01:19:27,639
(Crunching)

1012
01:19:40,767 --> 01:19:42,564
(Candyman) Hush.

1013
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:45,880
Hush.

1014
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:48,880
You're mine now.

1015
01:19:49,007 --> 01:19:52,124
It's time for a new miracle.

1016
01:19:57,927 --> 01:19:59,201
(Baby squeals)

1017
01:20:11,927 --> 01:20:13,599
(Metallic clattering)

1018
01:21:10,447 --> 01:21:13,519
(Candyman) It was always you, Helen.

1019
01:21:13,687 --> 01:21:15,803
It was always you.

1020
01:21:16,087 --> 01:21:17,645
(Baby crying)

1021
01:21:24,567 --> 01:21:26,762
(Crying continues)

1022
01:21:30,007 --> 01:21:32,282
(Crying gets louder)

1023
01:21:52,727 --> 01:21:54,445
(Crying)

1024
01:22:29,447 --> 01:22:31,677
He's here.

1025
01:23:04,207 --> 01:23:05,526
I'm coming.

1026
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:12,966
It's OK.

1027
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:15,721
Check it out, man.

1028
01:23:17,647 --> 01:23:19,638
Oh, yes.

1029
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:22,275
(Man) What happened?

1030
01:23:22,447 --> 01:23:25,757
(Man #2) We got the Candyman out there.

1031
01:23:25,927 --> 01:23:28,122
(Jake) I saw him go in there.

1032
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:30,119
Candyman's in there.

1033
01:23:30,287 --> 01:23:31,800
I saw him.

1034
01:23:31,967 --> 01:23:34,401
(Crying)

1035
01:23:36,927 --> 01:23:38,724
I knew you'd come.

1036
01:23:40,127 --> 01:23:41,924
Burn him.

1037
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:47,998
Hush.

1038
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:51,796
Burn him, burn him,
burn him, burn him...

1039
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:54,083
(Muffled cry)

1040
01:23:54,247 --> 01:23:57,159
(Crowd chanting)
Burn him, burn him!

1041
01:23:57,327 --> 01:23:59,795
Help!

1042
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:02,720
Burn him, burn him, burn him!

1043
01:24:02,887 --> 01:24:05,117
Help...help me!

1044
01:24:05,287 --> 01:24:07,118
Burn him, burn him!

1045
01:24:07,287 --> 01:24:10,359
You lied to me!

1046
01:24:10,487 --> 01:24:14,480
We must be on our way now,
you and l.

1047
01:24:14,647 --> 01:24:16,956
Our bones will soon be ashes

1048
01:24:17,127 --> 01:24:19,846
and we shall never

1049
01:24:20,007 --> 01:24:21,360
be separated again.

1050
01:24:21,527 --> 01:24:22,755
Let me go.

1051
01:24:22,887 --> 01:24:24,161
I cannot.

1052
01:24:24,327 --> 01:24:27,160
We are already dead.

1053
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:28,396
(Baby crying)

1054
01:24:34,647 --> 01:24:36,160
Helen!

1055
01:24:36,727 --> 01:24:38,046
(Screaming)

1056
01:24:47,767 --> 01:24:50,565
(Screaming in pain)

1057
01:24:57,967 --> 01:24:59,366
(Angry yelling)

1058
01:24:59,967 --> 01:25:01,446
(Groans loudly)

1059
01:25:09,847 --> 01:25:11,644
Come back to me!

1060
01:25:22,727 --> 01:25:24,558
Come back!

1061
01:25:24,727 --> 01:25:27,002
(Baby crying)

1062
01:25:47,487 --> 01:25:50,206
(Screaming)

1063
01:26:31,247 --> 01:26:34,364
(Minister) We commend to almighty God
our sister Helen

1064
01:26:34,527 --> 01:26:37,200
and we commit her body
to the ground.

1065
01:26:37,367 --> 01:26:40,803
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1066
01:26:40,967 --> 01:26:44,277
The lord bless her and keep her
and give her peace.

1067
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,363
God of holiness and power

1068
01:26:46,487 --> 01:26:49,718
accept our prayers on behalf
of your servant Helen.

1069
01:26:49,847 --> 01:26:52,077
Do not count
her deeds against her.

1070
01:26:52,327 --> 01:26:55,444
For in her heart she desired
to do your will.

1071
01:26:55,567 --> 01:26:57,364
May almighty God bless you

1072
01:26:57,567 --> 01:27:00,161
the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

1073
01:27:08,087 --> 01:27:10,806
(Man) My God, look at that.

1074
01:27:12,967 --> 01:27:14,798
Trevor?

1075
01:28:26,127 --> 01:28:27,685
(Stacey) Trevor?

1076
01:28:28,807 --> 01:28:31,367
What is it?

1077
01:28:31,527 --> 01:28:33,245
Trevor, are you all right?

1078
01:28:33,407 --> 01:28:35,921
Yeah, I'm fine.

1079
01:28:36,047 --> 01:28:38,686
Aren't you hungry?

1080
01:28:38,847 --> 01:28:40,280
No, I'm OK.

1081
01:28:40,447 --> 01:28:42,517
I'll eat a little bit later.

1082
01:28:42,687 --> 01:28:46,043
I was going to make us
a nice dinner.

1083
01:28:46,247 --> 01:28:47,885
OK, whatever.

1084
01:29:28,247 --> 01:29:31,478
Hey, why don't you help me
make the salad?

1085
01:29:32,887 --> 01:29:35,685
OK, I'll be there
in a minute.

1086
01:29:44,887 --> 01:29:46,639
Helen...

1087
01:29:55,487 --> 01:29:58,081
Oh, Helen.

1088
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:04,365
Helen.

1089
01:30:09,927 --> 01:30:11,645
Helen.

1090
01:30:17,487 --> 01:30:19,284
Helen.

1091
01:30:19,607 --> 01:30:21,598
Ow.

1092
01:30:25,967 --> 01:30:27,923
What's the matter, Trevor?

1093
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:30,038
Scared of something?

1094
01:30:32,607 --> 01:30:34,359
(Flesh tearing)

1095
01:30:37,567 --> 01:30:39,683
(Death rattle)

1096
01:30:39,807 --> 01:30:41,957
Trevor?

1097
01:30:42,127 --> 01:30:44,800
My God, Trevor?

1098
01:30:44,967 --> 01:30:46,036
Trevor?

1099
01:30:47,247 --> 01:30:49,078
Trevor!

1100
01:30:49,207 --> 01:30:51,243
(Screaming)
