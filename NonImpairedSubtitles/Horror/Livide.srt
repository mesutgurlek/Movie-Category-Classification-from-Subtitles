1
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,807
Children missing.

2
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,397
Wanted.

3
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,722
Are you Lucie Klavel?

4
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,747
Do you smoke?
- No.

5
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:19,419
When I was at school,
I had a very strict teacher.

6
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,712
Every morning he checked our breath

7
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,838
and those of cigarette smoke,
was given automatically insufficient.

8
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,893
And today I am that teacher.

9
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,315
You have two different eye colors.
Unbelievable.

10
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,312
I've never seen before.
That's rare.

11
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:46,488
Do you know how that name? - Right.
- Heterochromia.

12
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:50,408
You know what they say?
- That it is a mistake in the coloring pigment is.

13
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,074
No, no, no ...
Not in medical terms.

14
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,327
Two different eye means that you
have two different souls.

15
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,251
Souls come in one eye
and depart from the other eye.

16
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,375
It's just a pigment discoloration.
That's all.

17
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,344
My name is Mrs. Wilson, though.
- I know.

18
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,680
But you can call me Catherine
if you want.

19
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:13,222
No, I prefer to call you Ms. Wilson.
- What you want, Mrs. Klavel.

20
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,782
Given the majority of our clients
is not able to

21
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:38,251
independently to the toilet to go,
I do not tell you that

22
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,712
she left the door open for you will not do.

23
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:52,140
The next man we will see,
does not take much care. Only a syringe.

24
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:56,056
He's quite labile and talkative.
Although, we are more than a quarter.

25
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,065
If we do not keep to a time limit
the schedule is completely through each other.

26
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,979
Take my bag.
It's too heavy for me.

27
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,201
Andre?

28
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,288
Andre, it's time for your injection.

29
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,659
Calm.
It's just me, see?

30
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:23,751
You do not want you that we
in the early morning visit, right?

31
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,924
Go ahead.

32
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,422
Is that my granddaughter?
- No.

33
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,641
You know they no longer
long been.

34
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,603
This is Lucy. A young girl I
will help the next 10 days.

35
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,976
A trainee.
- And then my granddaughter?

36
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,860
Say hello to Lucy, Andre.
- Hello, young lady.

37
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,695
Hello, Mr. Marchal.

38
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,486
No.
- No, no, no. Not that again.

39
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,987
Always the same behavior. He hates this.
- I can.

40
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,667
Have you ever done it before?
Not that you halfway through the needle breaks.

41
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,626
No, I can.

42
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,419
Okay.
Let's see what you can.

43
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,963
Everything is in order, Mr.. Marchal.

44
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:25,226
Not bad.

45
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,906
Tell my granddaughter,
that they agree to come to visit.

46
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,945
Her name is Matilda.

47
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,705
Tell her to me
must visit soon.

48
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,495
Shall we do. Now then -

49
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,962
It's not that we are bored,
Andre, but we must leave.

50
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,957
So, until tomorrow.

51
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,259
Until tomorrow, Mr.. Marchal.

52
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:27,250
Well, Maddy, what a gift
this time you have left for us?

53
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,294
No, wait here for me.
- Why?

54
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,044
So far have you stopped fine,
But you're not ready for this patient.

55
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,297
What is special about this patient?
- Wait here.

56
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,940
I will not be long gone. And please,
allows the radio. It eats the battery.

57
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,041
Curious and impatient.
Exactly as I like to see.

58
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:01,038
You have everything it takes
a nurse in order to be.

59
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,753
May I introduce you to Deborah Jessel.

60
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:16,140
Deborah Jessel was once a famous
and infamous dance instructor.

61
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:20,060
There were even students from Paris,
to be able to study under her.

62
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,276
But that was before the coma.
One where they have been in it.

63
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,486
You can also give a window open.

64
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,400
A breath of fresh air and sunshine?

65
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:36,494
That will do us good.
Even plants need to breathe, right?

66
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:01,978
Talk to her?
- Only about niemendalletjes.

67
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:06,569
She will not interrupt me in any case.

68
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,688
And it's cheaper than a psychiatrist.

69
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:21,911
Reading was one of her few pleasures.
Jessel is a true collector. Read you like?

70
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:26,415
Yes.
- Look up only one out.

71
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,926
Go ahead.
Does not matter. Choose only one.

72
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,718
I never know what to choose.
I know nothing about literature.

73
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,183
Come on, come at once.
Close your eyes and pick one.

74
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,638
One of the many places of residence
of a moth.

75
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,600
Anyway, with my study
I have almost no time to read.

76
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,848
Want to swap?

77
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,531
Why, she receives a transfusion?
- No idea. I am not a doctor.

78
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,154
She could use a manicure.

79
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,782
It would not even last long.
To her nails.

80
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,661
In her condition she is probably
not even aware how long her nails.

81
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,540
And her family then? They will not complain
that our task will not run?

82
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,339
Her family? The only family she has
a daughter.

83
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:58,465
She was born deaf.
I think she is long dead.

84
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,639
I'm pretty convinced.
There is no single definitive proof.

85
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,137
Could not be better for her home?

86
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,769
It was her last wish
at home to die.

87
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,689
If you have so much money,
that practically anticipates your ears

88
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,187
your wishes will be respected.

89
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,614
Deborah Jessel is terribly rich.
It is even said that she has a treasure.

90
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,452
A treasure?

91
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:24,199
Money, jewels, gold bars and such.

92
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:29,542
The location of the treasure is unknown,
As you can imagine.

93
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,585
Believe me. I have tried every door
with a lock and key

94
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,382
in this hole. No result.

95
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,598
And there is no chance that they still
will awaken from her coma?

96
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:46,183
The odds are just so big that I
a rich guy will meet

97
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,058
and will take me to
an exotic land far away from here.

98
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,936
No, so?

99
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,108
Close the curtains.

100
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:59,610
If we let them open, and there is a control,
we will get in trouble.

101
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,576
Whiners.

102
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,244
I despise the folks at
the medical services.

103
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,495
Well, sleep well, Deborah.

104
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,211
Not too much partying tonight. Okay?

105
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,083
I know it is not
the most accessible work

106
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,705
but for a first day,
You did quite well.

107
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,832
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.

108
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,129
No thanks, Mrs. Klavel.

109
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:03,674
See you tomorrow. Same time. Same punishment.
- Good night. See you tomorrow.

110
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,020
Hey, Lucy!.

111
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,898
How is it?

112
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,701
I missed you.
- Mutual.

113
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,663
Understood?

114
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,620
William?

115
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,664
That hat suits you.
- Stop it.

116
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,376
Come on. Only because I smell like a fish,
does not mean you -

117
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,167
William!

118
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:50,135
You're not going anywhere until all fish
out of the way. Here.

119
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,095
Okay. Okay.

120
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,813
I am already at work.
- Good evening, Mr.. Kerrien.

121
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:02,063
She said good night.
- Good evening, Lucie.

122
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,107
Do not worry, this does not last too long.
- Here.

123
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,654
Then we grab a beer.

124
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,150
You must be exhausted after such
gloomy day with patients.

125
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,923
All right, mother? All right.
- Pretty good. You?

126
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:28,385
Hi, Lucy.
- We go down there. Okay?

127
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,094
All right, Yohan?
- Hey, man.

128
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,037
How are you, Lucie. Good?

129
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,958
So now you must come with the clown
which smells of sardines

130
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:03,496
in order to afflict me.
- That's right, Ben.

131
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:08,755
Justify that fifty dollars that my mother
you pay every month

132
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,550
and bring us two beers.
- I'll see what I can do.

133
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,471
The only way to get through a tough day.
- Yes, I know.

134
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,265
And, tell us about your first day.

135
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,811
It was. The sister that I had to train
was a bit strict occasionally

136
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,060
but otherwise it went smoothly.
- And the patients?

137
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,823
Most patients do not talk.
- Hort is indeed just a nightmare.

138
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,287
Besides, you can still remember that scary house,
near the marsh

139
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,658
go to Carantec?
- Are you kidding? Of course.

140
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,077
My mother had forbidden me to it
ever hang around.

141
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,455
But Ben and I went anyway,
to see if we were brave enough.

142
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,379
Why? Were you there today?
- Maybe.

143
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,461
Two beers.
- Has a maximum time.

144
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,636
What are you doing tonight?
- Something without you.

145
00:23:56,644 --> 00:24:00,728
Hey, Ben!
- Yes, I'm coming.

146
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,939
Can not get another two-second pause.
- Well, go.

147
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,025
Cheers.

148
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,320
Seriously, are you there?

149
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:14,237
What is it? Nothing else?
- Only an old lady.

150
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,577
No, and she is seriously old.
Practically on the hundred.

151
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,038
She's still alive,
but she can not move.

152
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:24,752
Lucy, my excuse that I have to say,
but your story is not particularly exciting.

153
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,871
Because it is not over.

154
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,670
So, not only is she in a coma,
but she also appears to be rich.

155
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:34,796
My teacher says that somewhere even
a treasure hidden in the house has.

156
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,550
A treasure? What's in it?
- She has no clue.

157
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,679
She is still searching for.
- What if we find him first?

158
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:47,604
Just a window strike. That's all.
- What? Are you crazy?

159
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:52,105
Since when you rob old ladies?
- What are you talking about?

160
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,076
Can you smell that?
The desire for a better life.

161
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,286
Or not? Or do you?
- Hello? Do I know you do?

162
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,075
Am I not enough?

163
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,204
What is going on?
What are you talking about?

164
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,792
I am 22 years old and I have the same
rough hands like my father.

165
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,835
Oh, I love the sea, very much.

166
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:15,507
But I do not die at sea.
Not as my father and his father before him.

167
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,927
I've got a choice.
And I choose not to die at sea.

168
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:24,179
I want to die on land.
Far away from here.

169
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:29,934
Take Ben once, for example. How long do you
even your mother's apron bows go down?

170
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,106
What are you talking about?
What is this?

171
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:39,406
I'm out of here. I see you guys.
- Lucie. Come on.

172
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,878
Hey, Lucie!

173
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:55,547
What is this? You're the one who always
your father's money problems yields. Do not you?

174
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,547
And since your mother died,
he must work a double shift every night.

175
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,924
Leave my mother out, please.

176
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,427
You're like a little child.
A villain, though perhaps too much honor,

177
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,146
which is only ideas can come to poor.

178
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,813
You were not just two months in jail?
Omwege theft of an old television set

179
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,779
from the garage of a policeman?
- Not that story again.

180
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:20,652
I was able geluist. And you know that too.

181
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,703
Go ahead. I must return to work.

182
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,495
Otherwise I get hits from my father.
But consider it, please.

183
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,284
Consider, okay?

184
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,664
Yes, my sweetheart.
Yes, we've come along this weekend.

185
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:18,213
Yes, I hang up.
Lucie is here and I must work.

186
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,586
I'll pass.

187
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,323
Lucie.

188
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,247
Lucie, I must work.

189
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,836
Do you "sweetheart" use?

190
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,591
Although my mother
only eight months dead.

191
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:04,510
Your mother is irreplaceable.
But Janice is a nice woman.

192
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,134
And what would mother of Janice like?

193
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,729
They will soon be with us.
- What?

194
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:17,943
I leave you alone, dear.
We'll talk about tomorrow.

195
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,358
I must work. 'm Already late.

196
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:31,721
Hello?
- Okay. But only what we really need.

197
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:36,222
Only Lesson, what we need for an ideal life.
You will not regret getting.

198
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,269
I hope so.

199
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:06,047
Well, sailor? Do you have enough next to your friend
gain to an old lady to scare?

200
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,545
Wrong guess. You are here only
because you have a driving license.

201
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,887
Okay, next point.
- Nothing next point. Enough points.

202
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,476
Shit.

203
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,395
Shit.

204
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,766
We did better with the bike can go,
than in the scrapyard.

205
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,564
You know what? You both deserve
a little of this karma.

206
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:27,690
Hey, not a bad word about my treasure.
Okay? Just some startup problems.

207
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:44,924
Happy, happy, halloween,
Silver Shamrock ...

208
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,756
Fuck you, ugly children!

209
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:01,227
See? I told you so.
He always starts eventually.

210
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,087
Wait, wait.
Park there.

211
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:50,235
We should play it safe.
From here we go on foot. Here.

212
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,238
Seriously? This is my pillow.
- Shut up.

213
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,034
Wait, William,
So I understand it all.

214
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,661
You expect us two hours
walk through the dark

215
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,880
dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan?
Seriously?

216
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,044
What should we do with it, man?

217
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,384
The old woman the fright
of her life?

218
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,972
"You all right? Your money or your life".
What are we doing?

219
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:19,469
No.
- Are you done complaining? Here.

220
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,763
Come on.

221
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:43,583
Hopefully you're ready to
a pole to be run.

222
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,999
I'm ready to get rich.

223
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,998
Soon, we will all
enjoy the good life.

224
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,876
Breakfast in bed and everything.

225
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:55,220
If you want breakfast in bed, you must
eight o'clock in the morning in the kitchen.

226
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,818
We are around thirty minutes to
walking. I can not go.

227
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,940
My shoes are soaked.
How long before we get there, Lucie?

228
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:22,489
Stop that whistling, William.
- Do not worry. Nobody hears us here.

229
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,914
Not that way.
You should know, or not?

230
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,755
They say that if you whistle at
Saints that evil you hear.

231
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,837
You hear too much in that bar.

232
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,656
What is she doing?

233
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:02,030
"Light attracts up to the Grim Reaper.
- That I hear often, indeed.

234
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,174
Shit.

235
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:29,064
Good. Here.

236
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,323
I'm pretty disappointed.
This is almost too easy.

237
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,693
No sound until we reach the door.
- Do not worry.

238
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,492
I can scroll through the door,
if necessary.

239
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:36,290
Without a crowbar,
We can stand here all night.

240
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,464
No destruction or I'm out of here.
I warned you.

241
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:46,763
Hey, do not worry.
Come on, let's look around the corner.

242
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,352
Where are you going?
- Come on. Come on.

243
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,267
Now he wants to know.

244
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,515
I have a feeling,
that this was not best idea

245
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,393
working with you to commit a burglary.

246
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,277
It's not too late to return,
and a nice cold beer.

247
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,305
Welcome. Welcome.

248
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,013
Here I am.

249
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,763
I must tell you something very important.

250
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,436
Lucie paid the first round,
if we leave now.

251
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,649
Ben, a new life awaits you.
- Nothing can stop me inside to wait.

252
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:40,611
This leads nowhere.

253
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,740
We came here with no intention to
destruction to apply.

254
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:49,325
And we do not even know what we seek.
- We shall see.

255
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,448
So many people come and go.

256
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,261
Here.

257
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,445
Welcome.

258
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,277
And where are you going?

259
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,489
The daredevil may as before.

260
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,122
Come on, you.

261
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,163
Can?

262
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,672
Okay.

263
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,052
Ben? Hey, Ben.

264
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:52,596
Yes, I'm coming. You know I'm afraid
alone in the dark are, asshole.

265
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,471
Can?

266
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,109
It is quite difficult to get back
to go outside.

267
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,275
Especially when we have a safe
around the bear.

268
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,277
We worry about it later.
Okay?

269
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,322
Anyway, if there are valuables
these are safe,

270
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:17,451
then it is certainly not the vault between these
inlet hose. Let's go upstairs.

271
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,712
Hey, Klavel.
What are you doing?

272
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,064
Do not forget that we
came through here.

273
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,398
And where is that old woman?
- Top floor.

274
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,612
Next.

275
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,424
I see almost nothing.
Maybe we can do to better the light.

276
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:58,723
Good idea.
We will call the police?

277
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,642
Ga is look around,
instead of spouting nonsense.

278
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,391
Will, I have no good feeling about this.

279
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,315
What would you do differently?
Would you give up now?

280
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,409
Will, look. I think it is silver.
'T Looks from rare.

281
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,116
Do you need a teapot?
- No, I do not -

282
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,332
Wow.

283
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,915
Seriously? A rusty scissors?

284
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:32,590
Are you a wanderer?
- How would I know. Leave me alone.

285
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:38,346
Her idea of ??a treasure is probably
a mountain of precious coins and jewels.

286
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,555
I hope so.

287
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,734
Shit.

288
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:07,121
Damn.
I shit in my pants here.

289
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:11,044
What do you think taxidermy pretty again?
- Taxidermie.

290
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:14,093
Barbarians.
- Taxidermie.

291
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:19,223
Hey, no trace behind?
- Yes. My excuse.

292
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,769
Looks like your girlfriend.

293
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,910
Shit. Everything is locked down here.

294
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,159
Does not matter.
We go upstairs.

295
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,783
What kind of pictures are these?

296
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:42,091
Jessel had only one daughter. She was
deaf since birth and is long dead.

297
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,765
Of the survivors, we will in any case
received no complaints.

298
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,813
Hey, come here.

299
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,698
What the hell is this again?

300
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,291
Dolls.

301
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,708
Gossiping at coffee time.

302
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,958
What a child
Well here wants to play?

303
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:23,927
This is nothing.

304
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,944
Women may first.

305
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,042
Shit.

306
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,333
Nothing shit. If this door is locked
and the other is not

307
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,084
there must be a reason for it, right?
I bet that my treasure lies there.

308
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:02,428
Great, but we have not the key.
And we do not know where it is.

309
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,674
No kidding, Sherlock.
- Jessel. She wears a key around her neck.

310
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,894
Stop it.
- That must be the key to this door.

311
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,889
If there is anything at all here behind.
- This old woman knows nothing.

312
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,266
They will not come up more awareness.
- I do not.

313
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:19,396
We borrow the key only.
For a while.

314
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,148
Well done, sister.

315
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,326
Shit.
- Come, let me try.

316
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,583
Okay, that's enough.
We break them.

317
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:49,257
This brings only problems.
We bring the key back and run away.

318
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:52,257
Stop agree with that negative thinking.
I guarantee you that -

319
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,180
Oh, brother, what have you done?

320
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:59,347
We have no choice.
We must go now.

321
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,277
Shit.

322
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,329
Nothing here.

323
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:21,619
Where has it that hidden treasure?
Here is nothing!

324
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,541
Be still.

325
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,184
Oh, shit.

326
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,008
What the hell is this again?

327
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,220
It is a corpse.

328
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,312
I think it Jessel's daughter.

329
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,902
This is their greatest treasure.

330
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,704
Illuminating the ground again,
there's some.

331
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,776
Shut up!
- No!

332
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,460
It's that old woman.
Hear that?

333
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,837
No, that's impossible.

334
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:40,387
That is not impossible. Electricity is
the only thing that works here and nothing else.

335
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,025
Okay, let's go.
Come on, we leave.

336
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,425
Come on, come at once.

337
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,552
Help me.

338
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,844
What is this nonsense?

339
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,137
We're stuck!

340
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,021
I know!
In Jessel's room has a window.

341
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,893
A window without security.
- What are you talking about, Lucie?

342
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:34,691
You know that we no longer
up to. Hear that?

343
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:38,941
But they can not possibly be awakened.
It is the only way to the outside.

344
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,909
Okay, we'll try. Come.

345
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,187
Where is she gone?
- Mrs. Jessel?

346
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,274
We need as quickly as possible get out.

347
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,059
Come on, William. The window.

348
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:25,033
Damn, Lucie, you said -
- I tell you, that previously was not.

349
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,837
There must be a way to get outside.

350
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,101
Ben?

351
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,435
Ben?
- Ben?

352
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,401
Ben?

353
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,108
Ben?

354
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:20,251
Ben? Ben?
Where have you been doing?

355
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,515
Hey, Lucie.

356
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,181
Come.

357
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,567
Come on, quick.

358
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,112
Damn, there is no door.

359
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,909
There is no door.
This can not?

360
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,845
That's not good enough, dammit!

361
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,613
Deborah Anne and Jessel. December 1935

362
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,908
Hey, I think she has beaten Anna.

363
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:02,158
Who has beaten Anna?
- Jessel's daughter.

364
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,410
I despise the name of Jessel's daughter.

365
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,458
Come on, we find her room.
- You have seen everything. There is nothing.

366
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,378
No treasure, no key, nothing.
- Keep it right here.

367
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,548
Try the window again.
- Save that nonsense for you, Lucie.

368
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:17,139
We're not going anywhere until we Are
have been found. Okay?

369
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:20,885
Do what I say.

370
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:40,709
Ophelie, you're hopeless.
Leave the room, immediately!

371
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:12,036
Ladies, go home.

372
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,202
Do not forget to bow.

373
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,713
Now, fast.

374
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,553
Anna.

375
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,309
Only people who we do not know, honey.

376
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,731
Anna!

377
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,994
Anna!

378
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,451
Do not go outside!

379
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,539
Make that mistake again.

380
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,227
William.

381
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,607
William.

382
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,274
William.

383
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,146
Lucie.

384
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:35,952
Are you there, Lucie?

385
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,946
William.

386
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:41,750
William.

387
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,998
Ben?

388
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,585
What are you doing with that thing on your head?

389
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:57,307
What is this?
Where were you?

390
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,798
Ben, do not!

391
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:45,514
Do not, Ben!
- What is going on? - Ben! - William!

392
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:48,358
I'm stuck! William!

393
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:55,073
Do not, Ben! Do not!

394
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,866
William! William!

395
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:53,640
Dance! Come on.

396
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,643
Come on!

397
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,485
The sun and moon do not want you, Anna.

398
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:03,275
And the people who live below even less.

399
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:08,652
Your life is here. With me.

400
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,448
Go!

401
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,451
Retry.

402
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:18,082
Retry.
Your dedication to learn to dance

403
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:21,297
will ensure that you do not again
trying to escape.

404
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,384
Again, please, more!
Down, up, down.

405
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,424
Again, with more deflection.

406
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:33,552
Again, please, and beyond.

407
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,054
Deeper, lower, lower.

408
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:39,433
More. Do it well, deeper.

409
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:42,732
More, more, more.

410
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,242
Anna?

411
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,530
Anna.

412
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,714
Anna.

413
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,097
You're not dead.

414
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,502
You're just broken.

415
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,937
Mrs. Wilson?

416
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,869
What are you -
What are you doing there?

417
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:06,875
I lost my job to execute it.

418
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,762
Wilson?
Why are you still here?

419
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:22,554
Why are you not yet gone,
like the rest?

420
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,897
Why do you say nothing?

421
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:27,251
You had a book with you,
or not? Treasure?

422
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,462
William ...

423
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:39,342
He has long maintained.

424
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,882
Mother?

425
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:16,723
Anna. Come back.

426
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:55,098
A person.
- Dance, my daughter.

427
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,274
Dance!

428
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,324
Dance!

429
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,463
Be obedient.

430
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,721
Run!

431
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:07,497
Do not be afraid for the evening.
