You want it?

4
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,469
Is it yours?

5
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,516
No, not mine.

6
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,156
Yours.

7
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,231
How much do you want for it?

8
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,396
Whatever you think it's worth.

9
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,636
Exactly the figure I had in mind.

10
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,950

It's a mystery to me, a mystery how those
assholes at Assignment knew it.

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,269
This is Joey Summerskill,
for Channel 8, Emergency Room.

17
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,316
Very bored, no story,

18
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,152
no life,

19
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,435
really, really pissed off.

Break it down, Doc, it's a wrap.

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,188
Joey, rein it in, kid.
They couldn't have known.

23
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,236
I know, I know.

24
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,356
It's just so... neat, isn't it?

25
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,150
My first gig that isn't kindergarten kids
or diet gurus is taken away from me.

26
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,113
Well, like you say, it's a mystery,
but that's all it is, a mystery.

27
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,672
Not malice. You really think the station
bought off every accident victim in the city?

Better hurry, Doc.
A real story with a real reporter.

34
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,475
Joey, look, can I take you home?
I can go by your place.

35
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,916
You'll miss the money shots. No.
I'll catch a bus. Don't worry.

36
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,912
OK, but be careful.

37
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,357
And lighten up. The story of your life
could be around the corner.

38

- Sure.

43

Help me.

44
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,070

Don't hurt him!

Wait! Wait, please. I need to talk to you.

50
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,755
I wasn't even with him!
Look, lady, I told you, it's not my problem.

51
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,796
I was just there, right?

52
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,836
- Where?
- The Boiler Room.

53
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,072
- Can I go now?
- What is the Boiler Room? Where is it?

See? This is what I mean.

65
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,432
Your technique, it's all wrong.

66
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,157
- What do you mean, technique?
- Hardly any thigh.

hot - bingo, you're an anchorwoman.

You're too straight.

You gonna let me in or what?

No, no, nothing like that, no.

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,237
Hey, this is great, isn't it?

162
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,276
I mean, just, er...

163
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,316
two girls, talking,

164
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,589
having a conversation.

165
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,636
Good coffee.

166
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,035
- You got a cigarette?
- Uh, yeah, just a second.

167
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,436
Great, thanks.

168
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,796
- Are you going to have one?
- I'm trying to quit.

169
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,672
Go on. What the fuck, huh?

170
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,513
Do you think you're going to live forever?

171
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,752
(Sighs)

172
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,436
Oh, you want to talk about that, huh?

173
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,638
Something awful happened to that boy
and I have to know what it was.

174
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,280
Look, I don't know anything, all right?

175
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,430
I come out of the club,
the kid's already lying in the street.

176
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,351
- Did you know him?
- No.

177
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,512
OK, I've seen him in the club
a couple of times.

178
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,956
He's a punkhead. I never really danced
with him or anything.

179
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,952
And he was a thief.
He must have taken it from a statue.

180
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,635
- Taken what?
- That thing.

181
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,831
He's lying in the street, moaning,
and pointing at it.

182
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,832
But the chains, where did they come from?

183
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,559
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

184
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,876
He said it came out of this.

185
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,916
(Man) So, when do you wanna go in?

186
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,436
Hey, hold on a sec.

187
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,236
All done, Mr Monroe.

188
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,036
Huh. What a dick.

189
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,431
Why are we here? Want a cigarette?

190
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,476
Sure.

191
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,636
(Thud)

192
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,036
(Clicking)

193
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,756
(Creaking)

194
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,277
Oh, what the...

195
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,316
(Rumbling)

196
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,516
(Clicking)

197
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,157
- Aargh! Aargh!
- (Squealing)

198
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,595
Get off!

199
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,068
- Aaargh!
- (Squealing)

200
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,233
Bitch!

201
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,276
(Squelching)

202
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,432
Whoa!

203
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,960
(Coughing)

204
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,477
- Did I sleep through an earthquake?
- I thought I'd make breakfast.

205
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,994
Oh, that's really nice of you, Terri.

206
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,434
Can I ask, is it always this exploratory?

207
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,476
Uh, I don't know.

208
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,757
It's my first time. I'm a kitchen virgin.

209
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,518
- I'll boil some water.
- No, I'll do it.

210
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,832
No, no, it's OK. I like boiling water.
It's a speciality of mine.

211
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,795
Look, why don't you go watch some...

212
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,836
some cartoons?

213
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,871
This is a really great place.

214
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,555
This is yours? You, like, own this?

215
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,119
Well, the bank owns it,
but I'm working on it.

216
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,872
I haven't even had a place of my own
since I was 15.

217
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,036
Ow, ow.

218
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,268
What a great view. This is a great view.
Would you look at this?

219
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,275
Well, actually I'm pretty familiar
with the view. But it is good.

220
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,035
You know, over to the left,
you can... see...

221
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,756
I love it here.

222
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,116
I have to solve this thing.

223
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,919
I have to find out what's going on.

224
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,912
- You mentioned a statue.
- Yeah, I found it.

225
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,470
- I knew he'd like it.
- Oh, wait a minute. He, who? The kid?

226
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,755
No, JP, my last boyfriend.

227
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,513
He owns a club.
You know, you were there.

228
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,593
- He bought the statue.
- That you found.

229
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,636
What do you mean, you found it?

230
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,236
Well, there's a store. It's really hip.
Lots of weird shit in there.

231
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,312
I don't know, I saw this statue pillar thing...

232
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,868
I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.

233
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,474
Would you know the place
if you saw it again?

234
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,438
- Sure. Why?
- We're going shopping.

235
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,309
- Maybe they're closed today.
- (Man) Closed every day.

236
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,153
Owner's in Hawaii.
Been there about a month.

237
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,076
Bull. My boyfriend bought something here
last week.

238
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,912
Couldn't have.

239
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,594
- Are you sure?
- Sure. Lived here 20 years.

240
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,671
I see everything. Come on.

241
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,149
(Dog yelping and growling)

242
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,509
Dead end.

243
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,750
Still, there's a back door, right?

244
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,349
Five seconds, we're browsing.

245
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,438
Wow. I didn't think this place
would be like this.

246
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,875
These places are always all show.

247
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,428
Do you break into a lot of art galleries?

248
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,115
I break in anywhere if it's raining
and I need a place to sleep.

249
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,156
So what are we looking for?

250
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,959
Anything. Contacts, clues...

251
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,956
Anything.

252
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,791
Oh, this is going to take forever. (Sighs)

253
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,874
How much do you think
your ex paid for that?

254
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,349
Whatever it took. Why?

255
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,832
Because this place is a scam.

256
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,392
Half the stuff was picked up for pennies.
School art classes, bankruptcy sales...

257
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,755
And closed-down lunatic asylums.

258
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,719
Property of the Shanard Institute.

259
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,756
Hey, Joey.

260
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,674
- Yeah?
- Check it out.

261
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,035
It's the box. (Giggles)

262
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,914
(d Rock music)

263
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,792
Ooh, ouch, hubba, hubba...

264
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,479
Hi, baby.

265
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,394
- Welcome.
- You're JP Monroe, right?

266
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,357
- Right.
- And this is your club?

267
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,034
- Right again.
- Great club. I love it here.

268
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,634
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the rose.

269
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,714
That's a prize. You won it. I only award that
to a woman of exceptional beauty.

270
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,553
Lots of girls here
are better looking than I am.

271
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,870
No, no, no, no, no. Don't do that.

272
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,916
Don't put yourself down.

273
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,639
If you have a quality,
you should be proud of that.

274
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,632
Let that define you, whatever it is.

275
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,036
(Heavy breathing)

276
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,396
Aaargh!

277
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,474
(Laughing)

278
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,916
It's Joey Summerskill again.

279
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,993
For half an hour you've been dicking me
around about this tape.

280
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,073
I know it's late. I don't want to have
to get my station manager involved.

281
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,912
So, for the last time,

282
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,357
please get me whoever is in charge
of the Shanard video archives?

283
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,273
Thank you. Of course I'll hold.

284
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,989
Dr Fallan, how nice of you to take my call.

285
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,036
Can you hold on for a second?

286
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,076
Terri! What are you doing?

287
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,276
Can you just wait two seconds?

288
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,676
Dr Fallan, so sorry.

289
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,433
Michael? We need the Kirsty Cotton tape.

290
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,670
Your assistant has all the details.

291
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,716
OK, thanks a lot.

292
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,756
Bye-bye.

293
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,751
Yeah!

294
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,796
So, you got what you needed.

295
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,836
So, I guess we're all done.

296
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,876
So, uh...

297
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,916
So long.

298
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,956
Where will you go?

299
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,193
Look, you know there's a spare room
and you can always stay.

300
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,590
If you want.
You're more than welcome to, really.

301
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,156
Uh, wow, um...

302
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,236
That's great.

303
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,871
Um... I'll do breakfast.

304
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,472
So cool.

305
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,516
Radical.

306
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,516
Wow, you've got great taste.

307
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,196
This really says it, you know.

308
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,875
It's really... It's really dark.

309
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,916
- Don't you think?
- Mm-hm.

310
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,714
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?

311
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,756
Uh-uh.

312
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,796
If it bothers you, just say so.

313
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,917
- Doesn't bother me. I'm just not interested.
- Oh.

314
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,995
Like I'm not an interesting person?

315
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,111
But you gave me a rose.

316
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,192
And tomorrow,
I'll give one to somebody else.

317
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,957
Now, get dressed
and get out of here.

318
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,836
You shit.

319
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,388
Who do you think you are?

320
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,232
I'm JP Monroe, right?

321
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,233
You stupid bitch, give me back my shirt
and get the fuck out of my life.

322
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,276
I can't fucking believe you.

323
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,069
You bastard! You get me in here and...

324
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,277
Like you were at fucking gunpoint,
you stupid...

325
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,158
You think you're some goddam prince
or something!

326
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,796
With your shitty little kingdom out there
and all this ugly shit!

327
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,997
(Gasps)

328
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,270
(Whimpers)

329
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,319
Aaaargh!

330
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,112
Jesus Christ!

331
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,952
Not quite.

332
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,553
What did you see? The same as I?

333
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,189
Appetite sated, desire indulged,

334
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,829
a miniature of the world
and how it will succumb to us.

335
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,798
You enjoyed the girl.

336
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,592
Yes...

337
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,356
Good. So did I.

338
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,992
And that's all.

339
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,514
No, it's not the same.

340
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,592
I just know, what you did,
that was fucking evil.

341
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,398
(Laughs)

342
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,158
Oh, how uncomfortable that word must feel
on your lips, "evil", "good."

343
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,916
There is no good, Monroe.
There is no evil. There is only flesh

344
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,390
and the patterns to which we submit it.

345
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,634
You will help me to...

346
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,350
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No fucking way, man.

347
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,997
No fucking way.

348
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,156
Oh, how touching.

349
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,596
That is the gun you used to kill your parents.

350
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,069
I understand. Their fortune was so tempting,
their affection so conditional,

351
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,310
what else could you do?

352
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,356
Fuck you.

353
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,028
Now, can we talk sensibly?

354
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,917
(Whimpering)

355
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,236
No.

356
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,076
Don't flee from yourself.

357
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,836
If you have a quality, be proud of it.
Let it define you, whatever it is.

358
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,874
By helping me you will help yourself.

359
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,748
Oh, yes, you want to.

360
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,752
You always have.

361
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,037
With your paintings, your sculptures...

362
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,634
Look at these tawdry representations

363
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,510
and then imagine a world of the body
as canvas, the body as clay.

364
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,910
Your will and mine
as the brush and the knife.

365
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,355
(Man banging on door) Mr Monroe!

366
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,874
Mr Monroe, are you all right in there?

367
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,913
- Mr Monroe!
- There is a place at my right hand for you.

368
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,439
For a man of your tastes.

369
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,149
Tastes I can help you to indulge.

370
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,992
(Banging continues)

371
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,231
Flesh, power,

372
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,276
dominion.

373
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,316
Mr Monroe!

374
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,116
I heard some shots. Are you OK?

375
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,836
Everything's fine.

376
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,796
(d Rock music pounding)

377
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,792
How do we start?

378
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,394
It has already begun.

379
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,434
Hey, Joey.

380
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,988
Wait up. Where are you going?

381
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,595
Oh, I need to get some fresh air.
I've been stuck in the office all day.

382
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,756
This just came for you.
Something for your story?

383
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,273
Erm... I hope so.

384
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,238
This story, Joey, if I can help in any way,

385
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,039
you've got my number, all right?

386
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,872
OK. Thanks.

387
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,832
'I don't know what the box is,
but I know what it does.

388
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,956
'I've said all this before.

389
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,750
'I saw it open. I opened it.

390
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,954

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,510
'I don't know what else to call them.
Demons.

392

'Demons live in the box.

'Look, I know you don't believe me.

395
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,796
'I know how it sounds.

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,198
'What else? What else?

00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,434
(Sobs) 'Can you turn that fucking thing off?

'She's telling the truth, Joey.'

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,272
'... and then they come, the demons.'

411
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,553
Man, Joey must have polished you up some.

412
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,280
She must be weirder than me.

413
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,356
(Phone)

414
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,392
Joey?

415
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,072
Not quite.

416
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,714
- JP?
- Alive and in the flesh.

417
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,189
How are you doing, baby?

418
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,714
- What do you want?
- I'm just concerned.

419
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,756
I'm just checking in.

420
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,594
- How did you get this number?
- Will you relax, honey?

421
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,389
Your girlfriend left cards all over the club,
remember?

422
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,597
'Uh, yeah. Well, I'm fine.'

423
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,352
Joey's going to get me a job
at the TV station,

424
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,275
and I'm meeting a lot of new people,
it's really great.

425
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,958
Now, come on. You can't tell me
you haven't thought about me.

426
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,077
Course I have. I mean, I've thought.

427
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,749
God, JP, you were really horrible.

428
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,798
I am a bad guy

429
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,714
but I try not to be, I really do,
and I really miss you.

430
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,196
I miss you, too.

431
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,670
Good. Why don't you come over here?

432
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,878
'Nothing heavy, just a little drink, maybe,
see how we both feel.'

433
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,916
No, I can't.

434
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,349
(Sobs) I just can't.

435
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,716
- (Phone)
- Shit!

436
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,076
Shit! Shit!

437
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,232
(Answerphone) 'This is Joey. Speak.'

438
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,550
(Man) 'Hey, Joey, congratulations.

439
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,916
'You may not have heard,
but you got that job in Monterey.

440

your condo.' (Laughing)

(Door opens)

442
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,356
Terri?

443
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,796
"Enjoy Monterey, you liar."

444
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,836
Thanks.

445
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,749
Hey, baby. Glad you could make it.

446
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,396
Come on in.

447
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,556
Not a good neighbourhood.

448
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,596
People disappear.

449
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,513
So, feel like home?
It's just like you left it, baby.

450
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,511
Not quite.

451
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,750
- That wasn't here.
- This?

452
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,593
Well, as you can see,
I'm having some work done on this.

453
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,674
You found a real treasure for me here.
I just hope I can show you how grateful I am.

454
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,716
Yeah? Well, it looks different.

455
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,473
A girl I know helped to smarten it up a bit.

456
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,915
She put her heart and soul into this.

457
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,956
(Laughing)

458
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,031
What a girl. Anyone I should know?

459
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,557
No. Honey, now that you're here,
it's like she doesn't even exist.

460
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,596
You know what I mean, right?

461
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,516
Yeah, right. Look, JP...

462
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,709
Terri, Terri, Terri, Terri...

463
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,031
You know it's got to be ticking away
in both our minds.

464
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,271
Is it going to happen,
isn't it going to happen?

465
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,990
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on.

466
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,714
You know we gotta get this out of the way.

467
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,155
Then we can relax. We can talk.

468
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,440
I don't think so.

469
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,516
- Not yet.
- (Sighs)

470
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,831
Sure. Sure, I understand.

471
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,796
- I'm just not ready yet.
- Registered.

472
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,236
It's cool. I mean, hey, we got all night, right?

473
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,674
(Groaning)

474
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,711
(Child crying)

475
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,108
(Men shouting)

476
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,430
Joey, welcome.

477
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,239
(Explosion, screaming)

478
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,432
(Screaming)

479
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,149
(Explosions)

480
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,755
(Shouting)

481

483
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,554
What a bitch.

484
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,552
- (Sobbing)
- She was obviously just using you.

485
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,950
- She was ready to dump you...
- No!

486
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,996
She wouldn't.

487
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,072
- Come on.
- I must have done something wrong.

488
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,191
I tried, I just fucked up something...

489
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,236
You didn't fuck it up with me!

490
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,915
You know that and you know how sorry I am.

491
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,278
I'm sorry to see you upset like this.
God, I hate to see you in pain.

492
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,430
(Sobs) Really?

493
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:41,469
Yes, I just want to hug you.
I want to hold you, tell you it's all right.

494
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,637
No, no, no, baby.
It's better that you come to me.

495
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,755
It's not fair that I come there.

496
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,278
On the bed.

497
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,196
Come on over here.

498
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,596
Come to Daddy.

499
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,948
Come on... Come on...

500
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,192
No, I can't.

501
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,119
Bring her to me, boy.

502
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,997
You're really making this hard on yourself.

503
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,756
(Pinhead) Aaaargh!

504
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,596
Watch your head on the steps.

505
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,796
Aaaaargh!

506
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,036
Wait!

507
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,437
Why run, Terri? Why run?

508
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,876
Do you know where you are?

509
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,916
I'm...

510
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,318
I'm...

511
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,834
You are at the door to dreams, Terri.

512
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,749
Now, there are two keys in this room.

513
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,229
One is in the pocket of this fool.

514
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,676
You could take it out without me reaching
you...

515
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,716
probably,

516
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,236
and let yourself back
into that world you've always known,

517
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,277
banal, hopeless,

518
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,112
dreamless.

519
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,758
(Sobbing)

520
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,717
And the other?

521
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,110
The other? Oh, Terri,

522
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,112
the other is the key to dreams,

523
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,636
to black miracles and dark wonders.

524
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,149
Another life of unknown pleasures.

525
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,552
And it's yours, Terri.

526
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,030
Complete the pattern
and you solve the puzzle.

527
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,636
Turn the key.

528
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,312
Where is it?

529
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,995
It's lying bleeding at your feet.

530
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,073
Hell has no furies for a woman scorned.

531

(Sobbing)

535
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,676
Oh!

536
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,796
Terri, no!

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,915
Wait. Wait!

560
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,271
You have to help me.
I don't understand. Am I dreaming this?

561
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,956
You'll have to help me.

562
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,237
You will understand,
and, no, you're not dreaming.

563
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,189
Forgive me.
My name was Spencer, Elliott Spencer.

564
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,236
Captain.

565
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,595
Joey Summerskill.

566
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,595
Well done. Brave girl.

567
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,593
You've probably never shaken hands
with a ghost before. Am I right?

568
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,513
Captain Spencer, uh, Elliott...

569
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,875
what the hell is going on?

570
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,793
Hell is exactly what is going on, Joey,

571
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,791
and we have to stop it.

572
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,630
Will you walk with me a while?

573
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,952
A dream of one war is a dream of all wars.

574
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,672
Your dreams of finding your father
let me find you

575
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,958
and bring you to this place,
this limbo between Heaven and Hell.

576
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,238
I can't act in your world, Joey,
but you can.

577
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,709
What do you want me to do?

578
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,270
There is a monster out there, Joey,
and it's me.

579
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,518
The war pulled poetry out of some of us.

580
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,273
Others, it affected differently.

581
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:11,434
Oh, we're in India, by the way. And it's 1921.

582
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,511
I was like many survivors -

583
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,912
a lost soul with nothing left in which
to believe but gratification.

584
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,596
We'd seen God fail, you see.
So many dead.

585
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,911
For us, He too fall at Flanders.

'It found the monster within me.'

593
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,714
For decades, I served Hell
with no memory of my former life.

594
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,839
- I still don't...
- Monster as I was, I was bound by laws.

595
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,276
Hell has its commandments, too, you know.

596
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,512
The box had to be opened to let me out.
The truly innocent were safe,

597
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,114
until a friend released me.

Kirsty Cotton.

599
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,914
Yes, but if your soul was freed...

600
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,434
My evil was too strong.

601
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,436
'It hid,

602
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,159
'it waited.'

603
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,676
Well, no longer, Joey.

604
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,274
The shell of the beast has been fleshed.

605
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,915
What I was is out there in your world,

606
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,556
unbound,

607
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,716
unstoppable.

608
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,118
- Then what can we do?
- There is something we can do

609
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,156
but it will require great courage.

610
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,392
- I don't know that I have...
- You just stepped through your window

611
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,232
to another reality.

612
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,434
You're stronger than you think.

613
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,034
- Tell me what to do.
- There is a gateway to Hell

614
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,076
through which he can be taken back.

615
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,116
He wants to close that door forever.

616
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,156
Where is it?

617
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,869
Your apartment.

618
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,718
It's the box, Joey. He has to destroy it.

619
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,395
You must go back.
You must let him come for it.

620
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,439
You found the window, Joey.
Use the box to bring him through it.

621
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,753
Bring him here, to my dominion,
where I have power.

622
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,435
- But what if he takes the box from me?
- He can't.

623
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,876
It must be given to him

624
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,713
and that's where your courage will count.

625
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,756
Because, believe me,

626
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,115
he can be very persuasive

627
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,076
and very inventive.

(Pinhead) Oh, it's unbearable, isn't it?

687
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:50,952
The suffering of strangers,
the agony of friends.

688
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,832
There is a secret song
at the centre of the world, Joey,

689
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,674
and its sound is like razors through flesh.

690
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,512
I don't believe you.

691
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,556
Oh, come.

692
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,154
Oh, you can hear its faint echo right now.

693
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,036
I'm here to turn up the volume,

694
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,995
to press the stinking face of humanity into
the dark blood of its own secret heart.

695
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,958
And I'm here to stop you
and send you back to Hell.

696
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,510
(Laughs) Oh, no, you can't stop me, child,

697
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,955
but you don't have to hear the music.

698
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,992
Just give me the box
and I'll free you from the future.

699
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,036
Free yourself from the past.

700
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,076
Don't debate with me, girl!

701
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,948
Just come here and die, while you still have
the option of doing it quickly!

702
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,632
You're going to have to come and get me,
you ugly fuck!

703
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,394
Oh, spirited.

704
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,636
Oh, good.

705
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,154
Oh, very good.

706
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,314
Oh, I'll enjoy making you bleed

707
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,036
and I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.

(Sizzling)

713
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,472
Aaah!

01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,393
(Whirring)

715
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,797
Oh, Doc, no.

716
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,313
Have you seen what he did to me,
you little bitch? Have you seen?

717
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,637
- (Screams)
- Where are you going?

718
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,597
- Run! Get out of here!
- Relax.

719
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,511
Everything's cool.

720
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,710
Whoa, what the fu...

721
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,352
Oooh!

722
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,635
Ready for your close-up, Joey?

723
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,396
(Taxi driver) No! Help!

724
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,637
Aaaargh!

725
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,116
(Whirring)

726
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,676
Aah!

727
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,276
(Gasps)

728
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,957
(Screams)

729
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,595
(Sirens)

730

(Tyres screeching)

731
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,758
- Get the hell out of here!
- Just calm down...

732
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,400
- Shit!
- No, listen to me. Listen.

733
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,718
(Police officer) Freeze! I said, freeze!
(Joey) Run!

734
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,155
(Officer) Calm down, please.

735
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,196
(Whirring)

736
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,639
Shit! Get back!

737
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,749
Get down, lady!

738
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,233
Shit! Gasoline!

739
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,636
Run!

740
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,278
(Screaming)

741
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,596
(Whirring)

742
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,918
That's a wrap.

743
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,352
(Gasping)

744
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,477
My child, what's the matter?
What on earth's the matter?

745
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,677
I have to get him back to my apartment,
back to the window,

746
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,513
but they just keep coming,
they just keep coming.

747
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,876
- Who keeps coming?
- The demons. The demons.

748
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,431
Demons? Demons aren't real.
They're parables, metaphors.

749
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,753
(Doors creaking)

750
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,711
Then what the fuck is that?

751
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,996
Come on! Come on!

752
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,952
How dare you?

753
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,316
Thou shalt not bow down
before any graven image.

754
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,472
(Roars)

755
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,313
I am the way.

756
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,879
(Laughter)

757
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,509
No!

758
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,956
You'll burn in Hell for this!

759
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:34,275
Burn. Of such a limited imagination.

760
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:46,637
This is my body, this is my blood.

761
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,190
Happy are they who come to my supper.

762
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,958
(Squelching)

763
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,430
Come on. Come on and get it.
This is what you want.

764
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,628
- (Roars)
- (Coughing and retching)

765
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,717
(Gasps)

766
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,110
(Rhythmic beeping)

767
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,590
I can dream now, Joey.

768
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,831
Oh, you wouldn't believe
what I can dream of now.

769
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,916
- Terri.
- Relax, baby.

770
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,911
This is better than sex.

771
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,031
- (Whimpers)
- Oh, yeah.

772
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,872
Oh, yeah.

773
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,951
Aah!

774
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,789
Aaah!

775
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,720
They're hand-made, Joey.

776
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,349
The shadow of my former troops,
over-eager.

777
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,989
But let them play, hm?

778
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,548
Our game will come later.

779
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:14,829
Down the dark decades of your pain
this will seem like a memory of Heaven.

780
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,275
(Whirring)

781
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,189
Aaah. More friends
come to play with you, Joey.

782
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,480
Play with this, Pinhead.

783
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,271
- Aah!
- (Gasps)

784
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,960
(Roaring)

785
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,993
Aaargh!

786
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,195
(Sizzling)

787
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,748
(Screams)

788
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,151
Was that it, Elliott?

789
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,549
I didn't bring him through my window.

790
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,872
Elliott?

791
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,236
(Birdsong)

792
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,553
Daddy?

793
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:31,795
I don't understand. I was somewhere else,
somewhere shining.

794
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,950
Somebody came to me and said,

795
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,634
"Your daughter's done well. Go to her."

796
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,872
- I don't understand.
- I do.

797
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,758
I do. It's a reward. Oh, Daddy.

798
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,796
(Sobbing)

799
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,549
Joey, Joey.

800
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,313
- Is it you? Is it really you?
- Yes.

801
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,794
Joey, they said you'd have
something for me.

802
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,758
Something you won't need any more.

803
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,115
This. Here, take it.

804
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,152
(Sobs) How did you know my name?

805
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,389
Thank you, Joey.

806
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,391
(Demonic laughter)

807
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:30,035
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Human dreams.

808
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:34,193
Such fertile ground
for sowing the seeds of torment.

809
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,790
You're so ripe, Joey,
and it's harvest time.

810
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,633
(Sobs) It isn't fair! You can't!

811
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,716
Save your tears.

812
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,314
I'll reap your sorrow, slowly.

813
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:52,518
I have centuries to discover
the things that make you whimper.

814
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,957
Uhh!

815
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:59,311
You bastard! You invaded my mind!

816
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,551
You think your night-time world
is closed to me?

817
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,393
Your mind is so naked.

818
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:10,349
A book that yearns to be read,
a door that begs to be opened.

819
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,748
A door. Window...

820
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,796
Window.

821
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,990
(Thunder)

822
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,994
Couldn't resist playing games, could you?

823
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,549
You had to come through
the window of her mind,

824
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,116
but now you're in my dominion.

825
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,033
And now...

826
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,076
we're going to Hell.

827
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,116
Ladies first.

828
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:56,435
- No!
- You'll like her better this way.

829
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,158
Trust me.

830
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:09,349
Why resist? You love this as much as I.

831
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,275
After all, you made me.

832
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,791
There is a world out there
waiting to yield to us.

833
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,829
So much flesh,
so many different pleasures.

834
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,995
(Muffled cries)

835
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,552
(Screeching)

836
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,749
(Creaking)

837
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,274
(Muffled scream)

838
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,109
You're right. We do belong together.

839
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,992
(Whirring)

840
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,916
(Growls)

841
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,320
Now, where were we?

842
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,198
Joey! Send me to Hell!

843
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,195
(Growling)

844
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,079
Aaah.

845
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,236
Ha, ha, ha.

846
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,432
Go to Hell!

847
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,318
(Sizzling)

848
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,950
