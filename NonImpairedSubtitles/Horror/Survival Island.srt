1
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,096
They were expecting us
but this is ridiculous.

2
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,292
It looks like ... Mardi Gras.

3
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,252
A good luck.
- Thanks.

4
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,337
Look. What do you think?

5
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,776
You are a cunning businesswoman.

6
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,294
Is this the boat?
- Yes.

7
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,298
The former Massachusetts.
Ideal for these waters.

8
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,054
Well done, Jack. He is beautiful.

9
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,294
M. Madsen ...
- Call me Jack.

10
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,774
Gary Richards. Your master.

11
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,016
This is Jennifer.
- Hi, Jennifer.

12
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,211
This is Gail.
- Hi, Gail.

13
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,330
And this is Bill.

14
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,932
Shy, slow, grumpy ...
- Who is that?

15
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,012
Manny and Pepe.
They will help me.

16
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,808
Manny knows where the fish are.

17
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,938
If he wants ...

18
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,418
Note the small ones.
There is a laptop.

19
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,729
I know what you think. Stout!

20
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,818
My God.

21
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,258
What happens?

22
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,897
This will leave traces.

23
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,648
Damn.
- Jack ... difficult you do not.

24
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,538
She is right. Keep your outside.

25
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,129
That was strange.

26
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,135
Let's just eat.

27
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,658
There he goes again.
- It 's true.

28
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,533
They were gay.
- But no. You imagine you in.

29
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,492
More than that even. They were so ...

30
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,094
Damn.

31
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,408
Manny, bring a bottle.
Tonight we celebrate.

32
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,097
Health.
- At us. And the rest of the pot.

33
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,098
Our ...
- And the rest of the pot!

34
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,533
Take a glass, Manny.

35
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,139
No, thanks.

36
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,054
Tough day at the port?
- Excuse me?

37
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,452
The señorita is difficult?
Drink a glass with us.

38
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,733
A little. What I am concerned,
does wonders.

39
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,857
Need anything?

40
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,139
No, everything okay. Thank you.

41
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,257
You had nothing to say, Jack.
- This guy is an idiot.

42
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,813
I have to lose.

43
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,011
For me is roads
on the quay as a Marlin.

44
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,973
I would you could tear.
- No, too late.

45
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,774
I have a headache.

46
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,892
Have a beer.
As in the good old days.

47
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,819
That I am happy.
- Come on, Homer.

48
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,338
Wil je 'n aspirin?
- No.

49
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,138
Show me your legs.

50
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,138
Merry Christmas.

51
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,769
Do you like?

52
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,010
Please use your teeth?

53
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,490
Tighter.

54
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,418
Ever get someone to.

55
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,249
What would he do?

56
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,652
Who says it's a 'he' is?

57
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,691
What would they do?

58
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,453
Not ...

59
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,609
He call all the whole morning.
He makes me crazy.

60
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,214
Someone watch it on us.

61
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,530
Shall I tell him something?
- No.

62
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,499
Do we understand each other? Buy, okay?

63
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,339
A moment.
Manuel, have you seen him?

64
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,252
He makes some Margarita's ready.

65
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,938
We wait for 20 minutes on the beers.

66
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,534
's Problem, M. Madsen?

67
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,090
Yes. We are still awaiting the beers.

68
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,456
Immediately, señor.

69
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,457
I'll call you back.
- Señoras.

70
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,697
Thank you.

71
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,933
Thank you very much.

72
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,409
I do not like the attitude
that guy.

73
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,852
I care for it. Keep this course.

74
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,818
You provoke them. I see it.
- It provokes me.

75
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,056
It's a customer!
He gave a lot of money.

76
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,654
He has respect for anyone.

77
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,533
If you do not handle,
you can go.

78
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,378
Okay, I go.

79
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,377
Okay, you go off at the next port.

80
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,491
What happens?

81
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,852
Place ice cream and beer to top.

82
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,939
What is the problem, Manuel?

83
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,768
That is the problem.

84
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,768
Do what he asks.
- Do it yourself.

85
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,612
You have one.

86
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,289
Get him inside.

87
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,411
No, no. Let him go.
Do not do everything at once.

88
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,093
I hope they do not
to bring here.

89
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,455
Margarita Are there no more?

90
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,533
What will they do?
- Striking until he is dead.

91
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,373
Throw him back.

92
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,817
My God. Smoke.

93
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,418
Captain!
We have a problem above.

94
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,611
What happens?
- Everything is on fire.

95
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,578
Damn. Look how big he is.

96
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,128
Help us!

97
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,091
Manny, Evacuate passengers.
We leave the boat!

98
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,416
In the life review.

99
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,210
We can reach anyone!

100
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,331
It failed!

101
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,413
Captain!

102
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,739
Captain!

103
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,812
Captain!
- Attention.

104
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,456
I have found him.
He floated in the water.

105
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,136
My God!

106
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,977
Still others seen?

107
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,013
Seen Jack?

108
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,540
I can not believe it.

109
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,297
It is so cold.

110
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,492
I have huge cold.

111
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,897
It's okay. It is good.

112
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,093
Good day.

113
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,451
Thank you
have kept me warm tonight.

114
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,816
You did the same with me.

115
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,411
How long will it take
before they come looking for us?

116
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,572
They do not yet know
that we are missing.

117
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,251
Yes, but when they hear ...

118
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,769
It can take weeks,
maybe months.

119
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,169
We are not in Miami.

120
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,934
It seems that the
you can not care what happens.

121
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,449
I am glad that I am still alive.

122
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,011
Wil you?

123
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,736
Is there anything else?

124
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,339
If lunch or dinner?
- No, I ... in general.

125
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,969
Maybe catch, I got lucky.

126
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,574
Can we really no fire lighting?

127
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,130
With what?
- No idea.

128
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,492
You mask. The rock.
The knife. You can see it in movies.

129
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,970
There are no increases in glass.
And you will find no flint.

130
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,609
How do you know?
- Because I live in such a place.

131
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,733
You think I do not want to fire?
- No, no.

132
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,695
Excuse me.

133
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,291
We have a house built.

134
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,819
A house?

135
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,418
How are you?

136
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,336
I have pain everywhere.
Have you seen something?

137
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,253
Nothing.

138
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,334
We go swimming in the dark.
As clever of you.

139
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,094
And my blisters?
- It will be good to do.

140
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,489
Come on.

141
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,011
Leave your clothes on the beach.
You do not want to sleep in wet clothes.

142
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,650
Come on! There is none.
- You are there.

143
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,698
I do not see what it matters.

144
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,289
We have slept together.

145
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,658
Come on, I will turn a blind eye.

146
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,615
Do not look.

147
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,131
It is very pleasant.

148
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,736
See? You must learn to trust me.

149
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,298
Can I ask you a question?

150
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,654
Go ahead.

151
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,530
Why did you get that girl beaten
on the quay?

152
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,771
You look not a guy out.

153
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,175
They forced me to it.
- Haart store?

154
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,452
Yes. They hit me. They tamped me.

155
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,730
She made me ridiculous
for my friends.

156
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,090
Why did she do that?
- No idea.

157
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,211
Because she refuses
its problems.

158
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,169
She wants me to blame.
And she wants to punish me.

159
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,249
What problems have they?

160
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,899
She is pregnant.

161
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,132
Or that she says.
She wants to marry me.

162
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,014
But I refused.

163
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,410
Is she not a virgin?

164
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,658
Were you a virgin when you married?

165
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,534
That does not matter.
- Reply.

166
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,374
It is your business.
- I understand.

167
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,368
You want to know everything about my life,
but you said nothing about yours.

168
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,252
You work with two weights.

169
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,172
What are you talking about?

170
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,889
You like your man.

171
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,978
You're rich and you think
ways than the rest.

172
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,895
That is not true.
You do not know what I think.

173
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,939
You act stupid.
- Dom?

174
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,608
You think? Listen ...

175
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,371
you can only survive
I eat because you give and for your concern.

176
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,168
I would not hear.

177
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,099
Wil you turn?

178
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,691
Smart ass, Señora!

179
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,659
A perfectly formed heart.

180
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,216
Then maybe God
you do not really heart it.

181
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,218
You sleep?

182
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,336
My mother did that with my father
when I was little.

183
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,533
They punished him doorte silence.
You know what he said to me?

184
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,528
"Pretend you're sad
and enjoy the silence. "

185
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,894
If you have cold,
put you against me.

186
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,617
Go fish?
- Near the reef.

187
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,298
Is not it dangerous?
- The best place for lobster.

188
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,493
What do you think?

189
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,135
From what?

190
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,338
Everything.

191
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,770
I do not want more
you argue, Manuel.

192
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,456
I would also not
argue with you, Señora.

193
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,170
Call me Jenny. Not "Señora".

194
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,333
Okay, Jenny.

195
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,289
Can we be friends?
- We are friends.

196
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,411
We sleep together. Have you forgotten?

197
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,773
You know where you are?

198
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,937
You know who I am?

199
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,898
Jenny!

200
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,048
Jack?

201
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,010
Where were you? Where did you find him?
- On the reef.

202
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,529
Is it? What have you done?

203
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,651
Calm down.
- Okay.

204
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,895
We are almost there.

205
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,658
Bye, honey.

206
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,092
I love you.

207
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,291
What took you so long as?

208
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,690
Put it here.

209
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,811
Jack, put you down, baby.

210
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,254
What? What is it?
- Not in my back.

211
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,853
Here is water.

212
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,256
Here, honey. Drink water.

213
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,134
I thought I had lost you.

214
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,059
Stop, dear ...
- Thanks. Thank you.

215
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,018
Drink water.

216
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,453
Let me, honey.

217
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,612
I missed you.

218
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,896
I must lie down.

219
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,297
Let me.

220
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,093
He sleeps.

221
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,815
He seems not to remember.

222
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,618
He needed rest, nothing more.

223
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,815
Are you hungry?
- Yes.

224
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,931
Thanks you have saved him.

225
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,058
I had it almost done.

226
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,692
Just kidding.

227
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,056
Someone a hot breakfast?

228
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,337
How did you do that?
- What?

229
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,178
The fire lit?
- Oh, that.

230
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,139
I have two pieces of wood
rubbed against each other.

231
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,538
As they do with the scouts.

232
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,651
Unbelievable.
We were not successful.

233
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,818
And I could not catch lobster.

234
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,614
Where did they find?
- On the reef.

235
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,173
And you need glasses.

236
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,376
What sticks do you use?

237
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,176
It is not a native flora ...

238
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,336
You cheated. I knew it.
You are a small child.

239
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,259
Good to see that you feel good.
- It's nice that I feel something.

240
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,968
And Bill and Gail?

241
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,089
I would not talk about.

242
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,295
But you were not silent.
I am ... I ... you know ...

243
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,139
You have a cabin built.
Is there a tank? There is ...

244
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,570
Manuel did 't. I just helped.

245
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,410
Good work. I am builder
and I am impressed.

246
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,292
It smells good, baby.

247
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,933
Yes. Enter.

248
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,569
What do you want?
- I want to open.

249
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,696
Let me.

250
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,218
You trust me with a knife.

251
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,053
I want to keep sharp.

252
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,052
Boring.

253
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,013
Here.

254
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,379
Here.

255
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,253
Wil je?

256
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,176
Go ahead. I go swimming first.

257
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,290
He was so sweet.
- Yes?

258
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,617
it seems that he is good fun.

259
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,689
What do you mean?
- Come on.

260
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,569
It looks like the Blue Lagoon.
And I see no separate rooms.

261
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,532
Stop, Jack.
- "He was so sweet."

262
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,294
We have been trying for 2 days to survive.

263
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,256
We had no time
to build a Hilton.

264
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:29,178
But you had time to
's wedding suite building.

265
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,092
Where are you going?
- I go swimming.

266
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,690
Go. Great.
All children love.

267
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,293
Sorry.

268
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,738
Excuse me.

269
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,333
I'm tired.

270
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,455
I am sad. I am angry.

271
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,252
I'm grumpy.

272
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,490
And ... I, I, I, I ...

273
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,656
And I'm sorry.

274
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,009
We must agree.

275
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,376
Only in this way we come here.

276
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,295
You're right. Easy to ...

277
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,458
Stop to enjoy. Okay?

278
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,092
Does he know where we are?
- No.

279
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,420
Have you seen airplanes?
- No.

280
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,133
A boat?

281
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,735
Cargo ships. Corridors. Nothing?

282
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,374
No, nothing.
- Have you fucked him?

283
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,299
Yes.
- Good.

284
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,253
He is great.
- He is handsome.

285
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,498
Thank you.

286
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,697
What are you doing?

287
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,494
This fluid is
flavors to waste

288
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,019
and other
contain no liquid.

289
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,257
Take the more mature if you want
they are juicy.

290
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,976
Why a mask?

291
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,373
Mask.

292
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,138
No idea. He had him
when we arrived.

293
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,769
You think that strange?

294
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,619
The boat is on fire
and he thinks it a mask to take?

295
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,817
Maybe he was in his pocket.

296
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,979
Perhaps he was glad to see you.
- Very nice ...

297
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,530
You make ridiculous.
- Oh, really?

298
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,093
How did it go?

299
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,298
The water is cloudy.

300
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,372
And the reef?

301
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,692
Too wild. I can not hold
what I collect.

302
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,454
Why do not you come?
- I have no sense.

303
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,655
Is it okay?

304
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,448
Bring a lobster to and
't is better than okay.

305
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,295
It is far. Can you swim well?

306
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,377
Well, I'm not very ...
- She's a great swimmer.

307
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,775
I am not a good swimmer.
- Shut up.

308
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,529
Ok. Come on.

309
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,773
Ok.
- Great. Do you 't fire?

310
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,493
Princess.

311
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,132
You know what really makes me bales?

312
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,770
I can not mourn
to my friends

313
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,455
because Zorro has a knife

314
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,532
and he wants to fuck my wife.

315
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,935
Do me a favor.
Pretend nothing

316
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,377
going on and keep him busy
on the reef

317
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,458
so I can mourn.
- Stop with your bullshit.

318
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,614
I am here
already 2 days longer than you.

319
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,970
So stop cutting.

320
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,178
Okay, I go diving. Stay here.

321
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,938
Stay away from the coral.

322
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,899
You'll cut you if you come out.

323
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,411
You have one. Fantastic.

324
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,857
How deep did you go?
- Twelve meters.

325
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,134
Want to see?
- Okay.

326
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,216
A shark. He is here.

327
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,217
It's okay. He'll do nothing.

328
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,609
You knew he was there, right?

329
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,258
I was just bitten.

330
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,257
Shows. Shows.

331
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,532
A jellyfish.
- It's painful.

332
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,537
You need to pee
to reduce the pain.

333
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,930
I can not
the back of my arm pee.

334
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,613
You need friends.

335
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,811
What have you done, Jack?

336
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,091
He had no need.

337
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,978
How can you do?

338
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,656
Easy. My feet bleed
and my head on fire.

339
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,936
Do you smoke cigars, Manuel?
There are still a lot.

340
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,858
No. Why did you move to the hut?

341
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,172
What do you think? Choose the boot
or hut. 's Whatever.

342
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,649
You should not do, Jack.

343
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,175
Should we all
creep in that cabin?

344
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,178
All right. I take the boat.
- Good choice.

345
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,938
You are not required, Manuel.
- Yes it is.

346
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,539
No, he built them. You built them.

347
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,334
'T even.
- We can take the boat.

348
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,770
What do you mean?
- Me?

349
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,489
You were not allowed to move
without eroverte talk.

350
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,568
That guy like you.
- And you had the captain not to dig.

351
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,578
That's disgusting.
- He like you, huh?

352
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,449
You want to make complicated ...
- It's true.

353
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,537
... not, Jack?
- Not you?

354
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,009
He has saved my life.

355
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,293
He also saved yours.

356
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,616
Yes. But there is a difference.

357
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,573
Come on.

358
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,736
You can at least have some respect.

359
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,494
Why do you say me
what happened here?

360
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,414
Nothing happened.

361
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,210
's in your head. You and rejects it.

362
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,576
Yes?
- Yes, it's in your head.

363
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,815
What is that?
- I was bitten.

364
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,698
A jellyfish.

365
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,417
Good. Bad karma.

366
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,092
It hurts.

367
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,220
How are you?
- Good.

368
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,129
And you?
- Okay.

369
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,496
Sure? You look so disappointed.

370
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,657
From there he can not hear.

371
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,377
's Whatever.

372
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,052
He is stupid.

373
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,055
He thinks we have a relationship.

374
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,612
Maybe this should be so.

375
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,253
Why blame will
if we do not have fun?

376
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,132
Make no jokes about it.

377
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,693
I'm not kidding.

378
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,178
The food is ready.

379
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,054
Is that for me?
- Yes, let me do.

380
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,859
Not necessary.

381
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,256
With greetings from the captain.

382
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,494
Now we both
armed and dangerous.

383
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,930
Manuel said that he
studied for civil engineer.

384
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,495
State to Miami for 2 years.

385
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,013
With such a degree you can
a beautiful building strandhut ...

386
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,853
You know, Jack,

387
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,528
I have enough of your bullshit.

388
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,773
Yes? And what will you do?

389
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,574
Why are you doing this?
- Do you really want to fight me?

390
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,492
What I want ...

391
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,132
I want ...

392
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,615
that you near
my wife continues!

393
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,171
Or I give you a plug.
- Jack! He has not touched me!

394
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,694
Hold on!
- No ...

395
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,818
But that does not
I do not mind me.

396
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,616
Fucking arrogant beach gaper!
- Right.

397
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,896
This means no money.

398
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,773
You are a stupid gringo
itself can provide no food.

399
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,739
But I can cook.
Stay away from my fire!

400
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,493
Wil you big mouth design?

401
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,493
Can you stop?
- Hold your fire.

402
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,811
From now you can eat for sure.

403
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,653
I will do nothing to help you.

404
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,420
We have not needed.
- No?

405
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,976
Once we are here,
I will live to 'make a hell.

406
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,972
Beginning March pray
that they can quickly find.

407
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,252
Because I live you
to 'make a hell.

408
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,332
Great. Great!

409
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,134
That was ... very stupid!

410
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,938
What do we do now?

411
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,019
You can not even find coconut.
Do you think he will give us food?

412
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,371
I ...

413
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,257
I will provide food!

414
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,052
I will provide food!

415
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,133
Are you?

416
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,933
I got one.

417
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,051
That I do not eat.

418
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,295
I do ...

419
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,331
We eat here anymore.

420
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,294
I am a prisoner!

421
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,017
Formidable! That is formidable!

422
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,859
Fine!

423
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,732
I go to the reef.

424
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,455
Here.

425
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,174
Without mask, you see nothing.
- Give me the knife.

426
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,339
For the second.

427
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,498
See you later.

428
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,012
Are you mad at me?
- No.

429
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,458
Would you like to eat?

430
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,178
I can not.

431
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,814
What do you mean?

432
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,656
I would feel
I him in the lurch.

433
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,936
Never mind. It is a fool.

434
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,773
It is my husband.
- He treats you bad.

435
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,415
Normally he does not.

436
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,208
Ok. Be a good wife.
What is it me?

437
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,450
He should not know what you do.
I will not say.

438
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,729
I trust you.
- Do you trust me?

439
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,575
Even when I swear in
's head of my mother?

440
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,938
Or perhaps, Manuel.

441
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,499
I swear the whole world
I will never say.

442
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,976
And if you give me a kiss,
I would not tell him.

443
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,014
Why do you say that?

444
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,575
Because I wanted to kiss you
the first time I saw you.

445
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,051
That's not fair, Manuel.
- Why do you say that?

446
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,610
It is never just a kiss.
- Do not worry.

447
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,615
You should not do what you do not want.
Just some food.

448
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,771
Promise that you will say nothing?

449
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,729
I would never hurt you.

450
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,733
Ok. I want a little bit.
- Okay.

451
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,173
Here.

452
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,252
Some juice?

453
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,213
Thank you.

454
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,376
Sorry for what happened.
- It's your fault.

455
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,450
What?
- You are cute.

456
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,535
No, actually.

457
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,454
Imagine how it would be
Jack and I were alone.

458
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,610
You would probably him
also a kiss questions.

459
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,336
Well. You can still laugh.

460
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,652
I see that you've already done.
- What?

461
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,571
You know.
- No.

462
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,655
It is better that I go.

463
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,294
Can I what?

464
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,373
For Jack?
- No.

465
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,055
I can 't tell him. 's for me.

466
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,296
Yes. Take it.

467
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,092
Thank you.

468
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,332
You are welcome.

469
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,531
The next time
I make a whole meal.

470
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,259
I am right
on a decent kiss.

471
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,813
I started to make me worry about you.

472
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,972
I said you do not make fires.

473
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,172
It's okay. He is not.
He is on the other side of the island.

474
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,894
Have you spoken to him?
- Yes, I have him.

475
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,456
What did he say?
- He asked me if everything was okay.

476
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,730
Is that all?
- Yes.

477
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,216
Have you caught something?
- Yes.

478
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,097
Give me a cigarette?

479
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,331
There are there.
- What is that?

480
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,772
Fish.

481
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,210
What is that?
- What?

482
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,890
There. Similar to fish.

483
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,898
That's down from last time.
- The last time?

484
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,534
You think I'm going fishing
and I eat fish without you?

485
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,569
Many prisoners?
- Ignore him.

486
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,450
He gave him, huh?
- No.

487
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:54,739
Why did you fire then lit?
- To bake what you bring.

488
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,255
The yellow you can not eat.
They are poisonous.

489
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,890
Nobody asked your opinion.
- I try to be a good neighbor.

490
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,458
You lie to me?

491
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,215
You lie and he gives you food.

492
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,978
Okay, you want the truth, Jack?

493
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,414
I fish stolen from him.

494
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,578
I ate him and I
nothing left for you

495
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,008
because I knew
that you would respond.

496
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,336
You are going to restart again.

497
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,178
Manuel!
- Yes, Jack?

498
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,331
Did you know that my wife today
fish has stolen from you?

499
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,333
They do not need to steal.

500
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,338
If they want fish, I will give her.

501
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,809
Thank you.
- Sure.

502
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,493
Let us prepare what you have.

503
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,053
The yellow?

504
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,978
Why we will install our
what on the beach?

505
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,933
Away from the counter-flow,
on to the sand flies?

506
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,734
No, he should just leave.

507
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,217
We get rid of him. Damn.

508
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,768
Trap is not. Note.

509
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,455
You have to catch him at ...
- That I do not get inside.

510
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,896
's war. Come on, tough guy.

511
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,850
That I do not get inside.
- It Looks bad, but it's good.

512
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,135
I will open one.

513
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,293
Beautiful, is not it?

514
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,293
Let's see if there are.
- Okay.

515
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,380
Why faded you fire?
- That I did not.

516
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,016
The bastard.
- No, Jack. Jack!

517
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,137
It's just a fire.

518
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,289
Hey! It is our fire!

519
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,657
You've stolen our fire, motherfucker.
- It is me. You have no.

520
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,771
Then we stole your lighter.
- That was not necessary.

521
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,416
It flew a spark on the island
and landed here!

522
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,890
Here? Here?

523
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,969
Jack! It's just fire.

524
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,812
Wil je 't out, gringo?

525
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,017
Wil je 't out?
- Give me that knife.

526
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,414
No!
- This is war.

527
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,894
Give me klotemes.
- Back, Jenny.

528
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,778
He has begun.

529
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,129
Through him we are here.

530
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,815
You're crazy, man.
- It does not matter who it is fire.

531
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,893
Saturday below decks when you 'fire began.
He was there.

532
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,529
You think I put the boat on fire
here with you to finish?

533
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,455
That is unbelievable.
- With me? No. Not with me.

534
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,615
Am I right?

535
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,731
Do you see each other.

536
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,812
You stole our fire,
I take fish.

537
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,258
Go ahead, take him.

538
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,576
You know how stupid you look?

539
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,610
You'll remember the taste
when you no longer have tomorrow.

540
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,615
Look at me not so, Manuel.

541
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,617
Stop it.

542
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,329
I do not eat more.

543
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,091
I want your girlfriend not.

544
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,296
I would not be your friend.

545
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,569
Who took my glasses?

546
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,016
I killed him.
I killed him, damn it!

547
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,376
He is hungry.
We have hunger.

548
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,531
He has requested it.
- Do you not?

549
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,897
I give him along. Let go.

550
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,140
I killed him.
- I give you your glasses back. Leave that.

551
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,489
Let me go.

552
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,498
Let me straight.

553
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,418
He will find out.

554
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,850
I do not care.

555
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,010
I can not do.

556
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,138
Come live with me.

557
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,656
I can not.

558
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,658
Why?

559
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,535
Promise me nothing to say.

560
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,378
Promise me you will keep silent.

561
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,211
Say nothing to him.
- Okay.

562
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,338
I promise it you.

563
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,896
But not only women
are good at it.

564
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,210
He will look in your eyes
and he will 't know.

565
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,059
Why did you do it, if you knew?

566
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,053
Because I love you.

567
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,850
The wind enter them there.

568
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,935
Great.
- I got another one.

569
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,496
Suddenly came the shark
and scheurde him my harpoon.

570
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,295
't here are lots of sharks.
As in 'Jaws'.

571
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,970
The sharks were everywhere.

572
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,738
It was crazy.

573
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,737
I had the impression that I ...

574
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,489
It wound me up. I
soup with venus shells

575
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,294
and I go to the woods to ...

576
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,818
What?
- Nothing.

577
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,654
You did not remove his glasses.

578
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,931
He was furious. He wanted to murder you.

579
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,739
Well. Then he
how I felt.

580
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,973
We need him smoking

581
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,019
and store.
Do you see that handsome head ...

582
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,338
The man and the fish?

583
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,412
And what did he say?

584
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,450
I told you already, he was furious.

585
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,098
He looks calm from now.

586
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,893
What has he done?

587
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,093
Nothing.

588
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,775
What have you done?

589
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,977
I told him that he was a fool,
Like I said to you.

590
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,492
I believe you.

591
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,611
Then I ...

592
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:00,689
Tell me what happened here.
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

593
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,772
Did you gevrijd with him?

594
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,178
I can not believe I said that.

595
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,498
You gevrijd with him, right?

596
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,379
The worst scenario ...

597
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,252
My God.

598
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,577
And now?

599
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,979
Go ...

600
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:04,299
with them?
- No.

601
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,458
No?
You still love him

602
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:10,777
and me together.
Then you can 'borrow a cup of ...

603
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,169
What do you want?

604
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,819
I want you to stop!

605
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,815
Watch what you want.

606
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,573
You will get what you deserve.

607
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,135
I want you to stop.

608
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:27,173
Okay, done.

609
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,974
's recent ...

610
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,854
You have my heart broken. And ...

611
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:38,370
you guys are together worth. And ...

612
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,696
You're a big liar star.

613
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,889
And I want you ...

614
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,732
leave. I think everything
it said. Go!

615
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,698
Look what I got caught.

616
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,371
Let him go.

617
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,858
You do not need.

618
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,253
He is still not back.

619
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:55,050
Why do you do?

620
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,213
You can not even
out of your head?

621
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,973
Or pretend he is not there?

622
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,177
You are crazy.
- He is not.

623
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:08,575
Let's dance.

624
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,653
Dancing?
- Yes.

625
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,778
Since I do not want.
- Okay, there's nothing to do.

626
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,374
We ruzieën all the time.

627
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,053
Let's dance.
- There is no music.

628
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,613
Then we make music.

629
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,893
Come on.

630
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,098
What happens?

631
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,698
I do not know.

632
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,896
It's like he just found.

633
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,339
it looks like a boat.

634
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,409
You have the sloop.

635
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:14,968
Let me help you.
- Reverse.

636
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:21,972
Let me help you.

637
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,454
He tries to help you, Jack.

638
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,850
He has already helped.

639
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:29,058
We try to help you
the island to leave Jack.

640
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,818
Let the sea make for you.

641
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,619
I 'm good. Thank you.

642
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,658
So is Jack.

643
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:41,058
You never in your life
shared something with someone.

644
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,211
I still have you shared?

645
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,651
I was never yours.

646
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,729
Do you really
that you will get away?

647
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:37,328
This brings you to your end.

648
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,898
You do not know which way.
- North-northeast.

649
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:45,651
We are south-southwest.
I repair it and sail departure tomorrow.

650
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:50,735
So fast?
- Why? Not sure?

651
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,849
Everything is not as great as it seems?

652
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,819
Do not be cruel, Jack.
- Were you not cruel?

653
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,456
I did what I had
to survive.

654
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:04,329
Ok. Then you also have to fuck me
in order to get here.

655
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,375
Is that all?

656
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,818
That would be a good start, baby.
- What do you mean?

657
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,937
Wil you that we love?

658
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,569
Immediately. Yes. Here.

659
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,573
Yes? Walk to the moon, Jack.

660
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,455
You wouldn 't, even if you wanted.

661
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:26,173
You need a heart to forgive.
- What do you know about a heart?

662
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,850
He has been a rush to die.

663
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:43,531
He leaves tomorrow.
- Did he say?

664
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,098
You still talk to him.

665
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,973
Why not? It's a small island.

666
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,129
Wil you go swimming?

667
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,811
's Nachts' s beautiful.

668
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,376
And it is full Monday Great.

669
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,817
When you 're fishing, Manuel ...

670
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,615
... she said that the next boat
wanted to leave.

671
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,774
And that they would do anything for.
- Nice try, Jack.

672
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:19,336
Ignore him. He lies.

673
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,173
Wil you still go swimming?

674
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,693
Come. I want you to swim.

675
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,140
The latest in the water must boil.
- That will do.

676
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:51,329
I said to you. It's beautiful.

677
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,533
Come on.

678
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,773
Let's take the boat
and leave him here.

679
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,656
Wil you?
- I would not stay any longer.

680
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,856
But he is not of that boat.

681
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:47,735
We can catch him when he sleeps.

682
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,537
And when he wakes up?

683
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,616
Can you do nothing?

684
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,739
Yes it is.

685
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,092
Wake up. Wake up.

686
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,373
What is wrong?

687
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:26,772
He is gone, go fishing.

688
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,448
If you want to go away, this is the moment.

689
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,974
Are you sure?
- Yes.

690
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,609
I checked the boat this morning.
He is ready. There is even a sail.

691
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,134
Come on.

692
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,252
Take the coconut them.

693
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,132
Stay there and push.
- He is coming.

694
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,779
Push!

695
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,690
Fast!

696
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,371
's gonna be fine. it will succeed.

697
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:33,615
Step into. Step into.

698
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:09,497
He went rampage like a screwball.
- It's a screwball.

699
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,219
Do you think he 's only saves?

700
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:14,612
Can 't care what you?
Why do you still busy?

701
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,737
I do not.

702
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,091
How long does it take
before we are back?

703
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,934
Maybe two days.

704
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,697
My God.
- What is it?

705
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:47,090
He leaks.
- Display.

706
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:48,849
I loose it, all right?

707
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,695
Can you do it?

708
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,931
Oh.
- What?

709
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:56,171
He has tampered with the boat
so that we would sink.

710
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,654
He is trying to murder us.

711
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:01,818
From the road. Let me see.
- Are we all well?

712
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:04,700
a few miles.
We have to swim.

713
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,413
I would not go back.

714
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,656
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

715
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,493
't have lasted longer
than I thought.

716
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,050
You tried to murder us, Jack.

717
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,699
How could you?

718
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,533
Where is he?

719
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,689
I do not know.

720
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:51,534
We became lost in each other 's reef.

721
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,652
Jack, what are you doing?

722
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,852
Jack, stop it.

723
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,814
What are you planning?
- Say, buddy ...

724
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,449
Was it a nice swim?
Shut up.

725
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:09,895
Was it a nice swim?

726
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:12,454
Everything okay?

727
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,613
Was it pleasant?

728
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,612
Come on, boy.

729
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:36,738
You are a coward, Jack!

730
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:40,814
You covered him while
he has my whole day swimming.

731
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:43,415
Everything can and everything goes.

732
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,737
To love and keep ...

733
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:59,457
Respect and cherish ...

734
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:02,732
In good and bad days ...

735
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,256
Until death do us part.

736
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,938
Or something worse.

737
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:21,897
Are you familiar?

738
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:28,452
Amsterdam, 2001?

739
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,369
What did you not?

740
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:33,612
Not answers. a rhetorical question.

741
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,209
You know what I think?

742
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:40,415
Maybe you and I
for him to step up,

743
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,458
like you did for me.

744
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,409
Would not that be fun?

745
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:49,849
There are many possibilities.

746
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:55,498
Consider this as a concession.

747
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,570
Understand me well. There are 12 steps.

748
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:06,009
The first is ...
a few crazy things.

749
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,688
Beat it, Manuel!

750
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,897
Come on. I care for you.

751
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:34,290
We must make the weapons.
- What?

752
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,890
Did you already? You have a fever.
- It does not.

753
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,096
No, we should hide.

754
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:43,378
No, I do not want to hide.
I want to fight.

755
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,812
I must fight against him.

756
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,253
Walk!

757
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,969
Are you ready to die out of love?

758
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,858
I am ready.

759
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,774
There is no edeler goal.
- Hold on, Jack!

760
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,011
Sooner or later someone comes along.

761
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:51,012
You will be accountable
for your actions.

762
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:54,571
My action?
- He can not fight. He is sick.

763
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,492
You made him sick.

764
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:58,333
I will teach him.

765
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:11,018
Leave him alone.

766
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,173
Stop it, Jack.

767
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:39,174
Someone built a hut here.

768
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,578
We're sorry, madam.
We wanted to not interfere.

769
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:51,411
We did not know that anybody was.
Is it?

770
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:55,773
Yes. 't Is. I can not believe
you there.

771
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:59,211
How long have you been here?
- A year, maybe longer.

772
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,895
Do you know what
with Maritani happened?

773
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:03,778
No, but we can
the ship's use.

774
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:06,369
Come on. I bring you there.
- Okay.

775
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:18,690
How are you here?
- I swam and I swam and I swam ...

776
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,088
We have chocolate biscuits.
Would you?

777
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:47,332
Tell them that you let them.
- They're cute.

778
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:49,212
I thought you could use. 

779
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,530
I enjoy every moment. 

780
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:20,529
Wait!


781
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,815
Wait!
