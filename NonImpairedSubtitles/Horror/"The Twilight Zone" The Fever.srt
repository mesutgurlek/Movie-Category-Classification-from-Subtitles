until we get married.

Right. Why did we agree
to that again?

the wedding night special.

committed you are to all this.

Yes, you did.
And very sweetly, too.

once in a while, hmm?

OK. No sex for six months. OK.

I'll pass with flying colors.

Yeah, he's right here.

-Ben?
-Yes.

It's me. Cindy.

00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,276
Cindy. Cindy who?

173
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:58,245
Sensuous Cindy, silly.

174
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:00,614
I had such a great
time today with you...

175
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:03,350
and l--I can't stop
thinkin' about you.

I told you. It's me. Cindy.

of your voice again...

Well, no--
But-butterflies?

183
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:17,464
You're--you're
a computer program.

184
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:18,699
Who is it?

185
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,501
Oh, it's, uh, uh--
it's, uh, somebody...

186
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,903
uh, from work.
Nobody, uh, y-you know.

Uh, th-this can wait
until morning.

00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:26,773
We'll--we'll discuss it then.

189
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:29,243
Will you promise to come see me?
First thing?

Uh, yeah, sure. Fine.

Can't wait for you to hold me
in your arms again. It was so--

00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:34,948
Is everything all right?

193
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,783
What? Oh, uh, great. Yeah.

194
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:37,851
Uh, so-something came up.

Uh, no--nothing r-really.

196
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,555
It's--it's, uh, something,
but it's nothing.

197
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:43,546
Every--everything's
under, uh, control.

198
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:18,889
Must've been a glitch
of some sort.

Aah!

00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:28,936
Didn't you make a little promise
to me last night?

202
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,306
I'm confused. Is--is--
is--is this part of the program?

203
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:36,209
Look, all I know is I've never
felt like this before.

Uh, l--l--I don't know
what you're talking about.

I'm talking
about chemistry, silly.

You know,
that mysterious attraction...

No, no. You--you have to be
human to--to have pheromones.

00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,260
Well, I was human enough

Yeah. Um...

come visit you,
uh, a-after work?

00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:00,167
And afterwards will you
hold me for a while?

Well, y-yeah.

as it is.

00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,635
But not as guilty as I'd feel
if Sam ever finds out.

311

Sam's a software developer.

312

Cindy was pretty damn cool.

313
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:06,106
Don't you get it?

314
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:07,307
no sex until our wedding.

315

not with others, and not with...

In the office.

326
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:55,322
Hi.

327
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,090
-Tough day?
-Yeah.

328
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,259
Uh, I won't bore you
with the details.

329
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,061
Poor baby.
I know how you feel.

330
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,762
I'm having trouble
with my hard drive.

331
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:05,031
I can't access any of my files.

332
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,366
You want me to check it out?

333
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:08,501
Who's the computer expert here?

334
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,804
Well, a fresh set of eyes.

335
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:12,237
I'll open the wine.

336
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,774
Yeah...

337
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:16,503
Iet's see.

338
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,815
"Terminate her"?

339
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:24,818
Did I actually hear you say,
"Terminate her"?

340
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:27,787
No! You can't be here.
We got rid of you.

341
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:30,090
You tried, but I was hiding...

342
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,759
in the computer
in the office next door.

343
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,420
Having any luck?

344
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:36,930
Uh--oh, look...

345
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,666
no, the--the damn thing
it, uh, froze up on me.

346
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,768
Why don't we, uh,
pop some popcorn?

347
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,571
-We'll watch a movie.
-Wine and popcorn?

348
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:46,406
Yeah, let's stick a bag
in the microwave.

349
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,941
I'll--I'll see what's on.

350
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,535
Sometimes you can be so cute.

351
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:59,319
Why are you trying
to hurt me, Ben?

352
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,651
I love you.

353
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:04,891
I'll--I'll get it.

354
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:06,159
Yeah?

355
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:09,129
Maybe it's time Samantha and l
had a little talk.

356
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,964
No, no, no,
don't--don't do that.

357
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,932
I'll--I'll--
I'll come to the office.

358
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:14,534
Don't do anything
on my account.

359
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:16,603
No, I want to come see you.

360
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,304
We'll talk.

361
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:19,672
And once
we're done talking...

362
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,341
I'm a tiger, remember?

363
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:22,776
Grrrr.

364
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,611
-You are so cute.
-Yeah--

365
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:27,213
-Will you stay the night?
-Uh, uh, stay the night?

366
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:30,016
Yeah. Uh, sure.
Anything you want.

367
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:31,484
OK, but hurry.

368
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:32,781
No--I'm already out the door.

369
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:35,355
Ben?

370
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:36,956
I got some--
the office called.

371
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,958
There's a fire
I have to put out.

372
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,289
I gotta go.

373
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:50,737
Hi.

374
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:52,439
What took you so long?

375
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:55,608
Oh. What can I say?
Traffic was horrendous.

376
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,778
I was gonna stop
for flowers, but--

377
00:18:58,778 --> 00:18:59,946
Oh.

378
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:02,414
Uh, well, I hope,
uh, you like them.

379
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,441
They're beautiful.

380
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:26,106
What did you do to me?

381
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:28,675
Uh, well, that's--
oh, it's--it's a virus.

382
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,211
I--I stopped by,
uh, Garrett's.

383
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,379
He--he wrote it for me.

384
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:35,081
But why?

385
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:38,551
I'm sorry, Cindy,
but being with you...

386
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:41,179
made me realize how much
I really love Samantha.

387
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:44,424
That is so romantic.

388
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,726
You are so sweet.

389
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:49,388
Yeah, I guess, but--oh...

390
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,337
Cindy?

391
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,751
Hello?

392
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,586
Ben, are you OK?

393
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:15,255
Yeah, I'm OK.

394
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,890
Did you get the fire put out?

395
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,993
Yeah. Yeah, it looks that way.

396
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:21,294
I know it's late...

397
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:22,929
but could you stop by the store
on your way home?

398
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:23,963
Sure.

399
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:25,532
I e-mailed a list
of what we need.

400
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:27,267
The computer's working fine,
by the way.

401
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,802
Uh, great.
So, I'll see you soon?

402
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:31,437
No need to hurry.

403
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:34,440
No problem. Sam?

404
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,609
What?

405
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,178
I love you.

406
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:40,346
Me, too. Bye.

407
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:41,711
Bye.

408
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:58,531
Sorry I'm late.
I was dealing with my fiancé.

409
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:00,733
He's been acting
a little strange lately.

410
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:04,003
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear he was cheating on me.

411
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:06,306
Hmph. Men...

412
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,433
You can't trust them.

413
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:21,688
Benjamin Baker
narrowly escaped his fantasy...

414
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:25,458
while his fiancée
explores her own sensual nature.

415
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,360
A glimpse into the future
of modern romance...

416
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,795
for better or for worse...
