1
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:30,449
Come on, Louis. Come on.

2
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:09,237
They should make heroin
look like something else.

3
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,740
Candy bars, maybe.

4
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:15,744
You're gonna have to hurry, Louis.
l'm gonna miss my plane.

5
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:44,022
Be careful, Lisa.

6
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:45,983
You too, Louis.

7
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,161
Taxi!

8
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,664
Taxi!

9
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,930
Air Canada...

10
00:02:58,096 --> 00:03:04,311
...flight 7 60 dC-9 jetliner service...

11
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:08,440
...for New York's Kennedy
International Airport.

12
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:54,148
Hey, is this St. Luke's Place?

13
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:58,152
-You, number 98.
-Who, me?

14
00:05:58,318 --> 00:06:02,739
-Where's St. Luke's Place?
-l don't know nothing. l'm a dropout.

15
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:05,284
l asked you a question, kid.

16
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:09,746
-Yeah, this is it.
-Thanks.

17
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,711
Big man on campus.

18
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:18,422
What did she say?

19
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,966
l told you, she just left a message.

20
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,886
-But she asked for me?
-That's right.

21
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:28,515
-Happy days are here again, huh?
-Well, we'll see.

22
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:51,330
-You sure this is right?
-Read it yourself.

23
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't make waves.
l only asked a question.

24
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:19,149
Lisa?

25
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,902
-Lisa?
-What are you calling for?

26
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,530
She says she's not here.

27
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:10,135
-Lisa doesn't live here.
-Yeah, l know. lt's clean.

28
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,937
What's the matter?

29
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,190
Since when can Lisa type?

30
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:28,362
Since never. Come on.

31
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,739
You think the place is bugged?

32
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:58,183
-You want something?
-You, Mr. Talman.

33
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:05,399
And you too, Sgt. Carlino.
l want you too.

34
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:10,404
ln fact, l want both of you,
and l've come here to buy you.

35
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:14,908
Sgt. Carlino, if you'd
just shut that door, please.

36
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:17,161
Don't call me "sergeant."

37
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:19,371
Why? Are you a touchy man?

38
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:24,710
-Just don't call me "sergeant."
-No matter. Sit. Sit.

39
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,129
We'll have a little chat.

40
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:38,349
-We'll start with, who are you?
-l'm Harry Roat Jr. From Scarsdale.

41
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:40,726
Scarsdale?

42
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:45,773
Well, now, may we have
weapons on the table?

43
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,776
We'll have explanations first.

44
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:51,278
Well, this goes back a little.

45
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:54,406
-So go back a little.
-Alrighty.

46
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,077
Once upon a time...

47
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,788
...there was a fairy princess
named Lisa.

48
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:07,503
And she had two very good friends,
who shall remain nameless.

49
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,257
Now, these three were fond of performing
little dramas for select audiences.

50
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:16,553
Their most memorable performances
were that of outraged husband...

51
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,641
...and detective breaking in upon
guilty wife in the arms of her lover...

52
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,017
...or vice versa.

53
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:24,520
They were adaptable.

54
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:34,613
The detective, it's worth mentioning, was
particularly convincing in his performance...

55
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:39,618
...but then he had had the benefit
of previous on-the-job training.

56
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:45,124
-Man, you're a charmer.
-Thank you.

57
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,460
Things went trippingly
for our three heroes...

58
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:54,508
...until one day, a certain stockbroker,
a Charles F. Parker, wasn't it? Got nasty.

59
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:59,305
And then our poor heroes went to jail,
or two of them did.

60
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:03,309
Lisa, well....

61
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,894
Well, she....

62
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:07,771
She escaped.

63
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:09,315
What's the point?

64
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:12,151
Lisa would like to do something
for her two friends...

65
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,695
...now that they're back
in circulation again.

66
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:17,072
-What does she want?
-A doll...

67
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:20,326
...for which she will pay handsomely.

68
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:23,996
Now may we have weapons on the table?

69
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:28,667
-l'm clean.
-Scout's honor?

70
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:32,755
Lisa says you favor brass, sergeant.
That pocket looks a little lumpy.

71
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:40,221
l cannot negotiate in an atmosphere
of mistrust.

72
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:51,357
Why, you?

73
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,713
-And, you, what's your favorite toy?
-Geraldine.

74
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,677
What does she do?

75
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:25,849
-May we have Geraldine on the table too?
-No, we may not.

76
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:29,854
-Why the hell not?
-Because she's the referee.

77
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:36,026
Now, Lisa will pay you $2000 each
for a couple hours work.

78
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:37,736
lnterested?

79
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:42,867
What kind of work?

80
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,536
Finding Lisa's doll.

81
00:13:45,703 --> 00:13:48,163
-Are you serious?
-l am.

82
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:52,626
-What kind of doll?
-An ordinary doll, a child's doll.

83
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,256
What's in it?

84
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:04,513
-Do we hurt anybody?
-Not a fly.

85
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,933
-Do you care?
-No.

86
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:12,563
-What do you think?
-What's to think? He's a creep.

87
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,317
Yeah, baby. Not like us, huh?

88
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:19,612
We want an advance.

89
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:23,282
250. Each.

90
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:26,911
Lisa and l thought more like 500 each.

91
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:28,204
Why so generous?

92
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:32,458
So you don't ask what's in the doll.

93
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,295
So now we know what's in the doll.

94
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:39,548
Well, win one, lose one.

95
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,467
lt's all straight.

96
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,386
What do we do?

97
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:49,350
What you always do, Mr. Talman,
lie and cheat and play-act.

98
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,606
-Go on.
-Lisa gave the doll to a man named Hendrix.

99
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:58,317
She met him on the plane from Montreal.

100
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:00,152
Lisa's friendly.

101
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:01,320
Why?

102
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,989
Somebody waiting for her,
she hadn't expected...

103
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:06,659
...so Hendrix brought it home here.

104
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,327
Hendrix? Who's he?

105
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:11,539
He's...nobody.

106
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:15,668
Mr. Clean. A photographer.

107
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:19,922
Looks like he has a wife. Where's she?

108
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:22,716
Out.

109
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:25,052
She goes to school.

110
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:27,847
Come on. This is a hell of a place
to be talking.

111
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:30,307
Don't panic, sergeant.

112
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:34,520
-Why not?
-Because it's arranged. lt's all arranged.

113
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,355
By you?

114
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,360
Photographer Hendrix is in his studio
waiting to photograph a certain Miss Lejiana.

115
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,280
But a little while ago,
her male secretary phoned...

116
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:47,450
...very efficient, very humble,
grovelingly polite...

117
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:49,618
...to say that she had been delayed.

118
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:54,248
-He's terrific.
-Last night, Lisa called up about the doll...

119
00:15:54,415 --> 00:15:56,625
...but Mr. Hendrix couldn't find it.

120
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:59,545
He looked all over for it,
but he couldn't find it.

121
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:02,173
Doesn't that strike you odd?

122
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:06,218
lt strikes me odd too, Mr. Talman.

123
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:10,890
-Was he lying?
-l don't know, but we're gonna find out.

124
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:14,268
Now, look around.
Familiarize yourself with the place.

125
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,729
We're coming back here tomorrow.

126
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:22,568
And the doll is here, you're sure?

127
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:26,697
Lisa and l checked earlier.
We didn't see it. lt's here, though.

128
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:29,867
Did you look in here?

129
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:36,916
Well, anyway, we don't work safes.

130
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,920
l know, but you talk, and that's why
you've been invited to this party...

131
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,256
...to talk your way into that big,
black safe, sergeant.

132
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:50,930
-There's a locked closet in the bedroom.
-Not there. Just clothes.

133
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:53,099
-How do you know?
-l looked.

134
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:56,227
-You got the key?
-lt's on the ledge above the door.

135
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:58,145
No, it isn't.

136
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,314
They must have taken it with them.

137
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:05,361
Lock the closet when they
don't bolt the front door?

138
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,282
They're strange people.
They lose dolls.

139
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:14,412
l think you just made a mistake.

140
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,958
l'd like the key.

141
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:20,960
Well, if you--

142
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:25,631
All right, fat man, over there.
Both of you through the door, backwards.

143
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,995
lf you'd only said please.

144
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:13,346
And now l'd like the key.

145
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:16,891
Please?

146
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:15,574
Go look.

147
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,586
Well, she was trespassing, Mike...

148
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:28,754
...poaching...

149
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,048
...going into business for herself.

150
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:32,967
Bad news.

151
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:35,428
Things like that go on,
what do you have?

152
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:36,846
Anarchy.

153
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:40,850
No discipline, no sense of order.
Bad news.

154
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,187
Out!

155
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:52,987
-Haven't you forgotten something?
-We just earned the money.

156
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:55,072
l mean fingerprints.

157
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:01,203
You just signed your names
all over this place.

158
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:11,714
Even if you could remember, it'd
still take you hours to wipe them up.

159
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:14,050
lf not days.

160
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,302
As for me...

161
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:20,681
...well, l've only touched one thing
since l've been in here.

162
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:25,144
And now it's clean...

163
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:31,400
...like me. No police record,
no known associations with Lisa.

164
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,527
Nothing, in fact.

165
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:36,614
l could let you go and what would happen?
l'd evaporate.

166
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:38,950
But you? Bad news.

167
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:40,910
Don't forget this, sarge.

168
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:43,371
And the icebox, don't forget the icebox.

169
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:45,331
Carlino, knock it off!

170
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,419
We can prove where we were
when this happened.

171
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:53,756
Oh, and when did it happen?

172
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:56,509
-Just before you let me in?
-So?

173
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,222
So if you do exactly what l tell you...

174
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:05,351
...there will be no police,
there will be no problems.

175
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,602
Go on.

176
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:09,730
First, get her out of here.
Roll her up in this.

177
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:12,233
l got a van by the corner.
l'll bring it out front.

178
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,568
Why not the back, where
there's less publicity?

179
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:16,070
There's no back door.

180
00:21:16,237 --> 00:21:19,615
We'll dump her where l found this.
Give me a hand.

181
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:21,909
-She'll be found.
-l hope so.

182
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:24,620
All she's got on her is a hotel key.
When they check...

183
00:21:24,787 --> 00:21:27,540
...they'll see she's Mrs. Harry Roat Jr.

184
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:30,167
-From Scarsdale.
-Right.

185
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,671
This changes things a little, you know?

186
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:36,090
That's what l figured.
We'll talk about it later.

187
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:38,217
No, we'll talk about it now.

188
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:43,222
lt was 2000 each. Now it's 4.

189
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:55,401
Get behind the door, and, you, back there.

190
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:00,031
Stay dead still.
She's alone. Don't breathe.

191
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,586
Sam?

192
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:17,506
Sam, are you here?

193
00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:24,931
No, Susy, l'm not here.

194
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:05,346
Gloria?

195
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:34,667
-Hendrix here.
-Hendrix here too.

196
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:39,547
l called to tell you l was the best
in blind school today.

197
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:43,092
-That's my girl.
-l really truly was, cross my heart.

198
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,302
And I believe you.

199
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:46,929
So can l tap my way over to your studio?

200
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,598
Not now.

201
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:53,144
Some female with the unlikely name
of Lejiana is due any minute for a sitting.

202
00:23:54,604 --> 00:23:56,397
Well, l'll wait for you here, then.

203
00:23:56,564 --> 00:24:00,359
Look, I'll tell you what. Since
this Lejiana character is already late...

204
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,528
...I'll just stick around
a few more minutes.

205
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:06,782
So can l come over and wait for you
in the coffee shop downstairs?

206
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,451
Sure.

207
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:13,080
Won't be hard to find me.
l'll be the one reading Peter Rabbit in Braille.

208
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:15,666
-Bye.
-Bye.

209
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:27,136
Damn it. You're supposed to be there.

210
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:21,399
Gloria, l know you're there.

211
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:47,008
Mr. Hendrix won't wait forever.
Shall we go to work, children?

212
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:50,011
Two plus two, 4000.

213
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:52,638
Two plus two, Mr. Talman.

214
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:04,984
Highly recommended.
Disposable, you buy them in enormous rolls...

215
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:07,153
...from Hammacher Schlemmer.

216
00:26:07,987 --> 00:26:09,447
Spread out the rug.

217
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:18,998
Trouble.

218
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,210
Trouble.

219
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:33,137
-Hi, Susy. Hey.
-Hi, Shatner.

220
00:26:33,304 --> 00:26:35,306
Let me help you with that mess.

221
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:40,561
Oh, you're a lovely cavalier,
only don't tell Sam you helped me.

222
00:26:40,728 --> 00:26:43,815
l'm supposed to be learning
total self-sufficiency.

223
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:46,359
Why don't you come down
for a drink tonight?

224
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:51,322
l can't. l'm off to Vermont for
a couple of days of chasing stretch pants.

225
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:57,495
By the way, l haven't been able
to get in touch with our slumlord all day.

226
00:26:57,912 --> 00:26:59,914
And my skylight's still broken.

227
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:02,792
-lf you see him--
-We never see him.

228
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:06,546
He's owed us a new refrigerator since we
moved in, so he doesn't come around.

229
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:11,843
Don't let it get you down.
Have a good weekend.

230
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:15,263
On Monday, we'll form a tenants committee
or something jazzy like that.

231
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:19,559
Some committee. Me, you, Sam,
Gloria and her mother.

232
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,227
Oh, well.

233
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:23,646
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

234
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:50,048
-Susy?
-No, Batman.

235
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,302
-Safe to open the door?
-All right.

236
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:01,601
-You want to give me a hand, darling?
-Sure.

237
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:05,730
Who are you doing?

238
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:08,232
Gloria.

239
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:12,028
She's been after me for weeks
to take some pictures.

240
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:16,449
l promised l'd have these done.
l've got to go to Asbury Park--

241
00:28:16,616 --> 00:28:20,036
-Asbury Park? l thought you--
-Sorry, l only found out this second.

242
00:28:20,203 --> 00:28:23,748
That's all right. l was just
planning something silly.

243
00:28:23,956 --> 00:28:26,501
-Will it hold till tomorrow?
-Sure.

244
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:30,088
Someone called from the chemical company.
They saw my Sunday Times spread.

245
00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:33,132
They want me to make their new factory
look like the U.N.

246
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,426
Another night shot.

247
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:37,970
They're paying handsomely.
That's the last one.

248
00:28:38,137 --> 00:28:40,390
-Can l go with you?
-Sure, but l'll--

249
00:28:40,556 --> 00:28:43,935
Be home much quicker if you don't.

250
00:28:44,352 --> 00:28:46,980
You know there was a murder
around here last night?

251
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:48,731
They found the body this morning.

252
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:51,526
A lady from Scarsdale.
l heard it on the radio.

253
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:52,777
So?

254
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:56,239
What if l get chopped up in little pieces
and dumped in the river?

255
00:28:56,406 --> 00:28:58,866
Little tiny pieces that nobody
could ever recognize...

256
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:01,452
...as having been a poor,
defenseless, blind lady...

257
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:03,955
...whose husband was off in Asbury Park.

258
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:06,582
-You're not listening, Sammy.
-Sure l am.

259
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:09,127
Why don't we have some light
around here?

260
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:11,337
They're always finding bodies in New York.

261
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:15,091
Not in the parking lot
practically next door, they don't.

262
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:20,138
-You're making it up, Susy.
-No, l'm not. l promise.

263
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:23,308
l told you l heard it on the radio.
Really, l did.

264
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:25,351
Come on, Susy.

265
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:33,568
The police don't have
the first notion who did it.

266
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:37,530
Pretty spooky, don't you think, Sammy?

267
00:29:37,697 --> 00:29:39,198
Tell you what l think.

268
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:42,410
l think it's a ploy to make me stay home.

269
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:45,747
Well, there was a murdered woman
found from Scarsdale...

270
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:48,499
...and that's a true fact.

271
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:51,711
And you're afraid for your life,
that's a true fact?

272
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:55,590
No, but it was worth a try.

273
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:14,150
Fourteen.

274
00:30:16,402 --> 00:30:18,529
-You sure he'll go?
-Yeah.

275
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:22,533
-He'd better hurry or he'll miss the bus.
-He's got time.

276
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:27,413
This is some day for a schlep
out to Asbury Park.

277
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:39,175
-When does your bus leave?
-Five.

278
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:41,386
Time for another cup of coffee?

279
00:30:42,762 --> 00:30:44,347
Maybe half a cup.

280
00:30:44,514 --> 00:30:48,309
lf that doll woman calls,
tell her l haven't found it yet.

281
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:51,896
Let Gloria look around for it while she's
down here. lt must be somewhere.

282
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:55,024
l don't want Gloria today.

283
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:57,235
l don't need her.

284
00:30:57,402 --> 00:31:01,072
-Yes, you do, for your shopping.
-No Gloria!

285
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:06,578
-Give me a hint?
-You can find it by yourself.

286
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:08,538
lf you couldn't, l'd tell you.

287
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:11,457
-What have you got against Gloria?
-A lot.

288
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:14,752
The problem is, she's in love with you,
which makes me the villain.

289
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:19,591
Susy, she's a kid.
More to your left, in front of you.

290
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:21,759
l'd rather have a dog.

291
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:23,553
Dogs can't shop at the supermarket.

292
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,556
They can't rearrange the furniture either
so l trip over it.

293
00:31:26,723 --> 00:31:30,143
That's her latest hobby.
l nearly broke my leg last night.

294
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,063
She's been sneaking cigarettes too.
l smelled smoke when l came in yesterday.

295
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,107
Susy, give her a chance.

296
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:40,987
Her father's run off again. Her mother's
flitted out for a weekend uptown.

297
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:44,073
Poor old Gloria gets slammed around
like a Ping-Pong ball.

298
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,075
On top of that, she's wearing glasses.

299
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:47,994
Kids are giving her the treatment...

300
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:51,039
...calling her the "monster from outer space."

301
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:54,083
lcebox needs defrosting, darling,
only my way this time.

302
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,587
lt's more practical.
Use plenty of boiling water.

303
00:31:57,754 --> 00:32:00,256
-What if l burn both my hands off your way?
-Don't.

304
00:32:00,423 --> 00:32:02,342
The Unguentine's in the emergency drawer.

305
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:05,136
lf the weather's okay, try walking
to the studio and back.

306
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:06,387
No cheating.

307
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:09,015
Do l have to be the world's
champion blind lady?

308
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:10,475
Yes!

309
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,864
Then, l will be.

310
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:29,035
l'll be whatever
you want me to be.

311
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:33,081
Tell me what you want,
and that's what l'll be.

312
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:36,125
-Susy--
-l mean it.

313
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:38,920
l don't want you ever
to be anything but Susy...

314
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,839
...because that's the way l love you.

315
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:43,049
Do you? Do you?

316
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:45,552
What do you think?

317
00:32:55,353 --> 00:32:58,439
-Do you want me to stay home?
-Yes.

318
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:02,527
But you can go to work anyway.

319
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:03,695
l'll clean up here...

320
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:08,032
...then when you get back,
l'll be all scrubbed and polished.

321
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,285
You sure it's okay?

322
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:12,579
Then, l got to rush.

323
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:16,332
Where does the icebox plug in?

324
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:19,752
You'll find it.
No fair asking Gloria either.

325
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,462
Sam.

326
00:33:21,796 --> 00:33:24,257
Are you looking at me?

327
00:33:26,468 --> 00:33:28,720
-Bye, dope.
-Bye, dope.

328
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:47,489
Thanks for everything.

329
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:06,758
Okay, Mr. Talman,
it's time for your soft-shoe.

330
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:12,305
And remember, there's a nice, little, pink kid
running around the house.

331
00:34:12,472 --> 00:34:15,141
And she wears glasses.

332
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:48,133
Sam.

333
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:49,592
Gloria!

334
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:52,053
Somebody!

335
00:34:59,018 --> 00:35:00,145
Operator.

336
00:35:00,353 --> 00:35:01,813
-Please....
-Fire department.

337
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,732
There's something burning.
l'm blind, and l can't locate it.

338
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:07,193
-lt's getting worse!
-Can I have your address?

339
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,154
27B--

340
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,448
Wait, l think somebody's here.
Come in!

341
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,701
The door's open.

342
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:17,495
-You all right?
-There's a fire. Can you see it?

343
00:35:17,704 --> 00:35:20,749
-l'm blind, and l don't know where it is.
-Oh, yes, l've got it.

344
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,460
-Careful.
-l'm all right. Please find the fire.

345
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:26,004
lt's in the ashtray.

346
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:30,133
lt's only a cigarette butt.

347
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:33,261
A filter and a bit of paper
making all the smoke.

348
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:36,056
Where was it?

349
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:39,392
lt was on the--

350
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,146
What is this, a safe?

351
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:46,357
Against the wall? Yes.

352
00:35:46,566 --> 00:35:48,735
l couldn't tell where it was coming from.

353
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:50,278
Smoke--

354
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:53,907
Smoke isn't my favorite thing.

355
00:35:54,574 --> 00:35:57,368
-l don't know you, do l?
-No, Mrs. Hendrix.

356
00:35:57,535 --> 00:36:01,122
My name's Mike Talman.
l used to know Sam.

357
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:06,920
l can't thank you enough
for being here.

358
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,382
And l'm sorry that Sam isn't here.

359
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,550
He won't be back until later tonight.

360
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:14,719
That was stupid of me.
l should've phoned...

361
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:18,181
...but l thought l'd take a chance
and maybe grab Sam for a quick beer.

362
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:21,393
Wait. Let me give you a hand with that.

363
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:24,646
-You got it.
-Thank you.

364
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:30,694
l haven't seen Sam for years,
but some people you don't forget.

365
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,987
Oh, Sam you don't forget.

366
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:34,572
l don't anyway.

367
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,449
He saved my life.

368
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:38,576
How do you mean that?

369
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:42,288
-l mean, he saved my life.
-That makes two of us.

370
00:36:42,455 --> 00:36:44,332
That makes two of us, Mrs. Hendrix.

371
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:46,418
Susy.

372
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:47,919
Susy.

373
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:49,379
Thank you.

374
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:52,090
You mean in the Army or something?

375
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:55,677
ln the Marines, yes.
The 3rd Battalion.

376
00:36:57,303 --> 00:36:58,638
-Charlie Company.
-Right.

377
00:36:58,805 --> 00:37:01,933
-Has he ever told you about that?
-No. Tell me.

378
00:37:02,142 --> 00:37:03,768
No, you ask Sam.

379
00:37:03,977 --> 00:37:05,770
Oh, please. He won't tell me.

380
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:08,857
You'd better ask Sam.
He likes to do things his own way.

381
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:11,526
-You're just as mean as he is.
-That's us.

382
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:15,071
-Mean Mike and Mean Sam.
-Well, you are.

383
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:17,157
Would you like a drink, Mike Talman?

384
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:19,743
No. No, thank you.

385
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:23,079
Are these Sam's, these pictures?

386
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:26,416
-Yes.
-Yeah, l thought so.

387
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:29,127
Hey, here's one of me.

388
00:37:31,504 --> 00:37:34,841
l sure have put on a few pounds
since those days.

389
00:37:35,592 --> 00:37:38,386
Tell me something,
did you know Sam then?

390
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:42,474
No, we only met a year ago,
not long after my accident.

391
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:45,018
You--?

392
00:37:45,185 --> 00:37:47,395
You lost your sight in an accident?

393
00:37:47,562 --> 00:37:51,566
Yes, in a car crash
or really the fire from the crash.

394
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,986
One day, l was practicing
crossing at the lights...

395
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:59,074
...and the cars were piling up
around me like mad, and...

396
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,035
...suddenly, a man named Sam
grabbed me.

397
00:38:02,202 --> 00:38:04,204
And that was that.

398
00:38:06,122 --> 00:38:08,124
Gloria?

399
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:11,086
-Who's that?
-A little girl.

400
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:13,880
Come in, Gloria.

401
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:22,514
She went out.

402
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:28,061
Well, l'm sorry to have missed Sam,
but l'm happy to have met you.

403
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:31,398
You're very lovely.
Sam's lucky.

404
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:32,691
So's Susy.

405
00:38:34,317 --> 00:38:35,944
Goodbye.

406
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:39,781
Please tell Sam that l stopped by.

407
00:38:39,948 --> 00:38:43,201
Next time l come in from Phoenix,
l'll drop a line first.

408
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:45,745
Thank you forever and ever for--

409
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:48,039
Oh, Lord! Hello? Are you still there?

410
00:38:48,248 --> 00:38:49,708
I have to have your address.

411
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:53,128
Listen, l can't tell you how sorry l am
to have kept you.

412
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:55,797
You're wonderfully good
to have stuck around.

413
00:38:55,964 --> 00:38:58,675
-did you find the fire?
-Yes, it's out.

414
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:01,136
-lt was just a cigarette.
-Okay, then, ma'am?

415
00:39:01,303 --> 00:39:02,846
Yes, thank you.
Everything is now.

416
00:39:03,596 --> 00:39:05,682
Goodbye.

417
00:39:06,182 --> 00:39:07,601
How awful.

418
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:11,229
Mike?

419
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:12,772
Who's Mike?

420
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:14,858
Hello, Gloria.

421
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:19,904
-Who was that man?
-Friend of Sam's from the Marines.

422
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:22,449
You wouldn't know him, dear.

423
00:39:22,616 --> 00:39:24,200
Oh, l see.

424
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:27,370
ls the grocery list ready?
The supermarket closes soon.

425
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:31,291
lt's on the typewriter with the $5.
Can you see it?

426
00:39:34,044 --> 00:39:35,629
Oh, and, Gloria?

427
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:38,548
When you come back,
give me a hand with the icebox.

428
00:39:38,715 --> 00:39:41,635
l've got to defrost it while Sam's away.

429
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:52,312
-What did you do then?
-Switched it to defrost, of course.

430
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,564
-That's not how it's done.
-lt is too.

431
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:56,816
l've done it for Mother
hundreds of times.

432
00:39:56,983 --> 00:39:59,611
Your mother's refrigerator is modern.
This one's ancient.

433
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:01,404
We've got to do it Sam's way. We--

434
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:05,283
Okay, do it Sam's way, then.
l'll go to the A&P.

435
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:07,744
Did you close the door?

436
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:10,538
Yes.

437
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:14,292
-l didn't hear it shut.
-Okay, so it's open.

438
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:18,421
-Please shut the door.
-Close it yourself. You're nearer.

439
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,384
Gloria, close the door.

440
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,682
-No!
-Gloria!

441
00:40:28,848 --> 00:40:29,891
No, l won't!

442
00:40:30,058 --> 00:40:33,061
Listen, little monster,
l won't put up with this one more minute!

443
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:37,274
What's that?

444
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:40,652
What are you doing?
Stop it!

445
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,072
Stop it! Gloria, do you hear me?
Stop it!

446
00:40:45,282 --> 00:40:47,409
Stop it!

447
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:34,539
You shouldn't have called me names.

448
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:37,417
l don't call you names.

449
00:41:40,003 --> 00:41:42,797
l shouldn't say things like that.
lt was wrong of me.

450
00:41:43,924 --> 00:41:46,301
-lt's okay.
-No, it isn't okay.

451
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:48,470
People shouldn't say that
to each other.

452
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:52,015
They're mean things,
and people shouldn't say mean things.

453
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:55,393
Guess l get terribly frightened sometimes.

454
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:59,981
l'm not a very good blind lady, Gloria,
and l'm still not used to all this...

455
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:01,608
...dark brown.

456
00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:05,612
l get cranky and impatient and....

457
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:09,950
-l know l look dreadful half the time.
-Oh, no. You're gorgeous.

458
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:16,790
What a lovely thing to say.

459
00:42:16,957 --> 00:42:19,209
Thank you, Gloria.

460
00:42:21,002 --> 00:42:25,966
But l do wish l could do things.
You know, important things like...

461
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:29,135
...cook a soufflé or pick a necktie...

462
00:42:29,302 --> 00:42:32,430
...or choose the wallpaper for the bedroom,
you know?

463
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,641
Sure. l know.

464
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:39,354
l want to be gorgeous.
Guess you can't have everything, huh?

465
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:42,065
l guess not.

466
00:42:46,236 --> 00:42:49,739
l'm sorry, Susy, for being horrid.

467
00:42:49,906 --> 00:42:52,826
And me for being an old crank.

468
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:58,206
-We break anything?
-Oh, no. l only threw unbreakables.

469
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,877
-That was crafty of you.
-l learned it from Daddy.

470
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:08,508
Okay, pumpkin, let's clean all this up,
and you can hop off to the supermarket.

471
00:43:09,843 --> 00:43:12,262
Look out!
There's a knife there.

472
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:17,642
Thanks.

473
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:21,146
Run along. l'll put this away
so l know where to find it.

474
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:24,191
-Right. See you later.
-Okay.

475
00:43:27,736 --> 00:43:28,737
Bye.

476
00:43:32,824 --> 00:43:36,161
l should very much like to speak
with Mr. Sam Hunt, little girl.

477
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:38,872
Who's he?
Well, he doesn't live here.

478
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,167
-Leave, little girl.
-Susy!

479
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:46,213
-Susy!
-Leave, little girl. Go about your business.

480
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:51,718
-Gloria, what is it?
-l should like to see Mr. Sam Hunt...

481
00:43:51,885 --> 00:43:55,430
...and tell Mrs. Roat that l should
also like to see her. Where are they?

482
00:43:55,597 --> 00:43:58,934
-Who are you?
-lt's not right, you know, and it's not fair!

483
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:01,186
-Well, tell me what you--
-ln there!

484
00:44:01,353 --> 00:44:03,772
What is it you want?
What are you doing?

485
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:05,982
You can't go in there.

486
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:09,986
Tell me who you are.

487
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:17,828
Here! l was right, you silly thing,
and now l've got the proof.

488
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:21,248
You tell Sam Hunt to leave her alone
or l'll fix him!

489
00:44:21,415 --> 00:44:24,543
-Please--
-Good and proper!

490
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:32,926
Oh, yes, yes.

491
00:44:33,343 --> 00:44:35,929
Don't touch me.

492
00:44:45,272 --> 00:44:48,316
Susy, it's Mike Talman again.
l think l left a package.

493
00:44:48,483 --> 00:44:49,901
Mike!

494
00:44:50,068 --> 00:44:51,737
-Susy, what's wrong?
-Mike.

495
00:44:51,903 --> 00:44:54,239
There was a man here.
He flew in like a black crow.

496
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:56,074
He's gone now. lt's all right.

497
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:58,618
-l'm scared.
-l'm here now. lt's all right.

498
00:44:58,785 --> 00:45:00,120
You must be so bored with me.

499
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,622
Every time you come,
l'm in absolute panic.

500
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:05,125
No, no, no.

501
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:08,837
Bedroom's a mess.
He's dumped stuff all over the place.

502
00:45:09,004 --> 00:45:12,215
l better call the police.
He might have stolen something.

503
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:15,969
Do you know the number?

504
00:45:16,136 --> 00:45:18,805
279...

505
00:45:18,972 --> 00:45:21,058
...0099.

506
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:23,769
That's the emergency number anyway.

507
00:45:24,311 --> 00:45:26,521
That's good enough.

508
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:31,401
279...

509
00:45:32,736 --> 00:45:33,862
...0...

510
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:36,448
-0.
-...0...

511
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:38,200
...9...

512
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:41,370
...9.

513
00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:48,210
Don't worry.
l'll take a later flight to Phoenix...

514
00:45:48,377 --> 00:45:50,629
-...and stay as long as you need me.
-Could you?

515
00:45:50,837 --> 00:45:52,631
Of course.

516
00:45:53,465 --> 00:45:55,467
Hello?

517
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:57,052
Police?

518
00:45:58,011 --> 00:46:00,347
And the guy just busted in?
That right?

519
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:03,016
Yes, he was at the door
when the little girl went out.

520
00:46:03,183 --> 00:46:05,143
Gloria from upstairs.

521
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,104
Yeah, l got that down.

522
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,816
-Then he pulled out the drawers.
-Sergeant, obviously the man's crazy.

523
00:46:10,982 --> 00:46:13,485
Why don't you send a report
and have him picked up?

524
00:46:13,652 --> 00:46:17,114
Just tell me the facts.
l'll decide what to do, if you don't mind.

525
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,824
Well, l do mind.

526
00:46:19,032 --> 00:46:23,161
-You act as if nothing happened.
-We'd better let the sergeant do it his way.

527
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,956
Thank you, lady.

528
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,807
The important thing is, this guy
didn't steal anything, right?

529
00:46:43,974 --> 00:46:45,017
No.

530
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:48,812
No, not as far as we know.

531
00:46:49,146 --> 00:46:51,523
l think l'll help myself
to that drink now.

532
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,025
Sure.
