1
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,742
Is it recording?

2
00:00:33,848 --> 00:00:34,775
Yeah.

3
00:00:34,872 --> 00:00:36,497
All right.

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,251
All right.
Can we clear this area, please?

5
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,157
See that?

6
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:44,401
I talk, people listen.

7
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,364
Hi, babe.

8
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,318
- Hi, babe.
- How are you?

9
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,528
I'm good.
How are you?

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,386
I'm good.
You having fun?

11
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:51,894
Yeah. Are you having fun?

12
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,846
- You look mighty tan.
- Hey!

13
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:56,626
Oh, my God!

14
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:57,675
Do it again.

15
00:00:57,782 --> 00:00:58,643
Do it again. Ready?

16
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:00,466
Hold on.

17
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:04,271
Hey, dude.

18
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:05,935
- Zachy poo.
- What's up, baby?

19
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:08,405
Hi, Zachy poo.

20
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,738
I see.

21
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,212
You want to get in on this, Lauren?

22
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,165
Come here. Come on.

23
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:15,210
Who loves you, baby?

24
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:16,179
You do.

25
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:17,423
Of course.

26
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:18,639
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.

27
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:21,261
Shut up.

28
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:22,740
Are you a little jealous, Zach?

29
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:24,015
A little jealous?

30
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,939
I thought your girl was throwing me
some rhythm there.

31
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,346
What do you mean "my girl"?

32
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:28,557
Yeah, what do you mean "his girl"?

33
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:30,003
Come on, you two.

34
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:31,181
I ain't nobody's girl.

35
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:32,300
Enough with the charade.

36
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:34,445
All right.
Why are you still here?

37
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,175
Because nobody's following me.

38
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:37,170
Where are we, by the way?

39
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:38,130
Does anybody know?

40
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,855
El Matador, homey.

41
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:41,135
El Matador.

42
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,611
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

43
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,170
You guys are my best friends.

44
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:45,487
No shit.

45
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:46,668
Okay.

46
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,634
Hi, guys.

47
00:01:49,588 --> 00:01:51,115
I'm totally gonna puke.

48
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:53,009
Guys, do you think...
Guys, do you think

49
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:54,995
we're gonna know
each other forever?

50
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:56,368
- Nah!
- Shut up.

51
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:57,777
I fucking hope not.

52
00:01:57,876 --> 00:02:00,265
Let's create some memories.

53
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:01,899
Come on.

54
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:04,207
Nice, Zach.

55
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:07,472
I can't drink, man.
I gotta do this to get high.

56
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,611
Oh, be careful.
Come on.

57
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:11,090
Hey!

58
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:16,203
Holy shit.

59
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,450
Pretty fucking funny, Zach.

60
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:24,489
- Give me the camera.
- My fucking arm.

61
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:32,753
Hey, man.
You all right?

62
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:36,301
Do I look all right?

63
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,244
He's over me.

64
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:04,360
Oh, that I don't believe.

65
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:05,326
Whatever.

66
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:06,919
No way any man could ever
get over you.

67
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,934
- Because I'm great in bed, right?
- Funny. Boy.

68
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,407
Wow. When's the last time
you saw these guys?

69
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:13,032
5 years.

70
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,340
If you don't behave...
Oh, boy.

Amy!

00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,087
- Hey!
- Wow!

98
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:58,699
What you got there?
Hi.

99
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,121
Wow. You have a family.

100
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,042
- Wow.
- Can you take her for a sec?

101
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,220
Okay.

102
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:08,520
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

103
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,864
You and Zach came together.

104
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,393
He just picked me up
at the bus station.

105
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,834
<i>My butt's still dizzy. Whoa!</i>

106
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,233
There you go.
Back to mom.

107
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:18,154
Wow, she's heavy.
Cute kid.

108
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,746
Thank you.

109
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,273
And where's the birthday boy?

110
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:24,070
Hey, mom.

111
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:25,415
Wow.

112
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:26,824
Hi. Who's this?

113
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:28,035
This is Sarah.

114
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,993
Hi.

115
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:31,618
I'm uncle Zach.

116
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:32,835
Yes. Oh!

117
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,499
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

118
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:35,911
So good to see you.

119
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,025
I'll second that.

120
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,592
James. Heard a lot about you.

121
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:40,422
Likewise.

122
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:42,246
Okay, let's go see this thing, huh?

123
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:43,459
Yeah.

124

<i>Which one's the Godspeed?</i>

125
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:46,629
I don't think it will be hard to spot.

126
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,868
Go on.

127
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,897
It's okay.

128
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:51,271
I promise.

129
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:19,421
Marco.

130
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,528
Polo.

131
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,811
Marco!

132
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:26,301
You're always cheating.

133
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:27,837
I'm only cheating if you lose.

134
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:38,180
Yo, dickhead.

135
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,716
Come on, Amy.
You can do it.

136
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:57,892
I'm right here, honey.

137
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:05,148
There you go.

138
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:08,069
Easy as pie. See?

139
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,693
Danny always said he'd be
a millionaire by 30.

140
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:10,846
Even back in high school.

141
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,511
You said the same thing.

142
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:13,475
Yeah, but I was kidding.

143
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:14,784
Let's give ourselves the tour.

144
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:16,511
Where the hell is he?

145
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:17,956
I don't know about you guys,

146
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,062
but I gotta pee.

147
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:22,751
Watch your step, babe.

148
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:24,829
Hey, Lauren, I think I found...

149
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:26,178
I guess not.

150
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,754
Classic Dan.

151
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:32,097
He's having breakfast.

152
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,791
Well, it's about time.

153
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:35,748
Who's next?

154
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,399
This little vixen is Michelle.

155
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,483
Say hi.

156
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,313
It's nice to meet you guys!

157
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:44,608
See you in, like, two minutes.

158
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,691
That's all it takes.

159
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:47,650
Happy birthday.

160
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:48,676
- Thank you.
- Great.

161
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:50,115
Our daughter is scarred for life.

162
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:51,642
She'll either grow up
to be oddly attracted

163
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:52,764
to Popeye or a lesbian.

164
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,298
Yo. Where's my gift?

165
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:55,931
My presence is your present.

166
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:57,182
Awesome.

167
00:07:57,284 --> 00:08:00,154
Do you have the receipt?

168
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:04,734
<i>Jeez.</i>

169
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,397
I wonder what this is.

170
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,355
# For he's a jolly big asshole #

171
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:09,913
# For he's a jolly big asshole #

172
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,802
# For he's a jolly big asshole #

173
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,972
He's 30 fucking years old.

174
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:18,144
Who modeled for these?

175
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:19,421
"Breast wishes."
Very clever.

176
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:20,385
Can't wait to taste them.

177
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,588
I wanted to get you real ones.

178
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:24,251
Okay.

179
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:00,189
# Yo ho ho #

180
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,199
# It's a pervert's life for me #

181
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:05,305
This is a nice fucking boat,
Mr. Rockefeller.

182
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,490
Business must be good.

183
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:07,739
- You like, huh?
- Yeah.

184
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:10,711
Me, too.
I like very much.

185
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,476
And I want to keep it that way.

186
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,912
No smoking on board, birthday boy.

187
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:15,903
Are you fucking kidding me?

188
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,823
Baby's brand-new.

189
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,360
How long you been running drugs?

190
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:24,668
I prefer to make my fortune
the old fashioned way.

191
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:25,630
How's that?

192
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,071
With other people's money.

193
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:29,535
All right, so, this is just what...

194
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:31,772
Your getaway vehicle?

195
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,399
I like it fine where I am.

196
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:35,735
Hey, Sarah.

197
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,783
You want to take a nap?

198
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:41,590
There we are, huh?

199
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:45,471
Are you having fun
on this big ole bed?

200
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:46,615
Who's my girl?

201
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,662
You are.
Aren't you?

202
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,660
Now let's see if mommy can relax.

203
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,742
You've already done the hard part.

204
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,636
- You think?
- Sure.

205
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:04,827
You got on board.
You scaled the wall.

206
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,349
<i>Your mommy's crazy, sweetheart.</i>

207
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:09,048
I hope you'll come
visit me in the madhouse

208
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,427
when you're older.

209
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,822
No. Your mom's acting human.

210
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:20,788
Party time, people!

211
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:22,585
Nothing like starting the day

212
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:24,475
with a screaming orgasm,
isn't that right, baby?

213
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:25,719
I don't know, you tell me.

214
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:26,683
Look at that ass, Lauren.

215
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,463
It's time for you to stop being
the perfect, caring husband,

216
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,027
because I'm fine.

217
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,956
No more talk.

218
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:43,507
Time to get our groove on.

219
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:49,495
Are we getting old?

220
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:50,546
Not yet.

221
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:52,660
Good.

222
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:01,302
It's been one major
adrenaline rush for us

223
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:02,582
ever since we met.

224
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:04,692
So, uh, how many hours
has it been exactly?

225
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,644
For your information,
not that it's any of your business,

226
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:11,036
we've known each other
for exactly... um, babe?

227
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:18,678
Two weeks, one day,
and 41/2 hours.

228
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:24,563
She can tell time.
I'm impressed.

229
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:28,148
The natives are thirsty.
Must feed the natives.

230
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,772
Quench your thirst with a nice shot.

231
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:33,297
The cleavers have arrived.

232
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:34,647
And just in time.

233
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:37,169
Screaming orgasm, June?

234
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,380
I think your mother
may have dropped you

235
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:40,890
on your head one
too many times, Dan.

236
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,678
She's breast-feeding, you fool.

237
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,917
No shit.
It's just O.J.

238
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:46,841
Oh, thank you.

239
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,044
Why are you wearing one of those?

240
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:55,215
To cover my monster boobs.

241
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:58,641
Monster boobs.

242
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:02,195
That wasn't very funny.

243
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:03,226
Yeah, I know.

244
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,046
All right, no, seriously.

245
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:07,535
I'd first like to thank you all
for coming out here

246
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:11,155
and accepting my most humble
of invitations after all these years.

247
00:12:11,258 --> 00:12:12,436
I appreciate it.

248
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:14,839
And I would like
to propose a toast

249
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:18,996
to our dear friend,
with a great ass, I might add...

250
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:20,341
Zach.

251
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:21,968
Happy birthday, old man.

252
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,861
Thank you.

253
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:25,903
Whoa. Whoa.

254
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,043
I dub thee captain for a day.

255
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:31,954
Hang on, hang on.

256
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:34,424
I'm not done with my toast yet.

257
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,368
Here's to staying single,
seeing double,

258
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,326
and sleeping triple.

259
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:41,839
No disrespect.

260
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:43,286
None taken?

261
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:45,877
- Salute!
- Cheers.

262
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:46,870
Salut.

263
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:48,594
Salut!

264
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:56,244
Come on, everybody.
Let's dance.

265
00:12:57,976 --> 00:12:59,983
Baby.

266
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:03,830
Water's over there.

267
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:05,105
Let's do it.

268
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,477
Okay.

269
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:09,517
Very impressive boat, Dan.

270
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,340
Yacht, Jimmy.
It's a yacht.

271
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,201
So, you still cruising the world...

272
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:28,117
Aspen in the winter,
Maui in the summer?

273
00:13:28,214 --> 00:13:31,563
Last winter, Japan.
Yeah. Instructing.

274
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,532
That was fun.

275
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,321
You can snowboard in Japan?

276
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,517
Yeah. Up north. Hokkaido.

277
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,076
Lots of Australians.

278
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:41,076
Cool.

279
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:42,734
Man, this is wild.

280
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:45,969
Ah, careful.
Easy, easy.

281
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,964
You all right?

282
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,622
Relax.

283
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,284
Where are all
the fucking dolphins?

284
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:56,178
What are you talking about?

285
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:57,870
Remember Flipper?

286
00:13:57,973 --> 00:13:59,249
Fall in, they'll save you.

287
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:03,888
Unless you save me first.

288
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,340
Let me guess.
You're the king of the world, right?

289
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,298
Very original.

290
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,501
Zach, shut up.

291
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,609
There it is.

292
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:41,806
Thanks.

293
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:43,500
See, that life raft seats 8,

294
00:14:43,603 --> 00:14:46,123
and there are only
6 of us, Amy, so we're set.

295
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:48,015
Don't forget Sarah.

296
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:50,482
I'm sorry.
So, 61/2.

297
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,353
Actually, I think the orange
Kind of suits you.

298
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,179
I'm hot.

299
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,387
Yes. You are.

300
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,374
I want to go swimming.

301
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:29,356
You boys want to take a dip?

302
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:34,830
I got masks and a knife.
Who wants?

303
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:36,238
- Ooh, yeah.
- We do.

304
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:38,093
We do.

305
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:39,720
Oh, cute.

306
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:41,679
Any special requests
for dinner, my captain?

307
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:44,013
Yeah. Two mermaids on a stick.

308
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:46,862
And now for the piece de resistance.

309
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:50,188
I love her!

310
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:51,368
I'm gonna name her Delphine.

311
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:52,487
Told you we'd see a dolphin.

312
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:53,454
Oh, wow.

313
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,796
You coming, Dan?

314
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:56,390
I'll be right with you.

315
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:59,595
You want one, right?

316
00:16:01,104 --> 00:16:01,997
Duty calls.

317
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:04,682
Go enjoy yourself, please.

318
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:05,765
You're sure?

319
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:07,399
- Fair.
- Mommy.

320
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:10,349
Gee, thanks.

321
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:11,375
All right.
Let's get wet.

322
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,195
Should I take my cigarettes with me?

323
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:15,270
Wow. It looks deep.

324
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,441
Just kidding.

325
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:21,031
That's funny.

326
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:22,957
I'm coming, sweet girl.

327
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,477
See you ladies in the water.

328
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:29,095
Last one in is the last one in.

329
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:47,971
I love it!

330
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:52,393
Let's go.

331
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,152
You and Amy seem really happy.

332
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:56,392
We are.

333
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:59,276
That's nice.

334
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:01,828
You know what they say...

335
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,362
You gotta kiss a lot of frogs

336
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,397
to find your prince.

337
00:17:06,574 --> 00:17:08,548
I think Amy's still kissing.

338
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,108
Ribbit.

339
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:12,457
Ribbit.

340
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:18,282
Well, you seem like a very nice frog.

341
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,617
So do you.

342
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,078
I don't mean a frog.

343
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,897
I mean, just pretty good.

344
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,713
I mean, just...

345
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:30,786
Good. I mean, you're pretty,

346
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:33,259
- You're good.
- Thank you.

347
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,632
Yeah.

348
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:36,706
She's beautiful.

349
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:38,153
Thank you.

350
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:39,746
I want kids, Amy.

351
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:40,866
You know...

352
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:43,044
one day, when the time's right.

353
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:45,995
With Barbie?

354
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:48,546
What's wrong with having a little fun?

355
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:49,862
Nothing.

356
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:53,029
If I was single and a guy...

357
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,913
You don't need to be
a guy to have fun.

358
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:58,788
In your dreams.

359
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,509
And to think, if I hadn't been
such an ass in high school,

360
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:02,920
It could have been
me instead of James.

361
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:06,695
Yeah. Like I was
the only girl in your life, right?

362
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:11,338
Why don't we head upstairs?

363
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,464
Why not?

364
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,089
Take that off.

365
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:42,055
Why?

366
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,746
Just, just come on.
Take it off.

367
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,093
All right.

368
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:49,507
Okay. Now close your eyes.

369
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,975
- No.
- Come on. Close your eyes.

370
00:18:57,128 --> 00:18:59,648
Okay. Open 'em.

371
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:04,928
Yeah.

372
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:09,183
It's cool.

373
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,278
Yeah. Let's go.

374
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,359
Okay.

375
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:20,546
So that's how it is, huh?

376
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:26,146
Oh, my gosh.
That's no fair.

377
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:28,516
It's so stupid and so long ago.

378
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:29,825
I lost my top.

379
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,552
Oh, my God, I feel so exposed.

380
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:33,510
Most people are afraid of spiders

381
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:36,062
or afraid to fly or scared of...

382
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,574
Scared of clowns?

383
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,063
Stop!

384
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,509
Hey!

385
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:48,701
Um, it's gotten worse
since I had Sarah.

386
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:51,262
I don't want her to end up worrying
about stuff like that

387
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:52,959
because of my paranoia.

388
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:55,745
You know, my buddy Brad,

389
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,504
He was afraid of circus clowns.

390
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:59,547
- Was?
- Yep.

391
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:01,345
What'd he do?

392
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:03,103
Well, we...

393
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:04,700
We took him to the circus.

394
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,300
No! You let me down, Dan!

395
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,354
The water looks great.

396
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:09,119
Let me down!
Let me down... No!

397
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:10,563
- No, no, no!
- Amy, trust me.

398
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:46,372
Daddy, what's wrong?

399
00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:04,000
- Marco.
- Polo.

400
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,026
Marco.

401
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:06,617
You're always cheating.

402
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,665
I'm only cheating if you lose.

403
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:30,303
Daddy!

404
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:51,674
No!

405
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,086
Daddy!

406
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:58,940
Amy?

407
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,863
Amy, what the hell happened?

408
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,138
What the hell happened?

409
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:04,445
How did she get in the water?

410
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:05,690
Are you okay?

411
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,418
You're gonna be okay, Amy.
We're gonna get you out.

412
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,014
You did this?
Did you do this, Dan?

413
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,981
Are you all right?

414
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,738
We just jumped in the water.

415
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:13,018
What's wrong with her?

416
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,462
Is she gonna be all right?

417
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,054
You're gonna be okay, Amy.
We're gonna get you out.

418
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,654
Where's the ladder?

419
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,701
Where's the ladder?
The ladder?

420
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:21,335
Should be...

421
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:24,700
Where's the fucking ladder, Dan?

422
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,523
I think it's on the other side.

423
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,232
It's not on the other side.

424
00:22:30,335 --> 00:22:31,229
Or the back.

425
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:33,083
There's no fucking ladder.

426
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:45,724
Get out and help me up.

427
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:49,501
Any second.

428
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:51,092
We're gonna get you back in the boat.

429
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,060
Real fast.

430
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,981
Relax.

431
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,664
We're gonna get back on that boat
real fast, okay?

432
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:08,059
We gotta find the lowest point.

433
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:09,085
There!

434
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:10,676
No?

435
00:23:13,918 --> 00:23:15,161
Fuck!

436
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:18,004
We gotta get to
the lowest point.

437
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:19,003
Higher, come on!

438
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:20,530
<i># Frere Jacques #</i>

439
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:22,645

440

444
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:31,416
Zach, what about that?

445
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:32,411
Damn it!

446
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:33,970
Zach?

447
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:35,254
We got a rudder right there
where the line is.

448
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:36,601
How's that look, Dan?

449
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:40,954

Using what? Water?

At least we're trying
to think of something.

I'm thirsty.

Sar... Sarah?

Oh, she'll be fine.

465
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:24,848
She could sleep
through a hurricane...

466
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:26,515
And my crappy singing.

467
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,235
You know that.

468
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:45,718
A little higher!

469
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:54,931
I want to get out now, Dan!

470
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:56,440
I'm getting cold.

471

Dan, help me!

472
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:02,418
Don't leave me alone.

473
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:07,247
I'm tired and I'm cold

474
00:25:07,353 --> 00:25:09,491
and I don't want to drown.

475
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,250
Come here.
Come here.

476
00:25:11,353 --> 00:25:12,847
That better?

477
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:14,196
You all right?

478
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:17,494
You look pretty silly with that thing.

479
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:20,275
L... I know.

480
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:24,916
I'm gonna have to
take it for a bit, okay?

481
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:30,447
Come on, bro.

482
00:25:30,552 --> 00:25:31,479
Push!

483
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:35,735
Too fucking slippery, man!

484
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:37,489
I'm holding it the best I can, bro.

485
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:38,769
Do it again.
Come on.

486
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,530
Yes! Yes!

487
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:42,453
Yes! Yes!

488
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:45,493
The air, bro.
We're losing the air.

489
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:46,998
Fuck.

490
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,256
This was supposed to be fun.

491
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:03,787
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,244
Well, there's a way.

493
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,910
There must be.

494
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,564
I don't believe it!

495
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,012
How could you be so stupid?

496
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,571
Would you get off my back?!

497
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:15,725
I said I was sorry!

498
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:16,844
Oh, you did?

499
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,772
All right, everybody
just fuckin' relax.

500
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,008
Okay, it can't be this hard.
We'll get on this fucker.

501
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,571
All right?

502
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,163
What you got?

503
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,611
Might be able to grab this.

504
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:28,116
Hell, yeah, you can reach that!

505
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:35,883
Gotta time it with the wind.

506
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:37,395
You're really close.

507
00:26:41,236 --> 00:26:42,349
Yes!

508
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:49,649
Yes! Nice!

509
00:26:49,748 --> 00:26:51,025
Nice, nice!

510
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:52,531
Yes, yes, yes!

511
00:26:56,564 --> 00:26:57,491
Damn it!

512
00:26:57,588 --> 00:26:58,832
Damn it!

513
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:04,428
I don't deserve this.

514
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:18,449
Fuck it.

515
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:20,270
We'll think of something.

516
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:33,324
Hey, girl.

517
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:35,794
Glad to have you back.

518
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:40,906
It would be funny
if it weren't so serious, huh?

519
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,681
How's she doing?

520
00:27:44,786 --> 00:27:45,735
She's all right.

521
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:47,086
Give me your mask.

522
00:27:47,186 --> 00:27:49,324
How are you doing?

523
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:50,833
Okay, good.

524
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:53,869
We'll get you out of this water.

525
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:01,807
Hey.

526
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:03,399
Any of you guys got a cigarette?

527
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:08,207
Listen, I smoke,
like, 40 packs a day.

528
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:09,646
My lungs are trash.

529
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:10,923
You don't see me going under.

530
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,326
Right?

531
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,726
It's a lot harder to
drown than you think.

532
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:17,963
You'll be okay.

533
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,723
Michelle, we'll be fine.

534
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,068
Thank you.

535
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,048
Come on.

536
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:29,159
Let's move around a little.

537
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:30,125
What was that for?

538
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:31,085
We'll get the blood flowing.

539
00:28:31,184 --> 00:28:32,045
That'll warm us up.

540
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,158
For being here.

541
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:35,086
We should look
for some other boats.

542
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:37,158
There must be
some around, right?

543
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:38,441
Absolutely.

544
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:39,405
Somebody will find us.

545
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,143
You all right?

546
00:28:57,743 --> 00:28:59,150
Not really.

547
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:02,023
I'll make it up to you.

548
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:09,100
Something just touched my leg!

549
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:10,627
What the fuck was it?

550
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:11,596
What?

551
00:29:12,655 --> 00:29:14,061
I don't know.
There it is again!

552
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:15,402
There it is!

553
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:16,909
A shark!
I know it's a shark!

554
00:29:19,662 --> 00:29:20,523
Okay. Okay.

555
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:21,483
Just calm down, okay?

556
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:56,584
What do you see?

557
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,478
Maybe we should
kick our legs...

558
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,074
Scare it away.

559
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,741
Or piss it off!

560
00:30:34,795 --> 00:30:36,486
All right, nobody's bleeding.

561
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,015
It ain't a shark.

562
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,353
How do you know?

563
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:41,636
We're still here, aren't we?

564
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:43,396
Yeah, that's the problem, Dan.

565
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:44,676
I didn't plan for this.

566
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:45,639
No shit.

567
00:30:45,738 --> 00:30:48,455
Don't you do some sort of
pre-flight check, like a pilot...

568
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:50,277
Have some sort of
emergency backup plans?

569
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:51,654
Obviously not.

570
00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:52,998
Isn't that standard?

571
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:54,440
Hey...

572
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:56,392
Who died and made you
captain fucking Nemo?

573
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:58,856
You didn't notice either.

574
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:00,263
None of you did.

575
00:31:01,257 --> 00:31:02,435
It's your boat, Dan,

576
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:04,993
not mine.

577
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,715
If it weren't for you, Dan,
Amy would be up there,

578
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:09,159
and we wouldn't
be here right now.

579
00:31:09,257 --> 00:31:10,719
Look...

580
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:13,160
I said I was sorry, okay?

581
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:14,916
I should have checked.

582
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:16,359
I should have checked.

583
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,504
I should have checked!

584
00:31:17,608 --> 00:31:18,917
What do you want me to say?

585
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:20,643
I didn't think.
I made a mistake!

586
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:23,614
You spend millions on a boat,
but you don't think?

587
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:27,103
I need some space.

588
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,353
Well, that's great!

589
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:30,431
We got loads of it out here, man!

590
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:32,195
You're MacGyver.

591
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:34,271
Why don't you build something?

592
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:37,060
Yeah. Why not pull
a 747 out of your ass

593
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,337
and fly us all out of here?

594
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:50,173
There has to be a way,
'cause Sarah's still up there.

595
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:12,033
I feel cold.

596
00:32:12,134 --> 00:32:13,695
I can't move my legs anymore.

597
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,239
Whoa! Whoa!

598
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:19,203
Please! Please!

599
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:20,512
Help!

600
00:32:20,614 --> 00:32:24,192
Listen!

601
00:32:24,294 --> 00:32:25,309
You give me a minute?

602
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:26,591
I need some time to think.

603
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:41,955
Jesus!

604
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:43,068
What are you doing?

605
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:45,475
Michelle, what are you doing?

606
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:48,475
I'm just trying to stay afloat!

607
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:50,075
Why does she get the jacket?

608
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,391
I need it, too!

609
00:32:51,493 --> 00:32:52,354
Stop it!

610
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:53,881
We can...
We can share it!

611
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:55,483
Michelle!

612
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:56,898
Get ahold of yourself!

613
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:03,226
What is this?

614
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:05,471
Best friends stick together forever?

615
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:10,459
I'm a person, too.

616
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:18,746
I just don't want to die out here!

617
00:33:18,852 --> 00:33:20,827
I don't... I don't want to die!

618
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,110
I don't want to die!

619
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:24,186
It's okay. It's okay!

620
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,469
It's okay. Come on.

621
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:27,230
- I can't!
- Come on!

622
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:29,470
It's fine.
Trust me.

623
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:30,848
Come on, Michelle.
Trust me.

624
00:33:30,947 --> 00:33:32,354
Okay.

625
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:33,793
Now breathe.

626
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:34,752
Breathe with me, okay?

627
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:38,593
Breathe.

628
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:39,868
There you go.

629
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:41,313
There you go, see?

630
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,905
See, you're gonna be fine.

631
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:44,026
Trust me.

632
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,269
Okay, now, I want
you to breathe, Michelle.

633
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,193
Just breathe.

634
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,697
Breathe with me.

635
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,490
You're gonna be okay.

636
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,374
There you go.

637
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,388
Our father,

638
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,791
Who art in heaven,

639
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,345
Hallowed be thy name...

640
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,367
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

641
00:34:18,465 --> 00:34:20,854
On Earth as it is in Heaven...

642
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:28,667
Give us this day
our daily bread...

643
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:34,746
And forgive us our trespasses,

644
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:38,144
As we forgive those
who trespass against us,

645
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,469
And lead us not
into temptation...

646
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:46,495
But deliver us from ev... evil.

647
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,295
For thine...

648
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:56,415
Is the kingdom...

649
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,342
The power...

650
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:04,407
And the glory.

651
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:07,294
Amen.

652
00:35:08,927 --> 00:35:10,814
Save your breath, Michelle.

653
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:15,767
It doesn't hurt to ask.

654
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,268
Yeah.

655
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,148
Blessed are those
who ask for nothing...

656
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:23,134
For they shall never
be disappointed.

657
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:26,421
What?

658
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:28,021
He lets millions of
people die every day.

659
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,784
Children die.

660
00:35:29,886 --> 00:35:31,609
What makes you think
he's gonna save us?

661
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:35,606
Well, I ain't no saint...

662
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,900
But I'd like to think
that there's something...

663
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:42,421
Something bigger out there...
I don't know.

664
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:45,460
Because if there isn't...

665
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:46,972
we're all fucked.

666
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:50,748
Mothers lift cars off their children

667
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:52,950
when they get into an accident.

668
00:35:53,053 --> 00:35:56,763
And people, they cure themselves
of terminal illness.

669
00:35:56,861 --> 00:35:58,322
It happens, okay?

670
00:35:59,805 --> 00:36:01,943
Maybe it can happen to us.

671
00:36:02,045 --> 00:36:03,223
It has to happen!

672
00:36:17,404 --> 00:36:19,292
I'm so fucking cold!

673
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,651
My hands are totally numb.

674
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:32,502
"Water, water everywhere, and...

675
00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:34,578
not a drop to drink."

676
00:36:34,684 --> 00:36:36,822
A 75-foot nautical wet dream.

677
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:38,417
Shit!

678
00:36:38,523 --> 00:36:39,701
Lucky me.

679
00:36:39,803 --> 00:36:41,842
I'm just going to the Bahamas, man!

680
00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:43,856
I'm so thirsty.

681
00:36:43,963 --> 00:36:46,167
Boats are bound
to come by sooner or later.

682
00:36:47,803 --> 00:36:49,526
Somebody will find us.

683
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,248
It's coming from the other side!

684
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:50,516
That's my phone!

685
00:37:50,616 --> 00:37:51,860
That's my phone!

686
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,040
Get it!

687
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:54,093
Get it, get it, get it!

688
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,215
Answer it!

689
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,597
Answer the phone!

690
00:37:56,695 --> 00:37:57,557
Careful, don't let it get wet!

691
00:37:57,655 --> 00:37:58,735
- I can reach that.
- Answer it.

692
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,366
Answer the phone!

693
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:08,525
Answer it!
Answer it!

694
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:11,086
- Ring, baby!
- Quick!

695
00:38:13,431 --> 00:38:14,892
Erica!

696
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:16,373
Happy birthday, baby brother.

697
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:18,413
# For he's a jolly good fellow... #

698
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,697
Erica!

699
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:20,976
# Which nobody can deny #

700
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,534
Erica? Anybody?
Can you hear us?

701
00:38:23,638 --> 00:38:25,067
Help! We're drowning!
Please!

702
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:26,036
Shut up!

703
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:27,215
Erica?

704
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:28,463
- Zach, can you hear me?
- Erica, hello?

705
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:29,777
Zach, can you hear me?

706
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:32,148
Erica! Erica?

707
00:38:33,238 --> 00:38:34,732
- Help us!
- Hello?

708
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:36,148
What did you do?

709
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:37,108
Nothing!

710
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:38,100
You hung up on her!

711
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:39,856
I did not!

712
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,740
- What happened?
- Give it to me!

713
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:44,015
Try to call her back.

714
00:38:44,118 --> 00:38:45,230
Bullshit!
Call 9-1-1!

715
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:46,894
Come on.
Come on.

716
00:38:46,998 --> 00:38:48,492
Please!
God damn it!

717
00:38:48,597 --> 00:38:49,775
Fuck!

718
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:51,284
No!

719
00:38:54,677 --> 00:38:56,084
Zach.

720
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,860
We might have been able to fix it.

721
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:07,058
It was soaking wet, Dan.

722
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:08,499
It was fucking fried.

723
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,484
Are you sure about that?

724
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:19,691
Maybe she heard something.

725
00:39:19,797 --> 00:39:21,836
Heard what? "Hello?"

726
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:25,778
How's that supposed to help?

727
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:27,763
You didn't even tell her
where we were!

728
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:34,316
I'm serious!

729
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,599
We're gonna drown out here.

730
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:42,729
How come nobody's
listening to me?

731
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:44,330
We're gonna fucking die out here!

732
00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:45,645
Fucking die, you idiot!

733
00:39:45,747 --> 00:39:46,729
Michelle, shut up!

734
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:48,177
No, you shut the fuck up!

735
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:49,322
Hey, come on!

736
00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:50,888
Hey! Hey!

737
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:52,172
Knock it off!

738
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:53,933
Let's keep it together!

739
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:54,983
It's bad enough out here.

740
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:55,952
We don't need to be

741
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,457
starting in on each
other every second.

742
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:15,852
Leg cramp!

743
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:16,815
Which one?

744
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:17,775
The left.

745
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,532
Hold it up, hold it up.

746
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,608
Okay?

747
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:25,291
That's better.

748
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:26,800
Thanks.

749
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:50,662
I have an idea.

750
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:52,492
What?

751
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:53,934
Let's make a rope.

752
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:55,210
Come on.

753
00:40:55,312 --> 00:40:56,937
Nude up, everybody.

754
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:00,518
Nude up.

755
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,085
Another one of your perverted stunts?

756
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,014
Give me some credit, Lauren.

757
00:41:04,112 --> 00:41:05,453
We make a rope...

758
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:06,501
out of our shorts.

759
00:41:06,608 --> 00:41:07,688
Toss it up there,

760
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,766
we'll hook it onto something.

761
00:41:09,871 --> 00:41:11,213
I hate to say it, but...

762
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:12,327
It might actually work.

763
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,089
Chop chop, people.

764
00:41:14,192 --> 00:41:15,501
I'm just...

765
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,290
I'm so cold.

766
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,049
You're wearing dental floss, sweetheart,

767
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,492
not a ski parka.

768
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:21,998
Would you rather drown?

769
00:41:35,886 --> 00:41:37,195
Oh, shit!

770
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:41,448
Hey!

771
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,594
Hey, stop!

772
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:49,635
Stop!

773
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:58,564
Over here!

774
00:41:58,669 --> 00:41:59,847
Hey! Stop!

775
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,608
- Oh, god!
- Stop!

776
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:03,848
Stop!

777
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:04,811
No!
Come on!

778
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,370
Stop!

779
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:13,803
Stop. Please.

780
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:23,817
She'll be awake soon.

781
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:29,605
I need the knife.

782
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:30,569
Okay.

783
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,490
Here, I'll hold that.

784
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:34,890
- Careful.
- Yeah.

785
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:36,646
Okay.

786
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:37,609
Should I start tying?

787
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:38,952
Yes.

788
00:42:41,707 --> 00:42:43,365
Is there any way to
get in from below?

789
00:42:43,468 --> 00:42:44,875
How should I know?

790
00:42:46,348 --> 00:42:47,362
You own a boat like this,

791
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:48,482
you don't know anything about it?

792
00:42:48,587 --> 00:42:49,765
It's a fucking yacht, Jimmy.

793
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:50,882
Remember?

794
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,810
If it looks good, I buy it, okay?

795
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:54,249
Is that the answer you're looking for?

796
00:42:54,347 --> 00:42:55,907
'Cause it's the only one I got right now.

797
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:00,227
I need the mask.

798
00:43:03,946 --> 00:43:05,353
Thanks.

799
00:43:13,546 --> 00:43:14,407
Hey, Zach.

800
00:43:14,506 --> 00:43:16,961
You done with the knife?

801
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:19,368
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

802
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:20,960
Let's tie this.

803
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:21,959
Tie it here.

804
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,520
Yeah.
It looks good.

805
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:24,968
Hello.

806
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:27,204
I am James Cousteau,

807
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:28,483
explorer of the deep.

808
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:29,764
Is it a good knot?

809
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:31,043
You gotta make sure
it's a good knot.

810
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:32,160
I'm gonna go take
a peek below.

811
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:33,760
Is it strong?

812
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:35,043
It's gotta be able to hold me.

813
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:36,007
You all right?

814
00:43:36,106 --> 00:43:37,928
I'll be fine.

815
00:43:39,146 --> 00:43:41,120
Give me the bikini top.

816
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:46,406
Tie knots... lf you can.

817
00:43:46,505 --> 00:43:48,032
I may have dropped something.

818
00:43:48,137 --> 00:43:50,144
This is strong.

819
00:44:20,776 --> 00:44:22,085
Wring it out.

820
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:25,151
We have to wring it... Yeah.

821
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:27,044
Go to your left.

822
00:44:29,063 --> 00:44:30,405
Back me up.

823
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:31,518
You okay?

824
00:44:31,623 --> 00:44:32,484
Wait... wait...

825
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,444
Here, pass it to Lauren.

826
00:44:33,543 --> 00:44:34,558
Lauren?

827
00:44:34,663 --> 00:44:35,678
Someone hold it here.

828
00:44:35,783 --> 00:44:37,125
I got it.

829
00:44:37,223 --> 00:44:38,237
Thank you so much.

830
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,520
Wait... Wait.

831
00:44:39,623 --> 00:44:42,078
Oh, that's it.
One...

832
00:44:43,622 --> 00:44:45,989
Two, three!

833
00:44:49,862 --> 00:44:51,204
Give me a "one, two, three."

834
00:44:51,302 --> 00:44:52,163
Okay.

835
00:44:52,262 --> 00:44:53,439
Just a straight "one, two, three."

836
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:55,517
Okay.

837
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:56,483
Fuck!

838
00:44:56,582 --> 00:44:57,597
Here, wring it out a little.

839
00:44:57,702 --> 00:44:59,677
Wring it out.

840
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:01,124
You're getting this too wet.

841
00:45:01,222 --> 00:45:02,465
It's too wet, look.

842
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,443
It seems so easy.

843
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:15,035
Okay, you can do it.

844
00:45:15,141 --> 00:45:16,483
On three.
You can do it, Zach.

845
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:17,759
One...

846
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:18,876
To the left a little.

847
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:19,843
Come on, come on.

848
00:45:19,941 --> 00:45:23,007
One, two, three.

849
00:45:25,701 --> 00:45:26,945
Yeah!

850
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,155
You can do it.
You can do it.

851
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,405
Come on, Zach.

852
00:45:49,507 --> 00:45:51,198
You can get it, man.

853
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,023
Take it slow.

854
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:01,339
Careful...

855
00:46:18,978 --> 00:46:20,472
Son of a bitch!

856
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:22,171
- Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes!

857
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:24,030
Oh, my God!

858
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,671
God damn it.

859
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:52,315
Yo, man.

860
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:54,239
What's that?

861
00:46:54,337 --> 00:46:56,311
I don't know.

862
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:59,002
There's a square cut in the side
of your boat, bro.

863
00:46:59,105 --> 00:47:01,472
James!

864
00:47:30,496 --> 00:47:32,951
What happened? Wh...

865
00:47:33,055 --> 00:47:33,916
What are you...

866
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:35,837
Are you all right?

867
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,429
Lauren!

868
00:47:39,295 --> 00:47:41,596
Lauren!
What happened?

869
00:47:45,214 --> 00:47:46,392
James.

870
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:49,113
Hey, James...
Lauren?

871
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:50,709
Is he okay? James?

872
00:47:50,814 --> 00:47:51,829
Is he okay?

873
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:54,389
- James?
- What happened?

874
00:47:54,495 --> 00:47:56,153
Support his head.

875
00:47:56,254 --> 00:47:57,116
What happened?

876
00:47:57,214 --> 00:47:58,873
Support his head.

877
00:47:58,974 --> 00:48:00,054
Keep it supported.

878
00:48:04,734 --> 00:48:08,279
I think he has a skull fracture.

879
00:48:08,382 --> 00:48:09,276
Jesus Christ.

880
00:48:09,374 --> 00:48:12,789
He needs a hospital
and he needs it fast.

881
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:14,900
Enough of this bullshit.

882
00:48:15,006 --> 00:48:16,794
James!
James.

883
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,137
Give me the knife.

884
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:35,378
No!

885
00:48:39,164 --> 00:48:41,106
Dan! What is wrong with you?

886
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:42,423
No!

887
00:48:42,524 --> 00:48:44,313
Buy yourself a new toy
when we're out of this mess!

888
00:48:44,413 --> 00:48:45,427
What the hell are you doing?

889
00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:56,825
No!

890
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:10,711
Oh, my God!

891
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:13,909
Couldn't you just leave him alone?

892
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,745
Give me some of the rope.

893
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:18,712
God damn it, Dan, now!

894
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:20,883
Christ, I'm... I'm sorry...

895
00:49:20,987 --> 00:49:22,067
What did you do?

896
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,185
It's just a stupid fucking boat!

897
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,697
What's wrong with you?

898
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,457
This is gonna attract
everything, isn't it?

899
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,602
He was just trying
to get us out of here.

900
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,988
Sarah...

901
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,747
Sarah, I'm here!

902
00:49:53,849 --> 00:49:56,500
Mommy and daddy are here!

903
00:49:56,601 --> 00:49:58,543
Sarah!

904
00:49:58,649 --> 00:49:59,510
I'm here!

905
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:02,423
Mommy and daddy
are here! L...

906
00:50:06,424 --> 00:50:07,831
I'm sorry.

907
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:11,023
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

908
00:50:11,128 --> 00:50:12,754
Easiest thing in the world.

909
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:14,449
It means nothing!

910
00:50:15,768 --> 00:50:17,175
Where's Michelle?

911
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:20,790
Michelle!

912
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,730
Oh, my God.

913
00:50:30,648 --> 00:50:31,509
Michelle.

914
00:52:31,122 --> 00:52:32,529
How you doing?

915
00:52:38,002 --> 00:52:39,889
I feel cold.

916
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:47,879
Well, we are at sea.

917
00:52:50,642 --> 00:52:52,202
Hold your head up, babe.

918
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:04,938
It's fine.

919
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:07,659
Maybe 20 years from now...

920
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:09,964
we'll look back on this and laugh.

921
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:26,543
It's too bad...

922
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,423
that Dan forgot his camera.

923
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,927
His video camera.

924
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,767
Yeah.

925
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:39,661
Remember...
El Matador beach?

926
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,280
Of course.

927
00:53:42,383 --> 00:53:44,139
You were so...

928
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:45,962
So sexy that day.

929
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,487
Now I know you're delirious.

930
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,821
How much seawater did you drink?

931
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,323
I should've told you that then.

932
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:13,475
You can tell me
when we get back to shore, okay?

933
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,035
Okay?

934
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,365
Okay.

935
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:28,684
Zach?

936
00:54:33,677 --> 00:54:35,172
Zach, breathe!

937
00:54:35,277 --> 00:54:36,771
Zach, wake up!

938
00:54:36,877 --> 00:54:38,665
Help me, Amy!

939
00:54:38,765 --> 00:54:40,620
Zach, breathe!
Breathe!

940
00:54:40,717 --> 00:54:43,335
Wake up!
Breathe!

941
00:54:43,437 --> 00:54:44,484
Oh, no!

942
00:54:48,237 --> 00:54:49,960
No!

943
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:52,779
God damn it!

944
00:54:52,877 --> 00:54:54,186
No!

945
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:03,237
Is the boat worth more to you
than your friends?

946
00:55:05,356 --> 00:55:07,014
He's dead!

947
00:55:07,116 --> 00:55:08,774
Zach's dead!

948
00:55:08,876 --> 00:55:10,152
Michelle's dead!

949
00:55:10,252 --> 00:55:12,619
But you still got your boat, right?

950
00:55:12,715 --> 00:55:14,439
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

951
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,816
It's a yacht!

952
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:17,574
It's a fucking yacht, isn't it?

953
00:55:17,675 --> 00:55:18,690
No!

954
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:20,770
It's a fucking yacht!

955
00:55:20,876 --> 00:55:22,053
It's a fucking yacht!

956
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:23,170
Fucking yacht!

957
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:25,414
Stop it!

958
00:55:27,915 --> 00:55:29,573
You're on his side.

959
00:55:29,674 --> 00:55:31,497
No, no!
Of course not.

960
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,798
That's what it looks like to me.

961
00:55:33,899 --> 00:55:35,328
After everything he's done?

962
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:40,902
Old fires always burn, right?

963
00:55:41,002 --> 00:55:42,912
James... I'm just...

964
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:45,157
I'm just worried about you.

965
00:55:58,473 --> 00:56:01,255
Most likely to succeed.

966
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,342
I was voted "most likely to succeed"
our senior year.

967
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:11,237
You guys remember that?

968
00:56:11,337 --> 00:56:15,331
Dan...

969
00:56:15,433 --> 00:56:18,368
I didn't want Zach to hurt it, l...

970
00:56:18,473 --> 00:56:20,677
I couldn't let him hurt it because...

971
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:26,273
Because it isn't mine.

972
00:56:28,073 --> 00:56:29,447
The boat...

973
00:56:30,953 --> 00:56:32,294
This isn't... This isn't my boat,

974
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:35,010
This isn't my life.

975
00:56:35,112 --> 00:56:37,250
I couldn't...

976
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,872
I couldn't rent something like this,
let alone buy it.

977
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:41,405
What?

978
00:56:41,512 --> 00:56:44,382
I don't... I don't invest anything
for anybody.

979
00:56:45,832 --> 00:56:47,806
I'm a fraud.
I'm a...

980
00:56:47,912 --> 00:56:49,089
I'm a monkey in a mailroom.

981
00:56:49,192 --> 00:56:51,264
I'm an errand boy.
I'm nothing.

982
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:57,028
I told Michelle I was a millionaire.

983
00:56:57,127 --> 00:57:00,356
I told a hundred Michelles
the same thing.

984
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:05,412
I walk into their bars
in my $2,000 suit

985
00:57:05,511 --> 00:57:08,446
with a picture of my boss' yacht
in my pocket, and l...

986
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,445
I promise to sail
them around the world,

987
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,208
and they always believe me.

988
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,132
You believed me.

989
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:19,775
And for once, just once...

990
00:57:19,878 --> 00:57:22,114
I wanted to believe it myself.

991
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:28,351
L... I'm... I'm so sorry.

992
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,950
No!

993
00:57:35,558 --> 00:57:37,729
Jesus Christ, I killed him.

994
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:46,109
I killed them.

995
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:53,792
Oh, God,
it's all my fault.

996
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:16,024
I loved him
and I never got to tell him.

997
00:58:16,132 --> 00:58:18,368
He knew.
He knew.

998
00:58:18,468 --> 00:58:19,329
Let him go.

999
00:58:19,428 --> 00:58:21,403
No, no!

1000
00:58:21,507 --> 00:58:23,809
Okay.

1001
00:58:23,907 --> 00:58:24,955
Okay.

1002
00:58:29,028 --> 00:58:30,915
God, no!

1003
00:59:24,705 --> 00:59:27,902
Guys, do you think we're going to
know each other forever?

1004
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:53,886
Is Sarah still asleep?

1005
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,544
I think so.

1006
00:59:59,712 --> 01:00:01,719
She'll be getting up
pretty soon, won't she?

1007
01:00:01,823 --> 01:00:03,317
Probably.

1008
01:00:03,423 --> 01:00:05,561
We'll be back
on board by then.

1009
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:16,926
I'll check
on her before I go to bed.

1010
01:00:17,022 --> 01:00:18,583
Okay.

1011
01:00:22,462 --> 01:00:24,055
She's a good girl, isn't she?

1012
01:00:26,622 --> 01:00:27,964
Just like her mom.

1013
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,922
I think I'm gonna...

1014
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,541
I'm gonna go for a little... swim.

1015
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,955
To see if I can
make it back to shore.

1016
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:22,034
It's too far.

1017
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,765
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

1018
01:01:26,939 --> 01:01:29,078
I'm not gonna die
treading water, man.

1019
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,586
That's just not me.

1020
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,906
It's James, he's just...

1021
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:36,432
There's pressure on his brain, Amy.

1022
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:37,783
Just...

1023
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:49,048
See you soon.

1024
01:02:12,857 --> 01:02:13,872
You're gonna make it.

1025
01:02:13,977 --> 01:02:16,595
Yeah, so are you.

1026
01:02:16,697 --> 01:02:18,737
- Okay.
- Take care, okay?

1027
01:02:23,737 --> 01:02:26,159
You look after them
while I'm gone, yeah?

1028
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:27,377
Yes, ma'am.

1029
01:02:29,977 --> 01:02:31,538
Wish me luck then.

1030
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:34,577
You won't need it.

1031
01:03:16,535 --> 01:03:17,942
Sarah!

1032
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:21,163
Baby girl!

1033
01:03:23,094 --> 01:03:24,687
Sarah...

1034
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:26,100
Can you hear me?
I'm here.

1035
01:03:28,694 --> 01:03:30,450
Your mommy's here,
l... can you hear me?

1036
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:35,795
Please stop crying,
you hear me?

1037
01:03:38,134 --> 01:03:40,022
I'm here, I just... I can't...

1038
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,508
I thought I heard
Sarah crying.

1039
01:03:58,613 --> 01:04:02,028
She's hungry.

1040
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:04,267
How are you...

1041
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,616
How are you doing?

1042
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,053
I'm all right.

1043
01:04:13,972 --> 01:04:15,019
Dan?

1044
01:04:17,972 --> 01:04:20,012
I can't move my legs anymore.

1045
01:04:30,835 --> 01:04:33,552
The square cut on
the side of your boat.

1046
01:04:33,652 --> 01:04:36,205
He was just
trying to get us out of here.

1047
01:04:49,971 --> 01:04:50,986
What are you doing?

1048
01:04:51,091 --> 01:04:53,546
L... I want...

1049
01:04:53,651 --> 01:04:56,018
Try to find the knife.

1050
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:00,432
Do you know how far we've drifted?

1051
01:05:00,531 --> 01:05:03,313
I got... I gotta do something.

1052
01:05:03,411 --> 01:05:05,385
No.

1053
01:05:05,491 --> 01:05:07,694
You don't. I do.

1054
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:11,856
I'll find it.

1055
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:16,272
Okay.

1056
01:06:05,008 --> 01:06:07,147
James.

1057
01:06:17,647 --> 01:06:19,207
I feel tired.

1058
01:06:23,407 --> 01:06:25,130
Really tired.

1059
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:31,559
My head hurts.

1060
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,453
I think I'm gonna
go to bed, all right?

1061
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:51,693
Don't go to sleep yet.

1062
01:06:53,806 --> 01:06:56,010
You wait up for me, okay?

1063
01:06:57,261 --> 01:06:58,723
You stay awake.

1064
01:07:00,686 --> 01:07:01,863
Sure.

1065
01:07:01,965 --> 01:07:02,892
Okay.

1066
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:05,509
Pretty sure...

1067
01:07:07,405 --> 01:07:09,380
I'll wait up for you any day.

1068
01:07:09,485 --> 01:07:10,564
Okay.

1069
01:07:17,645 --> 01:07:19,783
Yeah.

1070
01:07:19,885 --> 01:07:20,900
Yeah.

1071
01:07:40,524 --> 01:07:42,247
Don't cry.

1072
01:07:43,724 --> 01:07:45,447
I'm sorry.

1073
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:52,745
Don't cry.

1074
01:07:52,843 --> 01:07:54,566
It's okay.

1075
01:08:32,682 --> 01:08:34,340
James!

1076
01:08:35,722 --> 01:08:37,216
Drink.

1077
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,728
It's raining.

1078
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:41,601
James.

1079
01:10:14,917 --> 01:10:18,779
It's okay.
It's okay.
