00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:37,703
(narrator)
In the 16th Century,
the mystic John Dee wrote

2
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:41,140
the "Sigillum Aemeth",
a book of musical chants

3
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:44,076
that were meant to
summon angels,

4
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:47,112
but brought
forth demons instead.

5
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:51,450
Fearing the unholy power of his
dark songs, Dee tried to destroy

6
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:54,286
the book, but
failed.

7
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,056
Sought by sorcerers and
dark rules for centuries,

8
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,492
the book had
been lost

9
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,595
...until now.

10
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:09,068
(Men chant in Latin)

11
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,744
(man)
Bequeath protection upon
thine followers who walketh

12
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,114
in the footsteps of--

13
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:52,377
And your appeasement
of the gods of --

14
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,113
Have failed.

15
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,782
(man)
What seven blood packs
not enough, Ronny?

16
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,318
(man)
Yeah, this shit's never coming
out of my tunic, by the way.

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,519
(Ronny)
I don't know what to
tell you guys, okay?

18
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,820
The appeasement fails?

19
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,222
(Eric)
It's bullshit.
You failed, Eric.

20
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,590
Okay?

21
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,191
Maybe if you made
a meaningful sacrifice.

22
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,559
Hey, that's
bullshit, Ronny.

23
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,664
(Eric)
We're over here in the woods
in the middle of the night.

24
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,866
We nailed the chant.

25
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,400
Come on.

26
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,503
Had everything that
game plan laid out.

27
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,740
Can't keep just failing
my appeasements forever.

28
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,142
(Ronny)
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,843
(Eric)
F you, Hung.

30
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,245
(Ronny)
The appeasement fails because
Eric wasn't meaning it.

31
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,446
He wasn't
being meaningful.

32
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:28,914
(man)
Bullshit, Ronny.

33
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,916
(Ronny)
I don't know what
to tell you guys.

34
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,852
(Eric)
Sometimes I don't know who's
harder to appease, Ronny.

35
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,721
(Ronny)
If you don't stop complaining,
the gods of --

36
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:36,922
are going to curse
all your characters

37
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,757
with a case of evil herpes!

38
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,259
Eric, you failed.

39
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,894
Maybe if you made
a meaningful sacrifice.

40
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,396
Guys, how will we ever taste
triumph at Evermore with this

41
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,931
weak bullshit?

42
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:50,469
Fear not, Sir Reginald, for
I have just the magic needed.

43
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:53,705
Excuse me while I whipeth
this out.

44
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,478
What was that?

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,679
Hey, Dude,
what's that?

46
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,880
What?

47
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,282
Oh shit!

48
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:04,516
Oh!

49
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,322
Eat paint, -- fuckers!

50
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,791
(Indistinct shout)

51
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,461
(man)
This'll teach you
to play your

52
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,363
fucking wizard
game in our woods.

53
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,565
Run!

54
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,766
Run, you freaks.

55
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,301
Don't ever
come back.

56
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,785
Hey, check
this shit out.

57
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,487
Harry Pooper dropped
his book.

58
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,292
Yeah, tear
that shit.

59
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,665
Come on, man.

60
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,866
Destroy the book.

61
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,902
Rip it
open.

62
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,977
What the fuck?

63
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,913
(Muffled screaming)

64
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,656
Fuck.

65
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,291
Jesus motherfucker.

66
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,861
The book fucked
up your face.

67
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,769
Ahh!

68
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,473
(man)
Be strong,
Sir Reginald.

69
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,941
Be strong, I say.

70
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,944
Oh man.

71
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,815
Fuck.

72
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,017
Shit!

73
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,418
We gotta go back
for the book.

74
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,320
(man)
What book?

75
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,722
I brought that kickass old book
I was gonna use for my spells!

76
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,491
Fuck!

77
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,826
I must have dropped it when
those people attacked us!

78
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,061
Shit!

79
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,832
Fuck!

80
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,034
(man)
Is this it?

81
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,702
That's it.

82
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:04,903
Whoo.

83
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,605
Thank God.

84
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,407
Sorry about
freaking out.

85
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,008
No problem.

86
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,811
Ronny Kwok, he's gonna
shit when he sees that.

87
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,948
We'll be back,
you redneck cocksuckers.

88
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,483

That shit is tight.

106
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,647
It's called "Your
Heart Sucks My Soul."

107
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,849
It's kind of
a love song, you know?

108
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,050
Mm-hmm.

109
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,085
I wrote it as
a surprise for Beth.

110
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,687
Yeah?
Yeah.

111
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,791
Listen, if that song
doesn't say love and commitment,

112
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,093
I don't
know what does.

113
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,828
We need to have a talk.

114
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,497
I am way
ahead of you.

115
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,666
How about you,
me, dinner, tonight?

116
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,835
Somewhere with
a tablecloth?

117
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,872
I got a little something
special I want to give you.

118
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,707
Wait.

119
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,975
Don't tell me it's--

120
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,811
Is it what
I think it is?

121
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,479
No.

122
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,714
Yes.

123
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,082
I don't know.

124
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,583
What do you
think it is?

125
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:03,021
Don't do anything big
involving jewelry, okay?

126
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,823
I mean, I need to concentrate
on my career.

127
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,091
It's not the right thing
for that sort of commitment.

128
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,492
Oh, no, no,
I get it.

129
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,693
Whoa.

130
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,028
It's cool.

131
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,496
It's
cool.

132
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,565
I mean, why mess with
a good thing, right?

133
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,800
Time out here, Joe.

134
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,602
You're breaking up with me.

135
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,137
Will you listen to me?

136
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,474
You have a college degree
in communications studies.

137
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,675
You could be doing anything
you wanted.

138
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,876
Hold up.

139
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,678
I am doing what I want.

140
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,648
You live in a fake castle
leeching off your accidental

141

millionaire loser friend playing
black metal in your bedroom.

142
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,086
You will
never change.

143
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,855
Uh, it's doom metal.

144
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,490
Who the fuck asked you?

145
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,691
Well, he's right.

146
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,993
Gilberto, you're
the fucking man.

147
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,495
It was black.

148
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,896
Then we went through
a sludge phase.

149
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,097
Now it's more doom.

150
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,667
I need to focus on
my future, my career.

151
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:49,935
It's important that
I align myself

152
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,536
with successful people, Joe.

153
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,840
I'm sorry, but
that's just how it is.

154

(car alarm)

155
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,970
Hey, dude, where's
my plus-3 mace?

156
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,872
Am I thy
weapon's keeper?

157

Hey, man.

158
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,281
Found it!

159
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,817
Oh, hey, dude.

160
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,953
You bent
my mace.

161
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,655
That's not cool.

162
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,890
Sorry, man.

163
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,097
My mom made me this mace.

164
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,099
It's still

Maybe... I should be
making some changes.

demonic syphilis.

00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,652
Welcome to the fields
of Evermore!

332
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,293
Um, Ronny?

333
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,494
Yes,
Travis.

334
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,795
Where are our costumes?

335
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,831
There is no end to
the tricks up my sleeve.

336
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,032
Wardrobe?

337
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,433
(man)
Yes, sir.

338
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,635
Got it.

42 reg, I think
you'll find it snug.

Great.

(Ronny)
I think you'll find
it freshly laundered.

343
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,842
I'm a trained actor, man.

344
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:21,379
Not some
fucking stunt monkey.

workshop, my ass.

Ungrateful.

Ah, greetings,
enchanter.

348
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,689
I have some surprises
in store for you.

349
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:35,426
Some creatures with a taste
for flesh of the lowest order.

350
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:36,694
Hmm?

351
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,729
Parasites, charlatans.

352
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,798
War profiteers
of forbidden weapons.

353
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
Verily, I say,
let it go, dude.

354
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,934
Well.

355
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:47,338
Marketplace is a battlefield
and to the victor go the spoils.

356
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,839
Agreed.

357
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,976
I bring news of a legendary
warrior long absent from this

358

the estimable Sir Reginald.

359

The new warrior
is of course welcome.

What the

365
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,024
I hate that guy.

366
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,993
Ronald, Ronald,
why be so petty?

367
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,528
I mean, surely, you're not
still sore about

368
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,096
your
syphilitic paladin.

369

For old time's sake,

372

But... you must accomplish
a level 12 summoning spell

373

to animate Joe's character
with Reginald's life-force.

Consider it done,
my liege.

Okay, that was
a bit much.

this party has a quest
to loot the temple of --

Capital idea, Sir Lando.

Take Sir Hung the capable

fabled temple.

Fucketh you

Easy.

berth as he is pained by a riven

cruelty of an untrue maiden.

Ah, at last.

Yeah?

587
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:12,275
Thou must return to
the kingdom of Eliphaz.

Parking lot.

And fetch the amulet of Kokun
from our transport,

at the battle of Evermore.

592
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,422
So go to the parking lot
to get something you forgot.

Attention

00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,409
My lady?

658
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:24,120
All I'm saying is we'll be taken
more seriously if we refer to

659
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,522
ourselves as sprites.

660
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:27,056
Can we please stay
in character?

661
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:28,725
You guys sound like
a bunch of little girls.

662
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:31,127
If anyone would know
about little girls...
Okay.

663
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,530
I tried to handle this in
private, but if you wanna

664
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:36,065
do this here now, standing in
the woods, dressed like fucking

665
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,834
fairies, so be it.

666
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:41,104
Lo, perhaps thou art
having thine monthlies.

667
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,505
Out of game.

668
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:44,174
Out of game?
Okay.

669
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,509
Fine-- What the hell's your
problem?

670
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:48,611
You're the one who
wanted to experiment.

671
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,980
Don't blame me if you can't
handle the consequences.

672
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,916
It was fine as long as it
was all about you,

673
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,617
but heaven
forbid I enjoy it.

674
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,719
You saw her without me.

675
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,688
That wasn't part
of the deal.

676
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,858
I'm heading
back to camp.
Go.

677
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,159
Someday someone's gonna tear
your heart out and you'll

678
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,930
know exactly how I feel.

679
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,731
Sprites!

680
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,099
Let's fly.

681
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,638
You look like one of those...

682
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,641
freaky vampire LARPers.

683
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,751
Maybe we should
stick together.

684
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,720
Maybe.

685
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:21,538
(moaning)

686
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,697
(screaming)

687
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,149
As you approach the Exalted
Township of Valinore, you notice

688
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:09,752
that your own path intersects
with another.

689
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,060
Sir Hung, he is
rustling just across the way.

690
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:21,064
I can hear the breeze
on my skin.

691
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:22,765
'Tis burnt orange.

692
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,134
-- English.

693
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:26,336
The fuck's
he saying?

694
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:27,737
I don't know.

695
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:31,841
There is electricity
in the air.

696
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,676
Okay, Ronny, so if he goes
insane, can I inherit his

697
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:35,378
experience points?
You're obsessed
with experience points.

698
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,013
No, let's not talk
about that now.

699
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:38,214
I'm just saying,
that's a waste of experience.

700
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:39,616
I can use it.

701
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:43,319
Kill thy cowardly
tongue.

702
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:44,954
Oh, holy shit.

703
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,826
(Hung)
Prepare thineself
for battle, wench.

704
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:51,661
Do I know you?

705
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:53,096
All right, Hung, I don't know
what you're on, but I think

706
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:54,297
it's clouding your judgment.

707
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,698
She looks--

708
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,333
Nay, game master.

709
00:43:57,335 --> 00:44:01,404
The scales have finally
fallen from mine eyes.

710
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,847
Miss, are you okay?

711
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,048
Have you been
in an accident?

712
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,249
'Tis no accident!

713
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,251
Go no closer!

714
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:19,922
Although I have gazed upon thy
visage before, 'tis only by the

715
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:26,262
light of yon moon has thou true
nature revealed itself!

716
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,664
Okay, Hung, ease up
there, buddy.

717
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:28,998
I think she
really needs some help.

718
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,900
Excuse me, my lady, do you
really need some help?

719
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:34,937
Fuck you and the moustache you
rode in on!

720
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,346
(Ronny)
Oh, fuck!

721
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,214
I'm... outta here.

722
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:13,476
'Tis a cruel act of the gods to
waste such a sweet backside...

723
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:16,212
on such a filthy beast.

724
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,150
(screaming)

725
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,855
It gets me
every time.

726
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,101
The noise came from
around here somewhere.

727
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:20,870
Just keep
your wits.

728
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,480
Oh God.

729
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,186
Oh lord, he's dead.

730
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,363
Oh shit.

731
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:51,968
What the
hell?

732
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,438
I don't understand.

733
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,240
All right, we
gotta keep going.

734
00:47:57,242 --> 00:48:01,110
We gotta get Eric, your crazy
cousin and call the cops.

735
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:06,115
What was that?

736
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,654
Shit.

737
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,559
Joe, what are
you doing?

738
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,594
There's someone
in there.

739
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:20,563
I know, that's what
I'm worried about.

740
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,224
You're not sing,
Joe, are you?

741
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:49,492
What?

742
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:51,494
Tell me you're
not gonna sing.

743
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,999
Not right now, baby.

744
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,179
No, no, no.

745
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:13,182
No, no,
no, no!

746
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:14,383
(Gwen)
Gunther!

747
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:15,584
Gunther!

748
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:17,153
Ease up!

749
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:19,221
Stay your hand,
mighty warlord.

750
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,092
Evil has
befallen him.

751
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,460
His handiwork is
all around us.

752
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,966
We heard you and we thought it
might be whoever... did this.

753
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,510
Where's Ronny?

754
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,646
Lando?

755
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,715
Do not enter.

756
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:48,651
One cannot
cheat death forever.

757
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,462
This is
not good.

758
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,369
Joe, what the fuck
is going on here?

759
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:07,570
I don't know
what's going on.

760
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:08,771
But I want to
talk to Ronny.

761
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,172
Ronny?

762
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:13,042
You think Ronny is
responsible for this?

763
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:14,710
What am I supposed
to think?

764
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:17,413
You guys and your
quest for authenticity.

765
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:18,614
Oh, come--

766
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,016
Real weapons.

767
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,450
In-game bullshit.

768
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:22,651
Archaic
books.

769
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:25,454
Ugh, the evil
book again, huh?

770
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:28,024
It would surprise me not,
wizard, if thou has not brought

771
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:31,060
forth something vile and unholy,
a pox upon mankind.

772
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:36,065
Gunther!

773
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:38,067
We're out of
game here, man.

774
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:40,369
Somebody tell me what
the hell's going on here.

775
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,039
Hell, indeed,
is going on.

776
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,774
The wizard
has summoned evil.

777
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,444
And most likely while they
apprentice was in the circle,

778
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:49,645
he has been made unholy.

779
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:51,280
Gunther.

780
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:53,215
I cannot tell you
whether 'twas man or beast,

781
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,285
but I can tell you surely
it was not Jobryeth.

782
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:58,087
We need to get
out of here.

783
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:02,124
What we need to do is avenge the
poor souls taken here this eve.

784
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:03,793
With what?

785
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:05,528
Foam sticks?

786
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,129
Jobryeth
is right.

787
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:13,436
We need weapons from my
private reserve of steel.

788
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:16,439
Thou speakests
sense.

789
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:20,309
Let us return
to camp.

790
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:23,679
And arm
ourselves.

791
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:29,685
While they call for
help...reinforcements.

792
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,392
Very well.

793
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:38,394
I am
watching you.

794
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:41,530
We all feel safer
for that.

795
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,538
(Ronny)
Oh fuckity fuck.

796
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:57,847
Get a hold
of yourself, man.

797
00:51:57,849 --> 00:51:59,381
Get a hold of
yourself, man!

798
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,450
What the fuck
was that, man?

799
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,119
Oh my God,
she was not normal!

800
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:07,223
She was like some kind
of she-beast from the--

801
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:09,859
Oh, my sweet shit.

802
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:11,727
Oh my sweet,
sweet shit.

803
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:13,362
Eric, you fucking asshole.

804
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:15,664
I have to
warn him.

805
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:16,899
Where the fuck am I?

806
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,474
They suck
at making maps!

807
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,144
Where the hell am I!

808
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,648
Why is there
no one here?

809
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,350
Shouldn't
someone be here?

810
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:36,552
Come on, the best way for us
to help is to drive somewhere

811
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:37,753
and get some.

812
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:39,421
That's not what
was agreed upon.

813
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:41,490
We were to seek vengeance.

814
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,725
Where are
the weapons?

815
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,696
Weapons are
in here, okay?

816
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:49,398
Now come on,
let's go.

817
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,442
Where the fuck
is my phone?

818
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:02,244
Anyone?

819
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,448
Sweet Jesus,
man.

820
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,783
Sorry, dude.

821
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:11,220
There's some weird shit
going on out there, man.

822
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:12,454
Oh... kay.

823
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:13,656
We gotta
call 9-1-1.

824
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:14,957
Do you have
a cell phone?

825
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:17,259
9-1-1 is just gonna
route a cell call.

826
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:20,596
What you ought to do is call
the Sky Valley Sheriff directly.

827
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:23,332
I can get the number.

828
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,334
Call Sky
Valley Sheriff.

829
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:28,671
(dialing)

830
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,441
(phone ringing)

831
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:36,212
(man)
Sky Valley Sheriff.

832
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:38,347
<i>(Gwen)</i>
<i>There's been an accident at</i>
<i>the state park campgrounds.</i>

833
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:39,648
<i>You gotta get here</i>
<i>as soon as you can.</i>

834
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,317
(man)
Hold up now--
What kind of accident?

835
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:42,751
<i>Well, there's this</i>
<i>LARP event going on--</i>

836
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:43,953
Wait a minute, LARP like,
like dressed up like wizards

837
00:53:43,955 --> 00:53:45,354
and shit?

838
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:46,555
<i>Yeah, like that.</i>

839
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,357
<i>But this</i>
<i>is serious.</i>

840
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:49,558
<i>It wasn't just one of those</i>
<i>paintballer pranks,</i>

841
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,759
<i>people are in danger.</i>

842
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:51,961
You stay put.

843
00:53:51,963 --> 00:53:53,362
We'll be
right there.

844
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:54,597
<i>Oh, thank god.</i>

845
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,366
Tommy!

846
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:58,834
Tommy, get your
ass up.

847
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:00,536
We gotta get going.

848
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,878
Hey, Randy.

849
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,547
Rise and shine,
buddy.

850
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:14,250
We got a cold dish of
get back that needs serving.

851
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:15,551
Get your cousin and
get your gear.

852
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:17,553
Imma pick
you up in 10.

853
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,866
(man)
Whoa, this does not look
like regulation game play.

854
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:33,636
Are you guys out
of game or not?

855
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:37,339
We're so far outta
game, we're somehow back in it.

856
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:39,541
I thought you said
there were bodies.

857
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:40,943
What are you guys up to?

858
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,544
Where be the
game master?

859
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:45,414
Where be our hordes
for glorious combat?

860
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:47,750
Everyone else completed their
mission and camped out

861
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:49,518
on the battlefield.

862
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,789
Are you guys gonna camp
or just stay up all night?

863
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,592
I must fight the evil
at its source!

864
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,460
No!

865
00:54:58,462 --> 00:54:59,995
Gunther!

866
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:02,765
(yelling)

867
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,533
You guys are
on another planet.

868
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,702
You know drugs are
off-limit out here.

869
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:08,037
How far's the
battlefield?

870
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:09,438
Ronny Kwok's gonna
hear about this.

871
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,639
How far!

872
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:11,840
Take it easy.

873
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,676
Halfway
through the forest.

874
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,577
I'm out.

875
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:16,845
Great.

876
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:18,347
Now can we get
the hell out of here?

877
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,548
You kidding?

878
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,783
We can't leave
Gunther.

879
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,322
No.

880
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:27,890
Joe.

881
00:55:27,892 --> 00:55:29,725
Goddamn it, Joe!

882
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,836
Hey, what
is that?

883
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,843
Are they... I think
they're...

884
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,948
...is that Eddie?

885
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,989
Beth?

886
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,460
Beth!

887
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:06,862
Holy shit, that's
your psychotic girlfriend?

888
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,630
Ex-girlfriend.

889
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:15,437
This is so
fucked up.

890
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,708
Guys.

891
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,611
Dude, what...

892
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:25,914
Hey.

893
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,660
I'll tell you what I see.

894
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:39,895
Tell you what
I see.

895
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,497
A warrior.
Warrior.

896
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:43,699
Who can't let go
of his past.

897
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:44,933
Oh shit.

898
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:47,736
This has something to do with
the photo of me and Beth

899
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:48,937
at Prom.

900
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,139
(Eric)
What?

901
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:52,174
In the book,
the fucking eBay book, man.

902
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:53,575
What?

903
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,043
Get the fuck out, man.

904
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:57,813
No, I had the photo with me
when you summoned this...

905
00:56:57,815 --> 00:57:00,516
whatever this
is with the book.

906
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:01,750
Eric, use the book to
send that bitch back wherever

907
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,951
she came from!

908
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:04,153
I don't know how?

909
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:07,790
I just picked a page
at random earlier.

910
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:09,825
Well then,
just pick another...

911
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:12,895
pick another page
and hurry the fuck up.

912
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:14,963
(Speaks foreign language)

913
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,165
Sing it.

914
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:17,633
Sing it, wizard.

915
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:22,971
(Sings in foreign language)

916
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:45,761
(Eric)
That was for Hung!

917
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:46,962
Take that, bitch!

918
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,163
That was--

919
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:51,233
served by Eric
the Enchanter.

920
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:54,937
What?

921
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:56,138
You just let
her get away.

922
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,973
Excuse me?

923
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,775
She just went off into the woods
to die like a wounded animal.

924
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:00,976
(Ronny)
Gimme the book.

925
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,177
Fuck!

926
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,012
God.

927
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:05,848
This is the "Sigillum Aemeth."
Where did you get this book?

928
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,049
Uh, why?

929
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:08,484
Shut up,
never mind.

930
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,490
Did you read
this page?

931
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,659
Um.

932
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,861
Why?

933
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:20,062
Did you read it?

934
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:21,263
Yes, yes!

935
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:22,965
Holy fuck, yes.

936
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:26,235
We read it and it scared that
crazy chick back to hell

937
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:28,036
or wherever the
fuck she came from.

938
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:30,539
If that doesn't get me to level
27, I don't know what will,

939
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:31,740
Kwok, so why
don't you pony up.

940
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:33,242
No, no,
no, no, no, okay.

941
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:34,643
That all makes sense.

942
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:35,844
(Joe)
It makes no sense.

943
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,045
It's gibberish--

944
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:38,580
It makes sense!

945
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:40,048
It makes sense that
you speak Enochian.

946
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,250
Enochian, what?

947
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:43,151
You made
that up.

948
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:46,188
This is the "Sigillum Aemeth."
It is the only one of its kind.

949
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,224
It was handwritten in the 16th
Century by the mystic John Dee

950
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,593
and it has been
lost for generations.

951
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:52,961
Uh, bullshit.

952
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:55,264
It came from the internets,
not the 16th Century.

953
00:58:55,266 --> 00:58:58,066
If you're trying to get out
of admitting how awesome I am--

954
00:58:58,068 --> 00:59:01,570
John Dee was trying to summon
angels, but evil travels under

955
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:04,006
its own power and he actually
summoned demons

956
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:06,708
and the demons
forged this book.

957
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,143
What are you
saying, Kwok?

958
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:10,846
Dee tried to destroy,
but he couldn't.

959
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:13,916
So he sealed it and he hid it
deep underneath his manor estate

960
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:16,051
and it has been lost
for generations.

961
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:20,656
But here it is in your
incapable hands and you summoned

962
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:22,858
a succubus from hell!

963
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,828
(gasping)

964
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:38,273
And then this lat passage
that you read,

965
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:40,709
the herald of Abominog.

966
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:45,280
And in the language lay the name
of the hell lord Abominog and

967
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:49,851
I hath spoken the name
and hell has raineth down.

968
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:52,588
(growling)

969
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,894
You didn't injure it,
you ignorant fuck!

970
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:00,662
You transformed it!

971
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:07,269
Sorry.

972
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:11,039
Transformed into
what exactly?

973
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,989
What?

974
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:28,724
What the fuck
was that?

975
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:31,360
I don't know.

976
01:00:31,362 --> 01:00:34,162
Ronny Kwok's dragon!

977
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:36,031
Shit, shit!

978
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,634
Oh my God,
we overslept again.

979
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:39,835
It's time for Evermore.

980
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:41,770
Come on.
Grab the fucking horn.

981
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:44,072
The thing eats
