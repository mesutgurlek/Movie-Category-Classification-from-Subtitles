When dreams occur.

165
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,495
Right.

166
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,331
I mean, I know one
or two things, Doctor DeVries.

167
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,376
I have some more things
to show you.

168
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:36,090
So, what goes on
in this section?

169
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,925
Well, one of our
areas of research

170
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:39,260
is sexual dysfunction.

171
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,054
If a man is experiencing
impotency, we can determine

172
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,515
whether the cause is physical
or psychological

173
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,016
by monitoring his sleep.

174
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,185
Mm-hmm? How's that?

175
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:49,478
Well, if it isn't physical,

176
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,981
he'll experience
three or four erections

177
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,482
during the course of the night.

178
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:54,859
I see.

179
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,612
So, Jane, what you do here,
in effect, is count boners.

180
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,076
I can see you're going to be
a real challenge to work with.

181
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,453
Oh, wait a minute, Doctor.

182
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,705
I haven't agreed
to anything yet.

183
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,641
Doctor DeVries,
may I speak to you right away?

184
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,042
All right.
I'll just be a moment.

185
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:09,308
MAN: Hello, Alex.
You're a bit late.

186
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,770
Novotny, I should have known.

187
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,481
You're nine years too late.

188
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,775
You left me sitting in Chicago

189
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:21,362
with an overheated
bio-feedback machine.

190
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,738
I got tied up.

191
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:25,107
Well, I didn't mind too much
that you walked out on me,

192
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,409
you could have at least let me
know you were alive.

193
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:28,911
I was worried.

194
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,622
About me or your research grant?

195
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,625
Both.

196
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,168
I would apologize, but...

197
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,546
we both know I'm not
very good at that.

198
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,464
That's okay.
It's a long time ago.

199
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:41,465
It's good to see you.

200
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:43,801
It's good to see you, too.

201
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,487
Do you think next time you could
spare me

202
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,511
the cloak-and-dagger act?

203
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,515
Oh, you mean you would have
come if I just called?

204
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,600
No.

205
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,311
Nice place you got here.

206
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,147
Who's your decorator,
Darth Vader?

207
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,733
Come on, we need to talk, Alex.

208
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,485
How about some dinner in the
Village?

209
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:02,694
A couple of drinks, okay?

210
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:03,862
All right.

211
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:08,325
But before you spring for the
check, I just want you to know,

212
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,262
I have no intention of spending
the next six months

213
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,454
with electrodes wired to my ass.

214

Don't worry, Alex.

215
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,893
I can always have you
dropped back into your life

216
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,295
of playing the horses
and hustling the women.

217
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,505
I wouldn't dream of standing in
the way

218
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,465

219

You sound
as if you don't approve.

220

You're damn right, I don't.

221
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,723
You've got
tremendous gifts, Alex,

222
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,059
and you've chosen
to piss them away.

223
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,645
Anything else?

224
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,522
No. That's it.

228

- Let's play a little game.
- All right, it's your party.

229
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:15,184
Let's pretend that a man,
with a little help from science,

230
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,228
could psychically
project himself

231
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,690
inside the dream
of a sleeping person.

232
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,901
Okay, let's pretend that.

233
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,990
Then, pretend
that once inside the dream,

234
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,786
he could become an active
participant in it. Hmm?

235
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,623
You could actually be there,
right in the middle.

236
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,961
You could feel the dream,
experience it.

237
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:46,966
Even shape and alter
the dream itself. Hmm?

238
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,343
What would you say
to a notion like that?

239
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,930
That it's crazy.

240
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,726
You see, we've done it, Alex.

241
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,521
Not once, but three times.

242
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,357
Using two men with abilities
in telepathy,

243
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,025
just similar to your own.

244
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,611
Going into
another person's dream?

245
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,155
I might have to see that
to believe it.

246
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,991
Not very much to see.

247
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:16,161
Just two men with their heads
wired up to a machine.

248
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,623
Because the real trick
takes place up here.

249
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,834
That piece of science fiction
hardware you got,

250
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,043
that's the hook up, right?

251
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,712
That's right.

252
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,798
But all the machine does is
help connect your brainwaves

253
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,425
with the dreamer's.

254
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,344
But, hopefully, once you
get proficient at dreamlink,

255
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,889
you won't even need the machine.

256
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,183
Why me?

257
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,392
Why you?

258
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:42,271
Because you have a head start
on the rest of us mortals.

259
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,441
You can already work your way
into the conscious mind.

260
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:49,528
When the conditions are right,
maybe with a little help,

261
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,156
you could also get inside
the subconscious mind.

262
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,867
To the Dreamscape!

263
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,202
You got two guys
that have already done this?

264
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,079
You'll meet them.

265
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:04,501
Look, Alex, you don't have
to decide right this minute.
