1
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:11,819
A German folk tale

2
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,473
Behold!

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:13,312
The portals of darkness are open, and the
shadows of the dead hunt over the Earth...

4
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:04,877
"Back! Hold! Why dost thou scourge
mankind with War, Plague, Famine?!"

5
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,860
"The Earth is mine!"

6
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:21,429
"Never will the Earth be thine:
Man belongs to God!"

7
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,996
"Look below!"

8
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,056
"All things in heaven and on Earth

9
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:53,279
are wonderful!

10
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:56,494
But the greatest wonder

11
00:02:56,606 --> 00:02:59,606
is man's freedom to choose

12
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:05,375
between good and evil!"

13
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,032
"Dost thou know Faust?"

14
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,337
"A knave like all others!
He preaches good and does evil!

15
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:36,417
He seeks to turn
base metal into gold!

16
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,397
Behold his greed!"

17
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:53,193
"A wager: I will wrest
Faust's soul away from God!"

18
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,316
"If thou canst destroy what is divine

19
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:08,108
in Faust, the Earth is thine!"

20
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,070
"No man can resist evil!
The bet is on!"

21
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,593
"The Plague! The Plague!"

22
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,418
The devastating pestilence raged:

23
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:32,658
in a few days half the town lay dying.

24
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,350
To find a cure for the Plague,

25
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,167
Faust spent day and night

26
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:20,031
in prayer with God.

27
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:43,199
And there was a great cry in Egypt, for
there was not a house without its dead.

28
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,870
"Lord God, bless this act of redemption!

29
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:04,208
Only you can alleviate our misery!"

30
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:50,286
"Help... help!
My mother is dying!"

31
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:24,569
Mortal terror and fear of death
swept through the town.

32
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:46,079
"Repent, fast, pray!
Only Faith can vanquish death!"

33
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:27,129
"Have respect for the dead!"

34
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:38,341
"We still live, we still love! We shall
die dancing in each other's arms!"

35
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:52,523
"Who has faith shall live!
But death will take the sinners!"

36
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:12,235
"The Plague! The Plague!"

37
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:14,988
"Compassion, Faust!
Only you can help us!"

38
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,197
"Get hence! We are lost!
No faith is any help.

39
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:26,115
No knowledge is any help.
All is vanity... "

40
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:15,834
Mine God, thou art merciful
and a great goodness.

41
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:53,731
The third great Key
to the Force of the Ghost of Hell.

42
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:14,313
And if thou would summon the Prince of
Darkness to aid thee and give thee

43
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:22,572
all the might and glory of the world, go to
a crossroad and call on him three times.

44
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:02,515
"I invoke thy aid,
Spirit of Darkness: show thyself!"

45
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,929
"Come forth, demon of evil!"

46
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,958
"As thou art called with
thy unholy name:

47
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,579
MEPHISTO
appear!"

48
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,112
"You have summoned me!"

49
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,034
"Here I am!"

50
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,265
I renounce God and his heavenly legion,
and so shall be mine

51
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:36,755
the power and glory of the world.

52
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,999
"Be gone from me, Satan!"

53
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,228
"To have the power to help
for only one day!"

54
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:27,289
"One day! Try it!
Just one trial day!"

55
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,355
"When the hour-glass has run out... "

56
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:50,896
"... you go free, the Pact
canceled! Sign!"

57
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,809
glory... power

58
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,895
"Can you help the hungry
and the sick?"

59
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:47,876
"What you wish I will perform: you are
the master and I am your servant. "

60
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,749
"A drop of blood!"

61
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:44,112
"Blood is quite
a remarkable substance!"

62
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,473
"Only for one day?"

63
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,948
"Until the sand has run out!"

64
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,108
"Faust! Help us!"

65
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,434
"Then I shall help
in the devil's name!"

66
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,632
"A miracle! A miracle!"

67
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:31,254
"In the name of Christ crucified,
help my child!"

68
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,534
"He cannot look upon
the Holy Cross!"

69
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:59,394
"He is in league with the devil!
Stone him! Stone him!"

70
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,715
"Deliver me, elixir of death!"

71
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:19,135
"You may not cheat me! Remember
our pact: the trial day is not over yet. "

72
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,738
"Death sets all men free!"

73
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,008
"Is that death?"

74
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:57,890
"It is life, Faust, seducing you with
the fair image of your youth. "

75
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:23,171
"Wretched Faust, why do you seek
death? You have not yet lived!"

76
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,289
"I despise my life!"

77
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:41,818
"Your life was only the dust and
mold of books! Pleasure is all!"

78
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,813
"I am too old!"

79
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:07,059
"I offer you the greateast
happiness: youth! Seize it!"

80
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,339
"Give me youth!"

81
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,616
"I've caught you, old boy!"

82
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,253
"Take me to her!"

83
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,615
"Step upon my cloak... "

84
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,255
"... and the spinning Earth
will spread before you!"

85
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:50,650
"The wedding feast for the Duchess of
Parma, the most beautiful woman in Italy!"

86
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,573
"Strange guests!"

87
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:09,571
"To pay tribute to the highest beauty, my
lord brings you his kingdom's treasures!"

88
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:56,510
"The day is over! The sand has run out!
Be as you were!"

89
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,157
"Youth... Leave me youth!"

90
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,793
"Our pact stands for eternity?"

91
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:35,911
"You have tasted all of life's pleasures, Faust! From indulgence
to indulgence, sensation without end, yet nothing satisfied you!"

92
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:54,152
"What will you: a woman, a game of chance, an orgy?
Whatever you wish, I must grant!"

93
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,075
"Do you want the Emperor's crown?"

94
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,238
"Home!"

95
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,628
"Take me home! And at once!"

96
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:22,474
"Is today a feast day in your town?"

97
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:36,590
"Are you heathen born that you have never heard
of Holy Easter?"

98
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:50,114
"It is as if life had stood still:
All is as it once was!"

99
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:43,270
"An innocent little girl, running to a priest...
she is not for you!"

100
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:39,709
"Tedeum laudamus
Praise the Lord. "

101
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,593
"Vacation, mother!"

102
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,070
"I know more obliging wenches.
for you here!"

103
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:05,275
"I want only her.
Do as I command!"

104
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,719
"Brother Valentin!"

105
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:20,430
"Once she has this little golden chain in the
house she will begin to feel the devil's power!"

106
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,999
"Good gracious, how pretty you are!"

107
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,679
"Any lovers yet?"

108
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,317
"What have you, child?"

109
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:16,957
"Tell the mother of God,
if you cannot tell me!"

110
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:52,314
"May I visit Aunt Marthe?"

111
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,995
Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein

112
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:26,037
"Three little drops from this love potion by night
and all the girls' hearts will be yours!"

113
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:57,075
"Look Aunt Marthe what I found
in my drawer... "

114
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,869
"A rich treasure!"

115
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,838
"I found it in my jewelry box!"

116
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:43,829
"Just once let me try on
the beautiful necklace!"

117
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:30,629
"A small bouquet for the bridegroom,
a little wreath for the bride!"

118
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:07,589
"Pardon, lovely lady.
I seek Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein!"

119
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:52,078
"From your cousin...
from Lombardy...!"

120
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:09,149
"He gave me this necklace
as a gift for you!"

121
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:54,909
"Those we encircle within this ring
shall be sweethearts...!"

122
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:03,879
"One, two, three.
Makes you free!"

123
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,192
"Pardon: my stomach is too weak
for such a fiery drink!"

124
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:45,594
"Permit, that I mix myself a litle drink
as I learned it in Padua!"

125
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:17,399
"My friend, a prince of the noblest blood!"

126
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,394
"He loves me...

127
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,954
...loves me not...

128
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,190
...loves me... "

129
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:10,759
"Yes, with all his heart he loves you!"

130
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,317
"She loves me... "

131
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,153
"She loves me not. "

132
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,434
"She loves you!"

133
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,152
"I am yours forever!"

134
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,720
"He loves me!"

135
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:54,829
"What are you waiting for?
Your sweetheart herself lights the way for you!"

136
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,398
"Cursed matchmaker!"

137
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:06,833
"I will keep the brother out of the way!"

138
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:52,955
"To the prettiest girl in town!"

139
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:03,469
"No other girl is as pretty as your sister:
long live Gretchen!"

140
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,714
"A pretty girl is not pure!"

141
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,273
"Here's to Gretchen!"

142
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,954
"Here's to your Gretchen!"

143
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:38,875
"If you hurry you can catch her lover
before he slips out of her room. "

144
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,308
"Flee!... Flee!... you have murdered him!"

145
01:22:58,640 --> 01:22:59,834
"Murder!"

146
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,074
"Murder... murder!"

147
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:28,995
"Murder... Murder... Murder!"

148
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:46,749
"Flee!... Flee! The deputes
already seek the murderer!"

149
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:21,389
"Touch me not, you wanton,
your lover has slain me!"

150
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:39,230
"First read a requiem. Mass for me!
Then to the stocks with this harlot!"

151
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,675
"Gretchen... Gretchen!"

152
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:38,910
"Now death and nature with surprise Behold the trembling
sinners rise To meet the Judge's searching eyes. "

153
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:56,749
"For now before the Judge severe
No crime can pass unpunished here. "

154
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,474
"All hidden things must plain appear. "

155
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,790
"Mother! Mother!"

156
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:20,914
"And has born a little child
in the depth of winter. "

157
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:43,869
"Have mercy on my child!"

158
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:53,760
"Are you not Gretchen, who stood in the stocks?"

159
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:29,108
"Mercy! Mercy! My child is dying!"

160
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:04,878
"She has killed her child!
Seize her, the murderess!"

161
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:14,119
"Faust... Faust... help your Gretchen!"

162
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,239
"Mephisto!"

163
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:39,509
"You have betrayed me!
She suffers! She suffers!"

164
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:50,870
"To the stake with the child murderer!"

165
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:05,718
"Save her, save Gretchen!"

166
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:15,514
"Too late! Even now they build her funeral pyre!"

167
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:25,915
"You are still my servant!
Bring me to her, or the pact is broken!"

168
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:36,718
"My steed awaits!
Quick, before morning comes!"

169
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:09,799
"Faster! Faster!"

170
01:40:45,800 --> 01:41:00,431
"Oh had I never wished for youth, that brought this misery!
Curse... curse the delusion of youth!"

171
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:31,189
"You have yourself cursed youth!
What you wish I must grant!"

172
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:17,313
"Be as you were: an old man!"

173
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:35,879
"Forgive... forgive me my sin!"

174
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,998
"Gretchen!"

175
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:38,799
"Here is no place for thee!"

176
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:44,874
"I claim my wager!"

177
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:52,669
"One Word breaks thy pact!"

178
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:58,111
"Tell me the Word!"

179
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:21,993
"The Word that wings joyfully throughout the universe, The Word that appeases every pain and
grief, The Word that expiates all human guilt, the Eternal Word... dost thou not know it?"

180
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:28,071
"Tel me the Word!"

181
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:40,109
Love

182
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:08,756
THE END
