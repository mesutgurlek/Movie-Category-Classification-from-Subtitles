1
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,076
(Screaming) Josh!

2
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,068
I'm Kurt Loderwith MTV news.
The Film is The BlairWitch Project.

3
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,594
One ofthe scariestFilms
of alltime...

4
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,478
- I was terrified.
- Oh, it scared me to death...

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,558
armed with a 16mm camera
and a video camcorder

6
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,029
head into the Black Hills forests
of Maryland

7
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,350
to make a movie
about a legendary witch

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,590
..and they're never heard from again

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,592
There's no doubt about
the box-office success.

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,592
What's not clear
is whetherthe legend is true.

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,069
Fans are not only flocking
to the multiplex,

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,470
People have started coming
to Burkittsville

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,030
as if itwere Charles Manson's
The Spahn Ranch,

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,557
or Ed Gein the serial Killer's house,
to visit a haunted place.

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,790
'Burkittsville isn't a haunted place.

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,599
'it's a place that a fictional movie
was set in.'

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,159
I wasn't able to see the movei

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,992
when it came out, because I was...

19
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,832
in the hospital.

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,070
But as soon as they let me out,

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,311
I was atthe movie theatre
seventeen times in a rom.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,472
The web-site sold me.
The web-site, you know...

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,074
has allthese police photos,

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,799
and official police things,

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,029
all this information,

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,314
you really believe it.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,516
Our stick men sold so well
on the internet

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,875
that we started selling them
in the yard.

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,439
Somebody came by to buy them

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,794
and they wanted rocks.

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,075
So we got rocks
out of my rock garden,

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,118
but I didn't want to get rid of them
so he offered me $10

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,270
after he started booting it up more.

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,272
His wife really wanted them,
so we sold them to him.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,476
We sold some on the internet
but not many.

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,312
It costs too much to ship a rock.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,439
Everybody that comes is like this.
I'm so used to being videoed.

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,159
I make sure, if I go to my car,
or to get the paper,

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,198
that I at least have full makeup on,
and a great night-gown.

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,919
I wish that they'd used
a fictitious town,

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,230
and possibly thought ahead

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,357
toward what type
of repercussions could come

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,954
from using the word documentary

44
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,237
in their advertising,
and on their web-site.

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,551
Get out of these woods, and go home!

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,789
There was no goddamn Blair Witch!

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,759
You know, there are a lot of
naysayers who come and say nay,

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,628
but then there is supporters who
come up to my town, come up to me.

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,638
They run up to me, they stop...
Hey, Selena!

50
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,395
They come over to me, they hug me,
and say, "Dude, I know it's real,"

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,438
and they squeeze me, and I say,
"I know it's real, too,"

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,476
and we have a bond.

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,519
I say, "I know, and they go,
I know, man," and I go, "I know".

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,193
(Screaming)

55
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,836
You think you're a wise ass?

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,070
I didn't do anything wrong!

57
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,116
(Yelling)

58
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,793
Enough!

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,035
# And I'm a black rainbow
and I'm ape of God

60
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
# I got a face that's made
for violence upon

61
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,275
# I'm a teen distortion,
survived abortion

62
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,955
# A rebel from the waist down

63
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,552
# Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

64
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,116
# Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

65
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,636
# I wanna thank you, Mom
I wanna thank you, Dad

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,235
# For bringing this fuckin' world
to an end

67
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,869
# I never really hated a one true god

68
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,713
# But the god of the people I hated

69
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,395
# You say you wanted evolution

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,313
# The ape was a great big hit

71
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,870
# You say you want a revolution, man

72
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,396
# And I say that you're full of shit

73
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,316
# We're disposable teens
we're disposable teens

74
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,517
# We're disposable teens
we're disposable

75
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,149
# We're disposable teens
we're disposable teens

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,152
# We're disposable teens
we're disposable

77
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,357
# You say you wanted evolution

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,635
# The ape was a great big hit

79
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,837
# You say you want a revolution, man

80
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,798
# And I say that you're full of shit

81
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,438
# Yeah, yeah, yeah!

82
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,512
# Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

83
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,799
# Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah... #

84
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,916
(Music fades)

85
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,751
They found blood in the van.

86
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,310
# Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! #

87
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,152
(Woman) Could you turn that down?

88
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,756
(Man) I'm just trying to set the mood
for the mission.

89
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,229
That's sweet,
but I feel like I'm gonna toss.

90
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,437
- She's been feeling queasy.
- No need to explain.

91
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,556
Your comfort is my concern.

92
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,110
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for Stephen Ryan Parker,

93
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,317
who has three names,
so he must be from Boston.

94
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,279
Apparently he's here researching
a book with his girlfriend.

95
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,557
- The book's title is...
- Blair Witch History Or Hysteria.

96
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,029
Hysteria Or History.

97
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,430
Why is it you guys can't get on
the same page about the witch?

98
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,556
We've always been misunderstood.

99
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,393
We embrace nature, not evil.

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,152
Thank you, Erica.

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,309
(Erica laughing)

102
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,437
Not only a hottie, but a real witch!

103
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,158
Blessed be.

104
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,949
Wiccan... Wicc it good. (Laughing)

105
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,429
(Stephen) Wait,
why are we slowing down?

106
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,433
This is where your other tour mate
wants to meet. She's a little weird.

107
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,715
She thinks she's psychic
or some shit.

108
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,917
- When did you last talk to her?
- E-mail, two days ago.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,072
- Are you sure she'll be here?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,196
- Kim!
- Kim?

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,554
Yo.

112
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,154
Is that her?

113
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,992
Kim?

114
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,996
- Yeah.
- I'm Jeff.

115
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,116
I figured.

116
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,113
- What are you doing there?
- Trying to find the energy.

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,156
Inside the grave?

118
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,550
To stand up. I'm exhausted.
I've been on the road two days.

119
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,200
- Want a hand?
- I want amphetamines.

120
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,272
Weed is what I've got,
beer I'm gonna get.

121
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,316
Both - now.

122
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,156
(Jeff) That's right, friends.

123
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,356
For two luxurious days and nights,

124
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,831
my friends, you will walk the same
path the witch herself once walked,

125
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,232
sleep on the same soil where
her victims' blood was spilled.

126
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,355
Possibly losing your own souls
in the process.

127
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,989
I want to thank you all
for coming on the inaugural tour

128
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,036
of the Blair Witch-Hunt.

129
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,315
- Inaugural?
- You've never done this?

130
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,358
- Never.
- That's not what your web-site said.

131
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,352
"Over 10,000 satisfied customers."

132
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,396
No, that's my web-store.

133
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,869
Stick men, t-shirts,
official Blair dirt.

134
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,518
Tours?

135
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,273
We're all virgins on this bus!

136
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,999
# Hang on

137
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,992
# I lost control

138
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,548
# Anyway

139
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,551
# I lost control

140
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,671
# Anyway... #

141
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,116
Here? You drove by a huge Safeway
two miles back.

142
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,512
That was in Burkittsville. I don't
shop there. I don't even piss there.

143
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,394
(Kim) Hell of a town you got here.

144
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,357
What century are they living in?

145
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,749
The gene pool's
a little shallow here.

146
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,399
Dive in,
you'll crack your skull open.

147
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,111
(Jeff) OK.

148
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,036
- Where are we going first?
- The ruins of Rustin Parr's house.

149
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,511
(Erica) That guy who heard
the voices to kill, right?

150
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,275
(Jeff) Yeah, seven little kids.
(Kim) I hear voices all the time.

151
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,512
(Cracking)

152
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,193
Do we need all this shit
for a walk in the woods?

153
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,999
The Blair Witch-Hunt
provides all amenities

154
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,755
while you risk certain death
and dismemberment.

155
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,912
- Give it up.
- What's with all this camera stuff?

156
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,996
To record all occult phenomena

157
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,231
that may manifest itself
in the course of the tour.

158
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,677
Damn, you're really running
Bullshit Central, aren't you?

159
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,514
If you don't believe in the witch,
why the hell did you bother to come?

160
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,989
I thought the movie was cool.

161
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,119
How much further?

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,760
- Couple more miles.
- Jesus!

163
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,799
- So how far along are you?
- What do you mean?

164
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,791
The baby. How many weeks?

165
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,989
- Six.
- You don't want to keep it, do you?

166
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,513
No.

167
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,513
- But Stephen wants the baby.
- Yes. How do you know?

168
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,079
I don't know.

169
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,357
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

170
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,796
(Jeff) Welcome to the Parr ruins,
ladies and gentlemen.

171
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,276
It's supposed to be
where they found Heather's footage.

172
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,954
(Tristen) These markings
are incredible.

173
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,395
(Erica) Ancient witches' alphabet.

174
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,789
(Stephen) Looks like recent graffiti.

175
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,151
(Tristen) They're so realistic.
It's a little scary.

176
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,959
Actually, some of these symbols
are positive.

177
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,039
Only those who don't understand
witchcraft would be afraid of them.

178
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,473
And remember, fear...

179
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,755
is the forerunner of failure.

180
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,073
OK.

181
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,310
What's the story with this tree?

182
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,038
What tree?

183
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,759
Look behind you.

184
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,073
(Jeff) Where the fuck
did this come from?

185
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,878
This was never here before.

186
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,916
Nice try, dude.

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,911
What does that mean?

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,037
Maybe you should drop the tree bit
from your next tour.

189
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,951
No, no, I'm not making this up.

190
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,553
- I need a beer.
- Me, too.

191
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,599
Hey, geniuses, explain to me
why a house built in 1826

192
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,159
was built around a tree.

193
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,233
This would have been sticking
straight through the living room.

194
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,436
Jeff, nobody's scared.

195
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,599
(Screaming)

196
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,476
(Erica) Evil intent in the ground,
may a release soon be found.

197
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,996
In peace, release the energy
that be from my magic.

198
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,640
Are you casting
some kind of evil spell?

199
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,712
Widdershins - Reversing the evil.

200
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,075
The first law of wicca
is 'Harm none'.

201
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,436
Cos whatever you do
is going to come back threefold.

202
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,873
The karma's a bitch.

203
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,078
- What are you really doing?
- Communing with Elly Kedward.

204
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,869
The Blair Witch? I thought you
embraced nature, not evil.

205
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,997
You don't understand.
Elly...was a good witch.

206
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,833
She was an earth child, like me.

207
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,517
She's gonna be my mentor.

208
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,114
- You've spoken with her?
- Not yet...

209
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,191
but I will.

210
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,918
That's why I'm here.

211
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,190
To shed my mortal coil...

212
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,191
and commune with Elly.

213
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,317
(Tristen) Have you ever seen
her picture?

214
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,277
I don't think there are any.

215
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,999
Stephen and I found one.
Check it out.

216
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,916
We think it was drawn
before they banished her from Blair.

217
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,115
Banished, my ass.

218
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,237
They dragged her into the woods
in the middle of winter,

219
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,356
and tied her
to a fucking tree to die.

220
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,319
You make her sound helpless. Can't
witches summon powerful energy?

221
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,029
We can...
but we still have to eat, shit,

222
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,031
and die like the rest of you.

223
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,680
We just look good doing it.

224
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,751
Why do you need all these cameras?

225
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,116
I'm personally hoping for
an Elly Kedward sighting.

226
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,714
I've got a big beta
for a quality master.

227
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,951
I got a night vision, an infrared,
a cute little mini dv,

228
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,712
handhelds for everyone...

229
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,712
and this baby can even do
frame-a-second time lapse.

230
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,917
If anything comes in for a visit,
we're gonna catch it.

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,434
May I have permission
to take this leaf?

232
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,912
Thank you.

233
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,594
(Erica) Evil intent in the ground,
may your release soon be found.

234
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,395
And peace release the energy
that be from my magic.

235
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,595
So mote it be.

236
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,877
Evil intent in the ground,
may your release soon be found.

237
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,032
And peace release the energy
that be from my magic.

238
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,599
So mote it be.

239
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,638
OK, wait... How many Heather Donahues
does it take

240
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,119
to screw in a light bulb?

241
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,077
- How many?
- Just one!

242
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,116
- (Laughter)
- Just one of them!

243
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,994
Do you know
what I could never figure out?

244
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,311
- What's that?
- Blair Witch Project, OK?

245
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,549
Two guys and a girl, sleeping
in the same tent night after night,

246
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,153
and no sex?

247
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,549
- It makes no sense.
- You're so right.

248
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,108
I mean, they were scared
out of their minds,

249
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,909
and the greatest stress reliever
right at their fingertips...

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,956
and nothing.

251
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,271
I'm a little stressed.

252
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,031
Try some more weed.

253
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,915
OK.

254
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,990
The Bermuda Triangle.

255
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,154
It's a place in the world
that's been created by hysteria,

256
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,950
by people's own psychology,
by their own ideas of the place.

257
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,395
We were already
a persecuted minority.

258
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,313
This whole Blair Witch thing
set us back 300 years.

259
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,597
We're back in the burning times.
It fucked up our image.

260
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,753
Erica, people fear what they don't
understand. You must realise that.

261
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,038
No shit. People think that I drink
blood, that I sacrifice children -

262
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,192
that I worship the devil
just because I'm a wiccan.

263
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,397
Where I come from, people think
because I dress in black,

264
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,869
I'm some kind of sick killer
or something.

265
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,430
I don't even believe in the devil.
OK?

266
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,115
That's a Christian concept.
I believe in nature.

267
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,031
I hate nature.

268
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,156
Myth, for me...right?

269
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,037
..is just myth.

270
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,399
It's not history, it's not metaphor
and it's definitely not the truth...

271
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,869
Stephen, stories like this happen

272
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,916
because they exist
in a place of truth

273
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,798
because there's historical evidence,
there's fact.

274
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,632
That's what you don't understand.

275
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,312
(Jeff) I want to make a film.

276
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,710
Wicca...A Way Of Life.

277
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,273
- Nice.
- Yeah.

278
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,351
Wait, wait... Check this out.

279
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,511
Look at everyone.

280
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,151
Everyone is obsessed
with the Blair Witch

281
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,549
for their own reasons, including us.

282
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,677
Goth...A Way Of Life.

283
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,751
A documentary on you.

284
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,229
All real, all video.

285
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,312
Video never lies, Kim.

286
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,118
Film does, though.

287
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,555
Everyone wants to see something.

288
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,915
I'm telling you,
hysteria and delusions,

289
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,116
they breed in situations like this.

290
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,351
Why are you applying rational thought
to mythology?

291
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,230
Because if people believe something
enough, isn't it real?

292
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,788
Perception is reality.

293
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,632
You're not listening to me.

294
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,110
Babe, I know what you're saying,
I just think it's bullshit.

295
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,670
I think you're being
a monomaniacal reductionist.

296
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,998
(Eerie shrieking)

297
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,718
What the hell was that?

298
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,038
I heard that, too.

299
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,028
Burkittsville's funniest home videos!

300
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,475
You scared the shit out of me, man!

301
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,074
It answered every single one
of your wet dreams.

302
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,832
What are you guys doing here?

303
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,229
We've got a tour group,
the Blair Witch Walk.

304
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,869
- What's your excuse?
- Tour group, the Blair Witch-Hunt.

305
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,033
You're supposed to look out for stuff
like this. This is so not happening!

306
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,395
We have jurisdiction.
We have permits.

307
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,436
Yeah? From Cravens? Let me see 'em.

308
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,397
- They're in the car.
- Bullshit!

309
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,075
Let's put it this way, one of us
is staying - it's us or you,

310
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,673
and it looks like us, bitch!

311
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,830
It's gonna come back at you
threefold.

312
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,433
- What?
- In the wiccan...

313
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,515
Shut up!

314
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,068
Your balls will fall off
in three days.

315
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,720
Yo, guys, guys,
I think I can settle this.

316
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,439
Just give us till dawn,
then we're out of here.

317
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,991
We're cold, we're tired...
and we're a little shook up.

318
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,038
We saw something
up at Coffin Rock today.

319
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,033
Yeah... Yeah, up at Coffin Rock.
It scared the shit out of us.

320
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,430
Guys, stop talking about it,
because I'm gonna freak.

321
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,317
I just want to go home.

322
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,834
Can we see this thing...

323
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,117
- Coffin Rock?
- Blair Witch? Go to Coffin Rock.

324
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,032
It's your money, Greta.

325
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,429
Next time,
take the Blair Witch Walk.

326
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,638
Next time, take the Blair Witch-Hunt.
Here's my card. Call. I'm on the web.

327
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,273
(Giggling)

328
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,636
They were never seen again.

329
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,154
Their footage
was found a year later...

330
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,470
underexposed, and useless.

331
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,871
I don't trust that these assholes
aren't coming back.

332
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,236
They're going to be pissed
that we took the foundation.

333
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,709
I don't think it's anything
to worry about.

334
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,315
Besides...
we're gonna be up all night, baby!

335
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,958
(Howling)

336
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,314
Giddy-up!

337
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,675
We'll just keep our eyes open.

338
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,398
They're not coming back.

339
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,436
Why do you think that?

340
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,190
I just do.

341
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,795
(Kim) I'll be back in a minute.

342
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,474
Up all night!

343
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,915
How do your parents feel...

344
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,716
about having a witch for a daughter?

345
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,079
My father is an Episcopal minister,
in a one-church-town

346
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,038
back in Munnsville, Illinois.

347
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,834
Yeah.

348
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,070
That's a bummer.

349
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,796
How many beers is that for you?

350
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,794
I'm serious!
You're drinking like a fish.

351
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,440
I just think you should
take care of yourself.

352
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,838
Jesus! We've already gone
through this once today already.

353
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,954

(Baby crying)

368
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,033
What's going on?

369
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,795
What the fuck...?

370
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,237
This is my work.

371
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,592
This is all my research.

372
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,557
Our work.

373
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,914
Every word.

374
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,911
Where the fuck are my cameras?

375
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,595
(Stephen) This is all
of our goddamn work!

376
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,148
How the hell are we gonna make
the deadline?

377
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,199
- We backed it up on computer.
- No, Tristen, that was just notes.

378
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,635
Half this shit is original documents.

379
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,517
Where the hell was everybody?

380
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,670
We were all supposed to be awake.

381
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,954
Guys, where's Erica?

382
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,914
I'm right here.

383
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,953
We must have fallen asleep.

384
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,793
Asleep? It's like
we must have blacked out!

385
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,519
The last thing I remember
was that other group.

386
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,037
Yeah...those fucking dickweeds!
Who else could it have been, huh?

387
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,112
They came back from Coffin Rock,
and ripped us off!

388
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,670
Ripped? These things look like
they were bit off.

389
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,150
I-I-I... What am I gonna do?

390
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,911
At least the tapes are still here.

391
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,357
- What?
- The tapes. They're here.

392
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,158
Where? Do you see them?

393
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,912
In my mind, I see them.

394
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,270
Oh, Jesus.

395
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,916
You fuck.

396
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,349
They're there!

397
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,310
Where they found
the Blair Witch tapes?

398
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,913
You've got to be kidding me.

399
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,594
Come on! Why would they be in there?

400
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,150
Newsflash, everybody...
That was just a movie.

401
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,913
I don't know why, Stephen.

402
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,156
They're under the rocks.

403
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,952
There's nothing in there.

404
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,268
Reach inside.

405
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,988
- Well...?
- I don't feel so hot.

406
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,152
Jeff, is there anything in there?

407
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,352
(Erica) Jesus Christ.

408
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,913
How did those get in there?

409
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,956
Are they yours?

410
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,511
I think we should leave.

411
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,469
How did you know?

412
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,790
- I don't know.
- Are they yours?

413
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,632
Did you put them there? Did you?!

414
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,712
- Jeff, are they your tapes?
- Yeah, they're my tapes!

415
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,631
Then, why are they still here?

416
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,998
Why is the equipment trashed, the
cameras are gone, but not the tapes?

417
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,914
She's right. Wouldn't those guys
want to fuck up your tour footage?

418
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,116
Stephen, I want to leave.

419
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,394
How did this happen?

420
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,908
Oh, fuck!

421
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,592
Jesus Christ, the baby.

422
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,391
We found blood in the van.

423
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,360
Tristen had a miscarriage.

424
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,951
You know that, Cravens.

425
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,237
'She bled in the van
on the way to the hospital.'

426
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,990
This girl's hypothermic.
Get me heating blankets and a lamp.

427
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,674
It's like she's
been sitting in ice water.

428
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,432
We were just camping.

429
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,115
(Cravens) 'The doctor thinks
it's hypothermia.'

430
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,351
Course, the way I see it
you brought her out here,

431
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,431
you took her into those woods.

432
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,954
She's your responsibility.

433
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,951
Are you charging me with something?

434
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,273
You have been...a pain
in this town's ass since you were 10.

435
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,078
You need to learn
to stay out of trouble, boy.

436
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,355
It makes you defensive...

437
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,510
Anxious.

438
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,195
Last thing you need
is to end up back in the loony bin.

439
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,676
How is she?

440
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,756
She lost the baby.

441
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,318
The doctor will keep you here
till your temperature stabilises.

442
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,676
You lost a lot of blood.
More than usual.

443
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,512
It's for the best.

444
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,558
Your body is telling you
something was wrong.

445
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,276
Something was wrong.

446
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,319
(Screaming)

447
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,590
How are you feeling?

448
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,231
I'm not staying here.

449
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,031
Five hours of our lives
are unaccounted for.

450
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,157
I want to see those tapes.
I want to know what happened.

451
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,118
I've got some editing equipment at my
house.

452
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,112
We should be able to come up
with some answers.

453
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,033
We're still in
the Black Hills, aren't we?

454
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,473
Yeah, right up there.

455
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,709
Let's get Tristen inside.
We can take care of the bags later.

456
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,670
I thought we were going
to your house.

457
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,115
RFD 431... Jericho Mills, home.

458
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,952
(Stephen) What did it used to be?

459
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,792
It was a factory after the war.

460
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,395
They were going to destroy it, so I
got them to sell it to me for a buck.

461
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,629
(Erica) Cool.

462
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,712
Sorry about the bridge.
It's the only way in or out.

463
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,837
It's pretty safe...
don't lean on the railings.

464
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,433
I am not a gambling man.

465
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,629
But...

466
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,918
I would bet my entire...

467
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,836
retirement pension...

468
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,231
that the blood in the van...

469
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,873
is gonna match those tourists.

470
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,230
You've been looking to pin something
on me since I was a kid.

471
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,594
(Dogs barking)

472
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,673
Come on, get in, quick. Before they
eat you. Quick, quick. Let's go.

473
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,469
(Barking)

474
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,675
(Barking stops)

475
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,954
(Barking)

476
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,716
Burkitt County's cheapest alarm.

477
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,109
And what's that do? Squirt water?

478
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,079
No, that actually works. Wave.
It's recording you right now.

479
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,628
I got 'em hooked up
through the building.

480
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,950
- I'm a little paranoid.
- Hah! a little?

481
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,871
I heard that.

482
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,632
But with good reason.

483
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,359
I got a lot of valuable stuff here.

484
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,838
Oh, my God!

485
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,230
(Kim) Yeah! You wouldn't want
somebody to come in here,

486
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,959
and steal stuff
that you've already stolen.

487
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,476
Where it comes from is not
my business, nor should it be yours.

488
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,233
I just like to pass the savings
on to others.

489
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,914
- Really? And how do you do that?
- E-bay.

490
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,675
Buying, selling, trading, swapping.
I'm a major player.

491
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,399
I thought all your cameras
got trashed.

492
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,471
Well, you can never have too many.

493
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,155
Jeff, I think we've had enough
videotaping for one weekend.

494
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,753
Yeah, dude. Tour's over.

495
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,990
(Jeff) Maybe the tour has just begun,

496
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,038
cos you're walking into
the official Blair store.

497
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,680
Come in, everybody.
This is where it begins.

498
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,877
This is the epicentre of
the Blair Witch-Hunt web-site.

499
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,078
I got my sticks... You can touch
these, they're for the stick men.

500
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,515
Don't touch those, those are drying.

501
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,239
Did you collect these
in the Black hills?

502
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,469
Yeah, every twig.

503
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,074
Here is a rock...
Oh, my God, who made that?!

504
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,354
Oh, I did, earlier.

505
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,592
We've got Parr ruins foundation dirt,
that's a big item. I sell that.

506
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,399
T-shirts and sweat shirts, and hats.

507
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,153
Here you go, Tristen.
That's for you, gratis.

508
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,992
I feel better.

509
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,319
You're as big an asshole
as the rest of them.

510
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,312
What are you talking about, Erica?
This stuff is hot.

511
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,630
This is what
the wiccan religion needs,

512
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,995
more capitalism based on
fear and lies.

513
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,039
Do you really think it's fair
to exploit our culture,

514
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,032
just to sell stick-figure key chains?

515
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,152
- I think this place is cool, Jeff.
- Thanks.

516
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,708
Jeff, we're tired.
I should get her to bed.

517
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,319
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

518
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,550
Let's see...

519
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,592
The stairs by the kitchen
lead to my editing loft.

520
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,477
The bedroom on the right is mine.

521
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,916
It's got the biggest bed
and it's own john. You guys take it.

522
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,070
- Thanks, brother.
- Sure.

523
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,718
Sleep well.

524
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,633
The rest of the bedrooms
are down the hallway.

525
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,835
Hey...

526
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,471
I really appreciate the hospitality,
but take me off your mailing list.

527
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,879
OK.

528
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,112
They should have never let you out.
You're a long way from sane.

529
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,394
(Tristen) I saw something
at the hospital.

530
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,038
What?

531
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,989
It was just like the picture
in the Blair Witch black bible.

532
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,038
The same clothes,
that same face, like...

533
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,310
she'd been drowned.

534
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,628
Who?

535
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,472
The little girl.

536
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,470
Eileen Treacle.

537
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,471
Sweetie...

538
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,916
Why don't we talk about this
after you get some sleep?

539
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,638
I want to talk about it now.

540
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,075
You need to sleep. You're in shock.

541
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,239
This is so...intense.

542
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,358
Chill out, Erica.
We've watched half of one tape.

543
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,238
We've got four angles,
we've got our handhelds,

544
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,993
we've got hours of tapes
we haven't seen.

545
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,629
Last night, when we were camping,

546
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,596
I dreamt I hurt the baby.

547
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,674
That's just because we've been
fighting about it so much.

548
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,355
- You've been through a lot.
- I know how much you wanted a baby.

549
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,635
I'm sorry I didn't want it.

550
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,278
I'm sorry that I lost it.

551
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,030
Guys, something just occurred to me.

552
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,474
- Where's that tree?
- (Kim) What?

553
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,348
That big tree that was right there.
Now there's just this tiny twig.

554
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,716
See, guys, I told you there was
something up with that tree.

555
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,873
Hand me another of those dv cassettes
maybe there's another angle.

556
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,918
Whoa, whoa...what is up with that?

557
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,430
I don't know. I think it's chafing
from the backpack.

558
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,589
Does it hurt?

559
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,750
Not really. It just kind of itches.

560
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,990
It's nothing. Here.

561
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,511
- What was that?
- What?

562
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,953
Rewind it.

563
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,393
What did you see?

564
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,948
I'm not sure. A flash, or something.

565
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,635
Coffin Rock.

566
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,995
- What?
- Coffin Rock.

567
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,117
How the hell do you see Coffin Rock?
Can you see in other dimensions?

568
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,475
I don't know.
That's what it reminds me of.

569
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,279
Those guys
that were murdered there in 1886 -

570
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,318
after they were gutted,
their heads were arranged

571
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,073
in the shape of a pentagram...
like that.

572
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,513
A great American pastime -
blame it on a witch.

573
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,353
(Jeff) Let me see
if I can get that image back.

574
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,793
(Tristen) Stephen!

575
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,756
(Erica) Is she gonna be OK?

576
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,633
I don't know.

577
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,869
Stephen!

578
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,119
Tristen?

579
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,758
Tristen?

580
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,315
(Sobbing outside)

581
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,192
(Barking alarm)

582
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,469
Shut up.

583
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,518
(Girl's voice) 'You brought it back
with you.'

584
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,272
(Shriek)

585
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,478
(Tristen) What was all that?

586
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,870
That was Jeff's stupid dog alarm.

587
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,477
The crying.

588
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,992
You heard that, too?

589
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,116
In my dreams.

590
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,317
I thought I was having
this horrible nightmare.

591
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,191
About what?

592
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,318
Children...

593
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,435
looking up my skirt

594
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,239
as I twirled round and round.

595
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,758
So I hurt them.

596
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,875
Stephen, what the hell
is wrong with me?

597
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,157
Nothing. Nothing. You're just...

598
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,992
(Wind howls outside)

599
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,758
Look, there are...

600
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,718
rational explanations behind this.

601
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,030
Behind everything that's going on.

602
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,156
I think we need to go home.

603
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,517
- I'll get someone to drive us...
- Not yet!

604
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,352
Why?

605
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,588
Just not yet.

606
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,240
I need to understand what happened.

607
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,557
You can understand it
on the plane ride home.

608
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,639
Here.

609
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,553
Take these.

610
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,389
Take them.

611
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,152
They'll help you sleep.

612
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,878
Come on, take them!

613
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,359
You're not making a believer
out of me, son.

614
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,396
It was an accident.

615
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,990
I swear to Christ,
it was an accident.

616
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,798
- Jesus.
- What the hell was that?

617
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,871
I'm not sure.

618
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,320
See that? Whoa, wait. Look.

619
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,350
Time code goes from 1:32am....
to 3:57am....back to 1:32am.

620
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,318
In the middle of the footage?
How does that happen?

621
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,472
I don't know. But those were
the hours that we fell asleep.

622
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,472
Can you make it bigger,
or slow it down?

623
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,630
Let me try slowing it down.

624
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,153
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a naked woman.

625
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,959
What is a naked woman doing
swinging around a tree?

626
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,758
Are we sure these are our tapes?

627
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,354
I'm not sure of anything
in the last 24 hours.

628
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,638
I'll re-digitise this at a higher
resolution so I can blow it up.

629
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,711
This will take a few minutes.

630
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,075
I need alcohol.

631
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,354
Caffeine.

632
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,599
Caffeine!

633
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,473
Sure. I live to serve.

634
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,036
Ugh...great.

635
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,910
Stale coffee, no beer,
some old take-out chicken...

636
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,230
but plenty of batteries.

637
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,713
Hey...

638
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,712
- What's going on?
- We're leaving in the morning.

639
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,949
Really?

640
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,548
It's... It's Tristen.

641
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,716
She's in bad shape.

642
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,234
This whole thing has really
fucked her up.

643
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,869
How come you're the one who looks
like he's having a breakdown?

644
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,349
Look! I'm a little tense, all right?

645
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,432
Sorry.

646
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,558
No, I am...

647
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,153
sorry.

648
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,638
I just feel like my whole life's

649
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,109
been turned upside down
the past two days.

650
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,434
I know.

651
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,758
It's been really crazy for you,
but it's gonna be OK.

652
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,558
I promise.

653
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,868
That feels good.

654
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,791
You ARE tense.

655
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,476
- Like that?
- Yeah.

656
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,232
Lower?

657
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,471
Yeah, lower.

658
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,155
- How does that feel?
- Good.

659
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,798
Lower?

660
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,152
How does that feel?

661
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,355
(Ripping and scraping)

662
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,639
Do they hurt?

663
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,953
No. They're just a little warm.

664
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,519
Don't worry.

665
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,271
I have them, too.

666
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,079
(Kim) Guys...

667
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,071
want to come up here?

668
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,477
You're out of beer,
if that's what you want to know.

669
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,028
Jeff found a better angle
on this naked chick.

670
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,270
- What naked chick?
- Cool. How?

671
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,873
I blew up the image.

672
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,871
(Kim) It's a bit weird to watch...

673
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,270
Like watching a hold-up
on a bank security camera.

674
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,998
(Kim) You get the gist.

675
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,231
(Stephen) Where is this?
(Jeff) The foundation.

676
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,915
- (Erica) This was last night?
- Yeah. During the big blackout.

677
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,116
(Stephen) Can you let us
see her face?

678
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,474
Sure can.

679
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,951
If this is a joke...it ain't funny.

680
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,989
No joke. It's serious, Erica.

681
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,230
While I was gone,
you messed with things.

682
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,673
(Jeff) No.

683
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,433
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

684
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,512
- We were hoping you could explain.
- I don't have a clue.

685
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,875
- You have no memory of doing this?
- No.

686
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,713
(Jeff) If it's some wicca thing,
you can tell us.

687
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,631
(Kim) Try and help us understand.

688
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,076
We're just trying to put together
what happened last night.

689
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,994
- Find out who trashed my equipment.
- That wasn't me. I didn't do that.

690
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,435
Erica, that's you there
on the screen.

691
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,159
Leave me the hell alone, all of you!

692
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,599
Believe her?

693
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,593
I don't know.

694
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,835
Jeff, give me your keys to the van.

695
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,595
- Where you going?
- I have to get out. I need a beer.

696
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,116
Hey, see if we need more coffee.

697
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,672
(Erica chanting)

698
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,356
..earth and fire, water and smoke...

699
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,908
I am going to the store.
You want to come...?

700
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,434
(Continues chanting, sobbing)

701
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,272
Erica?

702
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,792
Erica!

703
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,511
We brought something back with us.

704
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,556
What are you talking about?

705
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,916
I can sense it...

706
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,752
like someone's choking me...

707
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,717
and squeezing the air out of me.

708
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,193
Look, we're just tired, OK?
We're all really tired. That is it.

709
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,430
I want to show you something.

710
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,229
I have got the same thing.
It's nothing, it's like poison oak.

711
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,038
But, Kim...

712
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,473
They're growing.

713
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,559
(Erica) Ancient pagan alphabet.

714
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,837
They say it means
you've been touched by a witch.

715
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,713
(Sobbing) That you're next
chosen to die.

716
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,393
There's something here!

717
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,516
There's something here!

718
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,238
Sweet.

719
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,595
Yo, Morticia.

720
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,911
Hey, Elvira, I got something
you can suck the blood out of.

721
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,991
Oh, yeah? Whip it out.

722
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,510
Excuse me, sorry.

723
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,670
I'm finished now.

724
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,478
What the...?!

725
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,879
What is your problem?

726
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,554
- You're with the witch people.
- Lady...

727
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,392
I'm just here to buy groceries.

728
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,038
Witch!

729
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,392
Freak.

730
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,274
Am I gonna have a problem
with you, too?

731
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,078
No problem.

732
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,674
Good. Let's go.

733
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,278
OK, look...

734
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,591
Either you ring this stuff up...
or I call your manager.

735
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,875
I am the manager.

736
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,997
- Really?
- Yeah.

737
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,230
Well, then, Peggy...

738
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,796
could you tell the bitch at the front
register to do her goddamn job?!

739
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,233
Get the hell out of here!

740
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,118
Not until I've completed my purchase.

741
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,839
We don't want people like you
around here.

742
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,708
You know what? I am gonna make this
so easy on you, Peggy.

743
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,159
I told you to get
the hell out of here.

744
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,672
You touch me again...

745
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,230
and I will rip out
your goddamn throat!

746
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,555
Keep your motherfucking change!

747
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,915
Persephone, do I invoke...by earth
and fire, and water and smoke

748
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,959
Persephone, do I invoke...by earth
and fire, and water and smoke

749
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,113
Persephone, do I invoke...by earth
and fire, and water and smoke

750
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,034
Persephone, I invoke...by earth
and fire, and water and smoke

751
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,960
Persephone, I invoke...by earth
and fire, and water and smoke,

752
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,600
Persephone, I invoke...by earth
and fire, and water and smoke

753
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,872
Persephone, I invoke...by earth
and fire, and water and smoke

754
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,952
Persephone, I invoke... (Sobbing) by
earth and fire, and water and smoke,

755
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,155
Persephone, I invoke...

756
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,196
(Continues)

757
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,795
(Sobbing)

758
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,031
(Indistinct disembodied chanting)

759
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,272
(# Heavy metal)

760
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,916
(Increases volume)

761
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,830
- Stone the witch!
- Stone the bitch!

762
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,433
Fucking rednecks!

763
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,995
(Distant crying)

764
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,198
(Crying continues)

765
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,350
Ow!

766
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,913
(Jeff) Kim?

767
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,673
Make me a pot of coffee
on your way up.

768
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,596
You're welcome.

769
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,797
(Creaking and clock ticking)

770
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,074
Look, I fucked up your front fender.

771
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,869
I had to swerve
to avoid hitting these little kids.

772
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,992
They were dressed funny, like
from another time. Seven of them.

773
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,229
Jeff!

774
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,554
I know this is crazy,

775
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,598
but I know those are the kids
Rustin Parr killed!

776
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,591
Coffee.

777
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,240
Next to your arm.

778
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,553
- Morning.
- Hey. Did you sleep OK?

779
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,632
- Yeah, I slept OK. You?
- Yeah.

780
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,359
- You ready to go?
- Yeah. Are you guys ready?

781
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,634
Yeah.

782
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,836
I...appreciate your driving us.

783
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,757
Yeah. I'll get the keys from Jeff.

784
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,192
Come on, Tristen, wake up.

785
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,673
- Come on, let's go.
- Not yet...

786
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,512
Tristen, we're going home.

787
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,431
Erica?

788
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,919
Erica!

789
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,599
Erica?

790
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,394
- Erica!
- (Jeff) Not up here.

791
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,994
Not up there? You sure?
She was just here.

792
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,719
Didn't you hear me?
I just said she's not up here.

793
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,677
Why don't you go check out the v...

794
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,115
What the hell happened to the van?

795
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,519
(Stephen) Jesus Christ.
We are never gonna get out of here...

796
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,158
Kim, what the hell did you do?

797
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,800
You said you just busted up
the front end!

798
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,836
How the hell did you drive it back?

799
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,075
I swear it was just the front fender.

800
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,673
What the fuck is going on?!

801
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,275
They dip their hands in your blood
then press them on your body.

802
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,193
- What are you talking about?
- The children.

803
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,598
Something I dreamt.
Jeff dreamt it, too. Look.

804
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,069
Look!

805
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,116
Oh, Jesus! What the hell is this?

806
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,715
Something from the woods.
We've all got them. Me, her, Erica...

807
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,836
Where is Erica?

808
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,394
Erica?

809
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,479
Erica?

810
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,389
Erica!

811
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,272
What the...?

812
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,598
Erica!

813
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,749
(Dog barking)

814
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,319
Erica!

815
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,313
ERICA!

816
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,590
We would've heard the dog alarm
when she went outside.

817
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,797
It's like she fucking vanished.

818
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,789
- Evaporated is more like it.
- Yeah, right, Kim.

819
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,997
You were the one who found
her clothes and those candles.

820
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,594
(Kim) What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

821
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,797
A prank. Two little bitches
trying to freak us out.

822
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,632
- You paranoid fuck!
- Come on!

823
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,676
We'd never do something like that!

824
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,638
Where is she, Kim? Where is she?

825
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,950
Why are her clothes and shit
still here?

826
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,155
How would I know?

827
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,118
Can't you see her, Kimmy,
in your mind's eye?

828
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,270
Very funny, asshole!

829
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,239
I think something really bad
has happened to her.

830
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,151
Maybe she called somebody.

831
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,277
(Jeff) I'd like to speak
to Minister Geerson, please.

832
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,477
(Woman) 'He's in a meeting.
Could he return your call? '

833
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,597
- No. It's urgent.
- 'Could I tell him what it's about?'

834
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,275
Yeah. His daughter, Erica.
We wanna know if he's heard from her.

835
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,999
The minister and Mrs Geerson
have no daughter.

836
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,039
No, I know, like, they disowned her
or something because she's a witch...

837
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,315
'They've never had any children.'

838
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,038
(Dial tone)

839
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,518
So she made up a story.

840
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,797
She gave us a fake name.
It doesn't have to mean anything.

841
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,029
She lied to us.

842
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,635
Why are we seeing all this shit?
Why is all this happening?

843
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,315
I don't know. Collective delusion.
Group hysteria.

844
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,598
It's what my book is about. You get
a bunch of people scared enough...

845
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,194
Dude, spare us the bullshit. Please.

846
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,794
It's real. Dude(!)

847
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,108
It happens.

848
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,398
They teach it at junior colleges
I bet that even you could get into.

849
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,517
How did you get into yours?
You have to brush your teeth?

850
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,158
(Kim) Jeff, the screen.

851
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,832
Roll it back, rewind it.

852
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,838
No, more.

853
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,638
(Jeff) Oh, shit.

854
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,393
I knew they'd come back
and mess with my stuff.

855
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,799
(Phone)

856
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,477
Fuck off. No one's home.

857
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,118
- It's Cravens.
- 'Sheriff?'

858
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,318
Funny. I just found out who trashed
my cameras. I was about to call you.

859
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,594
Turn on your TV.

860
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,478
'I don't give a shit.
I want you to see something.'

861
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,834
Me, too. News at 11:00.

862
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,673
Shit. Will you just turn that on?
Humour him.

863
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,516
- You watching?
- Like a hawk.

864
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,309
Listen, I'm trying to tell you
what I found out on Friday night.

865
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,072
'This is a special report.

866
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,118
'A brutal murder in the Black Hills
discovered today

867
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,270
'the bodies of five hikers found dead

868
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,749
'atop the landmark
known as Coffin Rock.'

869
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,637
Disembowelled, Jeffrey.

870
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,757
'A re-creation
of the infamous Coffin Rock massacre

871
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,400
'popularised by the movie
The Blair...'

872
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,472
Bodies were laid out
in the shape of a pentagram.

873
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,993
Sound familiar?

874
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,868
'We've received word that the victims
include two Chinese tourists

875
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,157
'and one German, as well as
two unidentified white males.

876
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,357
'Recently, the Black Hills
has been overrun with fans

877
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,591
'wanting to get a glimpse
of where the movie was filmed.'

878
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,399
- (Cravens) 'You looking at me?'
- What?

879
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,913
'Over here.'

880
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,274
(Kim) There.

881
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,272
- (Jeff) Yeah?
- 'I didn't find your cameras.

882
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,669
'Don't guess that's a surprise,
is it?'

883
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,797
- What do you want from me?
- I got five corpses here!

884
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,757
I had nothing to do with that.

885
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,071
You might not have been in charge
but you were involved,

886
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,232
so you and your little friends
had best just sit tight.

887
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:04,030
'And that means...you don't leave
this county till I say it's OK.'

888
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,991
I don't know you, Stephen.

889
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,350
I don't know a thing about you.

890
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,635
I don't know how much to believe
about any of you people...

891
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,277
But from now on...

892
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,875
know this:
you are not leaving me here alone

893
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,996
to take the fall for this shit.

894
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,550
Nobody is going out of my sight.

895
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,436
We brought something back with us.

896
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,276
For Christ's sake, Kim...

897
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,715
I'll tell you what's going on here.

898
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,955
It's Erica...

899
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,998
or whoever the fuck she is.

900
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,674
Erica has got nothing to do
with this.

901
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,957
She's a witch, man!
She's one big pissed-off witch!

902
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,589
She's casting fucking spells,
making herself appear,

903
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,875
making herself fucking disappear.

904
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,598
It's been her since day one!

905
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,717
Smoke it up, cos you're not totally
psycho yet!

906
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,951
- Where are you going?
- The fuck away from you!

907
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,234
You're a dick.

908
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,275
Kim!

909
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,477
Jeff, you've got to have friends,
somebody with a car...

910
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,075
What did I tell you?!
You're not going anywhere!

911
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,915
Wipe that shit off your face.

912
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,155
You think that your makeup
and black clothes give you power,

913
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,836
but you're just a scared, cowardly
little girl underneath all that.

914
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,717
(Erica) You don't understand.

915
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,519
Something happened to us
in the woods.

916
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,512
Something evil.

917
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,756
Why are you so mad at me?

918
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,509
(Siren)

919
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,672
Calm down. I'm not that pissed.

920
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,598
Just stop badmouthing Erica.

921
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,399
- She's outside.
- Where?

922
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,708
Right there.

923
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,116
There's nothing out there.

924
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,834
Tristen, let's get you back to bed.

925
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,390
- You just got to look, Stephen.
- Let's go to the bedroom.

926
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,436
Look again.

927
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,719
She's out there!

928
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,076
(Dogs barking)

929
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,239
Erica.

930
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,270
What happened to you?

931
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,389
Don't be afraid.

932
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,550
You know who it is.

933
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,110
- What?
- And you know what you have to do.

934
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,435
Erica!

935
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,752
You know who it is.

936
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,875
Erica?

937
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,234
(Distant laughter)

938
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,592
Tristen, help me. Help me!

939
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,393
Tristen!

940
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,675
Aw, Tristen...

941
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,078
Stephen! I got you, grab my hand.

942
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,071
Come on, hold on.

943
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,789
They did it, the little Buster Boys.

944
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,950
They did it! They hanged her!

945
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,553
The little Buster Boys!

946
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,232
Tristen! Shh! Shh!

947
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,390
It's only a dream. It's only a dream!

948
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,155
They're Elly Kedward's dreams!
I don't know why I'm having them.

949
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,549
Why do you think
they're Elly Kedward's?

950
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,029
Cos I was seeing them
through her eyes -

951
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,237
tied to the tree
where they banished her to.

952
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,834
And the bad little boys
from Blair village

953
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,151
sneaking out to the woods
to see if she was still alive...

954
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,629
and...and they let their big dogs
bite her

955
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,759
and they poked her with sticks and
then when the blood came out of her,

956
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:45,072
they put their palms in it
and pressed it on her flesh!

957
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,311
And then, when they found
she was still alive,

958
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,710
they untied her...and they put
the ropes around her neck

959
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,553
and they hanged her
from the big tree!

960
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,028
Stephen, I think I'm going
fucking crazy!

961
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,112
No! No, you are not going crazy.

962
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,838
Do you hear me?

963
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,355
You are not going crazy.

964
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,078
It's OK.

965
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,118
It's OK.

966
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,237
It's all right.

967
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,150
(Footsteps approaching)

968
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,437
Jeff? Listen, I'm really worried
about Tristen.

969
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,193
Do you know the name
of the doctor she was with?

970
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,349
No, no, I don't.

971
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,829
Then I think you need to call
the hospital.

972
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,957
OK. I think there's a phone book
in the desk drawer.

973
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,712
What is this?

974
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,197
What the fuck is this?

975
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,157
- What?
- These!

976
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,151
I don't know. Where did you get 'em?

977
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,549
In your desk!
What, are you spying on us?

978
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,473
What the hell are you talking about?
No, I'm not!

979
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,391
I've no idea where this came from!

980
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,311
Where'd you get this? Answer me!

981
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,789
She found 'em.
Maybe she put 'em in there!

982
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,633
- I wanna know where you got these!
- I've no idea!

983
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,389
We've been looking into
your background, Stephen.

984
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,916
You've been such a good little boy
all your life.

985
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,230
How did you get mixed up in all this?

986
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,959
(Phone)

987
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,994
What?

988
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,911
'It's Cravens, you little shit!'

989
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,719
Sheriff, I'm a little preoccupied
right now.

990
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,633
'I need to talk to you.
Get your butt down here.'

991
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,713
My van is trashed. And you know mommy
doesn't let me out after dark.

992
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,349
'I'm right at your front door,
you little twerp! Get down here!'

993
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,000
How can he be out there?
The bridge is gone.

994
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,551
(Kim) This is too weird.

995
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,596
- (Bang)
- (Cravens) Here!

996
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,954
- (Bang)
- Jeffrey!

997
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,632
- (Bang)
- It's Cravens!

998
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,358
(Banging continues)

999
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,153
We got a few things
to talk about, boy!

1000
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,310
(Banging)

1001
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,792
You were a punk as a kid,
and you're still a punk!

1002
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,677
Open up, Jeff!

1003
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,113
(Banging)

1004
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,351
Open the goddamn door!

1005
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,635
(Banging)

1006
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,350
If you know what's good for you,
you'll open the damn door!

1007
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,000
You open up
this goddamn door right now!

1008
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,152
I told you to stay out
of those woods.

1009
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,349
They're not gonna just send you back
to the loony bin this time.

1010
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,039
Open the goddamn door!

1011
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,629
(Barking)

1012
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,758
(Barking continues)

1013
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,269
Jeff!

1014
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,635
What the fuck, dude?
Put the gun down.

1015
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,835
Put the gun down!

1016
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,789
Erica.

1017
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,552
What are you doing?

1018
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,959
Erica.

1019
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,359
(Kim) That's gross!

1020
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,716
(Stephen) She...she's...! Oh, God!

1021
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,472
(Flies buzzing)

1022
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,118
(Clock ticking)

1023
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,717
You were the last one to see her
still alive.

1024
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,110
The last time I saw her,
she was heading up here to see you.

1025
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,353
I didn't kill her, Stephen.

1026
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,994
- Don't even think it.
- Kim was up here with me!

1027
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,799
Well, let me clue you in
to something, all right?

1028
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,440
She didn't commit fucking suicide!

1029
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,878
- One of you...
- Oh, wait!

1030
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,077
What about you?
What gets you off the goddamn hook?

1031
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,948
- My word!
- Which is worth exactly shit to me!

1032
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,112
Where was your little girlfriend
this whole time?

1033
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,398
Oh, for Christ's sake!
She can barely get out of bed...

1034
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,593
It's backwards.

1035
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,318
Go back to bed, Tristen.

1036
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,868
The little girl backwards.

1037
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,712
Erica dancing...

1038
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,469
backwards.

1039
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,118
Everything backwards.

1040
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,872
What are you talking about?

1041
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,956
Widdershins.

1042
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,632
Undo the evil.

1043
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,711
What the fuck is a widdershin?

1044
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,234
(Speaking gibberish)

1045
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,959
All right,
she's lost her fucking mind.

1046
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,319
That's it.

1047
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,833
Backwards.

1048
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,148
- Backwards!
- What?

1049
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,435
We need to run the tapes backwards.

1050
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,669
- Why?
- I don't know.

1051
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,593
I think it'll help us find out
what happened to Erica.

1052
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,113
This makes no sense!

1053
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,316
I know it doesn't. Just please do it!

1054
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,551
(Tristen murmuring)

1055
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,588
See? Nothing.

1056
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,439
Try the-the-the
keystrokes backwards.

1057
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,556
You know, the fucking commands.

1058
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,109
You see? You guys happy?
There's nothing!

1059
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,393
There's your missing hours.

1060
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,149
(Jeff) This must be
when we blacked out.

1061
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,673
Tristen...

1062
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,278
What is this?

1063
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,271
What did you make us do?

1064
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,234
You're leading us, aren't you?

1065
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,313
Weren't you watching
the fucking screen?

1066
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,278
No.

1067
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,352
- Get back here!
- Grab her!

1068
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,072
Get your hands off me.

1069
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,673
What did you do, Tristen?

1070
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,637
Stephen, please tell them to stop.

1071
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,429
Why aren't you marked like this?
Like the rest of us, like Erica?

1072
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,873
What did you do to Erica?

1073
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,394
Stephen, why are you letting them
do this?

1074
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,833
(Kim) You killed Erica!

1075
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,469
- (Tristen) You two are crazy!
- Shh, shh, shh! Listen.

1076
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,630
Just admit it to the camera.

1077
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,188
We're not gonna take the fall
for Erica.

1078
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:16,276
OK? Just admit it. Don't worry,
sweetie. We're not gonna hurt you.

1079
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,918
Not like you hurt the baby.

1080
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,719
What? I didn't have anything
to do with the baby.

1081
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,631
The witch kills children!

1082
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:26,429
I...haven't killed anybody!

1083
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,112
(Kim) Bullshit!

1084
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,710
- Oh, God, Stephen.
- Tristen, just say the words!

1085
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,438
Just say the words...

1086
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,439
(Kim screams)

1087
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,270
You're all gonna fucking die.

1088
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,030
- You wanna kill me?
- No.

1089
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,078
No, I just want to understand.

1090
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,277
But you can't understand
because you're so afraid!

1091
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,512
Just like the pathetic children
of Blair village, so frightened!

1092
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,832
- Aren't you, little girl?
- Who are you?

1093
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,911
She's the witch, man!

1094
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,748
(Gasps)

1095
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,877
(Deep voice) Is that
what you think...crazy boy?

1096
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,793
Tristen! Tristen, talk to me!

1097
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,997
- Stephen...
- What is it, baby, what is it?

1098
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,748
- Tristen's gone.
- (Kim) Get away from him!

1099
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,668
That's not...how you do it.

1100
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,839
This is what you want.

1101
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,748
Tristen, whatever you're doing...
don't!

1102
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,798
I'm not doing anything, honey.
It's all up to you!

1103
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,518
Witch bitch.

1104
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,828
Why did you kill Erica?

1105
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,353
(Sniffs)

1106
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,351
(Sniffing)

1107
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,953
I can smell the fear on you.

1108
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,713
Stay away from me.
