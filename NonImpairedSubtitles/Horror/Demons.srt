1
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,106
(Footsteps)

2
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,365
(Sighs heavily)

3
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,829
(Footsteps)

4
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,254
(Footsteps and metallic rattling)

5
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,888
Ah!

6
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,183
(Sighs)

7
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,980
Ah...can I have another one?

8
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:16,442
It's for a friend of mine.
She's waiting for me.

9
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,610
Thank you.

10
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,364
Er...are you dressed like this
for the promotion of the film?

11
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,779
Kathy! Kathy!

12
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,286
Sorry I'm late.

13
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,499
You usually are. Mrs Buckles is
just gonna blow her stack again.

14
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:16,168
She'd scream at us
even if we were early.

15
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,420
Look what I was given.

16
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,592
- Doesn't the movie have a title?
- No. Maybe it's a sneak preview.

17
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,011
You know, they show a brand-new
movie in a theatre

18
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,347
just to see the reaction
of the public.

19
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,100
Where is the Metropol?
I've never heard of it.

20
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,893
Me, neither. Maybe it's new.

21
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,813
What do you say we go
and forget about Mrs Buckles?

22
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:39,566
Sometimes you really worry me, Cheryl.
You're leading us astray!

23
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,443
It was just an idea.

24
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,192
(Heavy breathing sound)

25
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,705
(Laughter)

26
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,459
Hey, look, Kathy. There it is.

27
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,341
Hey, you don't think it's gonna be
a horror movie, do you?

28
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:50,846
- You know I just hate them.
- And I hate missing the start. Come on.

29
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,811
(Heavy breathing)

30
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:06,028
- Are you sure you want to cut class?
- Hm. I'll hold your hand if it's scary.

31
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,711
(Heavy breathing)

32
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:34,431
That's strange. I didn't know
there was a movie house on this street.

33
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,643
Closed down a couple of years ago.
Looks like they spent some money on it.

34
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,562
- How come I never noticed it?
- You never notice anything, darling.

35
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,566
Please, Frank, don't start.
This is our anniversary.

36
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,777
So what?
I'm taking you to a show.

37
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,739
- What else do you want?
- Straight ahead, sir.

38
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,703
Straight ahead, please.

39
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:01,291
- Great bike, huh?
- It's fantastic! Absolutely fantastic.

40
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,919
Oh, rats! Come on,
give us back the money!

41
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,756
- God, I hate these machines.
- Hey, Ken, forget the bike.

42
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,178
- What are you doing?
- Hitting the coin return.

43
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,931
Oh, forget it. It's ripped us off.

44
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,184
- These things only happen to you.
- It's not my fault if the machine...

45
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,645
Looks like you're having problems.

46
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:27,943
Thanks.

47
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,654
Sometimes all it takes
is the right touch.

48
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:36,702
I thought you said you just hate
to miss the start of a movie.

49
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,099
Liz?

50
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,393
- Liz!
- Yes, Werner?

51
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,229
- Don't touch it.
- Touch what?

52
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,648
This.

53
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:14,990
No, I never go. There are too many
people on the beach.

54
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,408
Hey!

55
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,659
(Laughs)

56
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,077
How do I look?

57
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,955
- Terrific.
- Do you like it, Bobby?

58
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,834
- Sexy, huh?
- I think you look silly.

59
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,296
- Just a sec...
- Hey, cut it, baby!

60
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,548
Ow! What was that?

61
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,383
- You cut yourself.
- Oh, shit!

62
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,303
That'll teach you to touch things.

63
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,848
What is he getting so mad for?
It was just...

64
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,484
Why don't we sit next to this guy?
He's cute.

65
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,319
Sit here and shut up!

66
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,530
Jesus, this is what you call
enjoying yourself?

67
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,993
I bet they're gonna come and sit here.

68
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,706
Come on.

69
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,295
- Hi.
- Hi.

70
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,592
Charlie, love, did you bring the popcorn?

71
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,136
Shut up, you stupid bitch!

72
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:33,276
<i>The sleep of reason

73
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,663
<i>J' Black angels laughing

74
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,545
<i>J' Street toys scream in pain

82
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,011
<i>Hey, stop! Look!</i>

83
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,764
<i>There's something written on this.</i>

84
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,225
<i>- It's an inscription or something.
- What's it say?</i>

85
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:52,022
<i>"They will make cemeteries
their cathedrals,</i>

86
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,317
<i>"and tombs your cities."</i>

87
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,986
<i>Eugh!!</i>

88
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,031
<i>According to an old legend,
Nostradamus was buried here.</i>

89
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,201
<i>Nostradamus?
Sounds like a rock group to me.</i>

90
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,286
<i>Yeah, Top of The Pops in 1500.</i>

91
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,539
<i>- They had rock groups then?
- Edith!</i>

92

- <i>He was kind of a fortune teller.</i>

93
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,420
<i>A prophet from the 16th century.</i>

94
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,131
<i>He predicted a whole mess of things
that have come true.</i>

95
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,299
<i>Such as?</i>

96
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,428
<i>Such as, for example, the discovery
of Neptune and Uranus,</i>

97
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,641
<i>Hitler, world wars,
the coming of the demons.</i>

98
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,644
<i>Big deal, that hasn't happened.</i>

99
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,814
<i>Not yet. There's still time.</i>

100
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,567
A horror movie. I knew it!

101
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,487
<i>I told you this was a great place.
Come on...</i>

102
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,907
If you get scared, you can always
hold my hand. I won't mind.

103
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,951
<i>But I thought you said he was gay...</i>

104
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,536
Shut up!

105
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,790
<i>- It was this way, right?
- Yeah.</i>

106
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,100
<i>Watch your step.</i>

107
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,736
<i>- What's that?
- More tombs.</i>

108
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,243
<i>Aargm</i>

109
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,744
<i>It was only a bat!</i>

110
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,080
What's happening, Liz?

111
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,291
<i>Yeah, so why didn't he die
of a heart attack?</i>

112
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,420
They're going down into a crypt,
Werner. It's dark.

113
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,214
<i>Hey, here's the way down.</i>

114
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,261
<i>Come on, Nancy, you're next.</i>

115
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,347
And now it's one of the girls.

116
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,809
Aren't they scared?

117
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,561
Yes, they are.

118
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,737
<i>No! I can't do it.
Pull me back up, somebody!</i>

119
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,156
<i>Just let yourself go.</i>

120
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,785
<i>- Come on.
- I can '1'.</i>

121
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,669
- Smoking is not allowed in here.
- Excuse us.

122

<i>We're nearly there, for God's sake,
just close your eyes, Jerry'll catch you.</i>

123
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,885
Hey, Tony...

124
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,095
(Giggling)

125
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,897
Hookers...fucking everywhere.

126
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,107
What do you care?

127
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,027
<i>Let's try down there.</i>

128
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,198
<i>This way, girls.</i>

129
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,408
<i>These cobwebs! Yuck!</i>

130
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,369
<i>I'm scared.</i>

131
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,540
' Liz?
' Yes?

132
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,795
- Are you scared?
- Yes, I am.

133
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,631
<i>Watch where you put your feet, girls.</i>

134
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,636
<i>See those cracks in the floor?</i>

135
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,430
<i>Under one of those you might
find yourself side by side</i>

136
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,433
<i>with Nostradamus' skull or ribcage.</i>

137
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,018
<i>(Laughter)</i>

138
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,856
<i>Cut it out. I came for a ride
on your new bike, not for this.</i>

139
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,775
<i>It's not fair.</i>

140
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,738
<i>Besides, I told my parents
I'd be home early tonight.</i>

141
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,369
<i>What do you say, Jerry?
Shall we tell them the truth?</i>

142
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,288
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Tell them.</i>

143
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,959
<i>We're the first people to set foot
in this crypt in centuries.</i>

144
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,294
<i>That hole we came through
only fell in this morning.</i>

145
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,299
<i>- How do you know?
- Me and Bob heard the crash.</i>

146
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:52,429
<i>We decided to come back tonight
so you could enjoy the discovery.</i>

147
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,557
- <i>Thanks</i> a <i>lot!</i>
- <i>Look, nothing's gonna hurt you</i>

148

<i>Vampires and all that stuff

<i>Hey, more tombs. Must've been
a real big-shot with a fancy one.</i>

150
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,738
<i>- Let's get out of here, please.
- Just a second.</i>

151
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,248
<i>Hey, look, it's got
some kind of seal on it.</i>

152
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,590
<i>Bob, give me some light down here.</i>

153
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:41,478
<i>Wait a second. It's gotta be a name.</i>

154
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:46,107
<i>N...O...S...</i>

155

You see that?

The same thing happened in the movie.

She put on that mask
and scratched herself. Get it?

348
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:13,213
Because of that scratch,
she became a demon,

349

an instrument of evil.

Right, we'll all go up there together.

475
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,872
Come on.

476
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,458
Come on! Move!

477
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:23,383
<i>J' Hey, little sister
Who's the only one?</i>

478
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:32,892
<i>J' I've been away for so long
So long</i>

479
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,311
<i>J' I let you go for so long</i>

480
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:39,566
<i>J' It's a nice day
To start again... J'</i>

481
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:42,610
Oh, it's even in my panties.

482
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,488
All of it! I said all of it!

483
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,991
You got trouble getting
your dope back now, Ripper.

484
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:52,161
Shut up! Unless you want me
to break your head?

485
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:58,418
Oh, that's Rambo talking, baby.
Ooh, yeah, tough Ripper.

486
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:02,297
Don't make me laugh, Baby Pig.
This takes concentration.

487
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,806
Come on!

488
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,730
Ken, you think this'll stop them?

489
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:21,190
I doubt it, but don't tell the others.

490
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,818
How many do you think
there are of them?

491
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,362
I don't know,
but I tell you one thing,

492
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:30,199
it's the last complimentary ticket
I'll ever accept from anybody ever again.

493
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:32,660
- Me, too.
- That makes three of us.

494
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:38,207
What the hell are you all doing there?
Watch the railings!

495
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,543
Make sure they don't get us from there.

496
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,587
Wait. Come on.

497
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:47,884
If you see anyone start climbing, shout!

498
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:50,762
The rest of us start
pounding on the wall.

499
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,390
Maybe the cavalry will hear us
and come to the rescue.

500
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,600
Let's hope.

501
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,022
I've finished.

502
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,232
This is me. I was one year old.

503
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:08,071
- Already selling your twat, huh?
- Fuck you!

504
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:11,658
Oh, lookee here.
There's snow in the valley.

505
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:20,500
Well, maybe there's some more
further down.

506
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:29,092
<i>(Radio) J' Start again</i>

507
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:34,222
<i>J' Come on, it's a nice day
for a white wedding</i>

508
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:42,230
<i>J' It's a nice day
to start again</i>

509
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:45,149
<i>J' It's a nice day to... J'</i>

510
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,276
Aargh!

511
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:50,154
You're a prick, Piggy!

512
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,992
Must be all the shit in the air
that's making you so nice.

513
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,879
Shh! Do you hear that?

514
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,299
(Dull thuds)

515
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:17,640
It's coming from the theatre.
It's a movie.

516
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:21,227
- No, that's not a movie.
- OK, so what is it, then?

517
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,397
It's Count Dracula!

518
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,249
Stop! I hear something.

519
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,835
Stop! Stop a minute!

520
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,672
I heard something! Listen! Listen!

521
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,802
What is it? Are they coming?

522
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:08,524
No, it's nothing.
Just the seats settling into place.

523
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,863
Relax, they can't get through there.

524
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,656
Come on, keep pounding!

525
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:58,074
- Tommy, someone's coming.
- Shit, let's get out of it.

526
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,883
Hey, it's like there's a room
behind the wall.

527
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,470
Come on, let's break it down!

528
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,857
We've got to get up to the gallery.
No one knows we're here.

529
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:33,317
- We're better off on our own.
- I want to join the others.

530
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,529
No, come on.
Let's try to find a way out.

531
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:48,040
Come on.

532
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:50,751
Come on.

533
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,646
Nothing doing in there.

534
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,529
No way out.

535
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,055
- This is another zero.
- It's just walls!

536
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,016
Cut it out, Cheryl,
you're not helping.

537
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,018
Look... Hey, wait!

538
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:53,522
Calm down! Get a hold of yourself!

539
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:56,067
(Cheryl) We're all gonna die!

540
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,534
(Hysterical screams)

541
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,363
Hey, kids!

542
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,159
We're parked illegally?
Sorry, officer.

543
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:49,412
We're on our way.
Just give me a second...

544
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,789
Everybody out of the car!
Put your hands on the trunk.

545
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,791
Let's go.

546
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,336
- Hey, I said put your hands...
- Fuck off, pig!

547
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,297
- Freeze, punk!
- Stop or I'll shoot!

548
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:02,425
Hold it, hold it. It's a blind alley.

549
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:09,015
Shit, dead-end!
Come on!

550
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,440
- We're trapped, damn it!
- No!

551
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,695
What the fuck? This way, come on!

552
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,208
- Where the hell did they go?
- Come on!

553
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,846
- Shh! Do you hear that?
- Yeah, I heard it.

554
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,639
Behind the car.

555
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,734
Hey, buddy.

556
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,571
Buddy, are you all right?

557
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,577
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him! Shoot him!

558
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,250
There should be enough room to crawl.

559
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,754
With luck, it'll lead outside.

560
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,303
What did I tell you?

561
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:31,347
I'll go first.

562
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,475
Give me your hand.

563
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:55,329
Where the fuck are we?

564
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:23,774
We're gonna make it.
This was a great idea.

565
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:40,583
Wait. What was that noise?

566
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,210
What noise? Keep moving.

567
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,842
We're in the movie theatre.

568
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:55,347
- Deserted. That's weird.
- Where was the noise coming from?

569
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:57,933
Who gives a shit? Let's go.

570
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,404
Come on!

571
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:22,333
You hear it'? Like something
scratching its nails inside of the shaft.

572
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,752
Behind you! Hurry, Hannah!

573
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,798
Faster!

574
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,972
You go first.

575
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,530
Christ! Now it's in front of us!

576
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,453
That's impossible. It can't be!

577
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,664
(Fierce growl)

578
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,555
- What kind of fucking place is this?
- What happened in here?

579
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,015
Find a way out!

580
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,600
Hey!

581
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,105
There's a door here. Come on!

582
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,277
Hey, come on,
move the machine.

583
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,487
There's a door right behind it.

584
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,578
Asshole!

585
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:46,000
This place goes nowhere. Let's go.

586
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:26,957
- Where's Nina?
- She's probably in the can.

587
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,053
Aargh!

588
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,894
Nina!

589
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,652
(Growls)

590
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:56,278
Oh, shit!

591
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,885
(Distant screams)

592
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,514
I can hear someone.

593
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,561
(Heavy thudding)

594
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:33,982
You're right. Help's coming.
We've been rescued!

595
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:36,402
Thank God. Help's arrived!

596
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:39,238
Don't you understand?
We've been saved!

597
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:44,034
Come on, get a move on.
Give me a hand!

598
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,079
Stop! Downstairs is full of them!
What are you doing?

599
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:50,124
Stop tearing down the barricades!

600
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:56,630
No! No! What are you doing?

601
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:59,466
Don't unblock the exits!
They're gonna get us!

602
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,388
Shit! Shit!

603
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:09,393
(Growls)

604
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:14,356
- What are they after?
- I don't know, Baby Pig. You ask them.

605
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,025
It's us they want, asshole.
See you in hell!

606
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:19,361
Cheryl, Kathy, let's go!

607
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:24,408
Ken, come on, let's go. Come on!

608
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,581
Aargh!

609
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:36,378
(Panicked screams)

610
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,228
(Gasps)

611
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:02,279
Ungh...ungh...

612
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,256
Ah! Ah!

613
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,061
Aaaiee!

614
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:40,776
Hurry!

615
01:03:58,377 --> 01:04:00,254
Aaaiee!

616
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,850
Aargh! No!

617
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:01,356
(LOW growl)

618
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:04,902
- I can hear them
- Easy.

619
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:06,528
George!

620
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,989
Help me! She fainted.

621
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,116
Kathy.

622
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,750
Oh, no! Kathy! Kathy?

623
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,460
Come on! Let's go!

624
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,462
(Growls)

625
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,313
Hey. Hey!

626
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,815
Come here!
There's an air-conditioning vent here.

627
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,990
We could crawl inside.

628
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,034
At least they won't see us in there.

629
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:57,746
Shall I go first?

630
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,499
No, we'd better get Kathy in there first.

631
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,918
I don't think she's capable
of fending for herself.

632
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:05,879
Yeah, you're right. Kathy, hey.

633
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:08,674
Kathy. Kathy!

634
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,801
Stand up, please!

635
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:17,808
This place. Where am I?

636
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,148
Kathy!

637
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,863
Maybe she's in shock.

638
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,084
(Growls) Who are you?

639
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:06,773
Oh, my God!

640
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,028
Make it stop!

641
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:12,654
Kathy!

642
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,240
No!

643
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:17,284
Kathy!

644
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:20,954
No, stop! No! Don't do it!

645
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,459
- Kathy! Oh, my God!
- It wasn't Kathy!

646
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:28,378
Not the Kathy you knew!
Understand?

647
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,714
It wasn't her.

648
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:34,926
It wasn't her!

649
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,476
Look!

650
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:48,857
Look at her back!

651
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:12,672
<i>It got me.</i>

652
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:14,966
- It's nothing, Ken.
- I'll turn into one of them.

653
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:16,927
It's nothing, Ken.

654
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:19,346
Stay away from me!

655
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,556
- Stay away from me!
- It's nothing, Ken!

656
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,141
Leave me alone!

657
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,478
Try and save yourself!

658
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,899
- We can't leave him alone like that.
- Come on.

659
01:08:57,551 --> 01:09:01,513
Fight it, Ken. Fight it!
You can do it!

660
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:07,936
You're still here? Go away!

661
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:13,483
I don't want you to see me like this.
Please, go away!

662
01:09:17,696 --> 01:09:19,281
OK, OK!

663
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,118
OK.

664
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:31,710
No, George. Wait.

665
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:36,715
Do me a favour.

666
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,426
A last favour as a friend.

667
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,386
Sure, Ken.

668
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,436
Kill me with this!

669
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:54,482
No, I can't do that, Ken!

670
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,569
Do it, George!

671
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,540
It's them!
They're coming up the stairs!

672
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,222
- Take it!
- No.

673
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:29,517
They're coming!
Take it, George! Kill me!

674
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:32,395
Don't let me become like them!

675
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:35,607
Come on! Kill me!

676
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,735
They're coming!

677
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,082
Aargh!

678
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,759
Aargh!

679
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,598
George!

680
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,558
Cheryl!

681
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:49,723
<i>J' Fog in the streets

682
01:11:49,848 --> 01:11:52,517

01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,167
Uh...oh...

702
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:47,632
Uh...

703
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:15,076
(Rumbling overhead)

704
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:19,164
- What's going on?
- My God, that noise!

705
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:06,104
(Growls)

706
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,483
(Growls)

707
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:12,986
Come on, Cheryl!

Come on!

714
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:53,276
Up there!
That's where we have to go.

715
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:58,364
It's all right, Cheryl.
We're gonna make it!

716
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:02,702
Come on. Take this. This, too.

717
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:21,262
Give it here.

718
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:28,978
- See that winch at your feet?
- Yeah.

719
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:31,230
Give me the end of the wire.

720
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,551
Quick, give me the starter.

721
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:08,142
Come on! Give me your hand!
Pull yourself up! Come on!

722
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:12,522
- I can't anymore.
- Push! Don't let go!

723
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:52,103
(Yells and gunfire)

724
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:11,497
(Creak)

725
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:22,717
George! George!

726
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,637
No! No!

727
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:33,478
Run, Cheryl!

728
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:35,980
Run!

729
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:03,925

This way!

733

<i>J' On your feet

<i>J' Yeah, come on, baby
Can you feel the heat?</i>

735
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:46,193
<i>J' Move up close
The boys are out to get you</i>

736
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:51,824

<i>J' Stamp your feet
This place is really rockin'</i>

743
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:33,449
<i>J' I said everybody up
Everybody, everybody up</i>

744
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:39,288
<i>J' I said everybody up
Everybody, everybody up... J'</i>

745
01:22:54,971 --> 01:22:56,889
(Growls)

746
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,933
Come on, Cheryl! Come on!

747
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:05,022
I can't! I can't!

748
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,983
I can't!

749
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:11,112
They're right behind us. Hurry!

750
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:31,757
Over here! Hurry up!

751
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:34,635
Jump in, hurry up! Jump in!

752
01:23:35,845 --> 01:23:37,304
Come on!

753
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:39,557
Go!

754
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:53,988
On the right, June.

755
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:05,207
Good shot!

756
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:09,545
Welcome aboard.
There are more weapons on the floor.

757
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,547
Kurt.

758
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:22,016
- Where are we going?
- Out in the country.

759
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:25,269
Just a second. Hey, dad!

760
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,981
Dad, they want to know
where we're going.

761
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:31,233
As far from here as possible.

762
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:37,406
West. We saw some lights in the sky.
Maybe not everything's lost.

763
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:42,661
Maybe there's still some place
where we can start a new life.

764
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,630
Aargh!
