1
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:52,601
11:55. Almost midnight.

2
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:56,237
Enough time for one more story.

3
00:00:56,279 --> 00:01:01,273
One more story
before 12:00...

4
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:03,752
just to keep us warm.

5
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:11,724
In five minutes,
it will be the 21st of April.

6
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:16,995
One hundred years ago,
on the 21st of April...

7
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:20,935
out on the waters
around Spivey Point...

8
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,704
a small clipper ship
drew toward land.

9
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:30,441
Suddenly, out of the night,
the fog rolled in.

10
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,449
For a moment,
they could see nothing...

11
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:35,951
not a foot ahead of them.

12
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:39,683
Then they saw a light.

13
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:45,184
By God, it was a fire
burning on the shore...

14
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:49,756
strong enough to penetrate
the swirling mist.

15
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,237
They steered a course
toward the light...

16
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:58,469
but it was a campfire
like this one.

17
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:02,911
The ship crashed
against the rocks.

18
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:05,244
The hull sheared in two.

19
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:08,251
The mast snapped like a twig...

20
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:13,279
and the wreckage sank
with all the men aboard.

21
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,918
At the bottom of the sea...

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,760
lay the ''Elizabeth Dane''
with her crew...

23
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:24,255
their lungs
filled with salt water...

24
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:28,931
their eyes open
and staring into the darkness.

25
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:32,931
And above,
as suddenly as it had come...

26
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:34,773
the fog lifted...

27
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,609
receded
back across the ocean...

28
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:40,309
and never came again.

29
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,615
But it is told
by the fishermen...

30
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:46,622
and their fathers
and grandfathers...

31
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:51,059
that when the fog returns
to Antonio Bay...

32
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:55,053
the men
at the bottom of the sea...

33
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:58,556
out in the water
by Spivey Point...

34
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:03,471
will rise up
and search for the campfire...

35
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:10,003
that led them
to their dark and icy death.

36
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:18,287
Twelve o' clock,
the 21st of April.

37
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,403
It's twelve midnight...

38
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,810
and we just started
into the witching hour.

39
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:20,213
This is Stevie Wayne,
on top of the world tonight.

40
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,617
And I'll be here
right up until about 1:00.

41
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:53,281
I'm all through, Father.

42
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:56,012
Oh, thank you, Bennett.

43
00:04:56,052 --> 00:05:00,785
I won't need you
until four tomorrow, Bennett.

44
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:02,155
Yes, sir.

45
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,395
Would you like something to
keep you warm on the way home?

46
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:09,398
No, thank you.
Father, can I get paid?

47
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:17,470
Why don't you come in at six
instead of four tomorrow?

48
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:19,668
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,819
Bennett?

50
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,759
It's 59 degrees outside.

51
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:51,528
And let me be the first
to wish Antonio Bay...

52
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,035
a happy birthday.

53
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,596
We're one hundred years old
today.

54
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,869
The weatherman's
been trying to spoil it for us.

55
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:01,001
He says we may be
in for some rain tonight.

56
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:05,242
But from where I'm sitting,
it looks like clear skies.

57
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:08,079
I think the weatherman's
been working too hard.

58
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,052
Well, I'll stay here
for another hour...

59
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:12,384
just to see if he's right.

60
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:14,947
And I'm inviting you
to stay here with me.

61
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:20,256
There's a cutter run aground
over here on the east bay, over.

62
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:25,730
Global 1X5.
It's the ''Lady Belle Pacific.''

63
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:29,967
Serial number 024KL596. Over.

64
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:32,406
Global 1X5,
the ''Lady Belle Pacific''...

65
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:34,467
is seaworthy, no major damage.

66
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:36,069
Why don't you
send a tow on over here...

67
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:39,104
about a quarter mile
above the Boatel. Over.

68
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:40,815
This is KAB,
Antonio Bay, California.

69
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:45,184
Six minutes after midnight.

70
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:46,456
Haven't heard
from the weatherman yet...

71
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,964
so I can't say for sure
about that rain...

72
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:53,094
but there's a full moon
and no clouds in the sky.

73
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:56,094
I'm Stevie Wayne.

74
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:58,573
And if you don't have anything
to do right now...

75
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:02,601
I'll be here playing music
all through the witching hour.

76
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:08,575
Even if you do
have something to do...

77
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:10,745
keep me turned on for a while...

78
00:12:10,787 --> 00:12:13,585
and I'll try my best
to do the same for you.

79
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:14,817
OK!

80
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:38,937
-How far you going?
-Other side of town.

81
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:40,312
That's close enough.

82
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:44,984
-Make it?
-Yeah. Thank you.

83
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:57,160
Sip?

84
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,690
Thanks.

85
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:08,334
Listen,
I never hitchhiked before.

86
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,470
I just really want
to be careful.

87
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:12,413
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

88
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:14,939
Are you weird?

89
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:17,145
Yes, I am.

90
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:19,177
Yes, I am weird.

91
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:21,747
You are weird.
Thank God you're weird.

92
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,624
The last one was so normal,
it was disgusting.

93
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,457
He picked me up
in Santa Barbara.

94
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:28,657
By the time we got to Carmel
he wanted to marry me.

95
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:31,360
Oh, yeah. I thought
you never hitchhiked before.

96
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,496
Not before last week.

97
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,407
You're my...

98
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:42,001
thirteenth ride.

99
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:44,774
Oh, great. Weird and unlucky.

100
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:47,442
We'll see.

101
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,714
Look out!

102
00:13:58,694 --> 00:13:59,956
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

103
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:02,226
-You're sure?
-I think so.

104
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:03,823
What the hell was--

105
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:12,501
It's exactly twelve minutes
after midnight...

106
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,407
and this is Stevie Wayne.

107
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,274
Let's get out of here.

108
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:21,347
I'm high tonight in the KAB
lighthouse on Spivey Point.

109
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:23,909
And in case you've forgotten,
it's April 21st...

110
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:26,183
and a happy birthday
for Antonio Bay.

111
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:29,089
Now, there's a celebration
planned for tonight.

112
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,925
So if you're so excited
about it you can't sleep...

113
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:35,556
well, stay up with me...

114
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:40,900
and I'll figure out some way
to keep you occupied.

115
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:42,097
Or not.

116
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,610
-KAB.
-Hi, sweetheart.

117
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:51,806
Hi, Dan. What have you got?

118
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:53,712
Well, I'm just calling
to see if you're lonely...

119
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:54,977
if there's anything
I can do about it.

120
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:56,746
Never lonely, Dan.

121
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,048
I thought
you were off work at 8:00.

122
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:00,487
I changed shifts to make it
to the big party tonight.

123
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:01,649
Will you be there?

124
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:05,149
Until I can talk someone else...

125
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:08,425
into giving up city life
for Antonio Bay, I'm it.

126
00:15:08,464 --> 00:15:11,433
-And ''it'' means day and night.
-Too much work.

127
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,435
That's what I get
for owning a station.

128
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:14,561
And if you don't tell me
why you called...

129
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:16,902
in about fifteen seconds,
I'll have to hang up on you.

130
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:19,407
-Want something to talk about?
-Anything.

131
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,842
I've got a position
on a trawler about...

132
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:25,540
fifteen miles out
called the ''Sea Grass.''

133
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,139
And I've got
something on my scope--

134
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:29,083
appears to be a fog bank.

135
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:32,451
It's about 25 miles out,
moving in their direction.

136
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:36,219
Thanks, Dan.
That's worth about ten seconds.

137
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,284
I'm on the air. Bye.

138
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,623
Ahoy, maties.

139
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,534
This is KAB, Antonio Bay.

140
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,438
Stevie Wayne here
beaming a signal across the sea.

141
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:54,705
To the men of the ''Sea Grass,''
fifteen miles out tonight...

142
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,109
a warm hello...

143
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:58,875
and keep a watch out
for that fog bank...

144
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,711
heading in from the east.

145
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,217
Now, in the meantime...

146
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:04,879
relax with me
while I play this song...

147
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,549
from the Coupe DeVilles,
dedicated just to you.

148
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:11,287
Boy, would I like to meet her.

149
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:12,555
I saw her
at a grocery store one day.

150
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:14,563
-And?
-You would like to meet her.

151
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:17,566
She's crazy.
There's no fog bank out there.

152
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,067
What do you know about her?

153
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:21,433
-She owns that lighthouse.
-I know that.

154
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,233
Her son plays Little League
with my kid brother.

155
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,569
She's a mother?

156
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,234
I thought
you were happily married.

157
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:27,902
Not that happy.

158
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,741
No fog bank out there.

159
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:40,289
There's a fog bank out there.

160
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:45,150
All right. I'm drunk enough.

161
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:47,128
Let's go back.

162
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:48,994
All right, all right.

163
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,660
Al, come here.

164
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:58,003
-Just give him a hand.
-Come here.

165
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:12,345
What was that?

166
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,108
Come here.

167
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,611
What was that?

168
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:56,892
It's the generator.

169
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,327
Wha--wha...

170
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,702
Al.

171
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:23,649
It's gone.

172
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:25,557
There was just a ship out there.

173
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:27,221
Al, listen.

174
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:29,390
Nothing.

175
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:31,593
-Listen.
-Who's there?

176
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:44,837
Who is that?

177
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,425
Al, it's right beside us.

178
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,098
It's big, Al. It's a ship.

179
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,900
It's a big ship!

180
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,407
What happened?
Did you get wet?

181
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:11,429
It's 12:43...

182
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,833
and I've got
four in a row for you...

183
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:16,133
right here on KAB.

184
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:55,107
Nothing but water, Stevie.

185
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,107
But it sure beats Chicago.

186
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:06,918
KAB.

187
00:21:06,956 --> 00:21:08,651
I like what you said...

188
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:10,989
but for your information,
you lied.

189
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:13,392
The fog bank
has moved due west...

190
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:17,058
and probably
missed the ship entirely.

191
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,930
Well, my gauges must be wrong.

192
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:20,663
I've got a wind blowing
due east.

193
00:21:20,703 --> 00:21:23,263
What kind of a fog
blows against the wind?

194
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,773
-You got me.
-I'm not so sure I want you.

195
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:27,605
You're just
a voice on the phone.

196
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:30,942
You're a voice on the radio.
We'd make a perfect couple.

197
00:21:32,948 --> 00:21:35,974
You let me take you to dinner
tonight, I'll prove it to you.

198
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:37,918
Sorry, Dan.

199
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:41,184
My idea of perfection
is a voice on the phone.

200
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:43,919
OK, mystery lady.

201
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,359
-Good night.
-Good night.

202
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,442
Not bad.

203
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:12,744
I started a week ago
in San Diego...

204
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:16,189
right up the coast,
five drawings a day.

205
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:18,022
It'll probably take me a month
to get to Vancouver...

206
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,618
and if I can sell them
for five bucks apiece...

207
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:21,960
-I'll be rich.
-Yeah.

208
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,767
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

209
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:28,827
What's your name?

210
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:31,533
-Elizabeth.
-Nick.

211
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:34,303
-Hello, Nick.
-Hi.

212
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:38,171
Is that where you're from,
San Diego?

213
00:22:38,213 --> 00:22:40,613
Wait a minute. You said,
''Can I ask something?''

214
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:42,844
Well, something,
to me, means one thing.

215
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:45,547
-San Diego is two things.
-OK.

216
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:52,282
Pasadena, and a lot of money.

217
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,761
Never a chance to do
anything I want to do.

218
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:01,630
What do you want to do?

219
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,764
I don't know.

220
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:08,004
That's OK. Me, neither.

221
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:10,773
I think I got to have this one.
Can I buy it?

222
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,106
The drawing's free.

223
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,638
It's 1:00, straight up...

224
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:17,270
the end of the witching hour,
and time for me to sign off.

225
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:26,247
So until tomorrow night,
at 6 P.M...

226
00:24:26,288 --> 00:24:28,415
when KAB
comes back on the air...

227
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:31,221
this is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

228
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,161
hoping you have
a nice rest of the night.

229
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:34,176
Hey, Mom !

230
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:42,447
Mom, come on. Get up.
Look what I found.

231
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:47,121
Andy...I love you...

232
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:49,596
but sometimes
you're a real pain.

233
00:26:49,631 --> 00:26:51,258
Sure, Mom, but look it.

234
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,631
First, it was a gold coin.

235
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:55,432
Then it turned into
this neat piece of wood.

236
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,028
This is one of those times.

237
00:26:57,072 --> 00:26:58,767
Look at it, Mom.

238
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:04,946
Good morning, Andrew.

239
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,073
Did you have a nice time
last night?

240
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:10,107
Yeah. Old Mr. Machen
told us ghost stories.

241
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:12,882
Did you thank Mrs. Kobritz
for bringing you home?

242
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:16,220
Yes, ma'am. Mom, can I have
a stomach pounder and a Coke?

243
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:19,659
-After lunch.
-OK.

244
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:21,390
I'm gonna go look
for another one.

245
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,921
Maybe this time
I can get the gold coin.

246
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:50,487
Where the hell is he?

247
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:52,652
Rolled out of here
at 4:15 yesterday.

248
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:55,060
-That's the last I saw of him.
-Al said 7:30, right here.

249
00:27:55,097 --> 00:27:57,190
You know Al.
If I were you--

250
00:27:57,232 --> 00:27:58,722
Did you call
the Coast Guard, Hank?

251
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,792
Nick, they probably
got drunk last night.

252
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:03,703
-No, he wouldn't do that.
-He'd do anything.

253
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:06,003
Al and I got drunk so many times
I can't count them all...

254
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:09,340
but we never got so shitfaced
we couldn't make it back in.

255
00:28:09,378 --> 00:28:11,369
He's too good a sailor
to stay out there all night...

256
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:12,710
and not let somebody know.

257
00:28:12,748 --> 00:28:15,581
-You sound like his wife.
-Just his friend.

258
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:17,414
-You worry too much, Nick.
-Yeah.

259
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:21,884
Where are we going?

260
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:24,892
I'm going to talk Ashcroft
into taking out his boat...

261
00:28:24,926 --> 00:28:26,484
and looking for the ''Sea Grass.''

262
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:27,995
Who's Ashcroft?

263
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,998
Someone who owes me a favor.

264
00:28:30,032 --> 00:28:32,000
Can I come along?

265
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:34,502
I thought you had to move on
to Vancouver?

266
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:35,764
Eventually.

267
00:28:42,944 --> 00:28:45,208
The sheriff
will drive his own car.

268
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:48,045
The mayor and his wife
are to be picked up at 6:45...

269
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,074
and brought to the mayor's box.

270
00:28:50,118 --> 00:28:52,609
Then we will have speeches
by the mayor...

271
00:28:52,654 --> 00:28:54,519
the sheriff, and me.

272
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:56,854
-Do you have my notes?
-Yes, ma'am.

273
00:28:56,892 --> 00:28:58,689
Then we will pass out
the candles...

274
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:00,490
and begin the procession.

275
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:03,430
Then I will go home
and pass out.

276
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:05,660
I'm almost afraid to look.

277
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,962
Well...

278
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,839
Not bad. Not bad at all.

279
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:13,704
A work of art.

280
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:16,870
Sandy, just be civil to me
for another five hours.

281
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:18,504
That's all I ask.

282
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:20,014
Let's see now.

283
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,845
The candles.
Did you order the candles?

284
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:23,612
What a thought--a candlelight
procession with no candles.

285
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:25,916
All taken care of.

286
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:28,218
And the promotional material--
did you get that to Stevie?

287
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:30,690
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

288
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:33,489
Sandy, you can be a very
annoying person at times...

289
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:34,893
but you do keep me together.

290
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,921
Thank you, Mrs. Williams.

291
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:10,057
...Spivey Point.
As of 1:57 today...

292
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:11,998
the ''Sea Grass''
had not responded...

293
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,933
to radio communication.

294
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:15,994
The Coast Guard
has begun a sweep...

295
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:17,732
south from Watley...

296
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,399
around Arcom Reef...

297
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:21,602
and should be
in the area of Spivey Point...

298
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:24,111
in approximately one hour.

299
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:27,445
Repeating this bulletin
from the Coast Guard...

300
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:29,450
be on the look out
for the ''Sea Grass''...

301
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:31,281
a thirty-foot trawler...

302
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,756
last seen approximately 15 miles
east of Spivey Point.

303
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,781
If you sight this vessel...

304
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:40,522
please notify
the Coast Guard immediately.

305
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:55,642
Nick, can I ask you a question?

306
00:30:55,677 --> 00:30:57,076
Is it always like this?

307
00:30:57,112 --> 00:31:00,081
It's always different.

308
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:02,140
You're worried, aren't you?

309
00:31:02,184 --> 00:31:05,551
Yeah. She can get real mean.

310
00:31:05,587 --> 00:31:06,952
There.

311
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:21,168
If I can just get through
the speeches without yawning.

312
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:23,467
-I couldn't sleep last night.
-Too excited?

313
00:31:23,505 --> 00:31:25,996
No. Al went out on his boat
last night and didn't come home.

314
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,601
-He still isn't back.
-Mrs. Williams!

315
00:31:28,643 --> 00:31:30,076
I called the Coast Guard,
and they said...

316
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:32,238
''Oh, he might have had
engine trouble.''

317
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,441
They said not to worry.

318
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:36,109
He was complaining
about his boat last week.

319
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:37,618
Maybe you ought to go home.

320
00:31:37,652 --> 00:31:40,143
That's the last place
I want to go.

321
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:42,122
My dog started to bark
at 12:00 last night...

322
00:31:42,157 --> 00:31:44,125
and didn't stop
until 6:00 this morning.

323
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,421
What happened?

324
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,587
He was pointed toward the ocean
and growling.

325
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:48,789
What does that tell you?

326
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,230
My dog goes crazy and
decides to bark at the water.

327
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:53,234
I heard the church bells
at midnight...

328
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:55,065
as I started
to drift off to sleep...

329
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:57,799
and my car alarm went off
for absolutely no reason.

330
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,399
-Really?
-Woke up the whole block.

331
00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:03,138
This town sits around for
100 years and nothing happens...

332
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:05,510
and then one night,
the whole place falls apart.

333
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,813
Take this line, too.

334
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:14,447
Al! Tommy! Dick!

335
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:21,652
Cabin and steering house
are empty.

336
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:23,960
Maybe somebody picked them up.

337
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,431
There's water in the generator.

338
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:29,630
But the deck is dry as a bone.

339
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:58,024
There you have it.
My next project...

340
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:00,899
restoration of
the Morgantown Road Cemetery.

341
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:03,165
It's historical.
Our ancestors are buried here.

342
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,900
-It'll cost a lot.
-Come on. So?

343
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,737
This town should be proud
of its past.

344
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:09,368
But trying to get
anyone involved...

345
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,845
in community affairs
is like pulling teeth.

346
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,074
Better get
the estimates ready...

347
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:14,581
for the council meeting
next month.

348
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:15,742
Yes, ma'am.

349
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:17,251
Sandy, you're
the only person I know...

350
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,583
who can make ''Yes, ma'am''
sound like ''Screw you.''

351
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:20,883
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:22,048
Now, if we'll just say
a little prayer...

353
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,115
asking that
he not be in his cups.

354
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:32,294
Not a good sign.

355
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:37,530
Father Malone?

356
00:33:45,513 --> 00:33:47,811
Another bad sign.

357
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:50,579
You try the study,
and I'll look up front.

358
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:18,407
-Jesus!
-I'm sorry, Mrs. Williams.

359
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:21,142
-Mrs. Williams--
-Are you all right?

360
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:23,275
I have something to show you.

361
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:31,291
''December 9.

362
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:35,228
''Met with Blake this evening
for the first time.

363
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:36,890
''He stood in the shadows...

364
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:40,731
''to prevent me from getting
a clear look at his face.

365
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:44,364
''What a vile disease this is.

366
00:34:44,406 --> 00:34:48,365
''He is a rich man
with a cursed condition...

367
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,934
''but this does not
prevent him...

368
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:52,037
''from trying to better
his situation...

369
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,412
''and that of his comrades
at the colony.''

370
00:35:15,136 --> 00:35:17,661
Every single gauge is broken.

371
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,566
-All the glass is shattered.
-Remind you of something?

372
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,601
-Last night.
-Your truck.

373
00:35:32,754 --> 00:35:34,779
Thermometer's broken.

374
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:39,284
The mercury's stuck
at twenty degrees.

375
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:46,564
No water got in here,
but something awful cold did.

376
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:50,731
''December 11.
Blake's proposition is simple.

377
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:53,206
''He wants to move off
Tanzier Island...

378
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:57,905
''and relocate the entire colony
just north of here.

379
00:35:57,946 --> 00:35:59,937
''He has purchased
a clipper ship...

380
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:05,476
''called the 'Elizabeth Dane.'
with part of his fortune....

381
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,320
''and asks only for permission
to settle here.

382
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:12,554
''I must balance my feelings
of mercy and compassion...

383
00:36:12,594 --> 00:36:14,653
''toward this poor man...

384
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:17,221
''with my revulsion
at the thought...

385
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:20,701
''of a leper colony
only a mile distant.''

386
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,915
It's rusted to the wall.

387
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:45,825
It was on.

388
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:55,703
They drank a lot of beer
last night.

389
00:36:55,737 --> 00:36:57,364
Every night.

390
00:36:57,405 --> 00:36:59,703
What's it like?

391
00:36:59,741 --> 00:37:02,710
It's always the same.
Room starts spinning--

392
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:03,938
I mean fishing.

393
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:08,542
You fish.

394
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,210
The only thing I know
about fishing...

395
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:11,582
is you use a lot of worms.

396
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:15,053
Salt water.

397
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:19,883
She was clean two nights ago.
I checked her out myself.

398
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:23,261
Now it's as if she's been
turned over in the water.

399
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:29,529
''April 20.
The six of us met tonight.

400
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:31,539
''From midnight until 1:00...

401
00:37:31,573 --> 00:37:35,031
''we planned the death
of Blake and his comrades.

402
00:37:35,076 --> 00:37:37,738
''I tell myself
that Blake's gold...

403
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:39,747
''will allow
the church to be built...

404
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:42,477
''and our small settlement
to become a township...

405
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:45,748
''but it does not soothe
the horror that I feel...

406
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:49,450
''being an accomplice to murder.''

407
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:55,959
Now what?

408
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:58,056
Wait for the Coast Guard.

409
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:04,895
I'm sorry.

410
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:06,201
What for?

411
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,232
Ever since you picked me up,
things have been going wrong.

412
00:38:09,277 --> 00:38:11,336
The clock broke, the windows
have been breaking...

413
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:12,937
the weirdo at the door
last night.

414
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:16,212
-That isn't you.
-I'm not so sure.

415
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,048
Things seem to happen to me.

416
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:20,418
I'm bad luck.

417
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:26,620
I don't believe in luck,
good or bad.

418
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:28,925
I don't believe
in anything much...

419
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:33,924
Something did happen once.

420
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,738
My father was a fisherman.

421
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:43,233
He ran a trawler
out of Whitely Reef.

422
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:47,611
One night, late,
he was coming back in.

423
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:51,676
He was out beyond the reef,
out near Spivey Point.

424
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,415
He looked to windward...

425
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:57,947
and saw a brig
under shortsail...

426
00:38:57,992 --> 00:39:00,222
heading right for him.

427
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,723
And he radioed.
There was no reply.

428
00:39:06,768 --> 00:39:11,364
Nothing moved on the deck,
but she held her course.

429
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:15,736
My dad and two of his hands
boarded the brig--

430
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:18,439
the ''Resa Jane.''

431
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:21,880
No one was on board.

432
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,884
There was food on the table...

433
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:26,216
and a hot, steaming
cup of coffee.

434
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:30,884
But underneath, the tin cup
was rusted to the table.

435
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:34,326
And then something caught
my father's eye.

436
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:40,858
It was a gold doubloon
minted in Spain, 1867.

437
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:43,564
My dad picked up the coin,
put it in his breast pocket...

438
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:45,902
of his jacket,
and zippered it up.

439
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,740
He came home,
told us the story.

440
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:54,373
And he unzippered the pocket
to give me the coin.

441
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:55,939
It was gone.

442
00:39:58,286 --> 00:40:00,277
I think I'll go
to Vancouver now.

443
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:10,393
''April 21st. The deed is done.

444
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:13,093

445
00:40:13,134 --> 00:40:16,934

451
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:35,988
I couldn't read any further.

452

Your grandfather
had a way with words.

453

Our celebration tonight
is a travesty.

454

00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:35,493
Father, where did you find this?

478
00:43:35,536 --> 00:43:39,233
My grandfather hid his sins
in the walls.

479
00:43:39,273 --> 00:43:41,741
When did you find it?

480
00:43:41,776 --> 00:43:44,904
Last night,
just after midnight.

481
00:43:44,946 --> 00:43:46,777
What difference does it make?

482
00:43:46,814 --> 00:43:49,647
That's the same time
the rest of the town fell apart.

483
00:43:54,455 --> 00:43:57,754
And the same time
the six conspirators met...

484
00:43:57,792 --> 00:44:00,192
one hundred years ago.

485
00:44:00,227 --> 00:44:02,354
It's really getting late.

486
00:44:02,396 --> 00:44:05,092
There's not much we can do
about any of this.

487
00:44:05,132 --> 00:44:08,829
Are you going to give
the benediction tonight, Father?

488
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:12,270
Antonio Bay has a curse on it.

489
00:44:12,306 --> 00:44:14,240
Do we take that as a ''no''?

490
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:16,470
Maybe it's just as well.

491
00:44:18,913 --> 00:44:21,882
We're leaving now, Father.

492
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,941
Will you be all right?

493
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:31,956
I'm going to call Dr. Thayden
and ask him to just drop by.

494
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:35,019
I think you're taking
all of this much too seriously.

495
00:44:35,062 --> 00:44:38,623
We're all cursed,
Mrs. Williams...

496
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,293
all of us.

497
00:44:52,513 --> 00:44:57,780
1340 KAB.

498
00:44:57,818 --> 00:45:00,048
Forty-four.

499
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:06,993
The smooth sound.
Fabulous 1340 KAB.

500
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:15,258
Forty-five.

501
00:45:15,302 --> 00:45:21,434
From the top of the world,
fabulous 1340 KAB...

502
00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:25,036
Antonio Bay, California.

503
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,603
Forty-six.

504
00:45:27,782 --> 00:45:30,250
The smooth sound...

505
00:45:31,752 --> 00:45:35,916
Something like
an albatross around the neck...

506
00:45:35,956 --> 00:45:38,424
No. More like a millstone...

507
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:41,257
a plumbing stone, by God.

508
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:43,661
Damn them all!

509
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,371
Nine.
Every hour on the hour...

510
00:46:01,415 --> 00:46:03,645
KAB news and weather.

511
00:46:03,684 --> 00:46:05,447
Ten.

512
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:10,583
Every hour on the hour,
KAB news and weather.

513
00:46:12,927 --> 00:46:16,158
End side two, KAB promos.

514
00:46:26,874 --> 00:46:30,401
How can a man drown
and not touch the water?

515
00:46:30,444 --> 00:46:33,072
He had water in his lungs...

516
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:36,845
salt water around his mouth,
seaweed in his clothes.

517
00:46:36,884 --> 00:46:38,909
Unless...

518
00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:43,681
You OK?

519
00:46:43,724 --> 00:46:46,591
Did you see his eyes?

520
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:48,788
Yeah, I saw his eyes.

521
00:46:56,103 --> 00:46:58,936
Andy, the telephone.

522
00:46:58,973 --> 00:47:00,907
I got it, Mrs. Kobritz.

523
00:47:06,347 --> 00:47:08,212
Andy, where did you get
that piece of driftwood?

524
00:47:08,249 --> 00:47:10,843
I told you, Mom.
On the beach this morning.

525
00:47:10,885 --> 00:47:12,375
-Where?
-By the rocks.

526
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:13,818
What was it doing?

527
00:47:13,854 --> 00:47:15,822
First it was a gold coin...

528
00:47:15,856 --> 00:47:17,949
and then it turned
into the wood.

529
00:47:17,992 --> 00:47:20,051
Andy, I want you
to stay away from the rocks.

530
00:47:20,094 --> 00:47:21,220
Do you understand?

531
00:47:21,262 --> 00:47:23,560
Don't pick up anything else
off the beach.

532
00:47:23,597 --> 00:47:25,064
It didn't belong to anybody.

533
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:26,726
I know, honey.
It's all right.

534
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:28,564
I just don't want you
to pick up anything else...

535
00:47:28,602 --> 00:47:30,695
unless you come
and get me first. OK?

536
00:47:30,738 --> 00:47:32,501
OK.

537
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,405
Is Mrs. Kobritz there?

538
00:47:34,441 --> 00:47:36,409
She just came in.

539
00:47:36,443 --> 00:47:40,846
OK. I have to start
the broadcast now.

540
00:47:40,881 --> 00:47:43,281
Andy, promise me you won't
leave the house tonight.

541
00:47:43,317 --> 00:47:45,080
Oh, Mom.

542
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,246
Promise me.

543
00:47:47,288 --> 00:47:49,654
Oh, OK.

544
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,851
I love you, Andy.

545
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:54,224
Me, too, Mom. Bye.

546
00:48:21,255 --> 00:48:22,916
Ahoy, maties.

547
00:48:22,957 --> 00:48:26,290
This is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

548
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:31,287
and KAB, Antonio Bay,
California, is on the air.

549
00:48:31,332 --> 00:48:33,630
I've lined up some tunes
to help you celebrate...

550
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:36,500
the 100th birthday
of Antonio Bay.

551
00:48:36,537 --> 00:48:40,439
So let's get down to business.

552
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:03,922
What did your mother want, Andy?

553
00:49:03,964 --> 00:49:05,363
Nothing.

554
00:49:05,399 --> 00:49:07,629
It must have been something.

555
00:49:07,668 --> 00:49:10,262
Nothing.

556
00:49:10,304 --> 00:49:13,740
Mrs. Kobritz,
what are those clouds out there?

557
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:22,344
Evidence of deep
penetrating wounds...

558
00:49:22,383 --> 00:49:23,873
in each ocular orbit...

559
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:26,385
entering into
the cranial cavity.

560
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,945
Also jagged lacerations
to the face...

561
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:30,650
Do you want to wait out front?

562
00:49:30,691 --> 00:49:32,556
I'd rather wait with you.

563
00:49:32,593 --> 00:49:33,958
OK.

564
00:49:33,994 --> 00:49:35,985
Thorax has been crushed...

565
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,363
and the lungs
are filled with fluid.

566
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,560
Talk to you a minute?

567
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,903
She gonna be all right?

568
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:52,036
-Did you talk to Simms?
-I got him on the radio.

569
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,910
He's coming back
from Bodega Bay.

570
00:49:53,947 --> 00:49:55,414
What the hell
happened out there?

571
00:49:55,449 --> 00:49:57,246
There was rust
all over everything.

572
00:49:57,284 --> 00:49:58,979
It was like the boat had been
out there a long time...

573
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:00,418
taking on water.

574
00:50:00,454 --> 00:50:02,251
He was down below
near the bunks.

575
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:04,587
Nick, his wounds
are covered with algae...

576
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,751
his lungs are full...

577
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:07,818
and there's silt
under his fingernails.

578
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:11,092
I saw Dick Baxter
three days ago in Salinas.

579
00:50:11,131 --> 00:50:12,496
Now he's lying in there
on the table...

580
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:15,001
looking like he's been
underwater for a month.

581
00:50:37,491 --> 00:50:40,016
-Do you feel that?
-I'll tell you what happens.

582
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,461
-It just got cold in here.
-The water acts like ice.

583
00:50:54,241 --> 00:50:56,732
A whole body would take a year
to decompose...

584
00:50:56,777 --> 00:50:59,245
longer if it was down
far enough, cold enough.

585
00:50:59,279 --> 00:51:01,076
But he was on the boat.

586
00:51:01,115 --> 00:51:02,514
He was below decks.

587
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:06,542
No. Dick Baxter
died in the ocean.

588
00:51:22,469 --> 00:51:24,596
You remember those three kids
that went diving...

589
00:51:24,638 --> 00:51:26,970
for that old boat off the Point?

590
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:29,100
We got to them,
they'd been down for a week...

591
00:51:29,143 --> 00:51:30,269
maybe ten days.

592
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:34,007
I swear to you right now,
he's been down longer.

593
00:52:56,797 --> 00:52:59,163
And while the wrecking
of that beautiful ship...

594
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:01,497
upon our coast was,
of course...

595
00:53:01,535 --> 00:53:04,561
a tragedy to those
who were on the ship...

596
00:53:04,605 --> 00:53:07,904
it still was the catalyst
that brought together...

597
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:11,001
all of the people
of this wonderful area.

598
00:53:11,044 --> 00:53:12,443
They came together...

599
00:53:12,479 --> 00:53:15,880
they formed the charter
for Antonio Bay...

600
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,976
the charter by which you have
voted for these councilmen...

601
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:21,613
who sit on my left
and my right tonight.

602
00:53:22,856 --> 00:53:25,654
The Coast Guard's
looking for them.

603
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:27,990
They're going to cover the area
pretty good...

604
00:53:28,028 --> 00:53:31,896
so, really,
all we can do is wait.

605
00:53:31,932 --> 00:53:34,093
I understand, Sheriff.

606
00:53:34,134 --> 00:53:35,624
Thank you.

607
00:53:37,404 --> 00:53:39,599
I got to go. I'm up next.

608
00:53:42,776 --> 00:53:45,176
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Williams.

609
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:51,616
It's funny,
but all I can think about...

610
00:53:51,652 --> 00:53:54,883
is my silly dog
barking all night...

611
00:53:54,922 --> 00:53:59,916
and me just wishing
Al would come home.

612
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:06,225
Now, we can't have
the chairlady...

613
00:54:06,266 --> 00:54:08,757
of the birthday celebration
in tears, can we?

614
00:54:08,802 --> 00:54:10,235
I don't think you ought
to go out there.

615
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:14,138
I think that's exactly
what I ought to do.

616
00:54:14,174 --> 00:54:16,404
I appreciate
all your help, Nick.

617
00:54:16,443 --> 00:54:17,774
That's all right.

618
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:38,320
I searched
a long time for this one.

619
00:54:38,365 --> 00:54:40,731
I hope you remember it.

620
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:46,935
Happy 100th, Antonio Bay.

621
00:54:46,974 --> 00:54:50,341
The ceremonies are underway
at Shelby Square.

622
00:54:50,377 --> 00:54:53,278
And we'll have that candlelight
procession in about an hour.

623
00:54:53,313 --> 00:54:57,044
So if you hurry,
you can still make it.

624
00:54:57,084 --> 00:54:58,551
The Coast Guard
dropped me a note.

625
00:54:58,585 --> 00:55:01,645
They found the ''Sea Grass''
earlier this afternoon...

626
00:55:01,688 --> 00:55:03,178
but there's no further word...

627
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:07,057
as to the condition of the ship
or the men on-board.

628
00:55:07,094 --> 00:55:10,427
I'll keep you posted
as the news comes in to me.

629
00:55:10,464 --> 00:55:13,297
Hope no one else gets lost
out there in the fog.

630
00:55:17,537 --> 00:55:19,095
I'll be right back.

631
00:55:28,782 --> 00:55:30,409
Hello. My name's Nick Castle.

632
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,247
You don't know me,
but I'm one of the men...

633
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:34,185
who found the ''Sea Grass''
this afternoon.

634
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:36,519
I'm sorry.
I don't have any further word.

635
00:55:36,556 --> 00:55:38,922
I understand.
That's not what I called about.

636
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:42,690
You just mentioned something
now on the radio about the fog.

637
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:56,033
This is going to sound
a little strange, but...

638
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:57,976
I saw the fog last night...

639
00:55:58,011 --> 00:55:59,535
out in the ocean
in the distance.

640
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:02,377
It was...glowing.

641
00:56:08,522 --> 00:56:09,648
What seemed to be happening...

642
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,715
is that the wind
was moving due east...

643
00:56:11,758 --> 00:56:14,056
and the fog
just kept moving west.

644
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:15,618
I know that sounds
completely crazy.

645
00:56:15,662 --> 00:56:17,095
Right now it doesn't.

646
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,291
Something happened last night.

647
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:21,061
At the same time
that fog was moving in...

648
00:56:21,101 --> 00:56:23,092
this whole town went unglued.

649
00:56:23,136 --> 00:56:24,603
Hold on.

650
00:56:28,575 --> 00:56:31,066
I've got some more
birthday music for you...

651
00:56:31,111 --> 00:56:32,976
and a few other surprises.

652
00:56:33,013 --> 00:56:36,278
Then I'll be ready to check in
with the weatherman.

653
00:56:36,316 --> 00:56:39,774
And the weatherman will be
ready to check in with you.

654
00:56:50,597 --> 00:56:52,565
-Hello?
-I'm still here.

655
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:53,930
There's one other thing.

656
00:56:53,967 --> 00:56:56,697
It may have nothing
to do with the ''Sea Grass''.

657
00:56:56,737 --> 00:56:58,796
Anything.

658
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:02,570
My son found a piece
of driftwood this morning.

659
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:11,646
Hey, Mel. How you doing?

660
00:57:11,685 --> 00:57:14,882
Your girlfriend on the radio
has been talking about you.

661
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:16,889
I came in tonight
just to keep her happy.

662
00:57:16,923 --> 00:57:18,515
I thought
you were off tonight.

663
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:19,718
I love my job.

664
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,059
You can tell them all
about that big fog bank...

665
00:57:23,096 --> 00:57:24,757
moving in
the southeast there.

666
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:27,392
-Where?
-You'll see it.

667
00:57:27,434 --> 00:57:29,402
I'm on my way.
See you tomorrow.

668
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:31,427
Yeah, Mel. I'll see you.

669
00:57:41,314 --> 00:57:42,838
There you are.

670
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:54,451
I've got to make a run
out to the lighthouse...

671
00:57:54,494 --> 00:57:56,018
at Spivey Point.
Want to come?

672
00:57:56,062 --> 00:57:57,324
-Sure.
-Come on.

673
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:04,468
Hi, sweetheart!

674
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:05,732
I thought you were celebrating.

675
00:58:05,772 --> 00:58:08,570
I couldn't spend an evening
without you.

676
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:11,270
I'm up in about thirty seconds.
What's new?

677
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:13,472
Another fog bank.

678
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:14,946
Where?

679
00:58:14,981 --> 00:58:17,245
It's coming in off the ocean
from the southeast.

680
00:58:17,284 --> 00:58:19,047
It's heading inland.
It should be here...

681
00:58:19,085 --> 00:58:20,780
at the weather station
in ten minutes.

682
00:58:20,821 --> 00:58:23,381
Dan, hold on.

683
00:58:24,724 --> 00:58:26,783
I have a special
weather bulletin.

684
00:58:26,827 --> 00:58:28,385
The tri-county
weather station...

685
00:58:28,428 --> 00:58:31,795
reports a fog bank moving
southeast along the coast.

686
00:58:31,832 --> 00:58:33,527
For whoever's interested...

687
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:36,900
that's the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.

688
00:58:36,937 --> 00:58:40,930
Repeating--a fog bank is moving
southwest along the coast...

689
00:58:40,974 --> 00:58:44,102
toward the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.

690
00:58:48,915 --> 00:58:50,746
Dan, are you still there?

691
00:58:50,784 --> 00:58:53,082
I'm still here.

692
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,144
You sound different tonight...

693
00:58:55,188 --> 00:58:57,213
kind of intense.

694
00:58:57,257 --> 00:58:59,885
I just feel like talking,
that's all.

695
00:58:59,926 --> 00:59:02,224
You told me you didn't like
to talk on the telephone...

696
00:59:02,262 --> 00:59:04,059
because you talked
on the radio all day.

697
00:59:04,097 --> 00:59:05,291
Dan, where's the fog now?

698
00:59:05,332 --> 00:59:08,233
It should be
right outside my door now.

699
00:59:11,404 --> 00:59:13,201
Hold on.
I'm going to try something.

700
00:59:18,778 --> 00:59:19,972
I can see it.

701
00:59:20,013 --> 00:59:22,743
Now, what is the big deal?

702
00:59:22,782 --> 00:59:24,841
You've seen fog once,
you seen it for life.

703
00:59:24,885 --> 00:59:26,910
There's something
different about this fog.

704
00:59:26,953 --> 00:59:29,751
It glows.
Can't you see anything yet?

705
00:59:29,789 --> 00:59:33,247
Glows? Oh, I get it.

706
00:59:33,293 --> 00:59:35,261
You take something
to keep you going, right?

707
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,957
Does it make you feel
a little weird sometimes?

708
00:59:39,132 --> 00:59:41,930
-Hey.
-What?

709
00:59:41,968 --> 00:59:43,936
The lights went out.

710
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:47,269
Everything's going crazy.

711
00:59:47,307 --> 00:59:49,707
Barometer's falling,
temperature's dropping.

712
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:51,711
Dan, what is it?

713
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:53,144
What the hell's that?

714
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:54,874
Dan, what is it?
What's happening?

715
00:59:54,915 --> 00:59:57,383
What is it?
What's happening?

716
00:59:57,417 --> 00:59:59,885
Someone's shining a light
through the window.

717
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,217
Dan, listen to me.

718
01:00:01,254 --> 01:00:04,087
Hold on, sweetheart.
I want to check this out.

719
01:00:06,927 --> 01:00:10,055
Dan, stay on the phone!

720
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:23,408
This has got to be a joke.

721
01:00:28,381 --> 01:00:30,906
Someone's at the front door,
sweetheart...

722
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:32,816
playing a stupid joke.

723
01:00:32,852 --> 01:00:35,548
And whoever it is...

724
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:37,886
they ain't gonna like
finding me home.

725
01:00:37,924 --> 01:00:39,721
Dan, stay away from the door!

726
01:00:56,609 --> 01:00:57,906
Anybody here?

727
01:01:01,414 --> 01:01:03,712
Some asshole got drunk
and started taking...

728
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,514
this 100-year-old business
too seriously.

729
01:01:59,472 --> 01:02:03,533
And so all of us living here
in Antonio Bay today...

730
01:02:03,576 --> 01:02:05,703
owe a great debt
of gratitude...

731
01:02:05,745 --> 01:02:08,179
to those men and women
a hundred years ago...

732
01:02:08,214 --> 01:02:11,377
who struggled and sacrificed
to make this town grow...

733
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:13,113
into what it is today.

734
01:02:13,153 --> 01:02:17,613
And it's up to us to keep
their kind of spirit alive.

735
01:02:22,595 --> 01:02:23,823
I have an urgent bulletin.

736
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:27,594
Will Sheriff David Simms please
contact KAB Radio immediately?

737
01:02:27,634 --> 01:02:30,694
The number is 555-2131.

738
01:02:30,737 --> 01:02:32,466
This is an emergency.

739
01:02:34,641 --> 01:02:38,975
So we must redouble our efforts,
work together.

740
01:02:39,012 --> 01:02:41,537
We have a vital,
thriving community.

741
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:44,049
And I say
we have to keep it that way.

742
01:02:47,187 --> 01:02:49,121
This is an emergency.

743
01:02:49,155 --> 01:02:52,613
Sheriff David Simms,
please contact KAB immediately.

744
01:02:52,659 --> 01:02:56,390
555-2131.
This is an emergency.

745
01:03:11,544 --> 01:03:12,738
Sheriff Simms?

746
01:03:18,718 --> 01:03:20,549
And so, as we make our way...

747
01:03:20,587 --> 01:03:22,248
to the presentation
of the statue...

748
01:03:22,288 --> 01:03:24,586
I think we should all
keep in mind...

749
01:03:24,624 --> 01:03:26,216
the significance
of this night...

750
01:03:26,259 --> 01:03:28,591
for every citizen
of Antonio Bay.

751
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:20,575
We should all proceed
over to the statue.

752
01:04:20,613 --> 01:04:22,672
Single file. Don't push.

753
01:04:22,715 --> 01:04:24,307
Take your time.

754
01:04:50,543 --> 01:04:52,511
Start!

755
01:04:52,545 --> 01:04:54,536
Please start!

756
01:04:58,918 --> 01:05:00,681
Why did all the lights go out?

757
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,657
One of the lines
are probably down, Andy.

758
01:05:05,692 --> 01:05:09,389
They usually take care
of these things right away.

759
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:12,125
I think it's kind of neat.

760
01:05:39,425 --> 01:05:41,290
What's that now?

761
01:05:57,844 --> 01:05:59,368
Start!

762
01:06:05,118 --> 01:06:07,518
Andy! Andy,
get out of the house!

763
01:06:07,553 --> 01:06:09,885
Mrs. Kobritz, get him
out of the house! Please! Run!

764
01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:12,857
I think maybe we better
close all the windows, Andy.

765
01:06:12,892 --> 01:06:14,587
Are your bedroom windows
closed?

766
01:06:14,627 --> 01:06:15,889
I'll go see.

767
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:27,205
Someone listen to me!
My son is trapped!

768
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,209
887 White Beach Lane!
My son is trapped by the fog!

769
01:06:30,243 --> 01:06:32,541
Andy, get out of the house!
Run!

770
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:40,109
Wow! Look at that!

771
01:06:40,153 --> 01:06:41,916
Are your windows all closed?

772
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:43,285
Yes, ma'am.

773
01:06:43,323 --> 01:06:44,881
What about
your mother's bedroom?

774
01:06:56,636 --> 01:06:59,696
Please, someone!
My son is trapped!

775
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:04,175
Andy, run! Run!

776
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:06,474
Mrs. Kobritz, run!

777
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:12,313
Andy, I want you
to go to your room.

778
01:07:12,352 --> 01:07:13,910
I think I should stay.

779
01:07:13,953 --> 01:07:16,319
-Right now.
-Yes.

780
01:07:37,377 --> 01:07:38,605
Go to your room.

781
01:07:38,644 --> 01:07:40,305
I want to see who it is.

782
01:07:41,714 --> 01:07:43,739
Can't I stay
for two more seconds?

783
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:49,347
OK, I'm going.

784
01:08:03,202 --> 01:08:05,193
Mrs. Kobritz?

785
01:08:15,248 --> 01:08:17,580
Please. My son is trapped!

786
01:08:17,617 --> 01:08:21,519
887 White Beach Lane.

787
01:08:21,554 --> 01:08:24,148
Someone get
to 887 White Beach Lane.

788
01:08:36,903 --> 01:08:40,703
My son is trapped!
Get him out of the fog!

789
01:08:47,413 --> 01:08:49,404
Please, someone!

790
01:08:50,683 --> 01:08:52,241
My son is trapped!

791
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:03,094
Come on!
Get out of there, now!

792
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:14,667
Andy, run! Run!

793
01:09:17,276 --> 01:09:19,141
Come on! Come on.

794
01:09:19,178 --> 01:09:20,941
Go! Go!

795
01:09:33,226 --> 01:09:34,488
Come on!

796
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:37,792
Don't pop it.
Try to ease it out.

797
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,388
Oh, Jesus.

798
01:09:45,471 --> 01:09:47,029
Come on, baby!

799
01:09:47,073 --> 01:09:50,531
Come on. It'll go.

800
01:09:50,576 --> 01:09:51,736
Reverse! Reverse!

801
01:09:51,777 --> 01:09:53,210
Come on!

802
01:10:00,253 --> 01:10:02,118
Come on, do it! Do it!

803
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:29,104
...Stevie Wayne
for the last twenty minutes.

804
01:10:29,315 --> 01:10:31,579
I think it's best
we call it a night here.

805
01:10:31,617 --> 01:10:33,084
Another five or ten minutes...

806
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:34,916
everyone will have
seen the statue.

807
01:10:34,954 --> 01:10:37,422
All right, but let's get them
through as quickly as we can.

808
01:10:37,456 --> 01:10:39,924
Probably be a good idea
if you went home, Kathy.

809
01:10:39,959 --> 01:10:41,586
We can close up here.

810
01:10:41,627 --> 01:10:42,924
I should see it through
to the end.

811
01:10:42,962 --> 01:10:45,260
Mrs. Williams,
there's nothing more to do here.

812
01:10:45,298 --> 01:10:47,664
Let me take you home.

813
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,533
A little annoying,
but you're right.

814
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,697
-Would you please take me?
-Yes, ma'am.

815
01:10:52,738 --> 01:10:55,400
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Thank you.

816
01:11:00,146 --> 01:11:02,512
Andy, I don't even know
if you can hear me.

817
01:11:02,548 --> 01:11:04,641
I'm sorry that
I didn't come for you...

818
01:11:04,684 --> 01:11:05,844
that I wasn't there.

819
01:11:07,253 --> 01:11:09,744
Andy, please understand.

820
01:11:11,591 --> 01:11:14,424
I have to stay here.

821
01:11:25,371 --> 01:11:29,637
The fog is moving inland...

822
01:11:29,675 --> 01:11:31,575
away from the beach...

823
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,114
towards Antonio Bay.

824
01:11:42,088 --> 01:11:44,249
It's over by the armory.

825
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:47,020
I can't remember the name.

826
01:11:47,059 --> 01:11:49,857
No, no--
I think it's Chestnut.

827
01:11:54,634 --> 01:11:57,694
Feel like listening
to some music?

828
01:11:57,737 --> 01:12:00,228
Sure.

829
01:12:00,272 --> 01:12:02,137
It's moving faster now.

830
01:12:02,174 --> 01:12:03,664
Up Regent Avenue.

831
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:05,700
Up to the end
of Smallhouse Road.

832
01:12:05,745 --> 01:12:07,178
What is that?

833
01:12:09,882 --> 01:12:12,442
It's just hitting
the outskirts of town.

834
01:12:12,485 --> 01:12:14,476
Broad Street.

835
01:12:15,921 --> 01:12:18,412
Clay Street.

836
01:12:44,784 --> 01:12:46,615
It's moving down 10th Street.

837
01:12:46,652 --> 01:12:50,110
Get inside and lock your doors.
Close your windows.

838
01:12:50,156 --> 01:12:52,386
There's something in the fog.

839
01:12:58,964 --> 01:13:01,296
If you're on the south side
of town, go north.

840
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,301
Stay away from the fog.

841
01:13:11,711 --> 01:13:13,804
Richardsville Pike
up to Beacon Hill...

842
01:13:13,846 --> 01:13:16,212
is the only clear road.

843
01:13:16,248 --> 01:13:18,216
Up to the church.

844
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,344
If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.

845
01:13:29,195 --> 01:13:31,629
Now the junction at 101
is cut off.

846
01:13:31,664 --> 01:13:35,122
If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.

847
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:37,067
It's the only place
left to go.

848
01:13:37,103 --> 01:13:39,936
Get to the old church
on Beacon Hill.

849
01:13:48,114 --> 01:13:49,911
-It cut us off!
-Where is it?

850
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:51,678
-Right behind us.
-Quick, inside.

851
01:13:55,154 --> 01:13:56,849
Come on.

852
01:13:56,889 --> 01:13:58,049
Hurry.

853
01:13:59,925 --> 01:14:02,860
Father, is there a basement
or cellar in here?

854
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:04,920
-We can't hide any longer.
-We have to try!

855
01:14:04,964 --> 01:14:06,898
No matter where we go,
it will find us.

856
01:14:11,337 --> 01:14:13,032
Is there a basement
or cellar here?

857
01:14:13,072 --> 01:14:15,040
There's a study in back.
I'll show you the way.

858
01:14:15,074 --> 01:14:16,507
Come on. Hurry.

859
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:18,908
Give me that.

860
01:14:47,973 --> 01:14:49,907
The fog is sweeping inland.

861
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:54,243
It's almost like a wall
across the east end of town.

862
01:15:18,838 --> 01:15:20,703
Blake and his men
have come for us.

863
01:15:20,739 --> 01:15:22,331
-Who's Blake?
-It's in the journal.

864
01:15:22,374 --> 01:15:23,500
-What journal?
-I don't know.

865
01:15:23,542 --> 01:15:25,840
-We're cursed.
-What are you talking about?

866
01:15:25,878 --> 01:15:29,075
-Where is the journal?
-It's in there.

867
01:15:35,154 --> 01:15:36,485
Over by the window?

868
01:15:36,522 --> 01:15:39,548
-It can do us no good now.
-It's all we got.

869
01:15:39,592 --> 01:15:41,287
If anything happens,
just lock the door.

870
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:43,659
Get back. Shut the door.

871
01:16:23,903 --> 01:16:25,097
''Six must die.''

872
01:16:25,137 --> 01:16:26,399
The three men
on the ''Sea Grass''.

873
01:16:26,438 --> 01:16:28,030
And the weatherman is four.

874
01:16:28,073 --> 01:16:29,540
-Mrs. Kobritz.
-Yeah, five.

875
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:31,042
And one of us makes six.

876
01:16:31,076 --> 01:16:32,703
That's what they want.
They've come back...

877
01:16:32,745 --> 01:16:34,372
for the six
original conspirators.

878
01:16:34,413 --> 01:16:35,846
There must be something
in here!

879
01:16:35,881 --> 01:16:37,371
It's me they want.
I am the sixth!

880
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:38,542
Why would they want you?

881
01:16:38,584 --> 01:16:39,881
Wait, Father.
You didn't read us this.

882
01:16:39,919 --> 01:16:41,887
''Were it possible
to raise the dead...

883
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:44,219
''I would return Blake's fortune
to him intact...

884
01:16:44,256 --> 01:16:47,191
''save the money spent
on these walls that hide it.''

885
01:16:47,226 --> 01:16:49,126
''My fellow conspirators
believe...

886
01:16:49,161 --> 01:16:51,152
''that the confiscated fortune
has been stolen...

887
01:16:51,196 --> 01:16:53,824
''from them, when in fact,
I am the thief...

888
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:56,334
''and God's temple
is the tomb of gold.''

889
01:16:56,368 --> 01:16:59,895
''I am the thief,
and God's temple--''

890
01:17:01,774 --> 01:17:03,969
Now, wait. Get rid of that.

891
01:17:05,577 --> 01:17:08,137
Get out of the way!

892
01:17:29,268 --> 01:17:32,704
-Give me a hand.
-Andy, stay right there.

893
01:17:56,395 --> 01:17:58,090
The gold.

894
01:18:17,016 --> 01:18:19,314
He melted down the gold
into this.

895
01:18:23,389 --> 01:18:25,254
Somebody help her!

896
01:18:38,404 --> 01:18:40,167
Don't go in there!

897
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,947
Blake, I have your gold.

898
01:19:31,356 --> 01:19:32,516
Blake?

899
01:20:10,596 --> 01:20:12,530
This is your gold, Blake.

900
01:20:12,564 --> 01:20:15,931
My grandfather stole it
from you.

901
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:20,768
I'm the one
who must answer for it.

902
01:20:33,452 --> 01:20:36,444
I'm the sixth conspirator.

903
01:20:38,457 --> 01:20:41,585
I'm Father Malone.

904
01:20:41,627 --> 01:20:43,788
Take me.

905
01:21:40,152 --> 01:21:41,949
Father Malone!

906
01:24:01,626 --> 01:24:02,991
Look.

907
01:24:13,238 --> 01:24:14,899
It's going away.

908
01:24:50,876 --> 01:24:54,312
I don't know what happened
to Antonio Bay tonight.

909
01:24:54,346 --> 01:24:57,679
Something came out of the fog...

910
01:24:57,716 --> 01:25:00,617
and tried to destroy us.

911
01:25:00,652 --> 01:25:03,678
In one moment, it vanished.

912
01:25:03,722 --> 01:25:07,214
But if this has been
anything but a nightmare...

913
01:25:07,259 --> 01:25:11,127
and if we don't wake up to find
ourselves safe in our beds...

914
01:25:11,163 --> 01:25:14,929
it could come again.

915
01:25:14,966 --> 01:25:18,402
To the ships at sea
who can hear my voice...

916
01:25:18,437 --> 01:25:22,669
look across the water
into the darkness.

917
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:26,236
Look for the fog.

918
01:25:54,739 --> 01:25:57,867
Why not six, Blake?

919
01:26:00,378 --> 01:26:02,471
Why not me?
