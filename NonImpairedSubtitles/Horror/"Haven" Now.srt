00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,413
- Hello, Dove.
- Croatoan.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:06,539
Not "Dad"?

4
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,389
Clearly we have a lot of catching up to do.

5
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:11,309
What they did to you, turning you
into the Barn's controller...

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,977
Could you do it to me?

7
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,646
Vince! What have you done?

8
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,256
What I had to.

9
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:19,768
(Audrey) It's a Holloway trouble,

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,054
where a building merges with a person.

11
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:23,222
[phone rings]

12
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,223
Are you trying to talk to me?

13
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,785
It's Laverne.

14
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,894
Who am I talking to right now? Duke?

15
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,112
No.

16
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,948
This is what I am.

17
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,283
Croatoan's inside your head.

18
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,701
You can force him out.

19
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,878
Don't let him control you.

20
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,067
Daddy?

21
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,244
I need to teach you a lesson.

22
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,012
[crack] [screams]

23
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:50,916
You can control the Troubles
that you take from people?

24
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,002
They're gifts, and in the right hands,

25
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:54,303
they can accomplish anything.

26
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,071
I created you.

27
00:00:58,176 --> 00:01:01,143
All the times that you
asked me to kill for you,

28
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:04,430
look what I have become,
what you turned me into.

29
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,489
I got snacks from the vending machine.

30
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,741
Please tell me you got the P3 unstuck,

31
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,193
and that's a Baby Ruth in your hand.

32
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:18,744
[groans]

33
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,615
- Sorry.
- Ah.

34
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:23,949
Granola.

35
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,618
Laverne controls the vending machine now.

36
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,745
She only dispenses the healthy stuff.

37
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:30,256
A little healthy wouldn't hurt.

38
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,543
How you holding up?

39
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:35,961
You must be exhausted.

40
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,264
Croatoan locked me in a child's room

41
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:43,352
and said he was going to help
my friends, make them happy.

42
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,888
It was scarier than a flat-out threat.

43
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,325
Sounds terrifying.

44
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:49,525
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,644
He was different than I expected.

46
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,362
So much hurt.

47
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,561
He really thinks that he's
doing the right thing.

48
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,399
By getting you to help him trouble people.

49
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,034
It's more than that.

50
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,153
He's a father that wants his daughter back.

51
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,539
But you are not his daughter.

52
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,458
Mara was. She's dead.

53
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,130
But when he looks at me, he sees her.

54
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,753
Which is why we need to
get this thing fixed,

55
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:21,223
get that Barn built, send that
monster back to the Void.

56
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,478
Has Vince come up with anything yet?

57
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:25,960
No, not yet.

58
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,930
Dwight's working on it with him.

59
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:30,075
He's got him stashed away just in case...

60
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,268
In case Duke comes after him.

61
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,486
Has anybody seen him since
he took the census?

62
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,688
No.

63
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,106
If Croatoan gets those Troubles,

64
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:38,274
he's going to use them against us.

65
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:40,555
He is not gonna get the chance.

66
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,195
We're gonna get Duke back.

67
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,367
[dramatic music]

70
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,366
Victor Kirby.

71
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,904
I knew your aunt.

72
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,330
She could see the future too.

73
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,392
Anyone she touched...

74
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:35,454
Vanessa knew exactly how
they were going to die.

75
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,036
What do you want?

76
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,543
Your trouble.

77
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:41,086
But why?

78
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,574
It's horrible.

79
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,307
Not for Croatoan.

80
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:48,260
He can turn it into a power,

81
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,397
use it to show his daughter

82
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,817
how amazing the future can be

83
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,319
if she joins him.

84
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,338
Please don't.

85
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,276
You look so worried, Kirby.

86
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:07,079
But don't you know what's going to happen?

87
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,949
Haven't you seen how you're
going to meet your end?

88
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,534
I've tried,

89
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:16,038
but I can only see how
other people die, not me.

90
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,416
If you had seen it,

91
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:22,044
it would've looked a lot like this.

92
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,796
[groans]

93
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,302
I know how it ends for you, Crocker.

94
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,633
I can see it.

95
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,610
Just like Vanessa did.

96
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,536
I'm not that man anymore.

Vince says there's nothing
in his new programming

99
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:30,025
to fix the Aether core.

100
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:32,561
I was afraid of that.
How's he doing otherwise?

101
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:34,029
He says he feels mostly the same,

102
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,397
but it's gotta be weird.

103
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,828
Being turned into an
otherworldly crystal, yeah.

104
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:41,987
I'd feel better if I at least
knew where you hid it.

105
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,375
You can trust me, Nathan.

106
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,745
Of course I can.

107
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:50,663
You keep working with Vince.

108
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,548
We'll try to and figure out a
way to fix the core on our end.

109
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,551
I'll call you if we manage
to come up with something.

110
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:02,381
Why don't you want to
tell them about Lizzie?

111
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,927
Because you're afraid they'll take her?

112
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,890
I need to know what she is.

113
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:09,431
An Aether creature maybe...

114
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,120
Like the ones William made?

115
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,550
Or a product of a trouble?

116
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:16,021
A resurrection trouble.

117
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:18,824
You don't think she could
actually be Lizzie?

118
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:21,243
No. My daughter's dead.

119
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,419
It's Duke. He's out there.

120
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:34,006
(Lizzie) Daddy, what's wrong?

121
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:35,708
Nothing, honey. Everything's fine.

122
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,543
Why is he just standing there?

123
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,211
What's he waiting for?

124
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:40,929
Okay, I want you to take
Lizzie to the back stairs.

125
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,848
If Duke comes in, I want you to both run.

126
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,133
But what about you?

127
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:45,384
I'll buy you some time.

128
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:46,385
Couple of minutes.

129
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:47,770
You can't confront him.

130
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:49,971
I can't let him get a hold of you.

131
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:52,524
He might be here for Lizzie.

132
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:54,193
Please.

133
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:10,376
Lizzie, I need you to go
with Uncle Vince, okay?

134
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,533
No, I want to stay here with you.

135
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:16,904
Honey, it's a game.

136
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:18,405
You and Vince go hide

137
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:20,324
and see how long it takes
for me to find you.

138
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,159
Oh, I love hide and seek.

139
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:24,495
Okay, you count down from
100, and we'll hide.

140
00:07:24,497 --> 00:07:26,964
Come on. I know a good hiding spot.

141
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:36,890

00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,545
97...

144
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,770
Oh, he was stabbed in the chest.

145
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:51,522
It looks like Duke's work, all right.

146
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:55,047
Poor Victor. He didn't stand a chance.

147
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:56,994
Anyway, I gotta go.

Intern's watching baby Aaron,

149
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:01,164

Vickie.

00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,377
Vickie still has her sketching trouble.

153
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,882
So maybe if she can draw the Aether core,

154
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:19,349
she can put it back together.

155
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,852
- She can make it whole again.
- It's worth a shot.

156
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:23,631
I'll have her meet us at the station.

157
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,141
Croatoan.

158
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:45,489
You must be Nathan.

159
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:47,711
An "ask questions later" kind of guy.

160
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:49,580
- I like you already.
- You bastard...

161
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:53,083
Nathan, the Troubles he holds...
We can't hurt him.

162
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:55,586
Smart, pragmatic.

163
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:56,920
That's my girl.

164
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:58,589
And right as usual.

165
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:03,427
Strike me, and your
internal organs liquefy.

166
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:05,762
A trouble I gathered from your census.

167
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:09,349
Why did Duke kill Kirby?
To take his trouble?

168
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:12,569
Collecting Troubles was
what I designed him to do.

169
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,439
So you could take them with
you, use them for your revenge?

170
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:17,274
No, you're going to design those Troubles.

171
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:20,777
Oh, these are for my personal use.

172
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:22,079
So what, you're just here

173
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,780
to make sure Duke stays on schedule?

174
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:25,575
No, no, Duke's fine.

175
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,906
I'm here to talk to you, Nathan.

176
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,719
You're a lucky man.

177
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:36,677
From my conversations with my daughter,

178
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,428
I can tell she loves you very much.

179
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,013
And she'll do anything to make you happy.

180
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:42,902
And that's very hard to find.

181
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,802
Leave Nathan alone.

182
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:49,168
As I promised you, I'm here to help him.

183
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:51,908
Nathan,

184
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:58,231
what if I could offer you
a new life far from here,

185
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:02,869
the life you've always wanted
with the woman you love?

186
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,658
Audrey.

187
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,035
There she is, Nathan.

188
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:18,051
Everything you've ever wanted.

189
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,188
And I'm giving her to you.

190
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:32,608
You want to give me a copy of Audrey?

191
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:35,192
One that loves you with all her heart.

192
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,279
I'll take you both outside the shroud,

193
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:42,115
set you up in a new life
far away from here.

194
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:44,901
Neither one of you will remember Haven.

195
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:48,738
Nathan, I'm offering you a fresh start.

196
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,576
Why?

197
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:54,411
Why would you do this?

198
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:56,609
Oh, Dove,

199
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:00,917
what is coming...

200
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:05,672
It'll be such a wonderful time for us.

201
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,841
You don't have to worry about Nathan.

202
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:11,096
This way you know he's taken
care of, that he's happy.

203
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:14,187
You think that copy can make me happy?

204
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:16,870
I assure you you will never know

205
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:19,584
or be able to tell the difference.

206
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,655
Well, if she's so perfect,

207
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:23,490
why don't you just keep her for yourself?

208
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:24,991
I said you would never know the difference.

209
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:26,293
I'm her father. I would know.

210
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:28,445
You think I would abandon Audrey

211
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,995
for some illusion?

212
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,586
I belong here in Haven
with Audrey, fighting you.

213
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:09,927
What do you want, Duke?

214
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:12,762
Question is, what do you want, Dwight?

215
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,648
Right now I want to kill you
for murdering my friends

216
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,099
and betraying us to Croatoan.

217
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:19,902
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.

218
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:22,405
Do you have a second choice,

219
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:25,675
like, perhaps, raising your daughter?

220
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:27,526
My daughter's dead.

221
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:30,579
No. She's right in there.

222
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:33,165
- That's not Lizzie.
- Are you sure?

223
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,702
Croatoan used a very special
trouble to bring her back.

224
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:38,788
He must really like you.

225
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,456
Yeah. Why did he send you here, Duke?

226
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,791
What does Croatoan want?

227
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:44,396
The controller crystal.

228
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,013
What makes him think I have it?

229
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,782
He knows that you have it.

230
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:50,933
The crystal isn't here.

231
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:53,352
Then go and get it.

232
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:57,640
Deliver it to Croatoan, and
he will let you keep Lizzie.

233
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,275
I think you know me better than that, Duke.

234
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:02,028
Then he will come for her.

235
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:06,532
Or maybe he'll just send me.

236
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:16,792
Where's Lizzie?

237
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:17,993
Upstairs.

238
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,569
What did Duke want?

239
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,883
He said Lizzie's some kind
of gift from Croatoan,

240
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,217
an example of his power.

241
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:27,303
He's going to let you keep her?

242
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,545
I'm not even sure she is a her.

243
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:32,258
I mean, come on, Vince, she
can't really be my daughter.

244
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,643
I see the way you look at her, Dwight.

245
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:36,729
It's not just that child.

246
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:39,515
A part of you has been
brought back to life here.

247
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:50,414
Losing Lizzie...

248
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:55,039
watching those bullets tear
into her, it was like dying.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,367
For a long time, I wanted to die.

250
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:04,250
Thought about ending it, a lot.

251
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,643
I know.

252
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,543
I was afraid for you.

253
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:09,628
[sighs]

254
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,873
It took so long to crawl out of that hole.

255
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:19,972
I can't go through that again.

256
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:21,466
I know.

257
00:14:22,643 --> 00:14:25,694
And to this day, I feel responsible.

258
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:27,509
I led the Guard.

259
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:30,876
They were my men who shot Lizzie.

260
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:34,309
I couldn't make it right back then.

261
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,406
I can never make it right.

262
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:43,546
How terribly ironic if Croatoan can.

263
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,675
I can't believe I let you
involve Intern in all of this.

264
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,093
What if Croatoan finds out

265
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:00,396
she's helping you and sends Duke after her?

266
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,231
If my trouble can fix it,

267
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,849
you know I have to try, Gloria.

268
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:05,768
Yeah, well, it doesn't
mean I have to like it.

269
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,318
It's really good, Vickie.

270
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:11,273
When I'm done, if we fold it here,

271
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,075
the crack in the core should close.

272
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,245
And then we will give it to Vince,

273
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:18,247
and finally we can build a new Barn.

274
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:19,686
Get rid of Croatoan.

275
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:22,368
[chuckles] Rock, paper, scissors.

276
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,452
Stick with the paper, kid.

277
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,120
They never see it coming.

278
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:27,396
Got a few more security cameras going.

279
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:29,424
Perimeter looks good.

280
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,095
(Audrey) Nathan.

281
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,517
We...

282
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,352
I think we might need to
talk about something.

283
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:41,476
Ah.

284
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,834
I'm not leaving you.

285
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:47,359
Croatoan's offer has to be a little...

286
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,978
tempting.

287
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,036
You're asking me if I
want all this to be over,

288
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,901
live behind some white picket fence,

289
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,073
adopt a shelter dog?

290
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:00,443
Of course I do.

291
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,626
But I want that with the
real Audrey Parker,

292
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,661
not some copy.

293
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:09,131
You wouldn't even remember
that she wasn't real.

294
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:13,836
How can I claim to love you as much as I do

295
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:17,089
if I don't at least give you that chance?

296
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:20,809
Your asking me to consider this is exactly

297
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:25,898
the reason why I never, never could.

298
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:31,060
Vickie's almost done with the core.

299
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:35,407
We are gonna beat Croatoan, save Duke,

300
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,244
and get our lives back.

301
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:39,578
Yeah.

302
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,780
[phone beeps]

303
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,999
Laverne, do you have something?

304
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,340
(Audrey) Duke.

305
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:03,949
Come out, come out,

306
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:07,872
wherever you are.

307
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,342
Where did they run to, Laverne?

308
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:21,512
[chuckles]

309
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,937
You can play all the games you want.

310
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,806
I'm getting what I came for.

311
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:45,125
Vickie, you have been very, very busy.

312
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:57,509
Still warm, Nathan.

313
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:02,898
Okay, what do we do now?

314
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,700
Well, we can't stay here.

315
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:06,568
Why? We're 3 feet above the lava.

316
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,516
We need to rescue the princess
before the dragon gets her.

317
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:10,706
I thought you were the princess.

318
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,074
No, silly, I'm Lizzie the Lionhearted,

319
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:13,492
and you're Dwight the Dauntless.

320
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:14,743
It's how we always play.

321
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:16,661
Right. Right. Okay.

322
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:18,831
Well, we need some stepping stones.

323
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,504
- Here goes nothing.
- Hang on.

324
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:26,922
[both laugh]

325
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:28,640
We made it. Did we rescue the princess?

326
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,319
Yes, but you melted your feet.

327
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:32,728
Oh. [exhales]

328
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,996
Darn.

329
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,370
It's been a while. I'm a little rusty.

330
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,473
Dad, we played last week.

331
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,103
Lizzie...

332
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:45,607
That was a lot of fun.

333
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,409
There's some milk and
cookies in the kitchen.

334
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:49,445
- I'd say we deserve them.
- [laughs]

335
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:56,335
She has no idea she died?

336
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:58,504
No, but she remembers everything else.

337
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,579
She even called herself
Lizzie the Lionhearted.

338
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:01,673
How could she know that?

339
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,376
Have you noticed anything
different about her?

340
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:06,845
Not yet. But the cookies...

341
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,931
- The cookies are a test.
- A test?

342
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,383
It's been a thing for her
since her mother left.

343
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,185
I stocked that kitchen
with ten types of cookies.

344
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,020
If that's my daughter,

345
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:16,605
she'll bring out two types... her
favorite and her least favorite,

346
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,557
and they'll be arranged on
the plate like a flower.

347
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,858
Oh.

348
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:26,565
Milk and cookies, Mr. Teagues.

349
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:32,654
[laughs] What a polite young lady.

350
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,907
Thank you, Lizzie.

351
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,504
How's it going, Vickie?

352
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:50,839
- Almost there.
- Hurry.

353
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,674
Laverne may have been able to
move this wall to hide us,

354
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:54,142
but Duke won't be fooled for long.

355
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:55,844
Or fooled at all.

356
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:58,754
Duke knows this place like the
back of his hand, poor kid.

357
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:00,933
Finished.

358
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:01,934
Good.

359
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,519
So if you fold it,

360
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:06,071
the core should be able
to fuse together, right?

361
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:09,491
- Nathan.
- Duke.

362
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,443
Stop.

363
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,494
Don't make me shoot.

364
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,979
Duke.

365
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,497
Go.

366
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:18,917
[grunts]

367
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,371
We have to get the core fixed.

368
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,423
Laverne, slow him down.

369
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:29,877
[gasps]

370
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:31,635
(Duke) I want that drawing, Vickie.

371
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:32,494
Oh, Jesus.

372
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:35,384
Duke, please. This isn't you.

373
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:39,471
Oh, this is me, just with improvements.

374
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,057
The Duke I know stands up
to bullies like Croatoan.

375
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,775
You don't want to hurt Vickie.

376
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:47,068
I should've killed you
when you were a statue.

377
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,982
[grunts]

378
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,617
Go.

379
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,235
- The Aether core.
- Got it.

380
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:54,847
No.

381
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,240
You don't.

382
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:04,162
Ah.

383
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,498
No.

384
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:28,045
I always liked your trouble, Vickie.

385
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,881
I can't wait to try it out.

386
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,197
Oh, is it your turn now?

387
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:49,150
You going to tell me how
much I mean to you?

388
00:21:49,152 --> 00:21:50,568
How we're family?

389
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,952
No.

390
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:53,307
No?

391
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,242
Hundreds and hundreds of
your little speeches...

392
00:21:58,244 --> 00:22:01,996
"trouble whispering"
all of your little lambs.

393
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:07,420
You must have something special
in your bag of trick for me.

394
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:09,672
I'm not going to tell you
what you already know,

395
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:11,922
that what you're doing is wrong.

396
00:22:11,924 --> 00:22:14,925
I'm not going to beg for our lives, Duke.

397
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:17,318
Don't be so melodramatic.

398
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:21,015
Croatoan wants you alive.

399
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:23,669
Nathan too, for now.

400
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:27,521
As long as the old lady
doesn't get in my way,

401
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:32,100
I will take the artiste and go.

402
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,361
[sobs]

403
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:38,032
- I will not let you kill Vickie.
- Oh, I see.

404
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:42,870
You'll only let me kill when
it serves your purpose.

405
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:45,539
Well, I don't work for you anymore.

406
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,258
You never worked for us.

407
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,094
No, Duke's right.

408
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:51,887
We used you.

409
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:55,976
I used you.

410
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:59,019
When we found out about
the Crocker family curse,

411
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:00,554
about what it could do,

412
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:02,857
I used that as a tool to stop the Troubles

413
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:05,025
because that's what I was sent here to do.

414
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:08,145
But I didn't think about how
much it was going to hurt you,

415
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:11,010
how killing all of those people, how...

416
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:14,406
how it would change you.

417
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,569
It didn't change anything.

418
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:22,376
This was always meant to be.

419
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:24,662
I don't think it was.

420
00:23:26,276 --> 00:23:29,744
I think you were fighting your destiny.

421
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:34,588
And if left alone, maybe
you might have even won.

422
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,056
But I didn't know that.

423
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:40,227
And I came along, and I
sent you on that path.

424
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:44,343
And for that, I am truly sorry.

425
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:49,937
I know how it feels, Duke,
to be fighting to be the person

426
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:51,689
that you want to be when everyone

427
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:53,440
is telling you to be someone else.

428
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:56,277
Croatoan thinks that I'm his daughter.

429
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:58,445
I-I look like her.

430
00:23:58,447 --> 00:23:59,864
I sound like her.

431
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:02,583
Do you know how easy it
would be to just say,

432
00:24:02,585 --> 00:24:04,002
"Sure,

433
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,819
it's good to see you, Dad,"

434
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,019
and stop being scared?

435
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,931
I'm so tired.

436
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:27,379
I'm so tired of fighting my destiny.

437
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:31,979
But I can't give up.

438
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,822
Because when I look in the mirror,

439
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:38,119
I only see me.

440
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:43,371
I see the person that I truly am.

441
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,569
The only person I want to be.

442
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:51,886
So tell me, Duke, when
you look in the mirror,

443
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:54,969
when no one else is around,

444
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:59,256
who are you?

445
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:19,326
I'm Duke Crocker.

446
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:21,946
And I just want to go
back to being a pirate.

447
00:25:25,418 --> 00:25:26,450
Yes.

448
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,634
Time to eat your peanut butter.

449
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:45,052
I already ate mine.

450
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:46,335
Yuck.

451
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,772
Maybe we shouldn't eat the
cookies we don't like.

452
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:50,307
But we always do it that way.

453
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:52,097
You have to eat the yucky one.

454
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:53,963
Why, Lizzie?

455
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:57,102
Why do we always eat a
cookie we don't like?

456
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,240
'Cause that's how life is.

457
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:01,402
Sometimes it hands you a bad cookie,

458
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:02,903
like when you got hurt in the Army

459

or when Mom left us.

460
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:08,869
But if you hang in there,

461
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,995
the good cookies will come, right?

462
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:13,247
Right, like how we still have each other.

463
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:19,711
Like how we still have each other.

Hey.

00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:33,635
(Gloria) Welcome back, kiddo.

467
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:35,596
Glad to be back.

468
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,110
I knew you could beat him.

00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:39,304
Yeah, not soon enough.

470
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:41,275
We have to make sure

471
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:42,693
that Croatoan doesn't find out about you.

472
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:44,111
Is there any way that you

473
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:46,080
can use your phasing trouble
to get out of town?

474

I'm not going anywhere.

I'm going to kill Croatoan.

No. No way.

He knows you are stronger together.

Please, you have to let me help.

I promise.

There's got to be something that we can do.

496
00:27:49,645 --> 00:27:51,562
There is.

497
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,341
You have to kill me.

498
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:11,648
You have to kill me. Now.

499
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:13,201
Before he takes any more.

500
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:14,736
There has to be another way.

501
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:15,737
There isn't.

502
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:16,738
Duke...

503
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,288
Whenever a Crocker has died,

504
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,574
the Troubles stayed with them.

505
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,347
If I'm dead,

506
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:27,080
Croatoan has no way of collecting them.

507
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:29,716
No, Duke.

508
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,803
I can't.

509
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:34,226
Yes, you can, Nathan.

510
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:39,760
You can to save Haven, to save Audrey.

511
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:42,562
No. No, not like this.

512
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:43,730
Look, I'd do it myself, right?

513
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:45,182
I'd go up to the roof and jump.

514
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,935
But if I break open and
bleed out all my Troubles,

515
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:49,772
then I died for nothing.

516
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:53,698
Croatoan took everything from me.

517
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,159
I have to take something back.

518
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:59,746
I have to choose my destiny.

519
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:06,670
I have to show Croatoan that
Duke Crocker's nobody's bitch.

520
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:11,959
So please.

521
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:16,964
Please.

522
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,132
Come on, please.

523
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,969
Please!

Gloria?

526
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:27,774
No, I'm sorry, Duke.

527
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,647
Do you see that?

528
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:35,449
Who knows which one that was?

529
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:38,402
You have no idea the horrible Troubles

530
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:39,820
that I've taken inside of me.

531
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:43,707
And if I let Croatoan
get them, then he wins.

532
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,650
That's not my destiny.

533
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,640
That's not me.

534
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:55,649
No.

535
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,007
Nathan, please.

536

I can't do it myself.

There's no time.

Hey.

00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:40,797
Duke, it's gonna be okay, all right?

547
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,625
We love you.

548
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,104
You are the bravest man I ever met,

549
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:49,022
Duke Crocker, you always have been.

550
00:30:49,024 --> 00:30:51,352
So much we've done together.

551
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:54,861
So much we never could've done without you.

552
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:58,398
I owe you so much.

553
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,983
I will spend the rest of my life

554
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,486
trying to repay that debt.

555
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,076

(Vince) I'm so sorry.

559
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:50,250
What Duke became wasn't who he was.

560
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:53,957
No, and in the end, it's what saved us.

561
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,173
Maybe all of Haven.

562
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,291
It stopped Croatoan from
getting his Troubles.

563
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,788
The Aether core, it's destroyed.

564
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,380
There will be no way to build a new Barn,

565
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,882
no way to end the Troubles.

[somber music]

Dwight, maybe you can just help me

00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:30,457
get him to the truck.

569
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:32,159
We'll put him on ice until we can give him

a proper burial at sea with Jennifer.

571
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,631
He would like that.

00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:38,832
(Nathan) Yeah.

573
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,717
At sea.

574
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:48,642
I'm gonna take a walk. Be back in a minute.

Oh, Dwight, glad you came.

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,660
That makes one of us.

579
00:33:06,662 --> 00:33:08,111
Difficult decision, I'm sure.

580
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,196
You brought the crystal?

581
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:10,280
The crystal's useless now.

582
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:11,364
Why do you even want it?

583
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,866
Useless to you.

584
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,202
I can do wonders with the
technology behind it.

585
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:16,586
What do you mean?

586
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:22,560
This room is similar to the
one my daughter grew up in.

587
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:27,547
I intend to make an exact
copy of this entire house.

588
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,932
You want to rebuild a house?

589
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:33,019
Not a house, a home.

590
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,915
When Audrey joins me,

591
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,977
we'll live here together, and
we'll be a family once again.

592
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,979
Without Charlotte, of course.

593
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,232
Because you murdered her.

594
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,377
Charlotte betrayed me.

595
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:52,372
She had me banished.

596
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:55,292
Then she tried to poison Mara with lies.

597
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:56,493
Then she killed her.

598
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,161
Mara was evil.

599
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,080
Like father, like daughter.
But Charlotte...

600
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:01,748
Charlotte was good in the sack.

601
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,650
Yeah, she had that going for her.

602
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,803
You know, Dwight,

603
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:09,172
you're lucky that I have
other concerns right now.

604
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,174
You've seen what I can do with people

605
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,051
who try to take what's mine.

606
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,313
So...

607
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:19,948
the crystal or Lizzie?

Are you really going to walk away?

I'm giving you a second chance
with your daughter, Dwight.

I, more than anyone, know
how remarkable that can be.

Are you really going to walk away from it?

613

I'll be back in a few hours.

With the crystal.

You made the right choice, Dwight.

The Crockers grew so
cowardly over the years.

any of his Troubles.

He died a hero.

He walked away from greatness.

No.

665
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:02,414
Nathan is...

666
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:05,030
beyond the shroud.

667
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,692
[indistinct chatter]

668
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:26,968
Parker.

669
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,003
Nathan.

670
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,641
This is weird.

671
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,208
Yeah.

672
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:36,144
What can I get you two?

673
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:39,431
Uh, actually maybe you could tell me,

674
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:42,601
did you see us come in?

675
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:45,770
Oh, things get so busy
around here sometimes,

676
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:48,039
all I see are hash browns.

677
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:49,533
But...

678
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,277
now that I come to think of it,

679
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:54,246
I could've sworn this table was empty,

680
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,867
and then I turned around,
and there you were.

681
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,369
Ah, maybe we all need a cup of coffee?

682
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:03,121
- Sugar.
- Black.

683
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,172
Thanks.

684
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:22,524
Don't worry.

685
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:28,146
At least we're together.
We'll figure it out.

686
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:29,147
Yeah.

687
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:31,190
We always do.

688
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,239
Nathan told me he changed his mind.

689
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,457
The tragedy of having to kill his friend...

690
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:41,326
He realized the futility of fighting me.

691
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:42,712
No.

692
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:46,248
Nathan never would've left
of his own free will.

693
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,906
I'm sorry, but it's true.

694
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,641
He begged me to take him away from Haven.

695
00:39:51,004 --> 00:39:55,320
He said that saving the world

696
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:58,343
had become too exhausting.

697
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,645
I know you're upset.

698
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:02,847
But really, isn't this what you want?

699
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:04,766
Nathan far away

700
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:07,652
from the terrible dangers
he would've faced?

701
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:12,691
Dangers?

702
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:14,359
Well, once we begin our experiments,

703
00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:16,861
there will be a lot of trial and error.

704
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:19,090
Things will become...

705
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,283
volatile.

706
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,085
No. I'm not helping you.

707
00:40:25,872 --> 00:40:27,872
This is what you were meant to do.

708
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:29,908
Nathan abandoned you.

709
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,111
But not me.

710
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:37,382
I will never abandon you.

711
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:48,143
You don't have to be so morose.

712
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:52,897
Attitude is the paintbrush
that colors our world.

713
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:02,240
[thunder]

714
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:05,160
What we're about to do will be wonderful.

715
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:15,470
[shivers]

716
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,756
What is that?

717
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:20,596
Mm, the question is, what is behind that?

718
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,786
I'm using an abrasion trouble

719
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,934
to create an opening to the Void.

720
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,683
Why is it...

721
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:29,768
Turning black?

722
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,403
It's filling with Aether.

723
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,105
And soon it will rain,

724
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:37,692
and then you and I will begin our work.

725
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:38,993
And it won't seem like work

726
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:41,946
because we'll have casual Friday,

727
00:41:42,818 --> 00:41:45,456
we'll have music, bring dogs.

728
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:53,925
Take a few hours before
there's enough Aether

729
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:56,264
and we can get to work, so...

730
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:59,547
go grieve,

731
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:00,765
make your peace,

732
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:04,719
do whatever you have to do to move on,

733
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,083
because Nathan

734
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:08,844
is gone.

735
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:11,849
Your life

736
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:16,528
is with me, here,

737
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,751
now.
