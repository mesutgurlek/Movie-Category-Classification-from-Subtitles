I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

It's okay.
I have another one.

All right.

I just did.

We got reservations at 7.
You mean to tell me we can't get through?

This is bullshit. Bullshit.

You can't do this.
We're in America.

Who gave the order
for this exercise?

Sir, my orders are to keep
this road sealed off

You can take your son
to the hospital in town.

Those guys don't know their asses
from a hole in the ground.

41

I want to go to a real hospital.

Sir, I understand.

00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,643
Not unless you have kids,
you don't fucking understand.

Honey,
you're not helping.

We're going to Boulder.

Please turn
your car around. Please.

What?

Sarah, what are you
doing here?

52
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,942
Your mom told me
you were never coming back.

53
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,711
Well, you know
how she exaggerates.

54
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,843
Besides, I'm needed here.

55
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,477
Look, I'm sorry
that I yelled,

56
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,818
but can you
get us out of here?

00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,323
Cody is really sick.

58

Mr. Leitner, I understand
that you're upset,

59
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,652
but the best thing that
you can do for Cody right now

60
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,923
is to get him
to the medical center.

61
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,760
The Army's
brought in specialists.

62

They're already there
at the hospital.

63
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,761
That'll be much quicker
than driving to Boulder.

Thank you.

Okay, you heard the captain.

Sir.

Did I just
tell them the truth?

to keep this shit hole town--

Your shit hole town sealed off.

They were supposed to
be here three hours ago.

They haven't reported in, sir.

Not really.
Yeah, right.

I don't know.

91
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,133
You want to check it out?

92
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,038
Find a cool little spot?

93
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:53,374
In a dark hole?
I don't think so.

94

Hey, didn't you
say something

95
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,947
about your mother
being sick with the flu?

96
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,418
Yeah, she's in bed.

97
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,388
You think she'd know
if we were on your couch?

Zip it up, Kyle.

00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,618
What?

100
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,525
We're out of here.
Come on.

101
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,390
I'm not really done here.

102
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,663
You want a ride? You're done.

Your friend's
a real buzz kill.

Chill. It stopped.

Okay, okay, come on. We gotta go.

If you got me sick,
I'll kill you.

No.

So I have some travel news

120
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,184
for all of you trying to get out of town.

121
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,553
Route 40 will be closed
until 7:30 tomorrow night.

122
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,958
Still, they keep saying
this is just an exercise.

123
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,826
Now, Uncle Sam wouldn't be
trying to lie to us, would he?

124
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,265
No. Stay tuned for further bulletins.

125
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,896
In the meantime, when the man
gives them to me,

126
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,837
I'll give them to you.

127
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,673
And now, some more
inane bull stuff.

128
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:35,771
So, as a cog in the military
industrial complex,

are you capable of
independent thought?

130
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,613
Sir, my orders are to relay
the information to you

131

so you can pass it on
to the public.

132
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,820
This ain't about
that flu thing, is it?

133
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,687
So what the fuck
is it about?

134
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,358
You are gonna talk to me,
so help me God.

135
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,389
Or...Celine Dion.

Where'd she go?

145

00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,435
Think I'm gonna like it here.

167
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,665
You were at Fort Bragg, right?

168
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,138
Yes.

169
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,265
Yeah, I heard about you.

170
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,173
You and my homie Henry Fat

171
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,042
was hitting it for
a couple months, right?

172
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,479
You and your homie
got your wires crossed.

173
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,481
It didn't happen.

174
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,812
If you say so.

175
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,443
As of now, you two
are on guard duty.

176
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,817
This is your barricade.

177
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,220
No one gets through.
You got that?

178
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,222
Crain, you the driver?

179
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,758
Yes, sir. Um, God.

180
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,758
Ma'am.

181
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,692
You up for a road trip?

182
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,751
Yeah.

183
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,492
No one gets through.

184
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,928
How long we supposed
to stay here?

185
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,370
We'll try and be back
before breakfast.

186
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,169
That's, like, 12 hours!

187
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,266
We'll bring you a bagel.

188
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,437
Ahem. Are we really
spending the night together?

189
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,707
Not a chance.
Okay, good,

190
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,545
because that wouldn't be appropriate.

191
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,983
He was definitely
hitting that.

192
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,611
Shut up.

193
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,593
I-- I thought
you wanted me to drive.

194
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,130
I know the way.

195
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,756
You just join?

196
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,664
Really? You can tell?

197
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,464
Yeah, seven months ago.

198
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,163
I was studying
radar and countermeasures.

199
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,001
My first time being called out.

200
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,439
Kind of wish it was something
a little more exciting.

201
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,703
Be careful what you wish for.

202
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,802
I've seen exciting.

203
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,346
You don't have to worry.

204
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,904
Nothing really happens
in this town anyway.

205
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,644
Yeah, it seems
like a real shit hole.

206
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,319
Where are we going anyway?

207
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,048
My house.

208
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,990
Oh, so you're from here?

209
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,290
Born and raised.

210
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,798
Well, it's kind of
a charming shit hole.

211
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,609
All right, I'll be back.

212
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,274
Listen,
Crain sounds so formal.

213
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,284
What do your friends
call you?

214
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,513
Um, my friends call me Bud.

215
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,579
Bud. Okay.

216
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,024
Well, when we're not around the others,
you can call me Sarah.

217
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,055
[car door shuts]

218
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,766
Whoo.

219
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,172
## [rock]

220
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,075
Nothing on TV?

221
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,810
Sarah?

222
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,445
Haven't you heard of knocking?

223
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,921
Uh, this is
my house, too.

224
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,959
You want privacy,
find a new place.

225
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,393
What's going on, Nina?
Nothing, really.

226
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,089
Your father still
teaching Sunday school?

227
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,290
This is so not cool.

228
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,423
You know what, you missed
a button right there.

229
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,694
What the hell are
you doing here?

230
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,894
Enforcing the quarantine.

231
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,061
What's up with not
returning my calls?

232
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,468
What quarantine?
What calls?

233
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,664
You're kidding me.

234
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,639
I called your cell phone,
like, five or six times.

235
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,903
You know what?
Where's Mom?

236
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:05,966
In bed, I guess.

237
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,569
You guess.
I just got home.

238
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,635
She wasn't feeling well
this morning.

239
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:09,578
And you didn't
check on her?

240
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,615
I check on her every day.

241
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,615
That's a lot more
than some people.

242
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,276
Get over it, Trevor.

243
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,517
Hey, Mom.

244
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,186
Sarah, honey.

245
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,229
I didn't know you were coming.

246
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,490
[cough]

247
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,397
I guess you were too busy to call.

248
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,661
How are you feeling, Mom?

249
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,929
I'm okay.

250
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,630
No, you're not.
You're burning up.

251
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,673
Please, you have more
important things to do

252
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,571
than worry about me.

253
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,109
What are you doing here?

254
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,439
I'm taking you
to the hospital.

255
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,536
Don't be silly.

256
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,139
It's just a cold.
I took some vitamins.

257
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,207
Mom, I'm taking you
to the hospital, okay?

258
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,513
Let's get you dressed.

259
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,282
[panting]

260
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,721
[coughing]

261
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,188
My dad's left a dozen messages.
They're at the hospital.

262
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,388
How long has Mom been sick?

263
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,953
Since this morning.
It's a cold.

264
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,658
Everyone's got it.
And when did you start caring?

265
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,825
Don't start with me.

266
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,027
Kyle had it really bad.

267
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,467
His nose
was gushing blood.

268
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,333
Where is he now?

269
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,839
Home. He found his dad's
supply of medical hash.

270
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,308
I'm gonna run over there
and check on him.

271
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,571
Wait, wait.

272
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,135
Wait, you can't even
go upstairs

273
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,407
to check on your own mother,

274
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,847
and now you want to go
all the way across town?

275
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,715
No. You're gonna
go upstairs,

276
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,879
make sure
Mom gets dressed,

277
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,047
and don't leave
until I get back.

278
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,852
Do you think
you can handle that?

279
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,586
I'll go check on Kyle.

280
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,424
Aye-aye, Admiral Bitch.

281
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,497
Everything okay?

282
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,193
No, it's not.

283
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,765
[knocking]

284
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,445
Kyle.

285
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,106
Anybody here?

286
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,658
Oh, shit.

287
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,694
Don't worry. It's not loaded.

288
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,282
Oh, my God.

289
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,806
What the hell happened here?

290
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,944
Aah! Fuck!

291
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,611
Fuck! Uhh! Oh!

292
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,758
What's there?

293
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,462
The phone is dead.

294
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,089
Fuck.

295
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,760
Oh, God.

296
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,271
[beeping]

297
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,601
I don't have any service.

298
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,866
Yeah.
Come on.

299
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,002
Let's go.

300
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,311
Fitzsimmons,
14 Cypress Pond Road.

301
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,044
The boy Kyle is missing.

302
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,915
The bodies look like they
were mauled by something.

303
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,546
I couldn't call the police.
All the phones are dead. Over.

304
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,816
[Rhodes]
Yes, I know, Corporal.

305
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,414
We're blocking all phone lines

306
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,722
until we get control
of the situation.

307
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,558
Got a whole lot of wild
rumors running around here.

308
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,825
I'll get that info to the police.

309
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,025
Where are you?

310
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,796
I need to take my mother
to the hospital, Sir.

311
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,427
Well, I'm headed
over there right now

312
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,028
to see if I can find
some missing doctors.

313
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,801
You get back to
that roadblock ASAP.

314
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,069
Yes, sir. Over and out.

315
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,443
Why isn't your gun loaded?

316
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,581
It's complicated.

317
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,420
Cool.

318
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,583
I'm a vegetarian, by the way.

319
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,092
Maybe we should just
keep that between us.

320
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:06,971
Was Kyle stoned?

321
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,341
He wasn't there.

322
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,280
Did his parents
know where he was?

323
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,283
No.

324
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,910
Oh, oh. I'm bleeding.

325
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,786
There's gauze
in the kit.

326
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,346
All right.
Here, here, I got it.

327
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,356
Here,
tilt your head back.

328
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,620
Careful.
You got it?

329
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,927
So when are you
going back to Denver?

330
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,436

332
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,869
[Sarah]
Park it and meet us inside.

333
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,274
[Bud]
Yes, Ma'am.

334
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,422
[coughing]

335
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,690
Slow down!

336
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,259
Oh!

337
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,362
Jerk!

338
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,374
Excuse me, ma'am,
my mom needs a doctor.

339
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,239
Yeah, her and everyone else.

340
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,642
Look, here.

341
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,340
Just write her name on the list,
and we'll get to her.

342
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:18,874
I-I can't wait.

343
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,851
Listen, lady,
half the town's sick.

344
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,443
We're overwhelmed
and understaffed.

345
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,614
Just write her name
down on the list.

346
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,816
[coughing]

347
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,822
Mom... look, they're
a bit overwhelmed, okay?

348
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,330
We're going to have to wait.

349
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,160
What?

350
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,362
Do you mind?

351
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,931
I found my mom and dad.

352
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,374
They're in a room,
waiting for the doctor.

353
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,036
You want to come with?
Yeah. I'll be right back.

354
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,273
Trevor, wait!

355
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,876
Stay here.

356
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,683
Salazar, you're supposed
to be on guard duty.

357
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,882
Williams and Elders
have it covered.

358
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,117
Captain had me
come with him.

359
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,682
You know the phone lines
are down.

360
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,818
The cell phones
aren't even working.

361
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,919
I heard it was orders
from Washington.

362
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,396
[coughing]

363
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,558
You think this is still
just an exercise?

364
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,832
Nah. There's some real
serious shit going down.

365
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,269
Corporal Cross.

366
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,907
Sir.

367
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,413
There's a doctor here
from the CDC.

368
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,181
He wants to ask you about
the bodies at Cypress Pond.

369
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,984
He was annoyingly insistent.

370
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,581
[coughing]

371
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,426
Sarah's great, huh?

372
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,527
I wish
she were around more.

373
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,040
Um, does she have
a boyfriend?

374
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,335
She's hot, huh?

375
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,178
Oh, she's so hot.

376
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,143
You think she'd ever
go out with a private?

377
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,015
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm a little bit--

378
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,387
Are you all right?

379
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,482
Oh, my God.

380
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,254
You're freezing.

381
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,852
[Man]
I need some help over here!

382
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,021
Come on, man.

383
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,928
Stay with me.
Talk to me, talk to me.

384
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,557
Talk to me,
talk to me, talk to me.

385
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,931
Um...

386
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,701
Okay, um, Mrs. Cross,

387
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,705
I'm going to go get Sarah.

388
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,001
Okay?

389
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,799
Corporal Cross!

390
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,280
It has to be airborne.

391
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,374
But once in the blood,

392
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,782
it mutates faster
than anything else--

393
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,911
Dr. Logan,
this is Corporal Cross.

394
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,615
Thanks for coming.

395
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,817
Can you give us a minute?

396
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,922
I find people
speak more freely

397
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,759
without a superior
officer around.

398
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,427
I'll be outside.

399
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,331
You've had quite a night.

400
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,434
You could say that.

401
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,001
About the bodies,

402
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,842
you said they looked
like they were mauled.

403
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,108
Could it have been
an animal attack?

404
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,151
If an animal can hide
a body in a closet.

405
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,151
The son is missing?

406
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,744
Yes.

407
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,119
Did the wounds
look like bite marks?

408
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,122
What?

409
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,659
It's a simple question.

410
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,887
How would I know?

411
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,259
Maybe it's the avian flu.

412
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,354
Don't say that.

413
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,763
Dad, seriously,
that's so not possible.

414
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,961
I heard about this case
in France where--

415
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,697
Dad?

416
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,968
Daddy, what's wrong?

417
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,968

00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,107
What's going on?

00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,681
Daddy?

421
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,848

Corporal, you gotta
come to the waiting room.

432
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,349
Something's happening.

433
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,086
To my mom?
To everybody.

434
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,492
What is it?
Something bad. I don't know.

435
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,741

Now this here's just
a little too much for this cowboy.

Now, you see this button here?

453
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,070
You press it, and you talk into that

to say to the folks

00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:33,893
Right there.

500
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,530
My mom's in there.

501
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,596
We'll go undercover.

502
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,732
That's an order, Corporal!

503
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,053
Come on!

504
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:01,931
Here.

505
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,490
We're safe!

506
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:09,974
Grrr!

507
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,440
Aah!

508
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,340
What the hell was that?
You almost got me killed.

509
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,511
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

510
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,282
[Sarah]
Bud! Help me.

511
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,754
[knocking]

512
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,104
[horn honks]

513
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:43,796
Oh, my God.

514
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,741
[knocking]

515
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,475
What are we going to do?

516
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,323
Aah!
Aah!

517
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,330
Fuck!

518
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,491
[sobbing]

519
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,659
Come on.

520
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,737
Aah!

521
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,959
Look at the radio station.

522
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,001
Look, there's somebody
in there.

523
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

524
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,232
Hey.

525
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,174
We're going to make it,
okay?

526
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,938
I swear.

527
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,534
We can make Molotov cocktails.

528
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,669
Great, and I'll just build a bus
and drive us out of here.

529
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,212
Come on,
we have weapons.

530
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,611
I don't have a gun.
What?

531
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,582
I'm in communications.
We aren't issued weapons.

532
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,140
So basically you're useless.

533
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,185
Shut up, Logan.

534
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,345
Come on.
You've got one.

535
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,649
We can shoot
enough of them.

536
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,087
It's not loaded.

537
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,182
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

538
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,124
What the hell kind
of soldier are you?

539
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,719
You don't want to find out
right now, okay?

540
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,560
Bud, where did you park the Humvee?

541
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,601
The lot was full, so l--
Oh, shit.

542
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,260
They must have come out
when I was--

543
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,101
Great. A driver without keys
and a soldier without bullets.

544
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,731
It must be my fucking birthday.

545
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,275
What's with you two?

546
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,334
You know what?
It's complicated, okay, pal?

547
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,605
How did you get here?

548
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,611
Taxi.

549
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,272
Great. Well, you're nominated

550
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,374
to go out
and hail us another one.

551
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,919
Captain Rhodes' Humvee.

552
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,556
He should have the keys on him.
We've got to go get them.

553
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,326
What? No! No. No way!

554
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,628
Those things are everywhere.

555
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,500
Not everywhere.

556
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,474
Come on.

557
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,478
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

558
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,852
Hello.

559
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,914
Hello. Hello, hello, hello!

560
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:48,924
Somebody.

561
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,517
Hello! Hello?

562
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,153
Stop pounding. Look!

563
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,788
Oh, God! Oh, God!

564
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,197
Oh, God!
Shh!

565
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,393
Oh, God, I'm gonna die!

566
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,799
Open the damn door!

567
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,030
Grrr!

568
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,629
Open the door now!

569
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,799
Open up!

570
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,342
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

571
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,570
Open the door!

572
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,111
Someone help!

573
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,874
Someone open the door!

574
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,938
Oh, God! Hurry! Hurry!

575
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,687
Are you one of them?
No!

576
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,016
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

577
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,317
You better not be!

578
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,633
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner.
Oh, you're all right.

579
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,760
Where's Cody?
Is he okay? Is he--

580
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,339
We wanted to get Cody
to a doctor,

581
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,637
but your sister
wouldn't let us,

582
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,869
and now he's dead.

583
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,377
[Mrs. Leitner]
Andrew, stop it!

584
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,845
[cough]

585
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,149
My cough--
I had it before all this.

586
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,984
I'm not sick.

587
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,047
[coughing]

588
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,391
Come on.

00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,223
Raah!

592
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,765
Sweet mother of God!
Don't--

593
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,634
Yuck!

594
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,066
God.

595
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,515
[Bud]
Do you want me to go?

596
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:05,050
Yeah. But I outrank you.

597
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,262
Okay.

598
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,441
[door opens]

599
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,222
Salazar. Are you all right?

600
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,123
Not if you keep
karate kicking me.

601
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,284
How did you get away?

602
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,389
When everybody started tripping,
I just jumped in the closet.

603
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,956
Keep laughing, bitch.

604
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,663
All right,
I'm taking Rhodes' Humvee.

605
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,204
Oh, man.

606
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,467
You won't be needing this.

607
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,810
I got 'em. Let's go.

608
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,120
Correct, my shit. Uhh!

609
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,655
Go.

610
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,369
Grrr!
No!

611
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,640
What?
What happened?

612
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,204
What is it?
Aah!

613
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,180
Give me some room! Go!

614
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,651
Come on!

615
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,119
He's got me!

616
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,212
Grrr!

617
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,050
Stop!

618
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,226
Pull!

619
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,923
Let's go! Come on!

620
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,090
Go!

621
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,628
Aah!

622
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,567
Aah!

623
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,017
Catch! Come on!

624
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,676
Pull!

625
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,516
Tell me you remembered
the keys.

626
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,108
Raah!

627
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,313
Aah! God!

628
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,418
God!

629
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,492
Ah, fuck, he got me.

630
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,121
Oh, fuck, he got me.

631
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,597
Oh, fuck, he got me.
He got me.

632
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,657
I'm sorry.

633
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:35,297
Aah! Aah! Aah!

634
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,240
Aah! Oh, fuck!

635
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,302
This is gonna be quick.

636
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,608
No, no!

637
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,148
You saw what happened
to Rhodes

638
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,343
when he got bit, okay?

639
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,612
This is the only way.

640
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,017
I put bleach on it.

641
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,749
[growling from above]

642
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,188
Shut up!

643
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,249
Put the gun down.
That's an order.

644
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,522
I don't know if you noticed,

645
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,826
but there's people out there
eating each other, okay?

646
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,763
So fuck you and your orders.

647
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,164
[growling from above]

648
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,601
I said shut up!

649
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,306
What are you going to do?
You going to shoot me?

650
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,672
Hey, look, Rhodes was bitten
hundreds of times, him once.

651
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,973
Besides, bleach kills
just about everything.

652
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,307
Who the fuck are you?

653
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,712
Look, I'm a doctor, okay?
I know exactly what's--

654
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,343
Man, ain't nobody trying
to hear that CSI bullshit.

655
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,319
He gotta go.

656
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,287
[growling from above]

657
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,984
Didn't I say
shut the fuck up?

658
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,391
Sir.

659
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,695
Look, I will take responsibility for him.

660
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,669
And if the time comes, I'll
do what has to be done, okay?

661
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,365
So just back down!

662
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,410
Look, I ain't got time
for this bullshit.

663
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,011
We need to figure out
how to get the fuck out of here.

664
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,214
I'm watching.

665
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,917
My eye's on you!

666
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,901
Call the police, the National Guard,

667
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,965
and if by any slim chance
the fucking FCC are listening,

668
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,340
they might take notice.

669
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,141
[coughing]

670
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,206
I gotta take a break.

671
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,514
This fucking blood
pressure's killing me.

672
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:32,556
I shouldn't have done
that kumquat diet.

673
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,456
It's probably too late
to stop smoking.

674
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,397
I'm the one who should be worried.

675
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,400
Your wife's been hacking up
a storm since you got here.

676
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,560
What are you trying to say?

677
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:46,762
Can I give this a try?

678
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,065
Hey, you got a license?

679
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,332
No.

680
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:50,395
Me, neither.

681
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,341
I ain't got a fucking license.

682
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,653
If anyone's there--

683
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,915
You go, kid.

684
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,457
If anyone can hear this,
we are trapped at the radio station

685
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,154
KXWT on Elm Street
in Leadville, Colorado.

686
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:15,096
Uh, uh, we are under attack.
Repeat. We are under attack.

687
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,065
If anyone is there at all--

688
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,396
[growling, moaning]

689
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:21,029
... we need help. Okay?
Something 's happening.

690
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,936
People are going out of their minds.

691
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,907
Please, please,
please, send help.

692
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,067
There's five of us here.

693
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,077
It's me, my girlfriend Nina,

694
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,737
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner, and the DJ.

695
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,974
Just somebody
send something, okay?

696
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,348
We're at the radio station
KXWT on Elm Street.

697
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:40,186
Oh, oh, and if you hear my voice,
do not go to the Pine Valley Hospital.

698
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,485
Okay? It's not safe there.

699
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,119
Repeat. Do not go to the hospital.

700
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,200
[Sarah]
We should go now.

701
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,694
Okay.

702
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,262
Take this and give me
one of your guns.

703
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,535
What, you little
Miss MacGyver now?

704
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,372
That shit ain't gonna work.

705
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,747
Give me one of your guns.

706
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:05,907
If something happens to you,

707
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,245
we can't risk
losing both of them.

708
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,957
I know how to shoot
one of those.

709
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,015
I bet you do.

710
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,551
Sweet spear.

711
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,956
You see a black man
with a sharp stick

712
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,056
and it's supposed
to be a spear?

713
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,623
Oh, no,
that's not what l--

714
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,535
Bud, can you throw this
chair through the window?

715
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,038
Yeah.

716
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,698
Do you have your lighter?
Yeah.

717
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,073
Let's do this.
Are you ready?

718
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,339
Yeah.

719
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,711
Okay...Now!

720
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,297
You gotta shoot them
in the head.

721
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,598
Raah!

722
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,638
Oh, my God!

723
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:10,602
Jesus!

724
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,543
Oh, my God.

725
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,387
Let's go, Doc!

726
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:25,686
Watch out!

727
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,895
Shit!

728
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,571
Watch out!

729
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,650
[Sarah]
Oh, shit.

730
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,453
Let's go.

731
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,264
Please help me.

732
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,998
I'll help you.

733
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,973
Aah!

734
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,749
Come on, y'all!

735
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,608
I got him!

736
00:45:58,922 --> 00:45:59,854
I'm out.

737
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,050
Me, too. Shit.

738
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,094
Where's Logan?

739
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,095
[car engine starts]

740
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,859
[woman screams]

741
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,830
What a dick.

742
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,373
There's more of
these motherfuckers?

743
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,876
Light 'em.

744
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,580
Come on.

745
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,707
Okay.

746
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,784
Oh, shit!

747
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,265
That worked.

748
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,537
Yeah.

749
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,082
Behind you!

750
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,688
Nice shot.

751
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,629
It was kinda gangsta, huh?

752
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,104
We gotta get some more ammo.

753
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,072
Hang on.

754
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,322
This is bullshit.

755
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,311
Hey, yo, Gomer.

756
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,350
Don't give up, man.

757
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,649
Yeah, I won't.

758
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,191
Shit!

759
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,759
What you dodging them for?
Run their ass over.

760
00:48:58,835 --> 00:48:59,767
They're still somebody.

761
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,736
Not anymore.

762
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,173
That was kinda fun.

763
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,274
That is unbelievable.

764
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,784
We have
to get out of here.

765
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,046
Do you have a car?

766
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,417
No, I ain't going out there.

767
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,752
Hey, dude, if you're feeling lucky,
you go for it.

768
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,655
I'd be like prime rib
to those fuckers.

769
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,591
I'm sitting my fat ass right here
till the help comes.

770
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,492
Let's just wait.
Somebody will come.

771
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,224
They have to.

772
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,959
[door creaks]

773
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,548
So which one of you
had the nosebleed?

774
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,312
What?
You heard her.

775
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:23,512
Anybody have a nosebleed?

776
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,886
Just sit down and
answer the question.

777
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,254
What is wrong with you?

778
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,623
Nina, put that down.
What are you doing?

779
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,161
Everyone who changed
had a nosebleed.

780
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,196
Who's lying?

781
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,423
Had to be one of them.

782
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,762
I said sit down.

783
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,631
Hey, you don't wanna eat this.
Major indigestion.

784
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,728
She hasn't had a nosebleed,
and neither have l.

785
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,102
Look at them.
They're covered in blood.

786
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,572
Shut up!

787
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:45,630
My son attacked a nurse.

788
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,108
It's her blood!

789
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,269
Hey, check them
for bite marks.

790
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,312
No one's touching my wife.

791
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,346
Just answer
the fucking question!

792
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,541
Don't you get it?

793
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,675
Someone in here is infected.

794
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,652
We're all in danger.

795
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,692
[Sarah]
All right. Let's make this quick.

796
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,532
What about
your boy back here?

797
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:18,040
Bud, I'm sorry.

798
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,668
No, no. I understand.

799
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,413
You all right?

800
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,247
Yeah.

801
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,308
Do me a favor.

802
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,979
Yeah. Anything.

803
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:37,789
Grab me a gun, too,
and, um, load mine.

804
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,606
Yeah, that's the type of
shit I'm talking about.

805
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,981
Ooh. Uh-huh. Yeah.

806
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,732
Fucking tell us.

807
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,831
Yeah. Now, just--

808
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:25,932
Ah...

809
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,536
choo!

810
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,614
Oh, God.

811
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,513
You scared me.

812
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,449
Paul?

813
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,815
Get off the couch!

814
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,769
Okay.

815
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,862
Is anyone alive out there?

816
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,873
Can anyone hear me?
Anyone? Anyone?

817
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,239
The police? Someone?
We just need someone.

818
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,504
Something's fucking happened.

819
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,546
We need someone. Please, anyone.

820
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,713
Don't think they know
who they fucking with.

821
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,513
Automatics
have no firepower.

822
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:13,044
Oh, yeah? Says who?

823
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:20,755
This shit right here
was made for me.

824
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,195
Uh-huh. Whoo.

825
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,927
By the power of Grayskull.

826
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,060
Okay.
Yeah.

827
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:28,069
Stop fucking around

828
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,070
and start loading
the stuff up.

829
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,902
How long you gonna
keep cussing at me?

830
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,340
You see this? This is a machete.

831
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,471
Unappreciative ass.
See if I save your ass again.

832
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,183

[screaming]

1005
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,501
Aah!

1006
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,765
Let's go!

1007
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,537
Hey! Follow me!

1008
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:42,829
This way!

1009
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,024
Let's go!

1010
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,765
Whoa.

1011
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,118
Hey, guys.

1012
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:12,189
Come on!
Cover him!

1013
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,432
Nice shot.

1014
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,535
Thanks.

1015
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,441
Hey, come on.

1016
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,990
[Salazar]
What the hell?

1017
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,859
A Puffy video.

1018
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,043
Of course.
[crash]

1019
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,275
Yo, we got company.

1020
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,714
Trevor, you loaded?

1021
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:10,513
Full up.

1022
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,918
All right, stay here with Nina, okay?
We'll be back.

1023
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,715
Wait, please don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

1024
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,683
The fuck are you doing here?

1025
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,118
I-- I was trying to get away.

1026
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,678
Those things were after me.

1027
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,690
I found this compound.
I just came here for shelter.

1028
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,589
So you took off
to save your own ass?

1029
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,786
No.

1030
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,089
And destroy some kind
of evidence, huh?

1031
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:31,294
Says something
about Project Wildfire.

1032
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:34,598
Your name's on every one of them.

1033
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,137
What is
Project Wildfire?

1034
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:37,433
I don't know how my name--

1035
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,269
Listen to me!
My mom's dead.

1036
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,139
My hometown's turned into
a fucking slaughterhouse.

1037
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,542
You either tell me
what you know,

1038
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,671
or so help me, I will
shoot you dead right here.

1039
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,773
Look, if you'll just
give me a second to explain--

1040
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,579
[chambers round]

1041
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:50,914
Don't lie to her.

1042
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:51,975
If you'll let me finish--

1043
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,079
Go ahead.

1044
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,158
There were a few select scientists
studying certain biochemical agents.

1045
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:59,717
Including you?

1046
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,195
Were you studying them
or creating them?

1047
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:05,825
Look, I was in Washington
to give a report.

1048
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:07,630
I couldn't reach anyone here.

1049
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,695
Then I heard about the quarantine.

1050
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,765
Look, we don't know our
research has anything to do

1051
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:14,968
with this outbreak.

1052
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,739
Yes, we do.

1053
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,580
Ahem.

1054
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,017
The virus--

1055
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,054
It was three days ago.

1056
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:28,589
...has mutated, and somehow

1057
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,592
we have all become
infected or eaten,

1058
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,127
and I'm the last.

1059
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,685
I think I've killed them all:

1060
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:38,563
Tom, Grace, and everyone.

1061
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:41,296
I, uh...[gagging]

1062
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,168
have sealed myself
inside this bunker.

1063
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,505
I've destroyed the samples
and archived my notes.

1064
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,034
And I don 't know why the infection
is moving so slowly,

1065
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,206
but I can feel it.

1066
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,716
I can feel the malevolence.

1067
01:10:55,784 --> 01:11:00,380
I'll die here like the pharaohs

1068
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:04,392
with my legacy,
a beautiful weapon...

1069
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,520
beautiful weapon.

1070
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,003
What was this virus
supposed to do?

1071
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:21,804
It was designed
to paralyze enemy troops

1072
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,242
by shutting down
their neural system

1073
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,371
for six to seven hours.

1074
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,914
We didn't think
it would mutate.

1075
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:28,313
Come on,
this would have allowed us

1076
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,249
to capture people
without killing them.

1077
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:31,718
It was intended to save lives.

1078
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,584
Yeah,
hell of a job, Doc.

1079
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,118
He got out.

1080
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,422
Yeah, the door was open
when Nina and I got here.

1081
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,452
Why aren't we all sick?

1082
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:44,465
Some people have
a natural immunity

1083
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:45,500
to specific viruses.

1084
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,831
Lucky us.

1085
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,598
But from what l
understand,

1086
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,367
once bitten,
there's no protection.

1087
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,271
Whatever, man.
Where's the back door?

1088
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,502
There isn't one.

1089
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:55,770
[distant growling]

1090
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,421
Oh, shit.

1091
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,501
Stay here.

1092
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,040
You back?

1093
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,200
I'm not going to
die down here,

1094
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:31,406
but you,
you knew about this.

1095
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,004
No, I didn't know.
I swear.

1096
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:36,245
Nina, Nina, no.
He's not worth it.

1097
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,389
He's smarter than the others.

1098
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:47,995
Don't believe this shit.

1099
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,759
I'm not going back
into that airshaft.

1100
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,391
Raah!

1101
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,301
Shut up, bitch.

1102
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,203
Hey, did you guys get him?

1103
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:05,371
He's in the ventilation system.

1104
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,142
Yeah, I got his little girlfriend, though.

1105
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,707
[clanking, groaning]

1106
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:15,613
That's Dr. Engel.

1107
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,386
He was the best man
on the team.

1108
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:20,360
If they do retain
something of what they were,

1109
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:23,227
we are so screwed.

1110
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:24,856
We have to find a way out.

1111
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:25,991
That's the only way out.

1112
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,330
That's why
we chose this place.

1113
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,394
Man, I thought scientists
were supposed to be smart.

1114
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,905
Here, follow me.

1115
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:32,998
Dumb asshole.

1116
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,508
This place
is a Nike site, right?

1117
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:35,804
Yeah.

1118
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,778
Well, they weren't making
sneakers up in here.

1119
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:40,246
Nike sites were built
during the Cold War

1120
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:42,249
to house missiles.

1121
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,682
What?

1122
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,846
What, you were smoking weed
during history class?

1123
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:51,222
Anyways, there were missiles,
and there had to be missile silos.

1124
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:55,024
We find one of those,
and we'll have our escape route.

1125
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:01,532
Hey, what happened
to Fuck-Face?

1126

01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,099
Oh, Jesus.

[groaning]

1129
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,746
We have to find
that silo.

1130
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,130
It's going to take forever
to search all these hallways.

1131
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:36,103
We've got to split up.

1132
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,264
We meet back here
in five minutes.

1133
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,207
Why do white people
always want to split up?

1134
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:42,504
I'm not doing it.

1135
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,773
He's right.

1136
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,508
Whatever. It's y'all's funeral.
Who is going with who?

1137
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:47,514
Trevor, you're gonna
go with me.

1138
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,916
No. Trevor and l
stick together.

1139
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,147
We'll be okay.

1140
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:54,951
All right. Five minutes.

1141
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,149
Not a second longer.

1142
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,159
Be careful.

1143
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,335
You look hot.

1144
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,535
Shut the fuck up.

1145
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,876
Lucky somebody paid attention
during history class.

1146
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,648
Yeah, you're not
as dumb as you look.

1147
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,280
Oh, yeah?

1148
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,155
Well, you're not
as annoying as you look.

1149
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:41,029
Just in case.

1150
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:14,367
Go!

1151
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:17,200

[Salazar screams]

1153
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:39,419
Are you all right?

1154
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:42,190
Yeah. Salazar?

1155
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,423
Great.

1156
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,063
Holy shit.
What?

1157
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:51,105
It's missile propulsion tanks.

1158
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,197
Are you sure?

1159
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,536
Yeah.

1160
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,975
We can rig these
like giant flamethrowers,

1161
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,477
get all those things
in one place,

1162
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,377
and just blast
the shit out of them.

1163
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,847
All right.

1164
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:04,374
As soon as Nina knocks
the nozzles off the tanks,

1165
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,911
all I have to do is--

1166
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,054
Are you all right?

1167
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,118
It's fine.

1168
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,569
All right, I'm going
to be running like hell.

1169
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,939
As soon as I clear,
you fire the tanks, okay?

1170
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,136
Got it.

1171
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,473
And don't worry,
it's going to work.

1172
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:33,343
I know.

1173
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,347
Hey, Sarah?

1174
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,111
Yeah?

1175
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:37,446
Don't get eaten.

1176
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,101
[growling]

1177
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,327
Hey!

1178
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,159
[screaming]

1179
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,406
Now!

1180
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:37,431
[Sarah]
See if Logan left the keys.

1181
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,850
[Radio]
An update on the outbreak
in Leadville, Colorado.

1182
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:58,442
We're getting sketchy reports

1183
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,488
that bodies are still being discovered,

1184
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,524
but a spokesman
for the military has assured us

1185
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:06,356
that the flu-like virus
has been fully contained.

1186
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:08,293
So while travel to and from the area

1187
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,729
won 't be fully restored
for several days,

1188
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:13,359
it looks like the danger is over.

1189
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:17,303
This is Haley Schue reporting
for KDSX, Colorado County.

1190
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,498
Aah!

1191
01:22:18,499 --> 01:22:19,499
