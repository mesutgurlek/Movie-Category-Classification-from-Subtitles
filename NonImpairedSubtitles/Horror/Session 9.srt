1
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,034
There's nothing but idiots
on this thing.

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,232
I've got to find something else.

3
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,278
There you go... some music.

4
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,835
Gordy?

5
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,152
You look tired.

6
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,278
You look beat.

7
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,596
Your turn to feed Emma?

8
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,188
She still has that

9
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,840
ear infection.

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,877
Still? She had that
at the christening.

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,039
She's still got it, huh?

12
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,030
How's Wendy holding up?

13
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,600
Tired. Same as me.

14
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,716
You need anything, Gordon,
you let me know. I'm here.

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,918
Hang in there.
You are going to be fine.

16
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,480
About fifteen minutes.

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,630
Okay, I'll tell him right now.

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,988
That was Bill Griggs.
He says he'll be here in a minute.

19
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay, thanks.
See you.

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,880
When was the hospital actually
closed?

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,154
Eighty-five.

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,200
I am curious because

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,600
you have the firearm on.
And people aren't trying to get out.

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,200
- Not out, in!
- Who?

26
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,590
Kids, delinquents, homeless.

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,040
A lot of patients ended up
in the streets when it closed.

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,433
Some come back. I found half a dozen
there last spring.

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,960
- The patients come back?
- God knows why!

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,200
I'd rather sleep in the street,
personally.

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,158
- But then, I'm not nuts!
- Obviously.

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,594
- There he is. Good luck, fellas.
- Thanks.

33
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,120
- Are we first in line?
- Nope.

34
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,640
Environmental Solutions and American
Yankees were up here last week.

35
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,480
What was their bid?

36
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,320
The Yankees bid was fast and low.

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,280
The way Griggs like them.
He likes jobs fast.

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,272
- I like them safe.
- But we cannot gamble with this.

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,720
You want me to talk to him?

40
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,359
I know what I'm doing.

41
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,479
Holy shit! Look at this.

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,553
Look at this.

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,400
1871 is when she went up.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,640
We call her the "Kirkbride Building",
named after Dr. Thomas Kirkbride.

45
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,560
It's a simple layout.

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
If you consider a giant flying bat.

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,240
The main staff building
in the middle.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,200
Slanting off to each slide
are these crooked bat wings.

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,919
One for female patients,
the other for male.

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,549
A bat.

51
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,880
This place is listed
in the national historic register.

52
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,480
I can't tear it down. Only one tenth
of it is salvageable.

53
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,920
But the land is priceless.
You know, put up a Wal-Mart,

54
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,798
but the town manager
wants to reclaim it.

55
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,079
- What the fuck is this?
- Are you scared, Phil?

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,520
This is hydrotherapy. They'd soak
the nut jobs in cold water.

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,480
Or they'd give them a lobotomy.
It was perfected here at Danvers.

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,880
You've done your homework.

59
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,240
My wife Elizabeth
is the town historian.

60
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,520
There's a morgue in the basement
where they did post mortem...

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,671
Bill, could you show us
the problem areas?

62
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,949
- Yeah. Sure. This way.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,560
You could feed a fucking army
in here!

64
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,311
It was a self-contained town.
Church, movie theater, bowling alley.

65
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,273
There's a lovely cemetery
behind the machine shop.

66
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,596
No headstones, just numbers.

67
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,400
You ought to check it out.
Watch your step.

68
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,720
This'll become
the municipal archives.

69
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,640
- It was a dining area.
- Will there be a lot of people?

70
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,600
Like a library.

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,040
All these tiles have to go.
These are deadly.

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,400
- They're loaded with asbestos.
- Really?

73
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,949
- The other bids didn't indicate it.
- They should have.

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,760
I'll take you to the female wing.
Ward C.

75
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,720
It'll become Administration,
Town Manager's office

76
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,160
- and Department of Public Works.
- In other words, your office.

77
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,639
You better believe it!

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,200
Each wing is made of four wards.

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Ward A, B, C, D.
Ward A, the wing tip

80
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,270
is the farthest away
from the staff building.

81
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,195
- This was for extreme patients.
- What do you mean?

82
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,868
Psychotic.

83
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,640
Keep the dangerous ones
furthest away, huh?

84
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,080
You're smart. They called Ward A
the snake pit.

85
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,920
Follow these and they'll take you
to C. I wouldn't walk on the floors.

86
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,760
- There's a water damage.
- How do we get over there?

87
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,716
Are you scared of the dark?

88
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,188
Over here.

89
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,596
Hello, Gordon.

90
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,790
Gordy? It's me.
Come on.

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,000
A Survival Rations.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,760
Duck and cover. Bend over
and kiss your ass good bye.

93
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,160
This was a fallout shelter.
That is a weird idea.

94
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,760
These ducts have to be wet-stripped.

95
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,311
That breaks off. You will
pollinate the entire building.

96
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,233
- I wouldn't want that.
- You don't.

97
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,910
Gordon, let me lead.

98
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,995
This used to be a solarium.
I call it the carpet toy room.

99
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,720
Danvers Town Hall.

100
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,160
Reclaiming a dark past
to build a brighter future.

101
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,560
- Crocidolite.
- What?

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,160
- Crocidolite.
- Crocidolite?

103
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,840
Worst kind.
This is decayed, friable.

104
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,000
- Circa nineteen forties.
- Really?

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,788
- What's the deal?
- I would seal off this whole area.

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,840
Full poly, a couple of neg air
machines, the whole bit.

107
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,480
OSHA won't let me start
until you guys clean up.

108
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,600
I have to get construction crews
in here by Columbus Day. How long?

109
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,320
These rooms, game room,
tunnels...

110
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,800
I would say three weeks, minimum.

111
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
Three weeks.

112
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,470
Two.
Two weeks.

113
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,715
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks.

114
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,509
You guys for hire?
What is it?

115
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,951
Two weeks.

116
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,680
- Two weeks.
- He's the captain, right?

117
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,160
You better believe it.

118
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,799
You've seen enough.
Need anything else?

119
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,080
What's all this, Bill?

120
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,520
They're punks. They come here,
get high, shoot guns.

121
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,200
- Destructive bastards.
- Shoot at what?

122
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,838
Hopefully, at each other.

123
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,269
- What is this?
- Phil, are you checking in?

124
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,552
Don't go in there without
your bathing suit.

125
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,830
This is seclusion.

126
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,040
That's what they called
the patients' rooms.

127
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,920
It was part of therapy
in the Seventies.

128
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,038
Art therapy, creative expression.

129
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,396
It helped them
with their self esteem!

130
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,600
Helped them feel good
about themselves. Creepy.

131
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,549
Shades of your childhood, huh?
There's a picture of me.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,275
What was wrong with this woman?

133
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,793
I don't know.

134
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,440
Watch out for the broken glass.

135
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,400
I have a little time.
You want to check out the cemetery?

136
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,640
- 750 bodies bured there.
- Gentlemen...

137
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,920
I left the bag.

138
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,600
- You know where you're going?
- The bat wing, right?

139
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,750
- I'll see you down here.
- Okay.

140
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,076
- Gum?
- No, thanks.

141
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,960
Congratulations to you and Wendy
on your new addition.

142
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,520
Thanks, Bill.

143
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,600
I know how long you both...
Elizabeth and I are so happy.

144
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
- Want to see a picture?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,430
I'll show you my baby.

146
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
- She's just a doll.
- Emma.

147
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,400
Oh, yeah!

148
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,631
I'll match Yankee's bid.

149
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,160
This isn't how we do bidding
process. Deadline's Friday.

150
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,596
We'll be in on Monday
and out the following Monday.

151
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,160
- You said two weeks.
- One week. I've got 4 good guys.

152
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,390
I'll hire another one.
One week, we're gone.

153
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,320
One week? That's fast.

154
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,117
I'm good for it.

155
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,951
I need the job.

156
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,711
I really need this job.

157
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,440
Roses?
They're lovely!

158
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,749
What's the occasion, Gordon?

159
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,916
Genny is up and running, sir.

160
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,000
- Take the mask off, Hank.
- Are the A field levels safe?

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,592
Take it off, dickhead.

162
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,440
Go down to the tunnel,
Tag those ducks we saw this morning.

163
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,998
Use the green slime.

164
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,313
Red, right?
Those ducts are hazards.

165
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,276
- What?
- Red, right?

166
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,553
Yeah, red.

167
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,439
Phil, Amy says hi.

168
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,640
Keep it up, dickhead.

169
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,552
I'm just relaying information.

170
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,829
This morning in bed
she said to say hi to you.

171
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,233
- Keep it up.
- I got it. That's the problem.

172
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,160
How long have you been working
for Uncle Gordon?

173
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,393
- Five whole years.
- Was he a slave driver?

174
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,390
Gordon is a reasonable man.
I'm the slave driver.

175
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,400
Got a couple of rules.
Safety first, the job done second.

176
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,914
And... No drugs on the job.

177
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,234
What the hell is that?

178
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,874
Mike, will you show me the ropes?

179
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,320
- Is this the new guy?
- They call it Jeff.

180
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,878
It's Gordon's nephew.

181
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,200
- Gordy didn't tell you about these?
- What?

182
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,270
- You can't use these.
- Why not?

183
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,240
Music creates sonic vibrations.

184
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,200
Vibrations jiggle spooge dust
into the air.

185
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,080
It gets into your lungs.

186
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,071
Is this the music
you plan on listening to here?

187
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,680
- Yeah.
- You trying to kill us all?

188
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,879
Put it away or play
something else. Yanni or John Tesch.

189
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,192
I'll see you guys at lunch.
I'm going down deep.

190
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,108
Who's Yanni?

191
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,000
Gordy, you finally landed us
the perfect gig.

192
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,630
What we do is crazy.
We work in an insane asylum!

193
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,320
You should be grateful,
you're about to make decent money.

194
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,197
Five bucks an hour?

195
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,798
- Didn't you tell him?
- No. You tell him.

196
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,878
Ten thousand dollar bonus.
Gordon arranged it with the town.

197
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,279
What's the catch?

198
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,516
It's got to be finished by the 13th.

199
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,280
This Monday?
This is at least a two week job.

200
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,396
Exactly right.
We're going to work our asses off.

201
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,389
So, what is that?
Ten g's each?

202
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,000
If you don't like it Henry,
I'll give you a ride to the airport.

203
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,520
- Let it go.
- You taking Amy to the airport?

204
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,239
- She likes to travel.
- I know.

205
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,479
Hey guys! I have the keys
for the gate.

206
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,672
Thanks, man.

207
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,120
What do you think? Fifteen years
really does a number on a place.

208
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,874
There used to be over 2, 400
patients here at one point.

209
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,193
Why'd they close this place down?

210
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,473
Nearly all these places closed down
in the Eighties. The budgets cuts.

211
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,070
The Feds called it
Deinstitutionalization.

212
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,960
They just dumped the people
on the street?

213
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,240
Some. Some went to home care type
programs.

214
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,870
The loonies are out in the real world
and we've the keys to the loony bin.

215
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,200
It wasn't just the budget cuts.

216
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,952
What was it then, Mike?

217
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,989
Patricia Willard scandal, 1984.

218
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,318
I don't recall that.

219
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,869
Patricia Willard was committed here
in the 1970's by her parents.

220
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,632
Maniac depression, that sort
of thing. Typical adolescent crap.

221
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,880
But in the 1980's this Repressed
Memory Therapy took off.

222
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,280
The shrinks figured these
new techniques would release

223
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,400
hidden memories of traumatic events
like rape, incest.

224
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,640
So Patricia,
with the help of her doctors,

225
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,270
recalls that when she was ten,
her father raped her.

226
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,518
But not once, right?
No. Three times a week.

227
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,360
And he didn't just rape her.

228
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,639
He came into her room at night
wearing a black robe.

229
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,310
He drove her to a wooded area where
her grandparents and mother were.

230
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,392
They wore black robes. When they
took them off, orgies ensued.

231
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,434
And then they brought out
the newborn.

232
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,560
She was forced to watch as her
mother

233
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,028
cut a baby's heart out
with a stone dagger.

234
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,876
She'd drink the blood,
others would eat the flesh.

235
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,480
The grandfather and father
would fuck her repeatedly.

236
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,678
- She was forced to have abortions.
- Enough!

237
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,080
This happened here?

238
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,278
Yeah. Satanic Ritual Abuse Syndrome
was big in the Eighties.

239
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,880
Destroyed a lot of families.

240
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,317
Patricia was ready to sue hers.
It was set to go to trial, and...

241
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,360
- What?
- She dropped the suit.

242
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,760
Why?

243
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,753
Her parents found a physical exam
she'd undergone a year prior.

244
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,511
Turns out she was a virgin.

245
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,353
None of it happened. So the family
countersues, and they win.

246
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,274
That, and the budget cuts.

247
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,355
- Mike, is that story true?
- Yes.

248
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,680
- How do you know that stuff?
- My dad was a lawyer on the case.

249
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,040
His dad's the state attorney
general. Better watch yourself.

250
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,080
Hank, leave it alone.

251
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,360
You were supposed to carry
the torch too, huh?

252
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,840
Hank, drop it.

253
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,308
Were you on the one year plan?

254
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,633
- You need help with that?
- No, I'm fine.

255
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,600
- Jesus!
- Tough week-end?

256
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,360
I think I pulled a muscle.

257
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,800
Mike and I called you Saturday to
take you out for winning the bid.

258
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,000
That was nice.
I was catching up on sleep.

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,468
- Baby still have that ear thing?
- Yeah.

260
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,200
If we don't make Monday...

261
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,240
- Griggs likes jobs fast.
- What if we lose this bonus?

262
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,559
We won't.

263
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,560
I know where this is leading.
Jeff is young, but he isn't stupid.

264
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,551
I'm not talking about Jeff.

265
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,880
Saturday night we saw Craig McManus.
I told him about the bonus.

266
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,800
He said he would leave Yankee
and work for us.

267
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,320
He has more experience than Hank
and he gives a shit.

268
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,840
Your job here
is to eliminate obstacles.

269
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,960
That's what I'm trying to do.

270
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,400
Jesus, man.
We're talking about Hank.

271
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,000
If I thought he was a liability,
I'd let you sack him.

272
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,355
- I don't agree.
- I don't care!

273
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,398
- Let's finish the decon chamber.
- Fine.

274
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,800
- Alright.
- Go slow, turn right, slow...

275
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,640
Try to get straight!
You have to bring the nose down.

276
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,880
Don't look at me.
What are you, a lobotomy case?

277
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,040
Fuck you, man!

278
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,996
Slow down!

279
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,240
- Nice job.
- That wasn't me.

280
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,400
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.

281
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,960
- Just wait there.
- What?

282
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,915
Hang on.

283
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,072
What the hell?

284
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,637
Go down and check
the breaker box.

285
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,550
I can't do that.

286
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,868
Why?

287
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,236
I got nyctophobia.

288
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,470
- What?
- Fear of the dark.

289
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,880
Okay. I'll go check the breaker box.

290
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,633
Try not to break anything,
mullet head.

291
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,078
Thanks, man.

292
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,999
Damn!

293
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,553
- You okay?
- Yes, fine.

294
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,120
Good first day.

295
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,400
Mike needs another hour.
The genny's carburetor is acting up.

296
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,000
Okay, but I don't want anyone
around this place after dark.

297
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,440
Good first day, guys.

298
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,280
Keep up like this,
we'll be dead by Monday.

299
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,236
Fuck you, Phil!

300
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,793
See you in the morning.

301
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,678
I know this is difficult, Mary.
That's why we're here to help.

302
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,039
I miss Peter.

303
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,839
I miss him so much!

304
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,920
Mary, I want you to remember
what happened 22 years ago.

305
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,832
Christmas night in Lowell.

306
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,160
That's where we grew up.

307
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,596
Yes. What happened that night
in Lowell?

308
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,400
- Nothing happened!
- Mary, something did happen.

309
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,960
That's why we have these sessions,
to help you remember.

310
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,480
No, I can't remember.

311
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,880
File note. Patient shows
extreme agitation.

312
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,952
She is putting her fingers
in her mouth.

313
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,152
Will you share a doll,
Mister Doctor?

314
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,000
Who am I speaking with?

315
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,560
Mary Hobbes got a china doll
from her mother.

316
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,154
We can't find it now.

317
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,960
No, Princess, I haven't seen it.

318
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,114
- Maybe Billy knows!
- Silly Billy!

319
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,473
Princess, what happened on Christmas
22 years ago in Lowell?

320
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,400
We got presents.

321
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,080
Mary got a pretty china doll

322
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,516
and Peter got a big old knife.

323
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,760
Then what happened?

324
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,515
Mary's mommy and daddy
went to sleep.

325
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,993
We played upstairs.

326
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,798
Peter turned off the lights
and hid. Mary tried to find him.

327
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,034
Who played upstairs?

328
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,749
Mary and Peter,
and me and Billy, silly!

329
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,240
Has Billy told you
what happened next?

330
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,471
Billy only tells me nice things.

331
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,400
Like that I am pretty.

332
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,518
Princess,
was Simon there that night?

333
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,960
I don't know any Simon.

334
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,600
Billy never told you about Simon?

335
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,669
No.

336
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,320
I'm tired, Mister Doctor.

337
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,959
Maybe Billy would like to talk now.

338
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,392
Billy is asleep.

339
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,272
He's asleep.

340
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,828
You can hear me.

341
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,160
Genny's topped off
and running.

342
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,920
Good. I don't want her dying on us.

343
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,152
- Put your mask on, Princess.
- I'm not your princess.

344
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,915
- What?
- What's up with Phil and Hank?

345
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,114
What's up with Phil and Hank?

346
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,400
Hank stole Phil's girlfriend.
You don't want to get involved.

347
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,393
Don't get on Phil's bad side.
He'll give you the grunt work.

348
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,712
1884.

349
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,879
1883. Fuck!

350
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,750
Hank, come back.

351
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,920
Yeah, Hank here.

352
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,038
I want you with Jeff and Mike
after lunch.

353
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,032
Alright. Hank out.

354
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,473
Got your wallet.

355
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,360
Nice grab. Ladies,
thank Uncle Gordy for lunch.

356
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,720
Thanks.

357
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,160
Your turn tomorrow.
Where's Mike?

358
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,800
The equipment room,
looking for those lost cartridges.

359
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,960
I don't want anyone around here
by themselves!

360
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,280
- It won't happen again.
- Do you have my scratch tickets?

361
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,600
I have them right here.
Hank's scratch tickets.

362
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,640
There's one.

363
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,720
These are jubilee.
You know I play Blackjack.

364
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,240
- Yeah to you too.
- Fuck you!

365
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,480
Mary, come in.

366
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,560
I can't talk anymore.
I am too tired.

367
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,480
Miss Hobbes is entering
a dissociative state,

368
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,000
rubbing her eyes,
switching to a remote personality.

369
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,760
- Mike, come back.
- I'll be right there.

370
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,991
- Mary?
- Hello, sir.

371
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,438
Hello, Billy.
How have you been?

372
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,836
Never better, sir.

373
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,117
Billy, where does the princess live?

374
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,319
- In the tongue.
- Why the tongue?

375
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,680
Because she's always talking, sir.

376
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,955
And where do you live?

377
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,080
I live in the eyes. You know that.

378
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,878
Remind me. Why the eyes?

379
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,715
Because I see everything.

380
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,437
And where does Simon live?

381
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,036
Where does Simon?

382
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,680
What's mortified pride?

383
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,840
Three patients were committed
in 1889 for mortified pride.

384
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,800
1889. Where'd you get this?

385
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,960
Under some boxes. They left a lot
of shit in this place.

386
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,480
When Phil calls lunch,
it means lunch.

387
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,200
No cartridges. I have to pick some
up at Grossman's.

388
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,000
Listen to this. 17 were committed
due to disappointed expectations.

389
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,630
They're talking about you. They
would've committed your ass then.

390
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,320
What do you have to do now to get
committed? Mortify someone's pride?

391
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,400
Simple.

392
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,675
You kill someone.

393
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,560
That won't get you committed.
That'll get you in jail.

394
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,278
If you get caught.

395
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,992
John Hinkley, temporary insanity.
He's in a nut house.

396
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,280
That defense never works. Most
people are conscious when they kill.

397
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,157
Homicide requires a motive.

398
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,920
How did you fail law school?
You're good.

399
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,233
What are you?
A lobotomy case?

400
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,073
Jeff, come on.

401
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,954
Toe me!

402
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,400
We're just fucking around.
Sorry, Mike.

403
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,600
The Ice Pick method.

404
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,880
Insert a thin metal pipette
into the orbitalfrontal cortex

405
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,998
and enter the soft tissue
of the frontal lobe.

406
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,560
A few simple smooth,
up and down jerks

407
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,391
to sever the kateral hypothalamus.

408
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,320
Resulting in a rapid reduction
of stress for our patient.

409
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,480
Total time elapsed, two minutes.
Only side effect?

410
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,029
- A black eye.
- Recommended treatment.

411
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,038
Sun glasses.

412
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,478
- Brilliant! Very good.
- Alright. Let's get back to work.

413
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,990
I wasn't kidding.
You should use your head, buddy.

414
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,320
I have to get a part
from Gordon's van.

415
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,160
Make sure mullet head
knows how to operate that thing.

416
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,073
Mike, don't forget this.

417
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,640
- You know how to ride a lawn mower?
- Yeah.

418
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,200
We just had a break.

419
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,751
Push it to that mid section there.

420
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,040
I am taking a smoke break.

421
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,837
We just had a break.

422
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,920
- What's up?
- You know what a whale is?

423
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,876
Yeah, I know.

424
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,160
A whale is a big time gambler.

425
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,920
I have a buddy
who deals out at Foxwoods.

426
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,120
12 hours and this whale has the
house down three hundred grand.

427
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,960
This guy leaves, takes his car keys
and drops them in my friend's pocket.

428
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,235
- You know what they're for?
- What?

429
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,190
Porsche 911.

430
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,998
And that was the tip.

431
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,713
Fucking tip!

432
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,079
What's your point?

433
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,360
I have an exit plan.

434
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,115
If you stick with this job too long,
it will mess you up.

435
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,238
It gets inside and stresses you.

436
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,069
You see?

437
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,358
Already a piece of this shit

438
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
may have gone into your lungs.

439
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,633
It incubates in your lungs and tissue
grows around it like a pearl.

440
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,590
Like a time bomb.
By the time you hit 30...

441
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,715
You're drowning in
your own lung fluid.

442
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,429
You're not even wearing
your mask now.

443
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,838
- Where's your mask?
- Me?

444
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,760
No, I've learned.
I have an exit plan.

445
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,672
I have a way of dealing
with the stress.

446
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,320
You think Mike
reads all those books for fun?

447
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,038
He has an exit plan, I tell you.

448
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,200
If the stress gets too intense
on this job,

449
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,640
he'll go back and finish law school.
He'll pass the bar

450
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,475
and make his dad proud.
That's his exit plan.

451
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,520
Phil's got his stress reducer.

452
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,479
He's got this plan.
He'll tell you about it some day.

453
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,955
Then there's Uncle Gordo.

454
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,880
If he didn't get this gig,
he'd have to fold H.E.G.

455
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,000
He can't even have an exit plan.
Fiber has always been his life.

456
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,152
It was over there. It is here.
Imagine that stress.

457
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,428
Let me tell you something.
You better hope

458
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,960
to have some of Gordo's genes.

459
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,838
Gordo is the Zen master of calm.

460
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,351
I've never seen old Gordo
lose it.

461
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,560
I don't know. In the last few months
I've seen some cracks.

462
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,915
I worry.

463
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,280
Mikey knows what I'm talking about,
right?

464
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,236
He does have the new baby.

465
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,760
Should be the joy of his life.

466
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,038
When you and Amy have a kid,
you'll see how hard it is.

467
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,400
Me and Amy?
I just fuck her to beat on Phil.

468
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,436
Get off your ass.
I want my bonus.

469
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,517
Hi, Wendy?

470
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,239
I know, but we need to talk.

471
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,959
We have to.

472
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,436
Would you let me finish.
Hello?

473
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,958
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.

474
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,553
Let's do this thing.

475
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,075
Silver.

476
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,031
Yeah, gold.

477
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,190
Fucking eyeballs.

478
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,951
They ought to be worth something.

479
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,990
Check that out.

480
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,995
What the hell is that?

481
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,152
Oh, God!

482
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,273
Fucking birds!

483
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,993
Jesus.

484
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,953
So what's the verdict?

485
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,991
I'm getting nothing. He didn't leave
his answering service on.

486
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,593
- You try Amy's yet?
- Do you know her number?

487
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,760
I'll try information.

488
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,830
Give me the phone.

489
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,952
I know the number.
Give me the phone!

490
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,068
Thank you.

491
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,393
Hi, it's me.
Yeah.

492
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,551
Wait a second.
What?

493
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,274
What are you talking about?

494
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,999
When did this happen?

495
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,198
Really?

496
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,154
Hang in there. I'll call you back.

497
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,080
Our favorite piece of shit, Hank,

498
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,120
went to Amy's last night.
He packed his car,

499
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,840
told her he found his meal
ticket,

500
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,080
and he bolted to Miami
to Casino School.

501
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,200
That lucky fuck!
Probably scored on a scratch.

502
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,680
I warned her, didn't l?

503
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,280
She said he left
without saying anything?

504
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,114
It's Hank.
He's totally unreliable.

505
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,752
Call Craig
and see if he's still available.

506
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,588
This is a blessing. We replace
this asshole and move forward.

507
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,600
Something is not right here.

508
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,828
What's the matter?

509
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,430
You know those two guys
you were talking to yesterday?

510
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,959
- What guys?
- I saw you.

511
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,680
- What were you talking about?
- What is this?

512
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,399
- I'm asking you a question.
- Okay.

513
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,549
- You're questioning my performance?
- Should I be?

514
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,520
- Call McManus.
- Don't walk away from me!

515
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,193
Don't ever walk away from me.

516
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,230
You're going to hit me?

517
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,880
You think I'm doing a bad job,
Mike?

518
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,359
No, you're doing fine.

519
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,040
This used to be a great deal.

520
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,360
Steady gigs, joking around,
beers after work.

521
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,240
It says here that eight were
committed for uncontrolled passion.

522
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,470
Then Emma came.

523
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,760
That's why we lost
the last two gigs.

524
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,160
He's tired and he overbid.

525
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,640
- Gordon loves being a father.
- Yeah, now he does.

526
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,916
But it was never in his heart.
This was Wendy's idea.

527
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,320
Look, Phil...

528
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,760
When you say you don't want something
it doesn't mean you don't want it.

529
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,560
Six years ago I didn't want to be
a lawyer, but now...

530
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,393
Wait.
Who are you kidding?

531
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,760
You shuck fiber with us.

532
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,160
It's not what I am talking about.
I am talking about fatherhood.

533
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:18,360
It's fucking his job up. He should've
canned Hank's ass 6 months ago.

534
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,640
What are you looking at?
Where are you going?

535
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,393
- To take a piss.
- You got twenty-five!

536
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,433
Hello, Wendy?

537
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,677
Can we talk?

538
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,959
I want to ask you something.

539
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,636
Can you forgive me?

540
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,757
Uncle Gordon!

541
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,629
Hello?

542
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,040
- Sorry.
- Hey, man.

543
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,360
I didn't see you on the phone.

544
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,157
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

545
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,635
I just came

546
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,200
to thank you
for giving me this job.

547
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:29,640
- I'll bust my ass for you.
- I know that.

548
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,712
Don't stress out.
Things will work out.

549
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,228
- I'm hear for you.
- Yeah.

550
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,116
- Family, man.
- Yeah.

551
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,150
- Was that Aunt Wendy?
- Yeah.

552
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,520
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

553
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,752
She's tired, you know?

554
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,232
- Kids tire you out sometimes.
- Yeah, I know.

555
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,600
- My dad got the christening photos.
- Yeah?

556
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,752
- Emma looks really pissed off.
- She's pretty pissed.

557
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,480
Why are you crying, Mary?

558
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,400
I miss my family.

559
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,437
How come they don't visit?

560
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,639
How did you get those scars
on your chest?

561
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,000
How many times should I tell you?

562
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,360
- I fell off my bike.
- Is that what you remember?

563
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,634
Yes!

564
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,040
Can you tell me
who the Princess is?

565
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,520
- I have no idea.
- And who is Billy?

566
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,273
I don't know anyone
named Billy.

567
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,400
- Who is Simon?
- I have no idea who Simon is!

568
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
- I'm sick of this!
- Calm down.

569
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,197
I want to go back to my room!

570
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,116
Mary is asleep, sir.

571
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,560
Billy, tell me what happened
in Lowell. I know you saw it.

572
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,240
You know perfectly well.

573
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,680
Mary needs to know what happened
to remember.

574
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,960
- No!
- Simon might like to tell me.

575
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,120
- He's asleep.
- Help me wake him up.

576
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,520
- No!
- We must wake up Simon.

577
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,195
- I'm too scared!
- Billy, we have to wake up Simon.

578
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,518
Take a shower, Gordon. Don't go home
with that shit on you.

579
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,916
What is the stupidest thing
you've ever done?

580
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,354
You mean besides working for you?

581
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,195
I would have to say...

582
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,440
Introducing Hank to Amy.
That was pretty stupid.

583
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,399
I wish I had that one back.

584
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,950
I hit Wendy.

585
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,918
What?

586
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,280
Friday night. I wanted to celebrate
getting this job.

587
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,192
I had flowers and champagne.

588
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,071
I went into the kitchen.
She was cooking pasta.

589
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,355
I wanted to kiss her.

590
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,273
She turned around and a pot
of boiling water poured on my leg.

591
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,880
I don't know if it was
the dog barking

592
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,633
or Emma crying,

593
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,639
but I slapped her.

594
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,556
I hit my wife.

595
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,430
I love my wife.

596
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,236
It was an accident.

597
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,316
I never slapped her before.

598
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,832
I've tried to talk to her on
the phone, but she won't listen.

599
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,957
Where are you staying?

600
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,796
A motel.

601
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,750
You're going to tell the other guys
about this?

602
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,670
Oh, come on.

603
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,234
You're right about Craig.
You should call him.

604
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,955
Those kids, the other day...

605
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,320
I talked to those graffiti artists
and they won't be coming back.

606
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,560
I said, if I see you again,
I'm calling Security.

607
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,916
So, that's taken care of.

608
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,713
Okay.

609
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,952
Hang in there.

610
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,480
Take a shower.

611
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,311
Take the shit off of you.

612
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,833
Hello, Gordon.

613
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,520
Do you know who I am?

614
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,440
Roses?
They're lovely!

615
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,749
What's the occasion, Gordon?

616
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,600
Not here. Later.

617
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,795
Watch out!

618
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,673
Do it!

619
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,320
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

620
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,232
I wasn't the only one
who couldn't sleep.

621
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,069
Craig's coming in tomorrow.

622
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,359
You okay?

623
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,750
I want to go home.

624
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,671
I am going inside.

625
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,113
I have to go.

626
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,671
It's going to get ugly.

627
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,640
Jesus!

628
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,600
- Jeff, what did you do?
- It wasn't me!

629
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,352
I'm going to check the breakers.

630
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,160
- What?
- Take a break with me.

631
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,840
- I have to check the breakers.
- Let the kid do it.

632
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,478
He can't. He's got nychtophobia.

633
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,910
Alright.

634
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,439
Fuck it.

635
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,600
- We have a problem.
- What?

636
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,640
We have a problem
and this is not easy for me.

637
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,200
- Look at me. It's not easy.
- Alright.

638
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,280
- We need to talk about Gordon.
- What about him?

639
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,960
He needs to take some time off.

640
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,430
- Why?
- Because he's becoming a liability.

641
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,040
I can see you are paranoid.

642
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,640
Do you know that he hit his wife?

643
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,676
He hit Wendy.

644
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,360
I've got Craig coming tomorrow.

645
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,920
If he hears about this,
you know what that means?

646
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,357
You want to lose this gig?
That's what will happen.

647
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,160
- So what do we do?
- You listen to me.

648
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,040
I don't give a shit what happens.
I'm in charge now.

649
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,350
- When will you do this?
- It might happen Saturday.

650
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,438
We were talking
about your nephew.

651
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,434
You know, how he's coming along.

652
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,195
And how is he coming along?

653
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,436
Hey, hello!

654
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,755
You're in deep shit,
you know that?

655
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,640
What are you doing here?

656
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:31,360
Me? Everyone thinks you're in Miami
in that Casino School.

657
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,715
Gordon and Phil want your head!

658
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,155
Did you score on a scratch?

659
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,358
What are you doing here?

660
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,993
I forgot something.
I'll be back.

661
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,119
He just needs a little motivation.

662
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,117
What do you think?

663
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,160
I think he's a little slow.

664
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,480
But Craig is coming
and we'll pick up slack.

665
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:19,157
He may be party in the back, but I'll
make sure he's business in the front.

666
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,400
- What time is it?
- I think it's noon.

667
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,470
- Lunch time.
- Yeah.

668
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,520
Want to place the order?

669
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,272
Yeah, sure.

670
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,949
I think it's Phil's turn.

671
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,440
- Fuck it. Let's flip for it.
- What?

672
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,560
- Let's flip for it.
- Where'd you get that?

673
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,240
Found it.
It might even be worth something.

674
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,071
- You found it?
- Yep.

675
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,400
Heads or tails?

676
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,594
Heads.

677
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,190
Tails. Get going, loser.

678
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,868
What?

679
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,349
Hey, uncle!

680
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,350
I found Hank!

681
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,794
What do you want?

682
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,388
- I found Hank.
- What the fuck are you saying?

683
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,360
I saw Hank in the stairwell.
He was standing there.

684
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:34,831
- Don't be a fucking idiot.
- I swear I saw him!

685
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,320
If he's in Miami,
why would he be here?

686
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,280
- I saw him!
- Get to work. We'll bring you lunch.

687
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,360
- Where was he?
- Next to the equipment room.

688
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:50,433
You believe this punk?

689
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,029
For Christ's sake, Mike!

690
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,600
This is so God damn ridiculous.

691
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,720
If he's in Miami,
why would he be here?

692
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,480
- Ask him yourself. Right up there.
- We are going to do that.

693
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,760
- That is where I am taking you.
- We're going to do that.

694
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,640
- He's up there.
- Where is he?

695
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,760
He was standing right there.

696
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,877
It's weird, but he's right here.

697
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,472
Right where?

698
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,080
I swear he was.
Why would I make this up?

699
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:24,040
Nice going, Jeff.
You heard me on the phone with Amy.

700
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,034
She said Hank went to Miami.
We all heard it, right?

701
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,713
No, we didn't.

702
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,553
What?

703
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,395
- I want to go to lunch.
- You stay where you are.

704
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:46,400
- What are you saying?
- You told us that.

705
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,109
We heard you on the phone,
but we didn't hear Amy.

706
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:55,320
So she wasn't on the phone?
This is what I'm talking about.

707
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,709
- Mike, give me that cell phone.
- Why?

708
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,960
- I want to talk to Amy.
- You don't need to speak to Amy.

709
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,200
- Give me the cell phone.
- Don't give it to him.

710
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,120
- Give me the cell phone.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

711
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,200
- Give me the cell phone.
- He's losing it.

712
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,236
Give me the cell phone!

713
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,229
- What the fuck was that?
- It's Hank!

714
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,560
Jeff, Mike, go downstairs. Make sure
he doesn't come. You come with me.

715
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,152
Fuck you!

716
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,110
You come with me. Let's go.

717
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,839
Come on.

718
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,356
- You go that way.
- The tunnels are safer.

719
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,749
Safer?

720
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,749
This could be anybody.
Squatters, kids.

721
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:56,278
Phil, slow down.
He's not down here.

722
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,238
God!

723
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,915
Did you hear that?

724
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,720
I heard something down there.

725
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,438
No, it's this way.

726
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,033
- I'm going down. Follow up top.
- Mike, we stick to...

727
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,233
Fuck this.

728
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,280
What the fuck are we doing here?

729
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,352
So fucking stupid!
Why?

730
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,236
I don't hear anything.

731
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,071
Give me a torch.

732
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,800
This is fucking dumb.
He is not down there.

733
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:04,320
Shut up! If you hear anything,
call me.

734
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,280
- I left my walkie in the van!
- Stay there!

735
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,960
- Phil, wait!
- What, Jeff?

736
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,317
When I saw Hank, I think he had
blood on his hand.

737
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,833
Stay there.

738
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,840
Billy, you understand
that you, the Princess and Simon

739
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,440
are all in Mary?

740
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,840
Yes.

741
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:45,920
If Mary is sick,
then all of you are sick.

742
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,680
- You want Mary to get better, huh?
- Yes!

743
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:55,356
So, help her.
Tell me about the night in Lowell.

744
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,593
We were playing hide n' seek.

745
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,479
Mary was looking for her new doll
and Peter.

746
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,995
It was real dark.

747
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,480
No, I won't tell!

748
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,711
Mary's a good girl.
She doesn't need to know!

749
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,110
- What?
- What Simon did!

750
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,675
To who?

751
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,760
To Peter!

752
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,520
What did Simon do to Peter?

753
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,239
- I won't tell!
- Tell me.

754
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,439
Fuck!

755
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,911
What are you doing here?

756
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,440
- I need to talk to Simon.
- He made me do it.

757
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,919
It was awful.

758
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,593
- We need to wake up Simon.
- No, it was awful!

759
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,153
Wake up Simon.

760
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,832
What are you doing here?

761
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,638
Phil, I think I found Hank.

762
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,517
Gordon, come back.

763
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,196
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

764
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,113
- Ward A. Third floor.
- I'm coming.

765
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,508
Hello, doc.

766
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,479
Simon?

767
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,911
Do you know who I am?

768
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,111
Billy told me a lot about you.

769
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,395
Billy is a smart boy.

770
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,631
What happened on Christmas night
in Lowell?

771
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,669
Use your imagination.

772
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,919
I'd rather you tell me, Simon.

773
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,153
Peter was naughty.

774
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,960
What did Peter do?

775
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:25,669
He shouldn't have done it.

776
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,311
Tell me, Simon.

777
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,518
He scared Mary.

778
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,508
He crept up behind her in the dark.

779
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,428
And he scared her.

780
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,234
Mary fell down.

781
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,398
She fell on her doll.

782
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,636
It cut her up.
It cut her up real bad.

783
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,915
She needed someone to help her.

784
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,752
So I introduced myself.

785
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,430
I told her to cut up Peter.

786
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,235
Do it, Mary.

787
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,757
To cut him up real bad.

788
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,034
Good thing his knife was brand new.

789
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,558
Real sharp.

790
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:49,874
And then, just so her mommy
and daddy wouldn't get mad.

791
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:57,238
I told her to cut them up to.

792
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,595
There was a lot of blood.

793
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,319
So much blood.

794
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:20,038
But Mary wanted to do it.
Do it, Mary!

795
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,154
So she did it.

796
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,396
Gordon, come back, please.

797
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,839
Who is that?

798
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,079
It's Jeff. I am by the van.

799
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,640
I was freaking out.
The lights went out.

800
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,392
I got these in the van.
Is that okay?

801
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,952
Come back.

802
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,312
Come back.

803
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,912
This is Gordon.

804
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,198
We found the one responsible.

805
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,752
You've got to be kidding.
It's beautiful.

806
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,071
Hello? Hello?

807
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,716
Your man is here.
Where are you guys?

808
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,475
I mean he...

809
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,272
He was a liability.

810
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,238
Who did this?

811
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,517
He brought it on himself.

812
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,072
It's typical of Hank.

813
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,188
Wrong place at the wrong time.

814
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,960
You did this.

815
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,599
I need you to wake up

816
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,718
and take a really

817
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,597
good look at him.

818
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,680
What are you doing here?

819
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:44,520
It's okay.
Hang in there. It's me.

820
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,440
We'll get you some help.

821
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:50,400
I wouldn't tell anybody about this.

822
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,790
If they find out about Hank,
they'll find out about the others.

823
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,800
You did this.

824
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,358
What are you doing here?

825
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,240
You hired those guys, didn't you?

826
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,600
You're asleep.

827
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,440
- You hired them to kill him.
- You are asleep.

828
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,237
- Where are the others?
- Open your eyes.

829
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,520
- Where are they?
- You've got to wake up.

830
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,320
- Tell me where they are.
- Would you wake up?

831
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,880
- Tell me.
- Would you wake up?

832
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,552
I am fucking awake!

833
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,351
Who are you talking to?

834
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,516
I'm a little confused here.

835
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,952
What is it?

836
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,596
Why did you do it Simon?

837
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,478
Because Mary let me.

838
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,268
They always do.

839
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,759
What are you doing here?

840
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,597
They always do.

841
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,760
You know what I wouldn't do?

842
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,595
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

843
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,720
I wouldn't tell anybody about this.

844
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:54,480
If they find out about Hank
they'll find out about the others.

845
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:59,395
I found Hank. He's hurt and said
you did it to him.

846
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,475
Who did this?

847
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,798
He brought it on himself.

848
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,628
Wrong place at the wrong time.

849
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,112
Where are the others?

850
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,360
Gordy, you are asleep.

851
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,475
Uncle Gordy!

852
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,078
Wake up!

853
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:45,119
I'm sorry I was freaking out.

854
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,592
I got these in your van.
Is that okay?

855
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,192
I need you to open your eyes now.

856
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,828
Wake up.

857
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,758
And remember.

858
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,873
Roses?
They're lovely!

859
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,435
What's the occasion, Gordon?

860
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,273
Not here, Gordon. Later.

861
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,556
Watch out!

862
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,476
Gordon, look out!

863
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,556
Stop, Gordon!

864
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,956
Do it, Gordon.

865
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,956
Do it, Gordon.

866
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,477
Do it now.

867
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:12,155
Wendy, it's me.
Please don't hang up.

868
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:20,159
I just want to say how
sorry I am for what happened.

869
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,270
I am so sorry.

870
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,072
I am so lonely here.

871
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,231
I want to come home.

872
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,994
I want to hold you.
I want to hold my baby.

873
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,671
Can you forgive me?

874
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,434
Can you forgive me?

875
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,672
Where do you live,
Simon?

876
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,078
I live in the weak and the wounded.

877
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,312
Doc.
