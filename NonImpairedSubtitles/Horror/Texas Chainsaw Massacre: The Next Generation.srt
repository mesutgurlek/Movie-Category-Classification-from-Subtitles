1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,552
News of a bizarre,
chainsaw-wielding family...

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,634
...reports which were to ignite
the world's imagination...

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,917
...began to filter out
of central Texas.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,512
Regrettably, not one of the family
members was ever apprehended...

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,714
...and for more than 10 years,
nothing further was heard.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,868
Then over the next several years...

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,995
...at least two minor, yet apparently
related incidents, were reported.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,390
Then again nothing.

9
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,748
It's not clear how the shooting spree
was motivated...

10
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,398
...although there has been
widespread speculation...

11
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,439
...it was in retaliation for the bomb
threats in Hebron.

12
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,510
A jury ruled guilty in the slaying
of abortion doctor Irwin Guthrie.

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,553
It took the 7-man,
5-woman jury just hours...

14
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,398
...to find Norris guilty...

15
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,359
Hey, I think you're chasing
the wrong tail.

16
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,358
Where have you been?!

17
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,393
The wedding's going on.
You go on the top tier.

18
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,671
Don't mind the footprints
in the icing.

19
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,748
They look good. It's like a vest
thing. I fucking hate kids.

20
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,755
Miss Abbott,
did Barry come through here?

21
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,550
Oh, Barry?

22
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,153
Didn't you break up?

23
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,350
No.

24
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,519
Well, never mind. I just thought...

25
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,309
Forget it.

26
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,152
She's doing it again.

27
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,757
Miss Abbott, she's...

28
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,834
She just does that to make trouble.
It is so obvious.

29
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,713
What are you talking about?

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,232
Don't listen to her.
She's trying to make trouble.

31
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,077
She's such a bitch.

32
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,152
Sean, hi.

33
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,039
Have you seen Barry?

34
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,352
Not in a while. Have you?

35
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,031
- She was completely naked.
- Bullshit.

36
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,750
She was spilling all over the place,
like a battleship.

37
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,110
- A battleship?
- Okay, like a dinghy.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,190
Has anybody seen Barry?

39
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,752
You've seen Barry?

40
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,315
Oh, shit!

41
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,270
Don't worry. She'll be back.

42
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,357
If that's really what you want.

43
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,676
Stop!

44
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,757
Heather, stop the car!

45
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,756
Damn it!

46
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,514
You better fucking stop this car
right now!

47
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,917
We have a wreck, it'll be my ass!

48
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,792
- I don't care.
- Slow down.

49
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,036
I wasn't doing anything.

50
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,356
I saw you. You were kissing her.

51
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,949
Once! What's wrong with that?

52
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,913
I can't even talk to my friends.
You're so possessive.

53
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,555
That's why you were feeling her up.

54
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,150
Guys need sex. It's bad to be excited
and not get it.

55
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,635
You can get prostate cancer.
You want that?

56
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,273
That's a lie.

57
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,996
Look out!

58
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,715
Fuck!

59
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,118
What's the matter with you?

60
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,550
I'm so fucking dead right now!

61
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,439
Oh, man.

62
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,035
You can't get cancer
from not having sex.

63
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,074
Like you'd know. You never
had a date, you're so ugly.

64
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,110
She is not.

65
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,196
Shut up.

66
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,635
He wants you to think it's your fault.

67
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,799
My father's a doctor. I know what
I'm talking about, so fuck you.

68
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,112
It's true, it is my fault.
I won't have sex with him.

69
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,072
It doesn't make it your fault.

70
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,150
What if he gets cancer and his hair
falls out from the drugs? Could happen.

71
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,271
So just shut up, all right?

72
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,677
It's a line to get you
to have sex with him. Ask Sean.

73
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,836
She's right.

74
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,758
He's never had a hard-on.

75
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,271
- I know his lines. We were neighbours.
- Shut up.

76
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,916
We were friends before he got too cool.
So fucking annoying.

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,549
It's not my fault you turned out
to be a geek.

78
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,554
He used to come to my house and laugh
about the girls he felt up.

79
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,793
He told them his father was a doctor...

80
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,992
...and they'd get breast cancer
if they weren't felt up.

81
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,590
It's not my fault they're
stupid enough to believe it.

82
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,710
What a schmuck.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,876
What's your problem?

84
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,232
Just because you hate guys.

85
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,160
He's just trying
to change the subject.

86
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,152
What are you afraid of?
That they might try to fuck you?

87
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,350
No.

88
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,795
It's no secret.

89
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,916
What?

90
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,236
Ask anybody.

91
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,789
You never go anywhere
unless you're with Sean.

92
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,879
Everybody knows he's a pothead
and you're only friends.

93
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,114
What if we crashed into a car in front
of us and we all died?

94
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,558
I dreamt about a weirdo following me
through the woods, and it's coming true.

95
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,476
I'm sorry, but we're all gonna die.

96
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,510
Some murderer...

97
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,470
...will kill us.

98
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,070
Now we can't see.

99
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,998
Someone is following me.

100
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,559
I can feel their eyes on me.

101
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,636
Bullshit!

102
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,678
They want us to wander around
in the dark.

103
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,399
We need an ambulance.

104
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,154
Piece of shit.

105
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,954
You might be, but my father's
still gonna kill me.

106
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,751
Call the police. There's been
an accident. A man's dying.

107
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,075
Prom night.

108
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,395
Somebody bring me a glass of water.

109
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,830
I think I'm gonna pass out.

110
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,519
Damn answering machine.

111
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,313
Don't worry, he'll pick up.

112
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,751
Vilmer, if you're there, babe,
pick up the phone.

113
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,190
Phony as 3-dollar bills.
Changed my life, though.

114
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,669
Goddamn it, button it up, babe.

115
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,432
- Glass of water?
- Stop it!

116
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,709
You know what?

117
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,151
The minute I showed up with these,
every farmer in the county...

118
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,994
...thought he was God's gift to women.

119
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,710
What the hell, doubled my commissions
in the first six months.

120
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,434
Goddamn, it's about time.
Vilmer, listen.

121
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,951
Some kids got in a wreck up the road.
One of them is hurt.

122
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,158
Wait a second.
Which way?

123
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,556
- Back that way.
- How far?

124
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,350
About a mile.

125
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,434
About a mile back up 709 from me.

126
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,399
Why do blonds stick their heads out
car windows?

127
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,710
Why?

128
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,598
To get a refill.

129
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,348
I don't get it.

130
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,433
Airheads?

131
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,034
We should get back there
and see if Sean's okay.

132
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,639
What was that?

133
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,950
Don't worry.

134
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,793
It's just some farmer's wife.

135
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,115
Like I'm even interested!

136
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,469
See them and weep!

137
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,637
Or some high-school boy.

138
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,072
They're always doing something
to get me to flash them.

139
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,435
What?

140
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,034
Is an ambulance coming?
This guy's hurt.

141
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,999
I think he's delirious.

142
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,835
Is he okay?

143
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,319
Boy's dead.

144
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,751
He's not. He's just passed out.

145
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,599
I said he's dead.

146
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,030
He was just talking in his sleep.

147
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,719
Is that right?

148
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,749
Well...

149
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,712
He's dead now.

150
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,792
Don't run off down that road.

151
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,196
- It won't do you any good.
- What'll you do?

152
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,838
First, I'm gonna kill you.

153
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,150
It ain't no fucking biggie.

154
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,319
Of course, it's different
for every individual.

155
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,988
Sorry I can't give you a ride.
The wrecker will be here soon.

156
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,152
- Thanks for calling for us.
- Yeah, thanks.

157
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,479
Don't worry about that boy that drives
the wrecker. He talks tough.

158
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,958
Tell him how the cows eat the cabbage
and you won't have any trouble.

159
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,389
Thanks a lot.

160
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,468
What about that service station?
Can someone there give us a ride?

161
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,958
That old man? He's liable to shoot
first and ask questions later.

162
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,875
We see you, you old fart!

163
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,354
Thanks. Bye.

164
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,793
You tired yet, boy?

165
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,991
- Please, you're scaring me.
- No shit.

166
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,919
What did I do?

167
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,952
Let's just say you're shit out of luck.

168
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,955
What can I do? Give me a chance.

169
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,754
We ain't even having fun yet, son.

170
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,273
Run, run, run!

171
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,234
Swing right.

172
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,590
Come back to Papa now!

173
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,794
All right, racing fans...

174
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,115
...here...

175
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,429
...we...

176
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,159
...go!

177
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,757
This is what I want

178
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,355
Still kicking?

179
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,955
That should've done it!
Yes, that should have done it.

180
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,913
There's somebody out there.

181
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,033
I mean it this time.
I'm not making it up. Stop.

182
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,550
- Listen.
- I don't hear anything.

183
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,916
Jenny, stop. My feet hurt.

184
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,752
Am I supposed to carry you?

185
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,519
Carry me piggyback.

186
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,472
Just for a while.

187
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,956
Lose 20 pounds.

188
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,348
Oh, man. All right.
This guy's a lifesaver.

189
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,511
All we need is a ride! We'll pay!

190
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,957
Wait! We could get arrested
for trespassing!

191
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,238
Please, come on.

192
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,232
If you guys can hear me, I'm gonna
go back and see if Sean's okay.

193
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,908
All right?

194
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,194
All right?

195
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,629
No, wait!

196
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,312
Okay, who's there?

197
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,958
Is there anybody there?

198
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,995
Wait.

199
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,110
Stop.

200
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,595
What if they want us to follow them...

201
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,075
...so they can hide and stab us?

202
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,238
There could be dead people
buried all around us.

203
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,715
They could tie us in a cellar.
No one'd hear us.

204
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,157
That's dumb. There are no cellars
in the houses around here.

205
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,119
That's it. Don't call me dumb.

206
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,915
I may not be the smartest person
in the world, but I'm not stupid.

207
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,879
I act that way sometimes
to get people to like me.

208
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,388
Yeah, right.

209
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,355
All those stories about murderers,
I know it's not true.

210
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,232
It's better than being bored.

211
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,512
What's stupid is what you said
about you and Brenda.

212
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,313
No one would believe that.

213
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,915
She started this whole thing.
It's her fault.

214
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,394
You'd like to think.

215
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,955
I'll tell you what it is.
I'm a bitch.

216
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,471
I'm just like my mother.
She can't stand my father...

217
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,718
...but she stays with him because
she wants a certain kind of life.

218
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,592
No matter what anybody thinks,
that's the way to get it.

219
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,154
What's wrong with that?

220
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,435
Forget it.

221
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,072
You should've said something.

222
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,191
It pisses me off
when you let me go on.

223
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,475
It's embarrassing.

224
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,478
I told you, I'm a bitch.

225
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,869
If I were braver, I'd be like Jenny.

226
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,354
No, you wouldn't.

227
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,759
You're probably right.

228
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,155
She's a dog.

229
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,755
You just don't know.

230
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,354
Everyone thinks she's such a wuss.

231
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,956
Her mother gets married
every 15 minutes.

232
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,237
Her husbands always hit on her.
That's why she's that way.

233
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,671
But I've had P.E. With her.
She's got a body to die for.

234
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,756
Really?

235
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,029
Great.

236
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,709
Tell them we'll give them
$50 for a ride.

237
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,876
Fifty bucks?

238
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,549
Don't give it to them.
Tell them to send us a bill.

239
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,958
If they get mad, give them 5 bucks.
Tell them we'll send the rest later.

240
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,793
It's no big deal.

241
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,558
It's just business.
My father does it all the time.

242
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,833
You are weird.

243
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,716
Hey, is anybody home?

244
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,513
Must be deaf.

245
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,950
Hey, is anybody in there?

246
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,038
Maybe they're out back.

247
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,829
Go check.

248
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,349
I have an idea.

249
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,352
Why don't I go check?

250
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,516
Bitch.

251
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,195
Damn it!

252
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,754
Hold it right there.

253
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,353
It's okay. We had a wreck.
All we want is a ride.

254
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,959
You better not shoot me.

255
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,192
A man shot a kid wrapping his house.
They got him for murder.

256
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,397
"I propose to fight it out on this line
if it takes all summer."

257
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,352
That's Ulysses S. Grant.

258
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,756
You didn't know that, did you?

259
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,348
Of course you didn't.

260
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,234
Because you're a bona fide moron.

261
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,193
Come nosing around here
where you don't belong.

262
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,039
It's okay. She's my girlfriend.

263
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,516
Don't trouble yourself.

264
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,758
No! God!

265
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,397
Please! Please!

266
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,677
If I go in there, it's kidnapping.

267
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,871
I know what I'm talking about.

268
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,353
"Among other evils that being unarmed
brings you...

269
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,790
...it causes you to be despised."

270
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,877
That's Niccolò Machiavelli.

271
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,990
Now get!

272
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,953
I need to use your bathroom.

273
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,556
Dumb ass!

274
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,353
Heather, you in here?

275
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,919
Damn it, I need to piss.

276
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,519
Where's the bathroom?

277
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,193
Heather, are you okay?

278
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,389
There's a crazy guy outside
with a shotgun.

279
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,079
Locked him out, though.

280
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,713
You should've seen me.

281
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,229
Fuck!

282
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,629
What's going on?

283
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,275
Who's out there?

284
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,072
You shouldn't walk these roads
at night. Get in.

285
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,032
Did you move the cars?

286
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,470
Do you want a ride or not?
It's up to you.

287
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,239
Where are you going?

288
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,748
Where's Sean?

289
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,268
Where do you want to go?

290
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,709
Where's Sean?

291
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,348
Your boyfriend?

292
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,995
The one who wasn't hurt.
Know where he is?

293
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,350
I know where he is. Get in.

294
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,473
- Well, where is he?
- Damn it, get in the truck.

295
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,398
Wait a second. Hang on.

296
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,399
You gotta watch it, getting
into strangers' cars.

297
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,238
I heard about an old man...

298
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,556
...picked up a girl on the road...

299
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,116
...cut her arms off, put her
in a culvert. Left her for dead.

300
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,751
God, I fucking hate that.

301
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,519
That son of a bitch didn't have shit
for an imagination.

302
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,836
How simple can you get?

303
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,475
- Stop. You're scaring me.
- Scaring you?

304
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,188
You're not scared.

305
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,756
You don't know shit
about being scared yet.

306
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,673
You want "scared"?

307
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,035
You want "scared"?

308
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,590
Have a look behind you. Look!

309
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,750
How about that? Look again, damn it!

310
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,109
Look again!

311
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,277
I think I want you to let me out.

312
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,676
You think? Or do you know?

313
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,114
- Have a look! Get a better look!
- No!

314
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,958
Don't want to look?

315
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,195
What's wrong?

316
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,469
Okay.

317
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,990
If you stop, I'll look.

318
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,791
- You wanted "stop."
- Stop it!

319
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,196
Come on, have a look at that.

320
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,316
Look at that.

321
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,397
Look at that. What is that?

322
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,995
What is that?

323
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,909
Oh, God!

324
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,350
You have to put in something extra...

325
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,517
...to show it ain't the cartoons.

326
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,151
What's gonna happen to me?

327
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,557
You think I give a goddamn
what happens to you?

328
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,474
Are you letting me go?

329
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,910
Figure it out. It's your life.

330
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,872
I don't understand.

331
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,193
Welcome to the real world.

332
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,509
You don't know what you're doing.

333
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,996
Where do you think you're going?

334
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,836
Okay...

335
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,473
...if that's what you want.

336
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,672
It's up to you.

337
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,638
Live and learn.

338
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,277
No, no, God, no!

339
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,038
Somebody!

340
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,478
Open this door!

341
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,356
Open this...!

342
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,274
Oh, God!

343
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,429
It's okay.

344
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,709
He's out there!

345
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,514
Sit down.
I'm gonna go see what's what.

346
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,874
The guy with the wrecker killed Sean.

347
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,391
Hell's bells, it's party time.

348
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,113
What about your friends?

349
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,118
They tried to get a ride.

350
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,075
What the hell is going on?
Where's Vilmer?

351
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,079
Now listen...

352
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,512
...don't you worry.

353
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,759
Vilmer does something,
there's a good reason.

354
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,916
Who's Vilmer?

355
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,713
Good question.

356
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,479
You know what? You look real pretty
with your glasses off.

357
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,910
What?

358
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,760
You should've brought a gunnysack
or something.

359
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,431
What's this look like to you?
Green eggs?

360
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,439
What the hell are you waiting for?
Tie her up!

361
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,273
Sit down, little lady.

362
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,118
I got enough trouble...

363
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,188
Look what you started.

364
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,597
Wait till Vilmer hears about this,
I swear to God.

365
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,789
Where's my gun?

366
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,150
It's easier to resist at the beginning
than at the end.

367
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,310
Be sure to tell Vilmer I'm going
to the pizza place to get some dinner.

368
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,235
Why are you doing this?

369
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,957
"Conversation's a game of circles."
That's Ralph Waldo Emerson.

370
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,390
What if I turned you loose?
What would you give me?

371
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,669
What about that?

372
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,635
- What do you want?
- I'll tell you what I want.

373
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,713
W.E., what the hell
are you doing back there?

374
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,512
Tell you what.

375
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,351
Grow up, will you?

376
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,397
Tell Vilmer our pizza will be ready
when I get there...

377
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,591
...and then I'm coming home.

378
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,479
One medium deluxe, one medium
pepperoni, one large vegetarian...

379
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,432
...and I'll get your drinks.

380
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,674
Lady...

381
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,753
...I think something's in your trunk.

382
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,910
That's just somebody I got tied up.

383
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,076
Really?

384
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,993
Really, what's back there?

385
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,873
You wanna come see?

386
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,956
Sure.

387
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,910
I better not, I might get in trouble.

388
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,749
All right.

389
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,552
Will you shut up
and quit kicking my car?

390
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,712
Okay, but I can't breathe.

391
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,599
Can I get your order?

392
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,269
What do you want? Black coffee?

393
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,278
Two black coffees.

394
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,675
Is that all?

395
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,355
If I poke a hole for you,
will you quit?

396
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,229
Well, somebody's gotta do it.

397
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,074
In your dreams.

398
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,599
If I hear any more kicking
or screaming...

399
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,314
...l'm gonna tape your mouth shut.

400
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,717
What you got in the car, honey?

401
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,750
Believe me, you don't wanna know.

402
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,991
Come on, I'm a nice guy.

403
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,670
Ma'am, your drinks are ready.

404
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,514
What are you doing out here
in the road?

405
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,630
Please...

406
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,390
...help me.

407
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,949
All right...

408
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,869
...but I have to run and get a blanket.
You stay right there.

409
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,674
Please don't hit me. Don't!

410
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,198
Don't hit me!

411
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,630
Stop!

412
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,755
Okay...

413
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,715
...but don't you go crawling off.

414
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,076
- I said get on out there. Move!
- Leave him alone.

415
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,996
You do whatever W.E. Tells you.

416
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,714
He even tries to hit you,
let me know...

417
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,395
...and I'll tell Vilmer.

418
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,793
"I have not yet begun to fight."
That's John Paul Jones.

419
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,068
You can scare him, but you so much
as lay a finger on me...

420
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,390
...you'll wish you'd never been born.

421
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,995
I almost forgot...

422
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,755
...one of them got away down the road.
Better get her too.

423
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,152
Come on. Bring her in.

424
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,998
I'm not gonna hurt you.

425
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,316
I'm not gonna hurt you. See?

426
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,949
See? I'm right here.
Not gonna hurt you.

427
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,231
Go on. Get in there.

428
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,515
Move!

429
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:49,950
Get!

430
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,833
Get, I said!

431
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,068
Hi, sweetie.
How was your day?

432
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,952
Sweetie, would you shut up?

433
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,595
What are you so pissed off about?

434
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,151
You having a bad day?

435
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,271
Why aren't my batteries charged?

436
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,678
Did W.E. Tell you?

437
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,154
That son of a bitch!

438
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,318
I told him to tell you
I was getting pizza.

439
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,352
He didn't, and I'm sick of it.

440
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,672
Look what your brother did.

441
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,233
Nobody gives a damn about that door.
I've had it with you.

442
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,229
I'm sick of you trying to make
trouble between me and Vilmer.

443
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,317
You're nothing but trouble.

444
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,797
I put things together here.
It was fine before you come.

445
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:41,910
Shut up.

446
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,910
Oh, my God.

447
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,789
What are you gonna...?

448
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,718
You don't believe this, do you?

449
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,831
What are you gonna do to me?

450
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,678
I asked you a goddamn question.

451
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,239
He asked you a goddamn...

452
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,678
Yes, I believe...

453
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,469
You don't think the FBI
has us under 24-hour surveillance?

454
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,796
And transmitters in all these walls?

455
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,308
I don't know.

456
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,113
Let me ask you a question.

457
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,720
- Are you having fun yet?
- Oh, God!

458
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,752
Because I promise you...

459
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,071
...you and I are gonna have some fun.

460
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,759
No more, please.

461
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,838
What's my fucking name?

462
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,955
- What's this?
- I don't know.

463
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,435
- What is this?
- I don't know.

464
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,551
You don't know shit, do you?

465
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,633
Do you think all I wanna do
is kill you?

466
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,114
I don't know.

467
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,550
You're goddamn right, you don't.

468
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,313
Why don't you try to relax?
I know it's hard...

469
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,556
Why don't you mind your business?

470
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,714
Look at this fucking door.

471
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,589
What?

472
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,835
"The woman's a whore
and there's an end on it."

473
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,997
That's Samuel Johnson.

474
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,195
Oh, take it on out of here.

475
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,389
Now, now...

476
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,950
...don't let him get to you,
because that's what he wants.

477
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,839
Please tell me...

478
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,191
...what all this is for.

479
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,755
You'll have to ask Vilmer that.

480
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,477
If you ask me, I think the son of a
bitch is from outer space.

481
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,714
What are you gonna do?

482
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,796
No...

483
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,037
...what are you gonna do?

484
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,635
Don't hurt her.

485
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,037
- Give her a kiss.
- How could I hurt this pretty face?

486
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,710
But then...

487
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,156
...I am in the mood for love.

488
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,588
There now...

489
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,510
How's that? Feel better?

490
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,193
Look at you!

491
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,072
You're really pretty.

492
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,474
You know what?

493
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,513
I've got this dress
I've never even worn...

494
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,109
...and it would be perfect on you.

495
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,316
Oh, you're scared.

496
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,157
I just don't wanna die.

497
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,000
Well, of course you don't!

498
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,273
Will you help me?

499
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,437
Shut up in there.

500
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,155
You hush up yourself.
It's just girl talk.

501
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,269
He's not near as bad as he seems
once you get to know him.

502
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,757
It's just this job, you know,
all the stress.

503
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,315
It's his job to kill people?

504
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,596
Well...

505
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,632
...I shouldn't tell you this.

506
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,230
You know those stories you hear
of people who run everything...

507
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,476
...but nobody knows who they are?

508
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,549
Well, it's true. I didn't believe it,
but it's true.

509
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,438
Who do you think killed Kennedy?

510
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,596
Government?

511
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,595
That government stuff is bull crap.

512
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,029
It's these people.

513
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,677
They been doing this kind of thing for
1000 or 2000 years, I forget which.

514
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,957
And nobody, I mean nobody,
knows their names.

515
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,515
That's who Vilmer works for.

516
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,757
I told you... No!

517
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,519
Alone again, huh?

518
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,318
Little desert flower.

519
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,312
I've got a mind...

520
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,836
...to slit your goddamn throat.

521
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,318
Count of 10 to tell why I shouldn't.

522
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,555
Nine, eight...

523
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,751
...don't be late.

524
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,152
Seven, six,
better get it right.

525
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,078
Why you shouldn't kill me?

526
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,596
Five, four...

527
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,472
- Three, two!
- Because you want me alive!

528
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,035
You want me alive for some reason.

529
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,159
That's a good answer.

530
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,793
That's a good answer.

531
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,116
Smart girl.

532
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,915
We've got us a smart girl.

533
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,949
Kind of makes you think, doesn't it?

534
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,838
You're embarrassing me
in front of company!

535
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,313
Okay, stop!

536
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,432
Don't move or I'll shoot!

537
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,193
What'd she say?

538
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,470
"Nobody move or I'll shoot"?

539
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,516
My advice? Gut-shoot him.

540
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,394
Poison his insides,
or it won't do no good.

541
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,070
He's been shot before,
lots of times. Run over.

542
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,476
- It don't mean spit.
- Shut up, W.E.

543
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,990
- Nobody asked you.
- You shut up.

544
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,675
Everybody, shut up!

545
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,194
Why don't you shut up?

546
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,438
Get down on the floor.

547
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,597
Put your hands in front of you!

548
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,196
Get down!

549
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,430
Okay.

550
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,475
You get down too.

551
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,519
What are you gonna do...

552
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,956
...shoot me?

553
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,116
Yeah...

554
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,038
...if you try something.

555
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,469
What if I do this?

556
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,149
Goddamn it, that ain't funny!

557
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,472
Now we're going. What do you think?

558
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,189
One, two.

559
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,832
Take your fucking chances.

560
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,269
It's a damn trick.

561
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,152
Shut up, W.E.

562
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,953
Why don't you shut up?

563
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,435
Just forget it, hon.

564
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,837
If that shotgun was anywhere
you could get it...

565
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,509
...it's where he wanted it.

566
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,359
You stop. You get back down.

567
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,229
"Discretion is the better part
of valour."

568
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,635
Billy Shakespeare.

569
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,911
Get down, or I'll kill you.

570
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,795
Come on.

571
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,229
I'm sorry, sweetie.

572
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,440
I got a big mouth, what can I say?

573
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,199
Okay, maybe it's not loaded.
But maybe it is, so fuck you.

574
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,712
And if you try and come near,
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off!

575
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,238
- Come on.
- Let's not make this an all-nighter.

576
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,229
I hate to be a party pooper, but it's
late and the pizza's getting cold.

577
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,590
And nobody asked you!

578
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,035
Heather, get up.

579
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,390
Get up!

580
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,028
You have to!

581
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,079
Five more minutes.

582
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,190
Get up!

583
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,993
You're gonna kill her!

584
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,351
Come on, get up, get up.

585
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,832
I can't find my shoes.

586
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,318
It's okay. Get up.

587
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,313
No, you gotta get up.
We have to get out of here.

588
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,276
Stop it!

589
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,238
Pop goes the weasel.

590
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,909
Oh, my God!

591
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,076
What are you doing there?!

592
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,397
No, no, God!

593
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,230
What are you doing?!

594
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,350
Oh, God!

595
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,439
Damn shame about her face, Leather.

596
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,796
At least you can have her shoes.

597
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,960
We'll have to see that doesn't
happen again.

598
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,916
That'll settle her down for a while.

599
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,552
You better be nice to me.

600
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,833
'Cause I can always
go back to my husband.

601
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,117
Is that all you got?

602
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,313
You better come and eat...

603
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,558
...before it gets cold.

604
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,790
All right, all right, all right!

605
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,116
What took you so long?

606
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,396
Welcome...

607
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,594
...to my world!

608
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,796
I suppose we can forget about having
a quiet evening?

609
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,797
Go ahead and breathe into this bag.
Go ahead.

610
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,352
I told him a thousand times,
it's gonna end in tears.

611
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,349
Lie down with dogs, get up with fleas.
Any fool knows that.

612
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,434
"Common sense is not so common."

613
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,039
Henry Voltaire.

614
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,872
Are you gonna help me or not?

615
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,676
- Are you gonna help me or not?
- And don't tell me any more stories.

616
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,916
You just don't understand.

617
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,191
He doesn't work for anybody.

618
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,712
The only reason for this...

619
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,275
...is, he's a psycho
and gets off on it.

620
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:07,916
Get off.

621
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,676
Now listen.

622
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,915
I just can't.

623
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,350
He put this little thing in my head.

624
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,791
All he has to do is push one
little button and...

625
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,036
...blow my head clean off.

626
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,355
There's nothing in your head.

627
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,119
You just said a mouthful.

628
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,110
Get to running with the wrong crowd,
wind up in a reformatory.

629
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,552
No respect, no discipline.
That's the problem.

630
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,035
Family values have gone to hell.

631
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,715
Now for why we came!

632
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,953
My brother is tired of
what's-her-name's face...

633
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,992
...and he wants a new one.

634
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,909
It just happens to be
he wants this face right here.

635
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,155
Oh, no!

636
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,759
Don't touch me!

637
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,997
Don't you ever touch me!

638
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,353
If you're gonna kill me,
then do it!

639
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,636
I'm not putting up with any more crap!

640
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,069
It's bullshit.

641
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,557
Nobody believes it
except your idiot girlfriend!

642
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,159
It's fucking pathetic!

643
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,195
"There is nothing to fear
but fear itself."

644
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,509
Now, I'm gonna leave...

645
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,468
...and no one is gonna stop me.

646
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,631
You sit the fuck down!

647
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,754
And shut up!

648
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,800
Are we having a party or what?

649
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,309
Here we go!

650
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,234
Douse her down!

651
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,751
You can't do that!
She has nothing to do with this!

652
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,276
- That doesn't matter!
- I'm sorry! Please!

653
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,549
Fire in the hole!

654
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,955
Burn!

655
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,309
Watch her burn!

656
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,834
Go to hell!

657
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,550
Burn!

658
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,711
Why'd you do that? I can never
get that smell out of my clothes.

659
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:10,956
Well...

660
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,196
...what the hell do you want?

661
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,392
I assume that that is
a rhetorical question.

662
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,990
Assume whatever you please.
It ain't no skin off my ass.

663
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,912
Is that what you want me to think?

664
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,117
That you're a silly boy?

665
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,475
Oh, God, you have to help me.

666
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,955
They're crazy. Please, let's go.

667
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,071
- Let's go, please.
- It's all right.

668
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,558
That's better. Come on, now.

669
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,677
Come on. It's all right.

670
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,477
Just sit down. There you go.

671
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:19,910
There.

672
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,553
That's all right.

673
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,994
That's fine. You just stay there.
It'll be fine, okay?

674
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,316
Come on, now.

675
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,636
It's all right. All right.

676
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,991
Come on, there. There. See?

677
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,639
What is this?

678
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,715
No?

679
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,517
Can anybody else tell me?

680
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,279
Things are gonna change.

681
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,958
I can promise you that.

682
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,354
- Just sit there.
- No.

683
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,437
You just sit there.

684
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:14,949
You...

685
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,873
...fuck!

686
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,832
This... is... appalling.

687
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,555
You are here for one reason...

688
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,758
...and one reason only.

689
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,156
Do you understand that?

690
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,597
I want to hear you say
you understand that.

691
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,195
No?

692
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,718
It's very simple.

693
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,038
I want these people...

694
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,357
...to know the meaning of horror.

695
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,190
Horror.

696
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,439
Is that clear?

697
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,954
You don't want to be a silly boy.

698
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,232
Is... that... clear?

699
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,751
Is... that... clear?

700
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,391
Fucking-A, it is.

701
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,036
What...?

702
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,469
What are you...?

703
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,233
What are you doing?

704
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,872
Why a woman like you
has anything to do with this...

705
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,315
...cripple...

706
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,832
...is a mystery to me.

707
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,237
You bastard.
You know exactly why I'm here.

708
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,192
What are you gonna do?

709
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,676
Oh, God, what are you doing?

710
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,070
What?

711
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,512
No! Don't! It's not your fault!
Stop that.

712
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,236
Get her, Leather! Get her, Leather!
We got some more fun today!

713
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,192
Get that bitch!

714
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,831
Thank you, Mrs. Spottis.

715
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,037
It's a beautiful morning.

716
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,268
- Stop!
- Don't stop, don't stop!

717
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,274
Stop! Please, stop! Oh, God!

718
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,919
Oh, God! Help!

719
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,518
There's a monster chasing her
with a chain saw!

720
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,554
Step on it, Mr. Spottis!

721
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,274
You have nothing to fear.

722
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,390
This...

723
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,274
...all of this...

724
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,077
...it's been an abomination.

725
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,357
Please accept my apologies.

726
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,551
It was supposed to be a spiritual
experience.

727
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,472
I can't tell you how...

728
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,432
...disappointed I am.

729
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,038
I suppose it's something
we all live with...

730
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:34,599
...people like us
who strive for something...

731
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,838
...a sense of harmony.

732
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,474
Perhaps it's disappointment
that keeps us going.

733
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,358
Unfortunately...

734
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,076
...it's never been easy for me.

735
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,757
One of my many failings.

736
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,550
Fuck you.

737
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,079
Do you want to go
to the local hospital...

738
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,231
...or to a police station?

739
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,918
This isn't the first time
something like this has happened.

740
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,749
Miss?

741
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,268
Miss?

742
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,352
We'll find out what this is all about.
This isn't the end of it.

743
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,510
Miss?

744
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,716
Do you know who that is, miss?

745
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,874
What the hell's going on around here?
