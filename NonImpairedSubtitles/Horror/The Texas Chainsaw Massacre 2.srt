[shrieking]

645
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,695
[groaning loudly]

646
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,866
[whimpering]

647
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:15,791
[spits]

648
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,627
[rasping] My darling.

649
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,046
[Stretch sobbing]

650
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:25,550
Darling?

651
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,678
Don't be scared, darling.

652
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:32,265
[groaning]

653
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:35,143
[screams]

654
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,479
[Stretch] Oh no, L.G.

655
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,612
Oh no. Oh no.

656
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,281
L.G.!

657
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,492
Oh, my God!

658
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:56,331
[sobbing] L.G., they got you, too?

659
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,083
Oh, L.G.!

660
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:02,128
[spits]

661
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,589
We gotta get y'all loose.

662
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,560
[groaning]

663
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,215
I guess I'm falling apart on you, honey.

664
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,717
[Stretch sobbing]

665
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,599
[L.G.] No.

666
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,477
[moaning] No.

667
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,983
[exhales]

668
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,818
Shit.

669
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,875
[shuddering]

670
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,687
[sobbing]

671
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:58,203
L.G.

672
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,165
I love you.

673
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,049
[loud rumbling]

674
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,686
[Drayton] So he says,

675
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:27,107
"Hey, get me those lawyers.
Legal meat."

676
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,693
- [man] Legal meat, yeah!
- [Drayton] Bubba, you idiot!

677
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,486
Get your ass over here.

678
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,905
- You fucked up again.
- [man] You fucked up again.

679
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:36,449
[Drayton] He says,
"Hey, get me those lawyers.

680
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,368
Legal meat, y'all."

681
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:41,955
Fuck me in the left eye! [laughs]

682
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:46,167
Valuable kill-time wasted running down
them coked-up pencil necks,

683
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,753
and not a good chop on the whole bunch.

684
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,880
I pick the vittles. Get it?

685
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,883
- I. Me. Nobody but...
- [man] I pick the vittles, I.

686
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,720
- [Drayton] Bubba, you hull wreckage!
- [man] Me. Nobody but...

687
01:06:56,887 --> 01:07:01,141
[Drayton] Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.

688
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:03,768
[cracking, rumbling]

689
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:07,480
Fuck, you idiots! You both will pay!

690
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,607
Both of you... You're both...

691
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,111
Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.

692
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,574
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.

693
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,951
Of course this is what happens.

694
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,954
- [laughing]
- That big brute!

695
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,956
Dirty meat don't cut it.

696
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,710
Family standards only require
the best meat in town.

697
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,462
More money lost.

698
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:33,465
I never, never, never get a break.

699
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,967
Work, work night and day,

700
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,512
presenting myself to the people,
selling, selling.

701
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,392
You pair of prima donnas fooling around
here and listening to the radio all day

702
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,687
and sawing down your own house.

703
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:57,072
Take it all down!

704
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,491
Bring it all down!

705
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,993
Bury the devil!

706
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:11,086
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!
Ah!

707
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,840
Get that thing out of here.

708
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,511
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.

709
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,680
It's up there. Go look at it.

710
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:25,391
Taxes. Taxes.

711
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:28,353
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.

712
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:32,190
Crooks don't pay taxes.
Politicians don't.

713
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,359
Movie stars don't.

714
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:39,781
It's the little guy that can't make
a dime. He pays the taxes.

715
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,534
Small businessman
gets it in the ass every time.

716
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,577
I ought to quit.

717
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:48,540
Right, it's junk. Quit.
Dump this cook show.

718
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:52,877
Sell off this turkey.
It's time. It's in the air.

719
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,838
It's what the public wants.

720
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:56,840
I don't wanna hear that again.

721
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,300
It's 'Nam Land!

722
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,346
- [fizzling]
- [yelps]

723
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,683
Yow! What the hell was that?

724
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:10,562
[high-pitched] I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.

725
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,775
[cackling]

726
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,947
'Nam Land.

727
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,783
Napalm.

728
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,911
Fire in the hole.

729
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,420
That's the main butane tank
up there, Bubba.

730
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:39,048
Go look at it.
Get your butt moving, boy.

731
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:42,760
Go up there and look at it.
Go look at it.

732
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:46,347
- I'll kick you in the ass again.
- Not now. It's 'Nam Land.

733
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,851
- It's a hit. It's a bang. It's a smash.
- Shut him up, Bubba.

734
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,781
Did you see it?

735
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,825
Well, did you? Didn't you?

736
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,286
Did you? Didn't you?

737
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,997
Go check it out, boy.

738
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:15,001
- 'Nam Land!
- Oh, shut up!

739
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,879
I told you to go check it out, boy,
before I start kicking your ass.

740
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:22,050
Some kind of crazy booger
just skipped through here.

741
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,220
No, a booger? How big?

742
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:29,849
[high-pitched] A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.

743
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,250
[whispers] Oh, my God.

744
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,174
Oh, God.

745
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,896
Franklin.

746
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:38,042
Don't you cry, my brother.

747
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:45,883
I'm here now.

748
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,970
They can't do this.

749
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,597
They can't do this!

750
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:55,852
They can't do this! They can't do this!

751
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:07,947
I'll take you back to hell!

752
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,616
I'll take you to hell!

753
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,768
[whimpering]

754
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,697
- [saw buzzing]
- [screams]

755
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:55,953
[screams]

756
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:59,624
[panting]

757
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,412
[screaming]

758
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:42,583
[shouting]

759
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:32,717
All right, all right!

760
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,762
Let's talk about it.

761
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,307
OK. What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?

762
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:43,019
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
[sobbing]

763
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:49,108
I'm trying to be open with you. It's
nobody's fault. I just can't do this.

764
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,252
Let me go.

765
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,789
What the hell's going on here?

766
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,711
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.

767
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,588
Get out of here.

768
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,969
Who's this? I get it.

769
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:21,349
Are you the saboteur
that's fucking up our house?

770
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,351
Trying to put me out of business?

771
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,770
Thousands of dollars lost.

772
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,773
You got that kind of money? No!

773
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:33,402
It's the deejay. My fave.

774
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,613
That dirty thing?

775
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,573
Told me you boys got her.

776
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,742
[man] Well, yeah.

777
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,578
Leatherface killed her
once already tonight.

778
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:46,165
But look, she's red-faced.

779
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:50,127
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.

780
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,964
Bubba's got a girlfriend.

781
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:59,845
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!

782
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:03,307
Bubba's got a girl... [screams, laughs]

783
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,601
Is that what this is, Bubba?

784
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,604
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?

785
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:12,233
S-C-E-X. Sex.

786
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,236
And you had to find out about it,
didn't you?

787
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,363
You just couldn't leave it alone.

788
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:20,241
If you wanted to know about it so bad,
why didn't you ask me?

789
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,202
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?

790
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,663
Ask me. Ask me.

791
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:29,834
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.

792
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,670
[sobbing] Help me. Help me.

793
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,338
Help me.

794
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,340
Please, help me. Please.

795
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:37,675
[imitating] Help me.

796
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,969
[sobbing] Please, help me.

797
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:46,517
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.

798
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,269
Leave him alone, damn it!

799
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:54,692
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.

800
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,739
- Burn her like a rat.
- Finish her.

801
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,532
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now.

802
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:05,244
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!

803
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:07,997
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now!

804
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,707
- Finish her now, Bubba!
- Burn her like a rat!

805
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,876
- Finish her!
- Finish her. Finish her.

806
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,714
Give me that.

807
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:20,676
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.

808
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:25,556
You got one choice, boy,
sex or the saw.

809
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,809
Sex is, well, nobody knows.

810
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:32,938
But the saw, the saw is family.

811
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:37,068
- The saw is family.
- Wait till Granddad hears about this.

812
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,073
Take her away.

813
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:47,244
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.

814
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,123
- Oh, no.
- A-one...

815
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,876
and a-two...

816
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,962
and a-three!

817
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,768
[screaming] No!

818
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:18,442
[Drayton] Dinnertime, damn it! Let's go.

819
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,945
Eat and run. Eat and run.

820
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:24,490
There's a lot of hungry
football fans to feed.

821
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:28,077
Hurry it up. Grandpa likes to go fast.

822
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:31,539
He always did. Come on. Come on.

823
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,458
Time eats money.

824
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:39,130
Those damn coon shits
are the weight of the family.

825
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:44,135
I stoop my shoulders
taking care of my younger brothers.

826
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:48,222
It squashed the young years
out of my life

827
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,142
like a can of cheese whip.

828
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:55,396
I wouldn't wish this rotten life

829
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:59,900
off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.

830
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:04,196
You're the first girl
Bubba's brought home to dinner.

831
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,741
This is a real special occasion.

832
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:10,119
Grandpa sure looks forward
to meeting you.

833
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:14,331
He's 137 years old
but still as fast as Jesse James,

834
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:16,500
so don't you worry none.

835
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:18,428
- Here comes Grandpa now.
- [Stretch screams]

836
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,921
God bless you, Grandpa.

837
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:24,633
It's playtime!
It's dinnertime!

838
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:27,470
Your little boys
have some left here for you.

839
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,889
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!

840
01:19:30,056 --> 01:19:33,100
[Drayton, man] We love you!
We love you!

841
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:38,606
OK, now. Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.

842
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,941
- That's right. That's right.
- Get him over here easy, now.

843
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,109
- That's right. OK.
- Come on, you boys.

844
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:45,279
- [Stretch screaming]
- Easy with Grandpa, now.

845
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,364
- Easy with Grandpa.
- No! No!

846
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,533
[Stretch] Oh, please, no.

847
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:53,204
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!

848
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:55,539
You're balling up his shit.

849
01:19:58,418 --> 01:19:59,376
[screaming] No!

850
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:03,964
Grandpa's strict liquid diet
keeps him as fresh as a rose.

851
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,299
Every spring,

852
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:10,763
the Atlas Rendering Company used to
throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.

853
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,890
He was the master.

854
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,892
He was the one and only.

855
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,062
He showed us all the business.

856
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:21,607
We was raised in meat. [laughs]

857
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:25,903
But then after the glory,
here comes the shame.

858
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,364
Atlas went for automation.

859
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,991
The electrified cages,

860
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,785
the cold-steel chutes,

861
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:35,079
the air-powered head hammers.

862
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:38,999
That drove Grandpa crazy,
seeing things done like that.

863
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,544
Let me go! Let me go!

864
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:46,006
No, no, that's all right. That's all
right. It'll be over soon.

865
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:52,263
Get the hammer.

866
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:55,307
The crunching and the grinding,

867
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,935
he just couldn't stand it, no way.

868
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,437
So that was all she wrote.

869
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:04,441
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.

870
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:06,277
It was the shame.

871
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:09,864
It was the shame. The shame.

872
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,993
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.

873
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,537
Right. Let's get on with it. Bingo!

874
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:20,249
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.

875
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:23,711
Do I have to do every damn thing
around here?

876
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,505
- You just sit tight.
- [screaming]

877
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:30,634
Bubba, she's ready. Bring her on down.

878
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,679
[screaming] No!

879
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:38,893
- Oh, no!
- Bring her on down, damn it!

880
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,562
[Stretch] No! No!

881
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,189
Bring her on down!

882
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:47,818
No! No, no, no!

883
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,987
No, no, no!

884
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:55,659
Help me! No, no, no!

885
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:59,496
Let me go! You gotta let me go!
Let me go! Please, help me!

886
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:02,082
- This will be one you won't forget.
- Please, help me!

887
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,168
It's a real honor.

888
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,879
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.

889
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:10,591
And it's just like going home.

890
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,510
Please help me!

891
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:16,972
- No! No! No, God!
- [man imitating] No, no.

892
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:20,976
Help me! Let me go!

893
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:23,479
Let me go! Let me go!

894
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,606
Help me, please!

895
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,025
Please, help me!

896
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,527
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.

897
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:32,363
No, don't!

898
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,872
- No! No, God!
- Come on. Bring the bitch down.

899
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,040
- [screaming]
- [groaning]

900
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,625
No! No!

901
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,794
No, no, let me go!

902
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,046
Let me go!

903
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,590
Let me go! No! No!

904
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:53,968
No, no, no!

905
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:56,470
No!

906
01:22:56,638 --> 01:23:00,474
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.

907
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:01,600
No!

908
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:04,645
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.

909
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:09,024
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.

910
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:14,613
- Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...
- No! No! God!

911
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:17,074
Please don't hoodoo the boy.

912
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:20,160
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.

913
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,788
Look what Bubba brought you.

914
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:26,375
Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got
something to show you here.

915
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:29,586
Look, a Slurpee booty. [laughs]

916
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:31,505
- Hit her, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa.

917
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,049
Let's see you do it. Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa. You're the best.

918
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:36,458
- Hit her, Grandpa. Hit her!
- Come on. Hit her, Grandpa.

919
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,095
Come on, I'm telling you...

920
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,973
Remember those thieves?
Come on. One-hitter.

921
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,058
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Hit her. Hit her, Grandpa.

922
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:45,436
Come on, you won't miss her.

923
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:49,565
- [Grandpa groaning]
- [screaming]

924
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,695
Come on, Grandpa.

925
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,698
Hit her. Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch.

926
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,409
Come on, Grandpa.

927
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,250
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.

928
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:10,753
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.

929
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,964
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.

930
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,633
- Hit that bitch, Grandpa. Hit her.
- [screaming]

931
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:23,849
Come on, Grandpa. Hit her.
You are, Grandpa. You're the best.

932
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:28,062
- [moaning]
- Yeah! That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?

933
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:31,899
[screaming]

934
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,317
Grandpa!

935
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,029
- Attaboy, Grandpa.
- Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.

936
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:40,449
- Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
- Get her now, Grandpa. You can do it.

937
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:42,076
Come on, Grandpa.

938
01:24:44,537 --> 01:24:46,663
[Stretch] No! No! No!

939
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:50,626
No! No! No! No!

940
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:54,004
No! No!

941
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:57,216
Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch!

942
01:24:57,383 --> 01:25:05,349
Come on, Grandpa!

943
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:10,145
Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.

944
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:13,357
All right! Slurpee-booty time!

945
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:18,821
[saw buzzing]

946
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:29,706
[Lefty singing in distance]

947
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:36,797
[man imitates singing]

948
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,175
Shut up!

949
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:42,886
What the hell's going on here?

950
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:47,558
[Lefty continues singing]

951
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:18,255
Boys, boys, boys.

952
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,258
What the hell's going on here?

953
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:26,263
Is that the American way of entering
a man's home, singing like that?

954
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:31,226
I get it.
The old pressure game, huh?

955
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:36,690
Boys, you never
should have been doing this.

956
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,777
Who sent you?
Those sissies over at Del-Mar Catering?

957
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:45,282
That chickenshit Burrito-Man bunch?
[laughs]

958
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:49,119
Well, I don't care, you hear?
Yeah, that's right.

959
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:50,954
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

960
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:55,292
And from where I sit,
there just ain't enough damn dogs.

Time to shut down the show, yeah.
