You find out who did this
and you bring them to me!

Do you understand?

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,305
You were out on your own
when Daryl found you.

5
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:09,456
- That's right.
- I just want to make sure

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,060
you know how to play on a team.

7
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:12,386
That veterinary college...

9
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:14,932
I'm glad you're here.

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,543
- Where else would I be?
- Running off.

11
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,292
Daryl's got a group going out.

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,457
I gotta go.

13
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,331
Make a run for the gaps right there.

14
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:27,178
Carol, did you kill
Karen and David?

15
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:29,106
Yes.

- Ma'am?
- Hi, Lizzy.

18
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:19,817
They told me to come down here.

19
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:21,652
Are you okay?

20
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:24,855
Good.

21
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:30,077
I wanted to see you because
I'm going on a run with Rick.

Lizzy:
Do you think Daryl's dead?

24
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,251
Carol:
<i>No.</i>

25
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:39,069
<i>He had to go far away</i>
<i>to get the medicines,</i>

26

Lizzy:

31
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:00,358
Yet?

32
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,259
I think a lot of people
are going to die.

33
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,928
It's what always happens.

34
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,398
Makes me sad, but...

35
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:08,983
at least they get to come back.

36
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:12,453
Lizzy, when they come back,
they aren't--

37
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:14,322
people aren't who they were.

38
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:17,074
Yeah, but they're something.

39
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:18,242
They're someone.

40
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:22,946

42

Lizzy:
<i>We all change.</i>

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,075
We all don't get to stay
the same way we started.

48
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:52,943
Lizzy, it's more
complicated--

49
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,813
You said I was weak.
I'm not.

50
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:58,649
I'm strong, so I'm telling
you what I think.

51
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,795
You remember what I told you
to do when there's danger?

52
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:12,596
Run as fast as I can.

53
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:15,165
You run and run
until you're safe.

54

<i>And if it's your life</i>
<i>or your sister's life,</i>

Yes.

Put your T-shirt

64
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:51,252
You've gotta be able
to get to it quickly.

65
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:52,753
Yes, Mom.
I mean ma'am.

66
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,805
Don't call me "Mom."

67
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:58,092
It was an accident.

68
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,044
Just don't.

69
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:04,315
Okay.

70
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:09,019
Carol:

How?

75
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:21,916
You fight it.

76
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:25,703
And fight it.

77
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:27,505
You don't give up.

78
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:31,759
And then one day,

79
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,245
you just change.

80
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,818

Maggie wanted
to come, you know.

97

Someone had to stay back,

Someone you trust, you mean.

99

They would have drowned
in their own blood.

They were suffering.
I made it quick.

We needed the bodies gone.

102
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,967
We needed to stop it
from spreading.

103
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:20,437
They were the only ones
who were sick.

104
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:21,604
They were a threat.

105

I was trying to save lives.

106
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:28,394

Somebody had to.

00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:03,046
The roof's broken now and it's been
getting rain, so it's full of fruit.

166
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,497
We were there about a day

167
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,715
and the skin-eaters
showed up.

168
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:07,500
( laughs )
Killjoys, man.

169
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:09,619
Jackin' it up
for the whole world.

170
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,555
I thought everybody was an asshole
before this all went down.

171
00:14:12,556 --> 00:14:14,591
Now I love people.

172
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:17,460
You know-- people
who are alive.

173
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:18,795
How did it happen?

174
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:20,563
When they were coming in
<i>through the door,</i>

175
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:22,899
<i>I tripped crawling out</i>
<i>the other side.</i>

176
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,735
<i>Pulled the glass out,</i>
<i>but my shoulder--</i>

177
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:27,437
it still hurts like a bitch.

178
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:30,139
It's dislocated.

179
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,909
Can you fix it?

180
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,694
Here, lay on your back.

181
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,203
<i>Okay, scooch over to the edge.</i>

182
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:46,322
<i>Just hold your arm...</i>

183
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:48,591
Grab ahold of this bag.

184
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:50,994
- Hold on.
- ( groaning )

185
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:53,630
- And keep holding on.
- ( crying ) No, that hurts.

186
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,931
Keep holding.

187
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:56,549
I can't, I can't.

188
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,184
Keep holding.

189
00:14:58,185 --> 00:14:59,853
- ( bone crackles )
- ( groaning )

190
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:03,523
( man gasping )

191
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:07,360
- ( bone pops )
- ( panting )

192
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:10,864
Sit up.

193
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:15,017
Woman:
<i>Is it...</i>

194
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:18,705
Yeah.

195
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:21,858
It's gonna be sore
for a few days.

196
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:24,210
Rick: After the greenhouse,
you came here?

197
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,463
Yeah. We thought
it was clear.

198
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:28,548
We missed the deadie
in the PJs,

199
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,083
so we dove into the bathroom.

200
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,335
So how long were you up
there till we showed up?

201
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:34,037
Like, two days.

202
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:36,339
There was just one.
You had guns.

203
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,174
We have about 12 bullets.

204
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:39,876
It usually take us
about five or six

205
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:41,511
to bring one of them down.

206
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:43,012
But you have knives.

207
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,814
To what, stab it in the head?

208
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:46,349
Yeah.

209
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,818
We got separated from
our crew about a week ago.

210
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:51,554
Been trying to play it safe
since it's just the two of us.

211
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:53,690
- I have to with my leg.
- Yeah.

212
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:57,026
We were at a refugee center
together and there was a fire.

213
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:58,945
People were just
trampling over me.

214
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:00,447
Assholes.

215
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:02,415
Sam saved my life.

216
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,666
We didn't know
each other before.

217
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:06,586
It didn't heal right,
but it healed.

218
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:08,505
And we found each other.

219
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,957
It was worth it.

220
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,742
Where are you two headed next?

221
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:14,094
We just keep moving.

222
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:17,430
We haven't been waiting
for places to go bad.

223
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,716
I mean, it's getting
a little old.

224
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:22,268
You guys look all right.
What's your setup like?

225
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:24,437
The "skin-eaters"?

226
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:26,639
We call them walkers.

227
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:33,095
How many have you killed?

228
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:34,898
( door creaks )

229
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,960
Come on.

230
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:56,386
Here we go.

231
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:13,469
Hmm, cells look pretty dry.

232
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,471
A little distilled water
will clear that right up.

233
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:24,614
You should have let him go.

234
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,700
The hell you know
about it, huh?

235
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,919
- You the damn expert?
- No.

236
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,422
I just don't want
to see you die.

237
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:34,490
Is that what
you're trying to do?

238
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:38,327
Do you even know
what you're trying to do?

239
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,048
I know you're pissed.

240
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,267
And you have
every reason to be.

241
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:48,188
But anger makes you stupid.

242
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:52,341
Stupid gets you killed.

243
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:55,728
Aren't you still angry
about the Governor?

244
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:57,447
What he did?

245
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:59,732
If he was here right now,

246
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,702
I'd cut him in two.

247
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,904
'Cause that's
how it needs to be.

248
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,858
But I'm not angry.

249
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:13,496
I <i>was.</i>

250
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:16,032
Then why are you still
going out looking for him?

251
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:27,060
I don't know.

252
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,682
( grunting )

253
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:40,890
Daryl:
<i>That's puke.</i>

254
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:45,245
Those douchebags in the vines

255
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,447
took themselves out,

256
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:48,948
holding hands--

257
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:51,668
kumbaya style.

258
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,753
They wanted to go out
together same as they lived.

259
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:55,338
That make them douchebags?

260
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:58,407
It does if they
could have gotten out.

261
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:02,745
Everybody makes it,
till they don't.

262
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:05,014
People nowadays are dominoes.

263
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:08,101
What they did, maybe it's about
not having to watch them fall.

264
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:10,887
Right.

265
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:15,858
<i>( raspy breathing )</i>

266
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,193
Come on.

267
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:53,346
( grunts )

268
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,106
We got about all
we're gonna get here.

269
00:20:03,107 --> 00:20:04,807
We should move on.

270
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:07,026
So, did we pass your test?

271
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:16,119
We're in a prison
eight miles north.

272
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,756
If you come back with us, we
can't guarantee your safety.

273
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:22,208
There's an illness, a flu.

274
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:24,293
It's bad.

275
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:25,828
We've lost a lot.

276
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,680
- <i>Kids, too.</i>
<i>- Yours?</i>

277
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,466
No, thank God.

278
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:33,770
But one of my girls,
she's got it.

279
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:36,889
- I'm sorry.
- She's strong. She'll make it.

280
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,176
Sam:
You got fences and walls?

281
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:42,845
- We're in.
- Yeah, whatever you need us to do.

282
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:45,114
For now, sit tight.

283
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,650
The two of us will circle
back for you before dark.

284
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:50,019
Or you could help us sweep the
rest of this neighborhood.

285
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,038
Woman: We can do that. I
can check the greenhouse,

286
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,539
see if it's clear,
bring back more fruit.

287
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,041
And I can hit
some of the houses.

288
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,692
Well, it's nice
of you to offer,

289
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:58,578
but your shoulder's
barely--

290
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:01,164
Sam: <i>As long as I don't put too
much weight on this arm, I'm good.</i>

291
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:03,583
<i>- And I can still move pretty fast.</i>
<i>- I just don't think--</i>

292
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:05,868
We won't take any chances.

293
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:08,721
We'll look. And if it's
cake, we'll do it.

294
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:11,808
If not, we'll just roll.

295
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,727
I mean, you don't look
so good yourself, man.

296
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:16,229
Are you a righty or a lefty?

297
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:19,215
We'll cover more ground.

298
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:21,567
The sooner we get back...

299
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:23,069
Sam:
You can't carry us, man.

300
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,056
- It doesn't work that way.
- Please, we want to help.

301
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:39,752
You fire a shot,
we'll come running.

302
00:21:39,753 --> 00:21:42,404
Let's meet back here
in two hours.

303
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,346
You'll need this.

304
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:57,687
You never told us about the
group you were with before.

305
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:01,124
Which one?

306
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,981
You know, when you found
me out on that road,

307
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:10,933
I almost kept walking.

308
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:13,536
Why is that?

309
00:22:13,537 --> 00:22:15,571
<i>'Cause I was done</i>
<i>being a witness.</i>

310
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:19,075
Two times,
two different groups.

311
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:22,311
I was the last one standing.

312
00:22:23,947 --> 00:22:26,799
<i>Like I was supposed to see
it happen over and over,</i>

313
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,801
<i>like it's some kind of curse.</i>

314
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:37,143
But, when it's just you
out there with the quiet...

315
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:41,297
Used to be I'd drink
a bottle of anything

316
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:43,182
just so I could
shut my eyes at night.

317
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:47,303
<i>Figured the prison, the people,
thought it'd be easier.</i>

318
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:51,691
The run to the big spot,
I did it for me.

319
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,475
You gotta keep busy.

320
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:56,412
No. I did it so I could
get me a bottle.

321
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:59,649
<i>Of anything.</i>

322
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,518
I picked it up,
I held it in my hand,

323
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,387
but I put it down.

324
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:07,323
I put it down so hard it took
the whole damn shelf with it.

325
00:23:07,324 --> 00:23:09,325
That's what brought on
the walkers,

326
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:11,594
and that's what got
Zack killed.

327
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,000
That's bullshit.

328
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:24,941
Why don't you get in there
and try the engine?

329
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:27,109
It's a red and a green wire.

330
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,844
Go on. It ain't
rocket science.

331
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:38,621
Give it some gas.

332
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,495

Sasha and me picked that spot.

336
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:02,245
He took you with us.

337
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:04,897
There ain't no way
anybody could've known.

338
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:07,567
You ain't gonna be
standing alone,

339
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:10,253
not no more.
Let's go.

( engine revving )

341
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,133
It's all expired
by at least a year.

342
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,736
Better to take it. Let
Herschel decide what he needs.

343
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,225
Did you think it was right?

344
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,811
Letting those kids
come back with us?

345
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:43,014
I think it was the
humane thing to do.

346
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,983
But did you think it was right?

<i>( drawer slides )</i>

348
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,206
Look at us.

349
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:52,540
Digging through drawers,

350
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:55,360
hoping that...
a couple of cough drops

351
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,462
and some disinfectant
might be the difference

352
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:00,165
between dying and living
a couple of more hours.

353

<i>( pills rattling )</i>

If they're strong enough to
help us survive this thing,

355
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,254
yeah, I think you made
the right call.

356
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,589
Rick:
And if they're not?

357
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,841
Let's hope they are.

358
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,211
( softly )
Yeah.

359
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,099
Rick...

360
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:24,856
I killed two people and you
haven't said a word about it.

361
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,443
What do you want me to say?

362
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,078
It's not about what you say.

363
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,729
It's about facing reality.

364
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,582
It always comes for us
and over and over again

365
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,067
we face it so that we can live.

366
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,286
- So that <i>we</i> can live.
- That's right.

367
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,738
That's what it always
comes down to.

368
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,407
You can be a farmer, Rick.

369
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:45,210
You can't <i>just</i> be a farmer.

370
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,137
You're a good leader.

371
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,391
Better than I probably
gave you credit for.

372
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,861
I never murdered
two of our own.

373
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,029
Just one.

374
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:10,151
He was gonna kill me.

375
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,370
So were they.

376
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,905
They were gonna kill all of us.

377
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,107
You don't know that.

378
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,913
If you thought it would
save Judith or Carl,

379
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,416
would you have done it then or would
you have just gone back to your crops

380
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:27,802
and hoped it'd all be okay?

381
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,455
You don't have to like
what I did, Rick.

382
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:34,125
I don't.
You just accept it.

383
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,183
( wind rustling )

384
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,853
( distant can rattles )

385
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,273
Daryl: Looks like
we're getting closer.

386
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,658
Ty: The building we
want is just up ahead.

387
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,979
( creaking )

388
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:01,619
( softly )
Come on. Come on.

389
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,421
Move, move.

390
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,208
All right, let's
make this quick

391
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,661
There you go.

392
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:23,024
Come on.

393
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,160
Carol: Let's hit the
houses across the street.

394
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,995
Hold on.

395
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,135
How'd you put his
shoulder back before?

396
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,703
You learn that from Herschel?

397
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,557
Internet.

398
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,475
It's easier than
telling an ER nurse

399
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:00,678
I'd fallen down the
stairs a third time.

400
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,647
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:06,017
Don't be. Just fixed
what needed fixin'.

402
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,723
I actually convinced myself
I was happy with him.

403
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,108
Which wasn't
all that hard to do

404
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,577
considering my idea
of happiness then

405
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:17,895
was just not being alone.

406
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,082
Made a decent living.

407
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,067
He was charming
when he wanted to be,

408
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:28,206
especially those mornings after
he'd come home piss-drunk and...

409
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,345
Stupid.

410
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,913
Stupid.

411
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:40,418
I didn't think
I could be strong.

412
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:43,288
I didn't know I could.

413
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,923
I already was.

414
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,279
Why don't you say her name?

415
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,117
She's dead, Rick.

416
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:59,370
Sophia. Dead.

417
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,208
Somebody else's slideshow.

418
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,617
Some mornings I still wake up

419
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:15,119
half-expecting Lori
to be there.

420
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,757
Reminding me to pick
up Carl after school

421
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,094
or telling me
breakfast is ready.

422
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:28,182
Every Sunday she'd
make us these pancakes

423
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:32,036
that were just...
godawful.

424
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,471
( chuckling )

425
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:37,075
Clumps of flour
that weren't mixed in right.

426
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:39,310
Thing was...

427
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:42,530
she knew it was bad.

428
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,582
Why'd she keep at it?

429
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,985
Well...

430
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,837
she wanted us to be
the kind of family

431
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:52,256
that ate pancakes on Sunday.

432
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,955

433
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,414
( grunting, munching )

434
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,735
We should get back.

435
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,221
Sam's probably waiting.

436
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:50,752
Anything ending
with -cillin or -cin,

437
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:53,555
C-I-N, grab it.

438
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:55,340
We'll dissolve
the pills in the IVs,

439
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:57,059
put 'em right into
the bloodstream.

440
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,629
Dosage will be tricky but
considering the time we lost...

441
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,152
- How'd you do?
- Bags, tubes, clamps, connectors.

442
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:09,187
- Everything on the list.
- What about y'all?

443
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:11,523
Yeah, we got it all.

444
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:14,476
Yeah. We're good.

445
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:16,161
All right, let's roll.

We fire at 'em, get their
blood on us, breathe it in.

We didn't come all
this way to get sick.

It's been too long.

476
00:33:55,988 --> 00:33:57,806
We should give him
a couple more.

477
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:03,995
He might be fine.

478
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:07,148
He really might be.

479
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,154
But it doesn't matter...

480
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:17,292
because he's not here...
and we have to go.

00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:58,032
Get down!
( grunts )

488
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:03,588
- Come on, move it!
- Jump down to the walkway below.

489
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:06,174
- Bob: <i>They're here!</i>
<i>- Let's go! Go, go. Move.</i>

490
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,852
( snarling )

491
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,113
Michonne:
<i>Bob, let it go.</i>

492
00:35:28,114 --> 00:35:29,564
Let it go, man.

493
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:32,233
- ( grunting )
- Ty: <i>Just let it go.</i>

494
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:34,870
- ( snarling, growling )
- Daryl: <i>Let go of the bag, man.</i>

495
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:41,743
<i>( snarling, growling )</i>

496
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:51,386
You got no meds in your bag?

497
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:53,104
Just this?

498
00:35:56,258 --> 00:35:59,161
You should have kept
walking that day.

499
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:01,596
Don't.

500
00:36:15,277 --> 00:36:17,963
( grunting )

501
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:21,616
Just let it go, Daryl.

502
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:23,618
The man's made his choice.

503
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,470
<i>Nothing you can do about it.</i>

504
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:28,473
<i>Just gotta let it go.</i>

505
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:31,426
I didn't want to hurt nobody.

506
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:36,231
It was just for
when it gets quiet.

507
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:44,372
Take one sip. When those
meds get in our people,

508
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:48,910
I will beat your ass
into the ground.

509
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:50,695
You hear me?

510
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:18,157
( handle clicking )

511
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:21,860
They might have lived.

512
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:28,266
Karen and David,
they might have lived,

513
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:30,736
and now they're dead.

514
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:33,972
That wasn't your
decision to make.

515
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:37,376
When Tyreese finds out...

516
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,746
he'll kill you.

517
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:43,449
He damn near killed me
over nothing.

518
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,050
I can handle Tyreese.

519
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:46,752
When the others find out,

520
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:49,188
they won't want you there.

521
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:51,924
And if they don't make it back,

522
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:54,476
if everybody dies of this thing

523
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:56,845
and it's just the two of us,

524
00:37:56,846 --> 00:38:01,600
with Judith and Carl--
with my children...

525
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:08,340
I won't have you there.

526
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:10,476
Rick, it's me.

527
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:14,513
No one else has to know.

528
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:16,832
<i>I thought you were done making
decisions for everyone.</i>

529
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:20,519
I'm making
this decision for <i>me.</i>

530
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,757
I could have pretended that
everything was gonna be fine.

531
00:38:26,543 --> 00:38:28,727
But I didn't.

532
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,349
I did something.
I stepped up.

533
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,667
I had to do something.

534
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:38,937
No, you didn't.

535
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,481
If you think I'm going anywhere
without Lizzie and Mica--

536
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:53,035
If you want them to leave,
to go out there with you?

537
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:57,022
Lizzie's sick.
Mica is 10 years old.

538
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:59,524
She can't.
( sniffles )

539
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:01,910
We'll keep them safe.

540
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,503
You're not that woman who was too
scared to be alone, not anymore.

541
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:14,339
You're gonna start over,
find others,

542
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,475
people who don't know,

543
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:19,812
and you're gonna
survive out here.

544
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:22,431
You will.

545
00:39:24,984 --> 00:39:26,985
Maybe.

546
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,562
Ty: <i>That's where I was
traveling, Highway 100.</i>

547
00:39:37,563 --> 00:39:40,749
Michonne: Then it will take
about seven hours to get there.

548
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,567
<i>We're gonna need more gas.</i>

549
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:44,419
Ty:
<i>But we'll get there.</i>

550
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:49,241
- Taking Highway 100.
- I heard.

551
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:56,982
( door closes )

552
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:05,107
You were right,
what you said before.

553
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:07,559
About the trail going cold.

554
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:12,364
I don't need to go out anymore.

555
00:40:14,484 --> 00:40:16,201
Good.

556
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:21,106
<i>( engine starts )</i>

557
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:35,137
Take it.

558
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:49,935
Ed gave this to me
on our first anniversary.

559
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,141
Please.

560
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:05,334
I should have given it
away a long time ago.

561
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,325
