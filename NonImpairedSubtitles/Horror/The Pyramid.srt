1
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,241
What's going on?
Are you getting this?

2
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,826
What's he doing?

3
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,799
Do you think
they'll let us pass?

4
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,184
It doesn't look like it.

5
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,179
Are you good to go?

6
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,227
Yeah, rolling.

7
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:30,319
Hidden within this sprawling desert,
250 Miles South of Cairo...

8
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,779
The public will soon lay their eyes
on the holdens' groundbreaking research...

9
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,621
And the father-daughter team
could rewrite history as we know it.

10
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,829
As you can see, the pyramid behind me
has only three sides...

11
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,171
Not four like
the giza pyramids.

12
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:49,537
This architectural feat singles it out
as an exception in this region.

13
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,956
You're gonna
have to start over.

14
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,964
The barking is covering
everything you're saying.

15
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,336
Damn it.
What's wrong with those dogs?

16
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,474
Whose are they, anyway?
They're just feral dogs running around.

17
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,967
Can someone get a shotgun or something
and get rid of these dogs, please?

18
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,979
Driving me crazy.

19
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,558
All right, let's go again.

20
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,105
Okay, sunni. Whenever you're ready,
we're good to go.

21
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,188
Okay. The way this works is,
I'll ask you a question...

22
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,245
You try to incorporate the question
into your response.

23
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,949
Like if I ask you your name,
you would say...

24
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,909
- Dr. Miles holden.
- Wrong.

25
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,704
Right. My name is Dr. Miles holden.

26
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,543
That's what I'm talking about.

27
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,749
Could you tell us
what exactly you're looking for?

28
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,619
Yeah.

29
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,425
There are certain ancient texts
which refer to this geographic area...

30
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,210
As the possible site
of the lost pyramid of akhenaten...

31
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:34,956
Which may be related...

32
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,505
To the particular and unusual
three-sided architecture of our pyramid.

33
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,803
I just need to
quickly check your mic.

34
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,886
Yeah.
It's a little windy out here.

35
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,181
It's a great shot.
Just don't step backwards.

36
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,939
Yeah, okay.
You tell me when.

37
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,938
Pyramids. Hit me with it.

38
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,859
Action.

39
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:58,243
Whatever we're looking at, this is not
the pyramid of king akhenaten.

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,490
The structure that we're dealing with
is buried below the surface.

41
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,333
It takes millennia
for sand to build up that high.

42
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:09,419
Which means that this structure predates
the reign of akhenaten by generations.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,790
Why are so many people
against the satellites?

44
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,836
Most archaeologists are trapped in time
when it comes to reworking methodologies...

45
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:22,053
And assimilating new evidence
into existing historical frameworks.

46
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,555
Proving an older genealogy
for Egyptian history basically means...

47
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,810
Throwing everything they have been working
on their entire lives into question.

48
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,904
Isn't that what
you're trying to do?

49
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,530
No, not exactly.

50
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,107
I respect the work
that they have done...

51
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,663
But we just need to know
when it's time to innovate.

52
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,553
Most of our pyramid
is buried deep beneath the desert.

53
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,127
Here is a scan.

54
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,471
Look at the size of that thing!

55
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,549
That's got to be
600 feet on each side.

56
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,465
See this tunnel here?
This is our way in.

57
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,346
It leads directly
to the apex of the pyramid.

58
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,393
The apex?

59
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,765
It's the tip of the pyramid.

60
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,312
Pyramids don't normally have
apexes at the entrance.

61
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,356
But this one does.

62
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,397
Who dug the tunnel?

63
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,941
We don't know yet.
That's also part of our discovery.

64
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,316
Nora, tell me about the satellites.

65
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,743
I'm not the first archaeologist
to break ground using satellite technology.

66
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,583
But I was inspired to apply it...

67
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,198
After an article that I read
about SETI out of new Mexico.

68
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,326
SETI?

69
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,872
"Search for extraterrestrial intelligence."

70
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,246
They were using the satellites...

71
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,003
To search for traces of water
underneath the surface of Mars.

72
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,255
I thought we were here
to talk about Egypt, not aliens.

73
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,978
What do you think
about all those theories?

74
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,378
About aliens coming to earth?

75
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,836
And that the pyramids
are just giant transmitters?

76
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,637
Come on.
Even I have my limits.

77
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,565
Do you see how these ridges
form a barrier around the pyramid?

78
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,148
Dad. Dad.

79
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,068
Could you please stop touching buttons
that you don't understand?

80
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,235
- Where was that taken?
- It doesn't matter when it was taken.

81
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,818
I said where.

82
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,323
This technology, the satellite stuff...

83
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,965
Is such a small part
of what we're doing.

84
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,872
We should be talking about archaeology,
about the pyramid, about akhenaten, and...

85
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,913
Actually, the whole satellite angle...

86
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,956
Is what interested the network
in the first place.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,130
It's the dawn of a
new age in archaeology.

88
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,549
Using the future to
understand the past.

89
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,588
Anything else
I'm not supposed to see?

90
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,384
Would you just mind your own business?
Thank you very much.

91
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,346
I'm sorry.
You are my business, all right?

92
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,392
Archaeology used to be about digs and dirt.

93
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,774
But we've lost the raw sensation
with all this technological mediation.

94
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,438
Great.

95
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,485
How was that, Fitz?

96
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,155
It was award-winning.

97
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,903
Okay. Let's wrap up.
We're done for the day.

98
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,873
Sorry.

99
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,190
Hey.

100
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,278
No, I'm fine, mom.

101
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,413
I'm fine. Don't worry.

102
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,617
Cairo is far, far away.

103
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,290
And we're supposed
to break through tomorrow.

104
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,659
So if we get far enough,
we'll be safer underground...

105
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,166
Than we will be
in a war bunker.

106
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,706
No, I'm not taking it lightly.
I'm just trying to focus on my work.

107
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,343
Could you please not worry?

108
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,549
You know dad is enough
to handle as it is.

109
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,880
Okay. I love you, too. I do.

110
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,257
All right, tell...

111
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,273
Mom, I have to go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

112
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,677
I love you. Bye.

113
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,345
Zahir, get your metallic junk out of here.

114
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,333
Jesus!

115
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,790
What the hell is that?

116
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,805
Allow me to introduce you to shorty.

117
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,961
He's gonna be
our first set of eyes and ears inside...

118
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,138
After we make initial breakthrough.

119
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,428
He stands just
over one foot tall...

120
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,432
With six wheels
on a rocker-bogie suspension system...

121
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,475
Which was originally designed by NASA
for their Mars rovers...

122
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,690
To allow them to travel
over the rough martian terrain.

123
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,270
I bet this thing is
a real babe magnet.

124
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,737
Some of the missions
shorty has been on are...

125
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,607
Michael zahir, our robotics engineer.

126
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,205
But it seems he wasn't briefed...

127
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,410
On which million-dollar territories
he would be exploring.

128
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,041
Don't you worry, Nora.

129
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,618
I've got two primary camera feeds...

130
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,423
Sending back real-time footage
to our command center.

131
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,955
So everything shorty sees
is permanently recorded.

132
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,094
Right, partner?

133
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,674
Look out.

134
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:52,934
Cute.

135
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,258
Look out.

136
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,704
We're not shootingdays of our lives.

137
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,910
Stop wasting your memory space.

138
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,040
Come on. People would love to see
these two nerds get freaky.

139
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,337
Dr. Holden!
Dr. Holden!

140
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,592
Wait, what's he saying?

141
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,974
We break through!

142
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,350
What?
Come on! Come on!

143
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,971
Are you all right?
Give me your hand.

144
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,064
- You got it?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,387
Slow down, slow down.

146
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,773
You coming?

147
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,485
Tell them not to open it up yet.
Tell them to hold off.

148
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:46,861
Yeah, hold off!

149
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,767
Zahir, I need you to translate.

150
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,455
You got it?

151
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,375
Here it comes.

152
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
Jesus!

153
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,761
Get him out of here!

154
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,945
We have to get
him to medical!

155
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,654
Oh, my God.
We have to do something!

156
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,004
He's alive.

157
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,963
Thank God.

158
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,673
- So what happened to him?
- Aspergillus.

159
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,843
What's aspergillus?

160
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,591
Inhalation of toxic air.

161
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,512
It's actually not as uncommon
as it sounds.

162
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,681
What causes it?

163
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,219
A fungi usually found
in caves and tombs...

164
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,973
Structures that have been sealed off.

165
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,480
This pyramid could be way older
than even I had originally thought.

166
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,898
Nora, please. Stop spinning out
your wild theories.

167
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,397
I am trying to
reassure the university...

168
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,859
That we're going to be
doing things on schedule.

169
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
And that has to be turned off.

170
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,033
Nobody goes near that pyramid
without my permission, all right?

171
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,782
And nobody mentions the word "curse."
Understood?

172
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,825
I don't want any of that crazy nonsense
on my site.

173
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,200
Our site.

174
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,995
Goddamn sand.

175
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,290
What?

176
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,171
What?

177
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,048
What's wrong?

178
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,015
What's wrong?

179
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,176
You can't shut us down.
We're about to launch shorty.

180
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,187
It's not us, it's the government.

181
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:53,109
The ministry of antiquities is ordering
all research teams in the area...

182
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,858
To pull out immediately.

183
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,992
They want you
cleared out in 24 hours.

184
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,738
When will we be able
to resume the excavation?

185
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,411
We don't know yet.

186
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,829
I'm sorry, what?
I don't understand.

187
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,618
You've been in
the desert too long.

188
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,002
You should see what's happening
in the streets of Cairo.

189
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,169
It's mayhem.

190
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,837
Wide-scale violence
between the military and the protestors.

191
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,127
They're fearing a civil war.

192
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,340
But this isn't Cairo.

193
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,840
Yeah, we are in the middle
of the desert.

194
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:18,881
You don't get it.

195
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:23,143
I'm sorry, Miles, but you have
to be out by tomorrow morning.

196
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,718
God. We are so close!

197
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,439
There goes my emmy.

198
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:34,227
Nora, this is not a discussion.
The final answer is no. Thank you.

199
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,193
Would you please hand these out
to everybody you see around here?

200
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,455
This place needs to look like
we were never here by morning.

201
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,658
What is going on?

202
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:43,868
It's all written down there.
This is not a conference.

203
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,327
Now just go, please.

204
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:48,908
So, that's it?

205
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,498
What would you like me to do?

206
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,120
How about anything?

207
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,497
You barely put up a fight.

208
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,133
I don't fight battles I can't win.

209
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,091
I have got a career to think of,
and so do you.

210
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,921
- Don't forget that!
- Okay.

211
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,255
But we can't walk away from here
with nothing to show.

212
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,433
I am not...

213
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,680
Dad, please!
This is the find of the century.

214
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:11,734
And you're going to give up
when we are this close.

215
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,558
We owe this to our name.

216
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,057
What's the harm?

217
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,895
Besides toxic air poisoning?

218
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,230
We won't go in ourselves.

219
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,026
We'll just send in shorty.

220
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,489
He can take some readings
and some pictures.

221
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,572
A couple of hours.

222
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,334
Nobody will even know
that we were gone.

223
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,663
Dad, I know what you're thinking.

224
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,038
Look me in the
eye and tell me...

225
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,753
That you don't wanna see
what's going on in that pyramid.

226
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,758
Trust me.

227
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,811
- Got it?
- Yeah.

228
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:53,773
Yes!

229
00:14:55,771 --> 00:15:00,481
Guys, captain Egypt is following you,
and he doesn't look happy.

230
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,526
Hold on.
Let me talk to him real quick.

231
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,132
Zahir, what is he saying?

232
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,167
He's wondering
why we still have our stuff here.

233
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:23,132
He's here to supervise us,
make sure we get on the plane tomorrow.

234
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,513
Tell him not to worry,
that we are wrapping things up...

235
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,141
That everything is on schedule.

236
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,387
Dad, what the hell?

237
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,024
Fine, fine.

238
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,000
How does the air check out?

239
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,327
No. Don't even think about it, Nora.
There's no way you're going in there.

240
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,713
Actually, according to the meters, it's
showing minimal traces of toxic fumes...

241
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,381
But definitely below
dangerous levels.

242
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,261
But I'm assuming it's because
we're still close to the entrance.

243
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,190
- Can you enhance that?
- Can you get out of my workspace, please?

244
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,032
It's a $3 million rover.
Yeah, I can enhance it.

245
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,937
Okay, zoom in. Zoom in right there.
Make that larger. Zoom in.

246
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,946
- Dad, please.
- What?

247
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,210
That. This says "slaughter."

248
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,709
This says "God."

249
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,421
Yeah, this one says "underworld."

250
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,751
What?
Really?

251
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:48,094
Relax, fitzie, these are just symbols
to scare away grave robbers.

252
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,065
Curved stick. Staff.

253
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,823
- What the hell is that?
- That, my dear, is the symbol of osiris.

254
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,506
- Osiris?
- He's the God of the afterlife.

255
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,875
He's also considered by the Egyptians
as the first pharaoh.

256
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:35,563
Oh, God.

257
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,216
Okay, what was that?

258
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,392
It must've been a dog.

259
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,774
Got in somehow.
They left the opening unguarded.

260
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,454
Let's just keep our wits sharp,
all right?

261
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:12,972
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

262
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,050
What?

263
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,428
You guys hear that?

264
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,322
I've lost all external control.

265
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,397
Both the camera feeds.

266
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,493
- Hold on, hold on. Damn dogs.
- You mean...

267
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,898
Hold on.

268
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,700
Shorty's offline.

269
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,735
- I got to go get him.
- No.

270
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,997
You are not going in there.
We have no idea what's in there.

271
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,369
Could be fumes still.

272
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,665
No. Be realistic, zahir.

273
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,418
Be realistic? I just told you
how much that rover costs, okay?

274
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,171
It's on loan.
Does he not know how this works?

275
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,513
We can't even be here.
We have to be on a plane.

276
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,718
And you don't think NASA's gonna be
pissed to find out we lost their rover?

277
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,505
Okay, okay.
But just the two of us.

278
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,386
No. That is not happening.

279
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,943
Okay, we have no idea if
we're gonna be able to come back here.

280
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,847
You're crazy if you think
I'm not going in there with you.

281
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,016
The camera goes everywhere you do.
You agreed to that back in the U.S.

282
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,936
Actually, I'm all right
to just hang back here.

283
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,404
- You guys can go on...
- Get your ass in there.

284
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,704
- Okay.
- Hope you brought those extra batteries.

285
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:15,818
We're gonna need them.

286
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,872
I thought we were
the only ones filming.

287
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,582
It's my version of a notebook.
I don't want to miss anything.

288
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:25,713
You ready?

289
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,579
Yeah, we're coming.
Let's go.

290
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,710
So, how are we supposed
to get shorty out, if it doesn't work?

291
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,046
I'll figure it out.

292
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,721
Yeah, he doesn't know either.

293
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,929
So, I think these flares might help us
take care of our stray dog problem.

294
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,214
He's saying we
can't go in there.

295
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,654
Keep rolling!

296
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,899
Tell him to calm down!

297
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,281
I'm trying.

298
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,035
Let me try to talk to him.

299
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,497
- What are they saying?
- I can't get it, they're going too fast.

300
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,594
He's making a plea of some kind.

301
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,629
From one Egyptian to another.

302
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:18,681
I think it's working.

303
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,404
All right, guys,
we've got two hours to get shorty.

304
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,371
Here you go.

305
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,497
What's that for?

306
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,458
It's just something to help us
find our way back.

307
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,289
You know, in case we decide
to go in a little further.

308
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,335
Further?

309
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,591
Great.

310
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,835
They don't seriously expect us
to wear these, do they?

311
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,512
Yeah, guess so.

312
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:03,102
Come on, guys, let's go.

313
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,273
Watch your step.

314
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,482
The structure could collapse
at any moment.

315
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,615
And don't touch anything.

316
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,069
Stay close.

317
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:20,491
Imagine, the last people
who walked these tunnels...

318
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,031
Died thousands of years ago.

319
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,848
Also, the ancient Egyptians
only stood about five feet tall...

320
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,484
So watch your heads.

321
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,482
It's a little taller in here.

322
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,998
The dogs couldn't have
dragged him too far.

323
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,250
I don't get it.

324
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:17,964
There's no tracks.
He couldn't have just disappeared.

325
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,318
Guys...

326
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,329
Which way do we go now?

327
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,335
No, no!

328
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,793
Michael, what's wrong?

329
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,543
Oh, God.

330
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:59,959
I'm dead. I'm dead.

331
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,343
NASA's gonna be pissed.

332
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,394
I'm dead.

333
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,102
I'm dead.

334
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,297
I'm freaking dead!

335
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:09,967
Death. Amazing.

336
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,854
Well, chin up, mate.

337
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:15,152
I'm sure we can
find the rest of him.

338
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,647
We're gonna find him.

339
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,307
Hey, doc.

340
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,567
Is this the apex thing
you were talking about?

341
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,490
There's something in the wall.
What's up there?

342
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,452
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

343
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,214
- Nora, no. Please don't fall.
- Be careful.

344
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,206
Zahir, give me your hand.
Come on.

345
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,285
Okay, ready?

346
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,963
- Yeah. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

347
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,922
All right, I almost have the ledge.
Yeah. I got it. Okay.

348
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,510
All right.

349
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,511
You okay?

350
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,471
Guys, you got to
come check this out.

351
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:54,355
- What do you see?
- Just come up here.

352
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:04,148
I've never seen
anything like this before.

353
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,154
I thought this thing
was supposed to be a tomb.

354
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,356
It is.

355
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,371
What's with the arsenal?

356
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,580
It's ceremonial.

357
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,866
The ancient Egyptians
buried their pharaohs...

358
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:18,713
With an armory of Spears,
for use in the afterlife.

359
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,050
Usually, they're placed next to
the sarcophagus, never separately.

360
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:24,877
Dad?

361
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:28,888
Look at that.

362
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:34,718
Mended at the shaft.
It's broken.

363
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:38,686
And I wonder...
Yeah, look at this.

364
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:41,019
There's a chip in this blade.

365
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:43,984
So these...
These were not just ceremonial.

366
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:46,991
These saw battle.

367
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,413
- Switch off your lights.
- Lights off.

368
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,424
- Look at that.
- What is that?

369
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:03,093
That is dried blood.

370
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:06,093
What does that mean?

371
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,876
I'll have to take it back
and analyze it and date it.

372
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:12,717
We won't know until then,
so go ahead and take that as a sample.

373
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,063
- Okay.
- Wow.

374
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,217
- Wow.
- That's cool.

375
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,766
Hey, your wire.

376
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,349
- Your wire.
- What?

377
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,444
It must have snapped.

378
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:27,067
It's high-tension wire, doctor,
it doesn't just snap.

379
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,240
- Well, how...
- Fitzie, you stepped on it.

380
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,449
No, I didn't.

381
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:33,329
You probably didn't realize but you
must've done it as you were filming.

382
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,622
Realize I stepped on it?
You probably stepped on it!

383
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,411
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Probably zahir, with his stupid robot.

384
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,745
It's all right,
just calm down.

385
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,310
We're not that far from the entrance.
We'll set up another wire.

386
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,789
All right.

387
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,762
- Okay?
- Okay, it's this way.

388
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,801
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
It's not this way, it's that way.

389
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,596
Look, I copied down the hieroglyphs
in my notebook before we set off...

390
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,770
- As we entered.
- No.

391
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,768
No, I think we came from
this direction over here.

392
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,234
They all look the same.

393
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,283
- Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
- That's enough, fitzie.

394
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,608
Look, guys. It's this way.
It's this way.

395
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,164
See?
This is why we attach a wire.

396
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:18,701
That's strange.

397
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,615
These hieroglyphs are all the same.

398
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:22,834
We only walked for a few minutes.

399
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:29,843
Guys, is it just me or is it becoming really,
really hard to breathe in these masks?

400
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,472
Pyramids are incredibly airtight.

401
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:35,008
Explains how mummies can remain so
perfectly preserved after all these years.

402
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:38,183
Yeah, no, I'm not talking about
some pyramid mumbo-jumbo here.

403
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,683
I'm being serious.
Something's off.

404
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,516
Now stay close.

405
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,284
I don't want to lose anybody.
Okay?

406
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,030
Shouldn't we go back
to where we were?

407
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,243
Yeah, I think it was back...

408
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,795
No, it's impossible.

409
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,790
I was positive.

410
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,595
I'm sorry, honey.

411
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,183
We have to go back
in the other direction.

412
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:15,428
This looks...

413
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:18,596
Yeah, we definitely
came the wrong way.

414
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:20,933
What could this chamber be?

415
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,644
Holy shit!

416
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:25,444
- What?
- Oh, no.

417
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,106
- There's shorty.
- Oh, my God.

418
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,648
Come on!

419
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,868
We should not be here.
Let's get out.

420
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:41,539
Oh, my God!

421
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,458
Wait, nobody move!
Nobody move.

422
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,420
All right.

423
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:48,209
All right.

424
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:49,749
Oh, my God.

425
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,714
What's happening?

426
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,465
The floor is about to collapse.

427
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,085
What?

428
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,136
We have to back out of here
one at a time.

429
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,929
Fitzie?
Come on. You first.

430
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:04,522
Easy.

431
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,652
Move toward me,
and try not to step on the cracks.

432
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,321
That's good.

433
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,069
Come on.
That's good, fitzie.

434
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,486
Don't jump!
Just...

435
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:18,567
Okay, okay.

436
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,155
Just come on, come on, come on.

437
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,450
Good, good, good.

438
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,700
All right, that's good, that's good.

439
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,825
That's right. That's right.

440
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:28,345
- Oh, my God.
- That's right, that's right.

441
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,995
That's good. That's good.

442
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,171
Come on.
That's good, fitzie.

443
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,131
Okay, now, zahir.
Come on. Come on.

444
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:37,725
- Are you sure?
- Come!

445
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:45,806
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- It's all right, it's all right.

446
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,060
Come on, Michael, faster!

447
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,187
Everybody run!

448
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:10,884
Nora?
Nora?

449
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,918
I'm good.
I'm good.

450
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,211
Is anyone hurt?

451
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,464
I'm alive.

452
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,006
Where are we?

453
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,974
Jeez, I can't breathe
with this stupid mask.

454
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,970
What is that smell?

455
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:29,234
Smells like shit.

456
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,114
Where are we?

457
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:39,397
I'm guessing where the animal who
destroyed shorty decided to relieve itself.

458
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:42,823
That's a lot of shit for
just one dog who got trapped.

459
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:46,156
Not only that, where did it go?

460
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:48,577
How'd it get out?

461
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:50,746
The only way out is up.

462
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:55,094
Still, we've got to get
out of here soon.

463
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,260
I haven't smelt anything this bad
since zahir's tent...

464
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,259
When he had the
beans the other day.

465
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,741
What the hell is
wrong with you, man?

466
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,354
Help me!

467
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,520
- Nora, wait!
- Michael, Michael!

468
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,809
Oh, my God!

469
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,981
- Oh, my God!
- Help me!

470
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:14,608
What do we do?

471
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,518
Okay, man, don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of here.

472
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,647
Okay, come on, guys! Help me, please!

473
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:19,864
Michael, Michael.

474
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,073
Okay.

475
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:23,373
- Calm down.
- We need to push, all right?

476
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:24,817
All right. All right, push!

477
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,237
- One, two, three.
- My God.

478
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,464
Come on.
Push, push, push!

479
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,498
Stop! Stop!

480
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,253
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay.

481
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:40,257
What are you doing with the phone?
You're not gonna get reception down here.

482
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,179
We're 90 feet below ground.

483
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:45,217
The walls are six feet thick.
Jesus, use your head.

484
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,972
We're never gonna be able to get
this rock off of him by ourselves.

485
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,559
And even if we do...

486
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:56,984
There's water in there, get it out.

487
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,480
Hey, hey.
Listen to me.

488
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:00,686
Look at me.
Look at me.

489
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,066
Look at me. Take these.

490
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:04,492
I want you to swallow these, okay?
I want you to swallow.

491
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,236
Here you go.

492
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:10,077
He's gonna be okay, doctor?

493
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,910
He's not gonna die, is he?

494
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:12,995
Fitzie!

495
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,540
Just shut up, please!

496
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,630
You're not helping right now, okay?

497
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,593
Michael, Michael. Breathe.

498
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:23,633
Hey, baby.
Look at me. Michael.

499
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,505
You are going to
get out of here, okay?

500
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:26,762
Just breathe, that's right.

501
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:28,814
Breathe.

502
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:32,137
Stay back, something could still fall.

503
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:36,814
What are you looking at?

504
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,525
This shaft should take us
back to where we came from.

505
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,953
You know,
I think I can get up there.

506
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,068
No, no, that's not a good idea.

507
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,155
I've been rock
climbing my entire life.

508
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:52,825
If you give me a boost,
I can brace myself in there and shimmy up.

509
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,460
Guys, she wants to climb this shaft.
Can you tell her she's crazy?

510
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,670
I can do it.

511
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,340
Don't worry.

512
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,586
Help me, come on!

513
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,179
Here, take this.

514
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:08,719
That way we can
watch on the monitor.

515
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,353
Jesus.

516
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,019
How's that?
You're picking that up? Yeah?

517
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,019
All right.

518
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:18,734
Okay.
All right.

519
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:20,522
Okay, sunni, be careful.

520
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,066
Michael, calm down.

521
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:28,414
- Go slow!
- Yeah.

522
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,503
- Okay, be careful, sunni.
- Go slow, go slow!

523
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:34,537
Yeah.

524
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,380
Right, just take your time, okay?

525
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,381
You got it.

526
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:46,974
At the same time, don't take too long.

527
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,931
Just let us know
if you see anything.

528
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,890
- Okay.
- Okay, sunni?

529
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,233
Oh, God.

530
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:58,398
- You okay? Go slow, okay?
- Yeah.

531
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:07,653
What do you see?

532
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:12,906
I see two people
trying to break my concentration!

533
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,408
Are you okay?

534
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,246
Did you guys hear that?

535
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,634
I can't see anything.

536
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,088
It's too dark.

537
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:26,924
Hang in there, zahir.

538
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:30,297
Let us know as soon as
you see anything, okay, sunni?

539
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:32,264
I think something is up here.

540
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:42,356
There's some kind of low tunnel
perpendicular to us.

541
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:02,674
Oh, my God! Sunni, are you okay?

542
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,289
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Oh, God.

543
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,586
You okay, fitzie?

544
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:06,629
Okay.

545
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,912
- I think I've got shit in my ear.
- Dad, give me my bag.

546
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,427
Here, use this.

547
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:11,797
What happened up there?

548
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,099
I saw something.

549
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,307
I was almost there
and it popped out at me.

550
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,928
This is gonna sting, okay?

551
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,063
So, was it a dog, yeah?

552
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:23,444
I didn't get a good look.

553
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,940
But when I saw it, I lost my...

554
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:27,193
I have another bag.

555
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:28,993
I saw its eyes.

556
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:31,573
What was it?

557
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:32,953
Yeah, hold on.

558
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,240
It was the same thing we saw
before we lost contact with shorty.

559
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:37,415
Sorry, sorry.

560
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:39,952
You know, maybe it's the soldier.

561
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,997
He knows we're down here.
He's probably gonna be looking for us.

562
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,540
A soldier popped out of a hidden tunnel
and scratched my face.

563
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,507
Maybe there's a
way out over there.

564
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,638
Hey, Michael. Michael.

565
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:04,443
These carvings tell a story.

566
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,979
You see these figures
holding the Spears.

567
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:09,114
These are the same ones we saw
in the apex.

568
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,320
This is a warning.

569
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:16,202
A warning?

570
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,585
A warning for what?

571
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,700
I don't know.

572
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:22,875
I think we should
just stay here.

573
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,465
That soldier will come
looking for us eventually.

574
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,501
No, Michael might
not have that long.

575
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:28,844
We have to look
for another way out.

576
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,339
All right, then, fine.
What is your plan now, Nora?

577
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,801
If there is a gate here...

578
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,641
Then behind those stones
there is a passage...

579
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,006
And maybe another way out.

580
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:38,643
And if the gate has been standing here
for thousands of years...

581
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,310
Maybe it's standing here for a reason.

582
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:41,469
Who are we to destroy it?

583
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:42,677
Jesus!

584
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:44,636
Stop being an archaeologist
for a minute here...

585
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:45,976
And start being a human being!

586
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:47,441
Look, she's right, okay?

587
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,151
We have to look for help!

588
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:51,575
- Maybe we can try the shaft.
- Nora!

589
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,070
Look at her face!

590
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:54,895
We don't know what's up there!

591
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,992
Look, guys,
we can't just sit around here.

592
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:04,115
Okay, we've got things up there
scratching people's faces.

593
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:05,334
It stinks in here!

594
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:06,924
So put your mask back on.

595
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:10,302
No, I'm serious, man. Listen...

596
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:14,258
If we can survive this drop
then so can it.

597
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,549
Whatever it is.

598
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,890
And while we're trapped in here
we're like food in a bowl right now.

599
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,059
All right, fine.

600
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:32,063
- There. You got it?
- I got it. Let's go over here.

601
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,609
Yeah, we're fine.

602
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:45,212
Okay, one more. Ready? One, two...

603
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:47,706
Oh, God.

604
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,625
I don't know if it's safe in there.

605
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:55,512
For all we know that air could be...

606
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:59,757
Yeah, we'll take our chances.

607
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,393
If you ask me,
it's not gonna be any worse...

608
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,890
Than the air
we're breathing in here.

609
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,101
Yeah.

610
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:09,058
Hey.

611
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:12,362
- You take it.
- No.

612
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:15,318
No. What, you want to sit here
in the dark?

613
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:16,946
No.

614
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:20,489
And besides, if we get lost
then maybe we can follow the light back.

615
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:22,453
Okay?

616
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,791
You're not gonna need the hatchet,
but it's just in case.

617
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,500
I'm gonna go get you help, okay?

618
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,497
I'm gonna come back for you.

619
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:28,933
Hey, listen.

620
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,266
- It's that soldier! What's his name?
- Shadid!

621
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,521
- Shadid!
- Shadid, help us!

622
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:34,984
- Hello!
- We're right over here!

623
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:36,073
Shadid!

624
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:37,856
Where's it coming from?

625
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:39,694
Can't tell.

626
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:47,835
Did you guys hear that?

627
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,075
Help me! Help me!

628
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:53,174
What's happening to him?

629
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,458
You guys, that's not shadid.
That's Michael.

630
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,592
- Michael!
- You should go! Go, go!

631
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,919
Find shadid! Nora, wait!

632
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,853
Shouldn't we just go with them?

633
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,659
How are we supposed to find shadid?

634
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,169
Hello?

635
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:38,127
Shadid!

636
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,838
Are you still there?

637
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,466
Michael.

638
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:52,064
Oh, my God.

639
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,480
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

640
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,480
Oh, my God.

641
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,646
No, no, no...

642
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,320
No, this isn't happening.

643
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,033
No!

644
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,115
Okay.

645
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,463
No, this is not possible.

646
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:16,328
- I think we have to get out of here.
- No, no, no.

647
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,005
- It's not safe.
- No, where is he?

648
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,169
No, no...

649
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,804
No, it's not happening. No.

650
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,301
- Nora.
- I don't believe it.

651
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:26,802
- Nora, Nora.
- No, I...

652
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:29,804
Honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

653
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:31,807
I know you cared for him,
but we have to go.

654
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,769
- Michael...
- I'm so sorry.

655
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:35,848
I'm so sorry.

656
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:38,864
- Honey, we have to go.
- Michael!

657
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:41,491
- We have to join the others, okay?
- I can't...

658
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,865
Okay, honey, you've got to focus now.

659
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,652
We got to get
out of this pyramid.

660
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:47,816
It's not safe for us.
Come on.

661
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,875
Where did he go?

662
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,118
Come on. Okay, come on.

663
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:53,908
- Come on.
- I can't.

664
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:55,214
Come on.

665
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:09,137
We should never
have followed them.

666
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,060
What's taking them so long?

667
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,563
Should we go back there?

668
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:16,428
Shadid!

669
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,476
Shadid, can you hear us?

670
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,773
All right.

671
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,653
What happened to zahir?

672
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:25,903
Zahir is dead.

673
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:28,196
He tried to shift the Boulder.

674
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,068
It rolled over and crushed him.

675
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,825
That's impossible. We couldn't shift
that thing between the four of us!

676
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:35,948
I don't know. I think he was chipping
away at it with the hatchet.

677
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,366
That's a load of bull.

678
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:39,715
We heard the screams.

679
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:43,549
If there's anything we've learned today
it's that you're talking out of your ass.

680
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:45,087
No, she's right, yeah.

681
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,300
You're lying to us.

682
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:50,762
What about the eyes I saw
at the top of the tunnel?

683
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:53,638
Whatever took a chunk out of my face
killed zahir!

684
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,140
- Calm down, lady.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

685
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:57,925
I'm sorry...

686
00:41:57,976 --> 00:41:59,976
But robot guy has just been devoured...

687
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,730
By a creature we cannot identify,
for Christ's sake!

688
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:03,903
"Calm down."

689
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:06,151
- Who the hell do you think...
- Nobody made you come!

690
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:08,403
My job is to follow you guys
with the camera.

691
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:09,695
What, are you just
following orders now?

692
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:13,028
Step up and take responsibility
for your own actions!

693
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:14,907
Hey!
Back off!

694
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:16,582
- Keep her away from me!
- Back off!

695
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,250
Jesus, sunni, relax.

696
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:19,998
Don't tell me to relax!

697
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,750
This asshole has led us
into a death trap!

698
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:23,923
I don't need this right now.

699
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:25,381
Look, sunni, all right?

700
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,420
You're panicking
and you're freaking out!

701
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:28,884
You're just looking for someone
to blame right now.

702
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:29,924
I found him.

703
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:34,217
Well, that attitude is not going
to help us out right now, is it?

704
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,430
All right, just relax.

705
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,017
Come on, just breathe.

706
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:44,272
I'm sure we can find
a way out of here.

707
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:47,356
What we need to
do is to find shadid.

708
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,821
He got in here, we can get out.

709
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,202
- Yeah.
- How's that?

710
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:52,488
Yeah, great.

711
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:58,658
What's up?

712
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,293
No, it was nothing.

713
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,168
Come on, fitzie, you go first.

714
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:06,375
What?

715
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:09,134
- Me?
- Yes.

716
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,344
What am I, a bloody Guinea pig?

717
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:16,139
For God's sake.

718
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,600
Are you seeing how tight this is?

719
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:18,769
Just go.

720
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:21,889
Bloody hell.

721
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:37,025
Are you sure this is the way?

722
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:39,285
Can't be sure of
anything in this place.

723
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:49,003
So...

724
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,420
Remind me again, guys, what do I do
if this thing jumps out at me...

725
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:53,876
And scratches my face off?

726
00:43:53,926 --> 00:43:56,676
You try to put as much distance
as you can between you and it.

727
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,160
Right, this is probably
about as fast as I can move right now.

728
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:00,931
Just move faster, fitzie!

729
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,854
I don't want to be here long enough
to find out!

730
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:08,105
Guys.

731
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,782
- Guys?
- Yeah.

732
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,240
Something's behind us!

733
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,120
What do we do?
What do we do?

734
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:19,197
- Keep going!
- Just move! Move!

735
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,375
Just move, fitzie!
Move!

736
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:25,212
Go! Go! Go!
Go as fast as you can, fitzie!

737
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:27,379
It's coming faster!

738
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,457
Shit.

739
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,302
- Oh, God!
- Don't stop.

740
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,971
Oh, God. Oh, my God!
There's something here.

741
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:36,594
Shit!

742
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,265
Keep going.
Keep going.

743
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,469
It's coming faster!

744
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,768
Guys, the soldier's here!

745
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:45,980
It's shadid.

746
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,649
Where the hell
did he come from?

747
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,230
Hurry up, fitzie!

748
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:52,074
Keep moving.
Keep moving.

749
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:57,032
Come on.
Come on.

750
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:00,531
Get back.

751
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:02,196
Everybody, get back! Get back!

752
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:19,797
Jesus.

753
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:24,434
What the hell was that?

754
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,074
Oh, my God.

755
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:42,993
Holy shit!

756
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:44,835
Lights! Fitzie!
Come on.

757
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,462
Turn it off.
Kill the light!

758
00:45:58,133 --> 00:45:59,633
- We should...
- No, no, no.

759
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:01,506
Just don't move a muscle.

760
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:07,768
Fitzie, shut up.

761
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:22,371
We should be very quiet.

762
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:42,386
What the fuck was that?

763
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:45,062
I have no idea.

764
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,602
Did you see the
claws on that thing?

765
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:50,228
What the hell is
going on down here?

766
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:57,899
All right.

767
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:10,245
Don't go too close.

768
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:14,787
Is it gone?

769
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,600
Sunni, that scratch
is becoming really infected.

770
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,739
Your eye is not looking
too good, either.

771
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:31,938
We need to find
an exit right now.

772
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,905
Please tell me
there is something on this wall...

773
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:42,323
That explains how
to get out of here...

774
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:45,122
Or at least
what the bloody hell is after us.

775
00:47:45,157 --> 00:47:48,617
This panel depicts the final judgment,
the weighing of souls.

776
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,083
What?

777
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:53,121
It's from the Egyptian
book of the dead.

778
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,248
When a person died,
they passed into a room.

779
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:59,923
They were brought before osiris
and a panel of judges.

780
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:02,343
And next to them
was a massive scale.

781
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:07,352
Then the God Anubis weighed their heart
against maat, the goddess of truth.

782
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:11,177
And if it balanced perfectly,
they passed into the afterlife.

783
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,849
They believed they were sent to the sky
to dwell among the stars.

784
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,775
I thought the book of the dead
was just full of spells and incantations.

785
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:19,404
No, it's more than that.

786
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:21,612
It's a guide to immortality.

787
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:24,152
This was central
to Egyptian philosophy.

788
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:27,616
This is the final milestone.

789
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:32,165
What, and you believe in this rubbish,
do you?

790
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,250
They believed it.

791
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:37,961
I think the priests
acted out this ritual.

792
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,091
None of this matters
unless we get out of here.

793
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:42,338
We've got to go.
Let's go! Let's go.

794
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:55,895
What do you see?

795
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,270
It's a dead end.

796
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:25,006
Fuck!

797
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:30,968
What was that?

798
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:33,013
I thought you said
don't touch anything.

799
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,060
What now?

800
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:48,025
What...

801
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,540
We'll get buried if we don't go!

802
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:58,581
Come on!

803
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:11,547
Go, go, go!

804
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:12,765
Come on!

805
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:17,225
- Nora!
- I'm trying!

806
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:18,267
Nora.

807
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:21,353
Nora, come on!

808
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:23,766
- Come on!
- Dad, I can't move!

809
00:50:24,566 --> 00:50:25,566
I'm stuck!

810
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:28,611
Guys!

811
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:35,121
Dad!

812
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:36,619
Dad!

813
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:38,462
Help!

814
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:56,259
Guys, I'm stuck! Help!

815
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,596
All right. Give us...

816
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:58,811
Sunni!

817
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:00,639
Oh, God!

818
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:02,516
Oh, my God! Sunni!

819
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:05,148
Come on. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

820
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,730
Give me your hand. Come on!
Just pull! Wiggle your legs!

821
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,436
God! I'm gonna help you!

822
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:11,066
I'm gonna get you!

823
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:12,163
Guys!

824
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:15,875
Shit!

825
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,160
No!

826
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:21,291
No, no, no, no!
Don't!

827
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:22,501
Sunni!

828
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,577
Guys!

829
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:26,286
- Oh, God! No!
- Help! We need your help!

830
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:27,666
Oh, God.

831
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:34,258
Get away!
Please... sunni...

832
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:35,855
Get away!

833
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,144
Help!

834
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:41,102
- Dad!
- Give me your hand. Give me your hand!

835
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:42,313
- Help me.
- Just don't...

836
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:43,981
- Keep at it!
- Dad!

837
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:45,401
- You're doing great. Come on. Give me...
- Dad!

838
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:46,609
Wiggle your legs!

839
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:49,278
Come on, honey!
You have to keep squirming!

840
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:50,528
Nora!

841
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:56,534
Sunni!

842
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:00,158
I'm gonna get you! Guys!

843
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:05,289
Right there. Right there.
Come on. Come on.

844
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,134
Come on, and give me your hand!

845
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:10,756
Come on! Come on, Nora!

846
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:12,507
Hold on! Nora!

847
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:14,935
Got it! God...

848
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:16,178
Come on.
I got your hand.

849
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,470
I got you, I got you.

850
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:22,394
- Pull!
- I am...

851
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:29,398
Nora...

852
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:33,148
Thank God. Thank God.

853
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:36,535
Oh, God!

854
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,239
- Fitzie!
- Doctor!

855
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:43,160
Jesus. Oh, my God.

856
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,250
Okay!

857
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:54,134
Come here, guys.
Fitzie, get on the corner.

858
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,344
Take the rope.
I'm gonna throw it to you. All right?

859
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:58,555
- Get the end. You got it?
- Yes!

860
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:01,215
Great. Sunni, just hold on,
we're coming right down, all right?

861
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:02,435
Watch out!

862
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:03,891
Wait.

863
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:05,894
Be careful.

864
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,569
Grip tight. Grip tight. Grip tight.

865
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:12,437
That's right.
You're doing great.

866
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:18,322
Jesus. She's...

867
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,905
Here, here.

868
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:23,616
Okay.

869
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:29,957
Lift up...

870
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,800
Right there, okay.
Is that better?

871
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:34,089
Is that better? Okay.

872
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:36,721
Just try not to breathe so hard,
all right?

873
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:38,128
Long breaths, yeah.

874
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:42,562
Nora. Come on, change places with me.

875
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:44,058
Cradle her head.

876
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,809
- Okay. Okay.
- Just take her head.

877
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:52,862
Oh, God.

878
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,280
We're gonna get
you out of here, okay?

879
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:55,608
- Right, guys?
- Let's do it.

880
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:57,532
All right,
we're gonna get you off, sunni.

881
00:53:57,571 --> 00:53:59,201
- Okay, you got her legs?
- Yeah, yeah.

882
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,779
- I got her shoulders.
- Okay.

883
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,034
Pull straight up, all right?

884
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:03,785
On the count of three. One...

885
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,334
Two...

886
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:06,752
Three.

887
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,081
Pull.

888
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:10,174
Come on!

889
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:18,263
Stop! Stop, stop!

890
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,930
- Okay, okay, okay.
- It's not working.

891
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,799
If we lift her off,
she's gonna bleed out.

892
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:24,556
Okay, okay.

893
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:26,811
Shit!

894
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:28,479
- Okay, let's try again.
- No.

895
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,689
No! She can't take it.

896
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,359
Just give her a second, all right.

897
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:33,567
Oh, God.

898
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:35,776
- Oh, my God.
- What?

899
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:37,067
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus. Jesus.

900
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,530
- Hold her. Hold her, hold her.
- Oh, my God!

901
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,070
- Sunni! I'm trying!
- Hold her! Hold her!

902
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:41,533
- I'm trying!
- Hold her! Hold her still!

903
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:42,703
- I can't, I can't!
- She can't twist!

904
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:44,241
- Hold her!
- I can't!

905
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:47,827
She's gone into...

906
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:49,295
Okay.

907
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:50,957
Oh, God.

908
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:52,576
Sunni?

909
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:53,706
Oh, God.

910
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:55,549
Oh, my God.

911
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,635
Oh, my God.

912
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:00,972
I think I can get her leg off.

913
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:04,549
I think if I just get her leg off,
then we can get her out of here.

914
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:06,006
- Fitzie, that's it.
- Oh, my God.

915
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:07,136
No. No, no, no.

916
00:55:07,683 --> 00:55:09,353
We need to get her off.

917
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:13,098
Oh, my God.

918
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,250
Those creatures can come back
at any minute.

919
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:36,804
We have to go now.

920
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:40,012
Dad?

921
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:41,338
Your neck.

922
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:44,094
Shit, is that...

923
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:46,928
- Like the digger!
- Probably.

924
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:48,472
- Just...
- What?

925
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:51,095
But why has it appeared now?

926
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:53,143
The masks stopped the onset.

927
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:56,187
For some reason,
the progress has been slowed.

928
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:57,361
Why didn't you say anything?

929
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:58,729
What difference does it make?

930
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:01,105
If I'm infected, we all will be.
It doesn't...

931
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:02,575
Sorry.

932
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:07,157
Okay, we got to get out of here
right now.

933
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,121
Well, that's our only choice.

934
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:17,463
You okay, fitzie?

935
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:18,963
- Yeah.
- All right.

936
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:22,385
Those things...
I think they're sphynx cats.

937
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:23,974
Like the statue?

938
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:26,049
The ancient Egyptians
believed that cats, like bastet...

939
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:27,894
Were the guardians
of the underworld.

940
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,060
They could have been placed here
to protect whomever was buried in here.

941
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:32,479
All right, this way.

942
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:37,147
How have they survived all this time
without any food or water?

943
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:38,769
I think they ate each other.

944
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:40,895
Each generation feeding the next.

945
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:42,823
Like rats.

946
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:46,874
Great, so to survive down here,
you have to resort to cannibalism.

947
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:49,027
That would explain the air toxicity.

948
00:56:49,326 --> 00:56:52,786
Okay, I see an opening overhead.

949
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:04,798
Fitzie, bring your camera here,
I need the light.

950
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,930
How can we possibly be back here?

951
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,100
It's a labyrinth.

952
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:17,854
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's just think this through logically.

953
00:57:18,146 --> 00:57:21,776
All right, we can't go that way,
that's a sand trap.

954
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:25,736
And we know that
that's a dead end.

955
00:57:26,238 --> 00:57:29,528
But corporal shadid got in here somehow,
so there has to be a way out.

956
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:31,744
How can we...

957
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,040
Look.

958
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:37,041
Shorty.

959
00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:47,094
You know, this antenna might still be
broadcasting a signal to the outside.

960
00:57:51,096 --> 00:57:52,426
Well, what are you thinking?

961
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:53,812
Hold on one second.

962
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:05,276
I can rewire my camera to it
and we can record a message...

963
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:07,739
And send it
to one of the outside monitors.

964
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:09,449
Well, will that work?

965
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:11,569
It's worth a shot. I mean...

966
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:15,617
I can't guarantee anyone's gonna see it,
but, it'd improve our odds.

967
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:17,248
What's that?

968
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:21,382
- Look.
- Brilliant.

969
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:36,524
Okay, so be quick, doctor.

970
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:39,442
I'm not sure how long
this aerial battery's gonna last.

971
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:43,858
And also, you know,
the cat creatures.

972
00:58:44,525 --> 00:58:47,945
Hopefully someone will bother to play
back these tapes when they find our gear.

973
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:50,736
If they find it.

974
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:55,954
My name is Dr. Miles Holden.

975
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:58,754
And I was a Professor
at Princeton university.

976
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:02,713
I am trapped in the excavation site
with my daughter...

977
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:06,421
Dr. Nora holden, and cameraman
Terry Fitzsimmons.

978
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:09,094
And we need help.

979
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:11,893
Two of our team members,
engineer Michael zahir...

980
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:16,057
And documentary filmmaker
sunni marshe, are dead.

981
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:20,063
This pyramid, unlike any other structure
I've ever encountered...

982
00:59:20,102 --> 00:59:21,982
Seems to have been built
with the express purpose...

983
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,520
Of keeping whatever
is inside from escaping.

984
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:29,065
If you come down here, bring guns.

985
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:34,033
Is that good?

986
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:37,544
Yeah, it was good.
It was really good.

987
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:42,423
Did you feel that?

988
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:44,128
Yeah.

989
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,048
Wow.

990
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:58,136
It's like a vacuum pulling the air out.

991
00:59:58,182 --> 00:59:59,722
What is it?

992
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,190
I think something's back there.

993
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:03,981
I think it's a way out.

994
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:05,401
How do you know that?

995
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:07,323
I don't.

996
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,201
Careful, doc.

997
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,699
Remember the last time
you started touching things.

998
01:00:29,922 --> 01:00:31,092
How did you find that?

999
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,800
I didn't spend my entire life
behind a desk, you know.

1000
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:37,184
Creepy stuff.

1001
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:38,966
Do you think shadid
came this way?

1002
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:40,104
I do.

1003
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,560
This doesn't look like the Egypt stuff
you find at the British museum, eh, guys?

1004
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:46,902
This possibly could be a link
to an older civilization.

1005
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,970
So...

1006
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:17,589
How are you feeling, doc?

1007
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,680
I want to get out of here.

1008
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:21,137
Yeah.

1009
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:22,970
What?

1010
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:24,887
Do you...

1011
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:29,726
I mean, do you feel any sicker or...

1012
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:32,573
You know what? I really haven't
had that much time to think about it.

1013
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:37,992
Man.

1014
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:42,446
So...

1015
01:01:43,954 --> 01:01:46,964
From the shitty room
to the kitty tomb...

1016
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:49,919
That, you know,
also smells like shit.

1017
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:54,258
You think this was built
to be some sort of prison, then, doc?

1018
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:56,628
Well, many temples
in the ancient world...

1019
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:59,255
Were thought to be
the earthly dwelling places of the gods.

1020
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:01,807
Some were benign and giving.

1021
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:06,227
Others, like the gods
the aztecs worshipped, were violent.

1022
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:07,478
They were imprisoned...

1023
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:10,939
And then they were fed a steady diet
of human sacrifice to appease them.

1024
01:02:10,981 --> 01:02:13,111
Thousands were sacrificed.

1025
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,570
As their hearts were cut out...

1026
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:16,490
Their bodies were kicked down
the pyramid steps.

1027
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:20,698
So, what's your point?

1028
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:25,043
Whatever we're dealing with,
it's not benign and giving.

1029
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:39,716
Let's go deeper into this hellhole.

1030
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,850
Make it completely impossible for them
to discover our bodies.

1031
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:51,557
Oh, shit.

1032
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,700
I think we found
the bottom of the pyramid.

1033
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:11,666
Well...

1034
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:14,884
Now we just have to find...

1035
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:19,171
The right escape shaft.

1036
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:33,192
Dad?

1037
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,230
- Dad?
- What?

1038
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:39,647
Jesus.

1039
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:42,914
Well, well, well, well.

1040
01:03:42,948 --> 01:03:45,028
We were not the first ones here.

1041
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:46,075
What happened to him?

1042
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,870
Shit. Shit, look at that.

1043
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,503
- Hey, hey.
- What?

1044
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:58,303
That's a freemason symbol.

1045
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:01,376
They must've built the offshoot tunnel
that we entered.

1046
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:03,550
Yeah, it makes sense.

1047
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:07,065
All right, yeah,
this is all very interesting...

1048
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:10,676
But our main priority
should be getting out of here.

1049
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,810
The masons aren't important.

1050
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:14,441
They were excellent tomb robbers.

1051
01:04:14,479 --> 01:04:16,059
If they couldn't find a way out...

1052
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,940
Shit.

1053
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:21,525
What?

1054
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:23,360
- I can't read this.
- What is that?

1055
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:25,531
Here, give it to me.

1056
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:30,369
Guys, can we drop the history crap
for five minutes, please...

1057
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:31,452
And get out of here?

1058
01:04:31,496 --> 01:04:32,746
Just read it!

1059
01:04:33,582 --> 01:04:34,922
It's a journal.

1060
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,294
Fitzie, I need your light.

1061
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:42,513
"May 21st, 1897.

1062
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:45,889
"The path we took upon our entry
into the pyramid has been blocked.

1063
01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:51,765
"We may have located a means of escape
in the burial chamber."

1064
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:58,652
That's the last entry.

1065
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:04,901
And this looks like
the burial chamber to me.

1066
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:06,994
All right. Well, then...

1067
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:10,245
There might be
a means of escape!

1068
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:13,286
You're right. We have to keep going.
We don't want to end up...

1069
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:20,668
- Dad! Dad!
- Nora! Run!

1070
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:28,263
Nora!
Let's go!

1071
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,524
No!
I have to go back for him!

1072
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,310
- No, we can't!
- I have to go back!

1073
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:38,193
I'm sorry, we've got to go!

1074
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,940
Keep going!

1075
01:05:39,982 --> 01:05:41,482
Oh, my God!

1076
01:05:42,818 --> 01:05:45,028
What? No!

1077
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:47,200
No! No!

1078
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:50,581
Oh, my God.

1079
01:06:03,714 --> 01:06:04,714
I can't...

1080
01:06:07,676 --> 01:06:09,136
He's gone.

1081
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:11,682
He's gone.

1082
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,937
There must be
some sort of latch...

1083
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:19,654
Or mechanism that
your dad found.

1084
01:06:21,273 --> 01:06:22,863
I don't know.

1085
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:27,396
I don't...

1086
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:31,655
You know what?

1087
01:06:32,451 --> 01:06:33,791
Screw it.

1088
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:38,083
I'd rather face him once and for all
than spend the rest of my life running.

1089
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:39,833
Are you out of your mind?

1090
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:42,588
Nora, come on.

1091
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:44,923
Look at all this shit
we've been through!

1092
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:48,046
Someone will find our tapes.

1093
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:50,721
The least I can do is
let people know who killed me.

1094
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:53,564
What is wrong with you?

1095
01:06:53,597 --> 01:06:57,177
My dad just died and all you care about
is getting your shot.

1096
01:06:57,768 --> 01:06:59,938
It's not about the shot, Nora.

1097
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:03,438
I just don't know
what else to do.

1098
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:07,442
Fitzie, please don't leave me.

1099
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:10,105
Fitzie, please...

1100
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:11,914
Fitzie...

1101
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:17,815
Oh, God.

1102
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:19,138
Help!

1103
01:08:19,183 --> 01:08:20,933
He's still alive.

1104
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:45,455
Help... help, help...

1105
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:46,501
No...

1106
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:39,892
Nora.

1107
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:47,616
It's me.

1108
01:10:57,883 --> 01:10:59,473
This isn't real.

1109
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:01,220
No, this can't be happening.

1110
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,467
It's impossible.

1111
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:08,772
It's Anubis, or the devourer.

1112
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:12,733
He took my father's heart
to weigh his soul.

1113
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:17,609
What are you talking about?

1114
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:22,282
Anubis, half man, half jackal.

1115
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:25,494
He ate the hearts of those
he found to be impure.

1116
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:28,200
In the book of the dead...

1117
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:33,247
The last judgment is the final gate
before resurrection or damnation.

1118
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:38,836
If there's a way out,
it's inside that room.

1119
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:42,257
We don't have a choice.

1120
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:45,683
We can either stay
here and die, or we...

1121
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:47,312
Or we can die trying.

1122
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:18,343
Oh, God, it's the soldier.

1123
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:45,995
Come on, Nora.

1124
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:48,663
I'm so sorry, dad.

1125
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:07,715
Come on, Nora.
Grab his flare.

1126
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:24,613
Wait.

1127
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,210
It tells the story of osiris.

1128
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:43,048
Osiris. No, no, no.

1129
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,510
You said Anubis.

1130
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,840
Osiris was his father...

1131
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:47,645
Or his creator.

1132
01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:49,968
It's the same symbol
for both words.

1133
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:53,728
Egyptians believe osiris
came from the heavens...

1134
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:55,017
And brought agriculture
and tool-making...

1135
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:57,060
I get that you find
this stuff fascinating, okay?

1136
01:13:57,104 --> 01:14:01,194
But right now what we should be
working on is how to get out of here.

1137
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:03,233
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

1138
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:04,987
Osiris knew that his time had come
on earth...

1139
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:07,818
So he had this pyramid built
for his journey into the afterlife.

1140
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:09,285
Nora, I promise you, look...

1141
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:11,414
I've got it all down on tape. All right?

1142
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:13,661
You can watch it back
as soon as we're out.

1143
01:14:14,663 --> 01:14:16,623
Anubis turned his
wrath on the people.

1144
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:20,131
He had hundreds
of them sacrificed...

1145
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:22,049
So he could join his father
in the afterlife.

1146
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:25,841
Since his soul was corrupted,
he was looking for a pure one...

1147
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:27,933
A pure heart, if you will.

1148
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:31,097
The only way to enter
the final gate of heaven.

1149
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:34,219
My father was right.

1150
01:14:34,266 --> 01:14:36,306
This pyramid became a prison.

1151
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:39,557
Closed by the Egyptians
to get rid of their own God.

1152
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:43,985
Nora, does this thing give us any clues
on how to get out of here?

1153
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:45,606
It says something
about a star map.

1154
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:47,032
Then you got to find it, okay?

1155
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:50,240
Because your friend Anubis
is gonna be back any minute now!

1156
01:14:51,783 --> 01:14:55,373
The exit shaft points to where the dead
was supposed to be resurrected.

1157
01:14:58,290 --> 01:14:59,370
Well, then...

1158
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,965
There must be at least six shafts
in this room.

1159
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:03,482
How do we know
which is the right one?

1160
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,167
The stars...

1161
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:13,472
Look at the ceiling.

1162
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:15,394
Fitzie, turn off your light.

1163
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:19,439
Look at the ceiling.

1164
01:15:19,478 --> 01:15:21,728
In between the hieroglyphs,
all those dots.

1165
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:23,692
That's the star map!

1166
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:25,692
So what exactly
are we looking for?

1167
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:27,614
The tetrahedron.

1168
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:31,363
The three-sided pyramid is also the
hieroglyphic symbol for the Sirius star.

1169
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:37,792
Look! There it is.

1170
01:15:37,829 --> 01:15:39,499
The brightest one.

1171
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,920
It's right above this shaft.

1172
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,340
It's got to be our way out!

1173
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:46,838
Okay.
Well, let's go check it out.

1174
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:50,182
Okay.
Come on!

1175
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:52,511
It's got to be the one.

1176
01:15:53,136 --> 01:15:54,716
Look!
The rope.

1177
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,363
That's got to be
how the soldier entered.

1178
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:58,847
Thank you, captain Egypt.

1179
01:15:59,268 --> 01:16:01,228
You think that thing
will hold us both?

1180
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,902
I guess we have to see.

1181
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:04,979
Okay.

1182
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:06,073
Okay.

1183
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:07,568
All right, you go first.

1184
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:09,188
Here, take this.

1185
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,112
Just in case.

1186
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:13,411
I'll be right behind you.

1187
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:14,868
Okay, hold that.

1188
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:20,664
Okay.

1189
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:25,711
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1190
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:30,840
Try and get your
leg up on that ledge.

1191
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:54,856
Can't be much further now.

1192
01:16:58,702 --> 01:16:59,832
Shit!
He's back!

1193
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,330
Go, Nora! Go!

1194
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:04,211
Don't look back! Fitzie, keep going!
Don't look down!

1195
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:06,669
Shit, he's back!

1196
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,500
Go, Nora!
Go! Go! Go!

1197
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:09,915
Come on, fitzie, move!

1198
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:11,553
- I'm coming!
- Move! Move!

1199
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:12,720
Go on!

1200
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:14,835
Come on, fitzie!

1201
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:16,645
You can keep going! Come on!
Don't look down!

1202
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:24,101
Climb!

1203
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:28,273
Fitzie!

1204
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:50,882
Help! Help!

1205
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:05,306
No!

1206
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:25,973
Fitzie.

1207
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:28,686
No!

1208
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:13,392
Yeah...

1209
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:32,967
Help me.

1210
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:35,562
Help me.

1211
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:43,903
Help, please...

1212
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:46,651
Please help me.
