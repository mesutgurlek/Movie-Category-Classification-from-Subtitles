00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,077
<i> The strange, almost unbelievable,</i>
<i>story of Robert Scott Carey</i>

2
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,078
<i>began on a very ordinary summer day</i>.

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,195
<i>I know this story better than anyone</i>
<i>because I am Robert Scott Carey</i>.

4
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,349
- This is the way to spend a vacation.
- Mm-hmm.

5
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,790
I'm thirsty.

6
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,560
Mmm! That sun feels good.

7
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,399
- I'm thirsty.
- Interesting.

8
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,558
- A cold bottle of beer'd taste fine.
- Why don't you get it?

9
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,034
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

10
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,358
- I'm on vacation. All week.
- Well, so am I, my friend.

11
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,239
- Louise?
- Hmm?

12
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,591
- I think we should get married.
- We've been married six years.

13
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,994
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,191
Seems like six minutes.

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,233
I am not gonna get you that beer.

16
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,350
I provided the boat.
You provide the beer.

17
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,438
- Your brother provided the boat.
- I'll make you a deal.

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,950
- What?
- You get the beer, I'll get the dinner.

19
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,835
- How's that?
- OK, you got yourself a deal.

20
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,508
To the galley, wench.
Fetch me a flagon of beer.

21
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,156
I'm sorry, Captain, but we're
out of flagons. It'll have to be a can.

22
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,477
Out of flagons?
How are we to make the Philippines?

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,831
We're not going, sir.
We're going home at the end of the week.

24
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,996
Mutiny.

25
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,315
- Make 'em cold!
- Like ice.

26
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,793
- Scott, what was that?
- I don't know. Some kind of mist.

27
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,956
Look at your chest.

28
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,189
<i>But then, on an equally ordinary day,</i>
<i>six months later</i>.

29
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,710
- Morning, Joe.
- Morning, Mrs Carey.

30
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,674
- Looks like a nice day, huh?
- See you tomorrow.

31
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,909
Here, kitty-kitty-kitty.
Here, kitty-kitty-kitty. Come on, Butch.

32
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,749
That's a boy. There you go.

33
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,713
- Scott? Scott, are you dressed yet?
- I'll be right there.

34
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,911
All right.

35
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,271
- Lou?
- Yes, dear?

36
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,948
You sure you got the right
pants from the cleaners?

37
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,276
Just a second.

38
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,871
- You asked that yesterday morning.
- They still don't fit.

39
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,514
- They still too loose?
- The cuffs are draggin'.

40
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,392
They do look kinda big.

41
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,592
I dunno what that cleaner's doing,
but tell him to cut it out.

42
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,236
You're just losing weight.
It's very becoming, so don't complain.

43
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,590
- You want one or two eggs?
- One.

44
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,872
One?
Now that's why your pants don't fit.

45
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,237
- Lou?
- Yeah?

46
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,997
Hey, the shirt doesn't fit either.

47
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,509
It's your shirt.
It's got your monogram on it.

48
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,474
- What's that supposed...
- Eat your breakfast and forget it.

49
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,355
I know a lot of people who'd like to
lose weight. What's your secret?

50
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,430
- Maybe it's the cooking around here.
- Well, thanks a lot. Drink yourjuice.

51
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,471
- Lou, do me a favour.
- What, honey?

52
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,832
- Pick up a bathroom scale today.
- All right.

53
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,270
Still get five foot eleven inches,
Mr Carey.

54
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,313
- I've been six foot one since I was 17.
- Mm-hm.

55
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,638
- What's the weight?
- Still 174 and a quarter pounds.

56
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,356
I don't understand it.
That's a loss of almost ten pounds.

57
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,279
I told you,
you're probably overworking yourself.

58
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,756
You told me that when you overwork
you get nervous and lose weight.

59
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,996
But I've never lost that much weight.

60
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,919
Besides, I haven't been
particularly nervous lately.

61
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,839
Not eating wouldn't
make me lose height, would it?

62
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,998
Oh, I very much doubt if you've
been losing height, Mr Carey.

63
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,395
Why don't you put your things on?

64
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,479
You told me that you've been six
foot one since you were 17 years old.

65
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,999
That's right.

66
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,556
How many physical examinations
have you had since then?

67
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,196
Oh, the draft board, the Navy,
a life insurance physical.

68
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,198
That's not too many.
It's possible there might have been

69
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,868
errors made on all of them
as regards your height.

70
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,197
It often happens. A number of things
could cause such errors.

71
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,916
If you stood erect, you'd measure out
as taller than you actually are.

72
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,669
Or if your height was taken in the
morning, you'd measure out as taller.

73
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,074
Why's that?

74
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,033
Because people decrease in height
during the day.

75
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,030
See, the body weight compresses the
spinal discs, the bone joints and so on.

76
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,758
- I see. Two inches, Doctor?
- I wouldn't worry about it, Mr Carey.

77
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,349
As far as I can see
you're in perfect health.

78
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,155
Likely lost a little weight
due to an insufficient diet but...

79
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,912
People don't get shorter, Mr Carey.
They just don't get shorter.

80
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,315
What'd Charlie think about
your idea for the ad?

81
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,672
Huh? Oh, he thinks it has possibilities.

82
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,154
- Well?
- Four pounds.

83
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,032
- Up or down?
- Down.

84
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,391
That does it, my boy.
You're gonna start taking vitamins.

85
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,034
I'm gonna get you so fat
on ice cream and cake

86
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,834
you'll think you're
living in a child's paradise.

87
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,237
- I don't think that's gonna fix it.
- Then we'll see a doctor.

88
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,558
- You're due for a checkup anyway.
- I've already seen a doctor.

89
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,830
- When?
- A week ago.

90
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,952
Well, honey,
why didn't you say something about it?

91
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,756
Come here, Louise.

92
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,513
- Kiss me.
- You think that's gonna fix it, huh?

93
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,550
You didn't have to stretch.
You used to stand on your toes.

94
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,512
What? In your stocking feet?

95
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,428
- I'm getting smaller, Lou. Every day.
- Well, that's silly, honey.

96
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,471
People just don't get smaller.

97
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,156
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

98
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,875
We'll go back to the doctor tomorrow.
I'm sure he's got a pill for it.

99
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,754
Don't worry, Butch. Everything's
gonna be all right. Go to bed.

100
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,630
Well, that's the last of them, Mr Carey.

101
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,277
- This has been a long week, Dr Bramson.
- I must have worn out your machine.

102
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,597
I needed two full sets of pictures
spaced several days apart.

103
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,271
I had to compare them before I...
Before I could be sure.

104
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,516
Sure of what, Doctor? What is it?

105
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,032
Relax, Doctor, you can't tell me
anything I haven't imagined.

106
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,592
You are getting smaller.

107
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,588
I... I don't profess to understand it,
Mr Carey.

108
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,395
There's no medical precedent
for what's happening to you.

109
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,273
I simply know that
you're getting smaller.

110
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,075
The X-rays prove it beyond any doubt.

111
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,430
But that's impossible.

112
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,428
That's what we've always believed,
Mrs Carey.

113
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,794
I'm gonna send you to the
California Medical Research Institute.

114
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,039
If there is an explanation
for your phenomenon, why...

115
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,800
They'll find it.

116
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,152
<i>Then began a series of intensive tests</i>.

117
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,798
<i>I drank a barium solution,</i>
<i>and stood behind a fluoroscope screen</i>.

118
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,514
<i>They gave me radioactive iodine</i>.

119
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,032
<i>And an examination</i>
<i>with a Geiger counter</i>.

120
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,353
<i>I had electrodes fastened to my head</i>.

121
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,111
<i>Water restriction tests, protein bond</i>
<i>tests, eye tests, blood cultures,</i>

122
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,108
<i>X- rays and more X-rays</i>.
<i>Tests, endless tests</i>.

123
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,757
<i>And then one day in the third week</i>
<i>the final examination</i>.

124
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,679
<i>A paper chromatography test</i>.

125
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,076
Now don't be despondent, Mr Carey.

126
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,033
At least we've found out
what is happening to you.

127
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,357
Gradual loss of nitrogen,
calcium, phosphorus.

128
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,836
- This test may tell us why.
- I hope so.

129
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,511
I think the strip should be dry by now.
We should find phospholipid,

130
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,840
amino acids, cholesterol,
creatinine, and protein.

131
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,238
These are the elements
most commonly found on the strip.

132
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,079
Mm-hm.

133
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,559
Wait a minute. This one doesn't belong.

134
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,595
It certainly doesn't belong.
Here, take a look.

135
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,595
Our analysis shows that
it's a rearrangement

136
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,553
of the molecular structure
of the cells in your body.

137
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,435
- You mean like a cancer?
- No.

138
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,792
No, more like an anti-cancer,
causing a diminution of all the organs.

139
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,309
Then you know what's
causing me to get smaller.

140
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,478
We think we do, Mr Carey.
That's why I asked you here.

141
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,717
Now I want you to tell me something.

142
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,549
Have you ever been accidentally exposed
to any kind of germ spray?

143
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,638
In particular, an insecticide,
a great deal of it.

144
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,230
- Insecticide?
- Exactly.

145
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,557
Has there ever been a time
when you were so exposed?

146
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,433
Do you remember that day
I told you about the truck?

147
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,915
Yes, about two months ago.

148
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,395
I was on my way to the store
through an alley.

149
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,434
As I was walking a truck turned in.
It was spraying trees.

150
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,269
- Is that what's causing me to...
- No, that was only the beginning.

151
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,758
You see, something happened to that
insecticide after it was in your system.

152
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,520
Something fantastic and unprecedented.

153
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,756
Something which, in layman's terms,

154
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,396
so affected the insecticide
that from a mildly virulent germ spray

155
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,149
it created deadly chemical
reversal of the growth process.

156
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,716
Have you been exposed to any
radioactivity in the past six months?

157
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,629
Oh, no, of course not. I don't come in
contact with anything like that. I...

158
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,549
Scott, wait a minute.
That day we were on the boat.

159
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,320
- The boat?
- Charlie's boat. Remember?

160
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,351
Well, yes, I remember.

161
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,836
The mist.

162
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,956
That mist!

163
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,990
You want me to drive, honey?

164
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,589
No, I'm all right.

165
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,597
Louise...

166
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,316
I want you to start thinking about us.
Our marriage.

167
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,433
Some awful things might happen.
There's a limit to your obligation.

168
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,029
Oh now, wait a minute.

169
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,869
Look, I love you. Don't you know that?

170
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,868
You love Scott Carey. He has a size
and a shape and a way of thinking.

171
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,358
- All that's changing now.
- Not a darn thing's changed.

172
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,199
When I married you I meant what I said.

173
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,110
And as long as you've got
this wedding ring on, you've got me.

174
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,880
Come on now, let's go home.

175
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,148
The truth is,
I just lost the Bannister account.

176
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,433
You know how big that account was.
Probably 40 per cent of my income.

177
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,633
It's gone now and I just can't afford to
send you your pay cheques any more.

178
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,673
You've done everything
that a brother possibly could do.

179
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,757
Look, I don't like to say this but...

180
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,190
There have been reporters
over at the plant.

181
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,358
Looks like somebody at the
medical centre talked about you.

182
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,314
I told them there was nothing in it,
but one of the reporters stayed behind.

183
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,590
He was from the
American Press Syndicate.

184
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,588
He said they might pay for the story.
If it's true.

185
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,473
Scott, the story's going to
break anyway eventually.

186
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,229
So whether you make them pay or not,
they're going to make the most of it.

187
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,513
- So make them pay.
- No, Charlie.

188
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,995
Well, think about it.

189
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,396
All right. I'll think about it.

190
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,318
<i>But really, was there any choice?</i>

191
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,069
<i>We owed a great deal of money</i>
<i>and I had nojob</i>.

192
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,238
<i>There was no choice. None at all</i>.

193
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,512
<i>And so I became famous</i>.

194
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,029
<i> And still Robert Scott Carey,</i>

195
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,518
<i>known to a nation as The Incredible</i>
<i>Shrinking Man, keeps getting smaller</i>.

196
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,359
<i>How long will this phenomenon continue?</i>

197
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,518
I want to apply for
an unlisted line please.

198
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,757
This is a special case.

199
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,997
My name is Louise Carey, my hus...

200
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,749
Carey. C-A-R-E-Y.

201
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,511
Now look, we've got to have an unlisted
line. That's all there is to it.

202
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,512
I... I talked to you yesterday.

203
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,951
- Has he come out yet?
- How big is he now?

204
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,995
- Have you seen him?
- He's got to come out sometime.

205
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,998
What's the television truck doing here?

206
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,589
<i>We return you now to</i> Magic Melody.

207
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,875
Yes, thank you very much.

208
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,153
Scott? Scott, I've...

209
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,035
- I've cancelled our phone.
- What?

210
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,958
I said, I've cancelled our phone.

211
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,470
They're gonna try to get us
an unlisted line sometime next week.

212
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,752
- What do you mean, they're gonna try?
- They're just gonna try.

213
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,269
A lot of people are
waiting for unlisted lines.

214
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,553
Didn't you tell them who you're married
to? Scott Carey, the shrinking freak?

215
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,637
- Don't.
- Use your influence.

216
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,877
- I'm a big man! I'm famous!
- Please don't.

217
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,390
Those reporters out there.
Why don't you tell them about it?

218
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,558
Give 'em a new angle for their...
for their papers!

219
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,639
Or will I save it for my book?
Yeah, that's what I'll do.

220
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,115
A whole chapter devoted to telephones

221
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,630
and one more joke
for the worid to laugh at!

222
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,230
Scott, people know. They realise.
They're not laughing at you.

223
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,839
- They're not?
- No.

224
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,996
Why not? It's funny, isn't it?

225
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,228
But it is. See how funny I am?
The child that looks like a man.

226
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,035
Go on, laugh, Louise.
Be like everyone else. It's all right.

227
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,870
Well, why can't you look at me?
Look at me!

228
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,471
Don't, Scott.

229
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,150
Will they just let us alone?

230
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,874
Will they just let us alone?

231
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,438
Lou, honey, I'm sorry. I must be losing
my mind, talking to you like this.

232
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,076
No, honey. I'm all right.

233
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,716
- I know what you must be suffering.
- Do you?

234
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,789
Yes, I guess it's been
a nightmare for you too.

235
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,434
Maybe we've forgotten how to hope.

236
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,359
But, Scott, there's so much to hope for.

237
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,996
Any day now the doctors
say they may find the antitoxin.

238
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,718
Sure. Lou, let's get out of this place
before we both go crazy.

239
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,956
Somewhere where nobody can find us.

240
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,438
All right, Scott. I'll...
I'll look for something.

241
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,349
And try... Try not to worry.

242
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,998
No, I'll let the doctors worry.
I'm two days behind on my book.

243
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,389
<i>October 17th</i>.
<i>Height: 36-and-a-half inches</i>.

244
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,591
<i>Weight: 52 pounds</i>.

245
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,429
<i>We haven't been able to find a new house</i>
<i>and there still is no privacy,</i>

246
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,393
<i>no relief,</i>
<i>and no word from the medical centre</i>.

247
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,990
<i>- I fear that what life remains to me</i>...

248
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,995
Hello? Yes, this is Carey.

249
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,198
- Louise!
- Yes, Scott?

250
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,550
The antitoxin, they found it.

251
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,799
Oh, Scott. Are you sure?

252
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,992
Dr Silver wants us down there.
Right away!

253
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,635
There's something you both
must understand.

254
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,628
We're working with unknown factors.
Nothing is guaranteed.

255
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,235
We're 50 per cent sure
this will be effective.

256
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,512
The other 50 per cent,
we'll just have to pray.

257
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,472
How long before we'll know?

258
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,478
Mr Carey will remain here
under observation for a week.

259
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,636
We should have the answer by then.

260
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,308
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

261
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,238
Weight: 52 pounds.

262
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,512
Height: 36-and-a-half inches.

263
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,075
What was last week's reading?

264
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,638
Weight: 52 pounds. Height:
36-and-a-half inches. No change, Doctor.

265
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,513
It's all over, Scott.
You're gonna be all right.

266
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,918
How long will it take, Dr Silver?
To be normal again?

267
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,432
Put on your robe now.
That'll be all, Miss Maltby.

268
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,519
Mr Carey, we seem to have checked the
degenerative process of your disease.

269
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,711
We've won that much.

270
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,674
At this moment the growth capacity of
your body is as limited as any adult's.

271
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,952
Whether or not you grow again
is another question.

272
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,152
To help you,
we face a whole new set of problems.

273
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,239
Then I'll spend the rest of my life...
like this?

274
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,715
Mr Carey, I assure you,
we'll go on working.

275
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,150
Every day we'll push
our knowledge further

276
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,635
until one day we might
have the whole answer.

277
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,990
Thank you, Doctor.

278
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,470

She weighs 840 pounds!

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,151
See Flamo! Flamo, the Fire-eater!

299
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,354
Here is one of the greatest attractions
you'll ever see in your born days!

300
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,553
You will remember these sights
for the rest of your natural life!

301
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,318
Time for the big show.

302
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,796
I would like you to meet a few
of the exhibits here on the platform.

303
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,117
First we have Tiny Tina!

304
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,474
Here she is. 36-and-a-half inches
of feminine pulchritude.

305
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,276
You'll see freaks and curiosities
assembled from every part of the globe!

306
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,439
The most unusual aberrations
assembled under this tent!

307
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,473
Contrived by a tricky Mother Nature!

308
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,114
Here they are in all their glory!

309
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,950
This exhibit is not only entertaining,
it's educating...

310
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,436
Hello.

311
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,634
- Mind if I sit down?
- No. Please do.

312
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,671
- Don't be late, Clarice.
- I won't.

313
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,632
- Hi.
- Hi.

314
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,549
- Pass me the sugar, huh?
- Oh, sure.

315
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,473
I haven't seen you here before.
You with the carnival?

316
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,114
Oh, no, I... No.

317
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,392
- Just visiting then, huh?
- Yeah.

318
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,553
- I'm Clarice Bruce.
- My name's Scott Carey.

319
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,035
Hi, Scott.

320
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,679
Scott Carey?

321
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,189
I'm sorry,
maybe you don't want any company.

322
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,554
No, don't go.
I want you to stay. Talk to me.

323
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,990
- All right.
- How do you live with it, Miss Bruce?

324
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,033
- What do you do?
- I was born a midget.

325
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,358
It's the way I grew up. And now it's
happened to you and that's different.

326
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,438
Different? That's another
way of saying alone, isn't it?

327
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,790
Oh, but you're not alone now.

328
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,231
Still, it must be hard
to forget the way things were.

329
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,510
Yeah,
I'd like to burn it out of my mind.

330
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,917
Maybe the best way to begin
is to start thinking about the future.

331
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,319
- A future? In a worid of giants?
- I've lived with them all my life.

332
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,274
Oh, Scott, for people like you and me
the worid can be a wonderful place.

333
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,713
The sky is as blue as it is for the
giants. The friends are as warm.

334
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,596
- I wish I could believe that.
- You've got to believe that.

335
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,394
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

336
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,398
Give me time, Clarice. I'll learn.

337
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,310
- Oh! I'll be late for my show!
- Oh, look, can I see you again?

338
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,910
- Mmm. If you like.
- I would.

339
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,669
You know, Scott?
You're taller than I am.

340
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,836
May I?

341
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,872
Thank you.

342
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,077
<i>That night I got a grip on life again</i>.
<i>I went back to work on my book</i>.

343
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,953
<i>It absorbed me completely</i>.

344
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,628
<i>I was telling the worid</i>
<i>of my experience</i>.

345
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,197
<i>And with the telling, it became easier</i>.

346
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,239
- I think it's just fine, Scott.
- Do you really think so?

347
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,352
I'm not much of a writer.
Just tryin' to tell what it's like.

348
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,074
You don't know what it's meant to me,
meeting you.

349
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,238
- Someone who understands.
- But you're so much better now.

350
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,589
Thanks to you.

351
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,917
Aw, not to me. Yourself.
You just stopped running, that's all.

352
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,271
All I know is I can wake up in the
morning and want to live again.

353
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,232
Actually want to live.

354
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,433
It's a funny thing. Sometimes I begin
to think it's the worid that's changed.

355
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,200
- I'm the normal one
- That sounds like a good thing.

356
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,790
Everybody out of step but you and me.

357
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,549
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
We can talk about another chapter.

358
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,519
What is it, Scott?

359
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,349
Two weeks ago I was taller than you.
You said so yourself.

360
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,994
- Yes, I remember, but...
- Well can't you see?

361
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,112
- I'm shorter now.
- Oh, Scott.

362
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,199
It's starting again. It's starting.

363
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,356
It's starting again!

364
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,518
Scott? Scott?

365
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,834
- Scott? Are you in there?
- Do you have to make such a racket?

366
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,750
- I told you what happens in there!
- I'm sorry, Scott. I try to be careful.

367
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,112
- Are you going out?
- Yes, for a little while.

368
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,357
- Where?
- Just to the corner. To the store.

369
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,155
- You'll come right back?
- Well of course I will.

370
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,319
Why don't you try to get some rest?
Dr Silver wants to see you tomorrow.

371
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,230
All right, go ahead.
Be sure the doors are locked!

372
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,240
<i>Every day it was worse</i>.
<i>Every day a little smaller</i>.

373
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,715
<i>And every day I became more tyrannical,</i>

374
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,957
<i>more monstrous</i>
<i>in my domination of Louise</i>.

375
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,152
<i>Heaven knows how</i>
<i>she lived through those weeks</i>.

376
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,192
<i>Only I had the power to release her</i>.

377
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,473
<i>If I could find the courage</i>
<i>to end my wretched existence</i>.

378
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,158
<i>But each day I thought,</i>
<i>"perhaps tomorrow"</i>.

379
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,033
<i>Tomorrow the doctors will save me</i>.

380
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,635
Scott!

381
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,313
No. No. No.

382
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,593
Oh, Scott. Scott.

383
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,351
...drew deafening applause
when he announced that if elected

384
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,189
he will do everything in his power
to reduce taxes.

385
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,918
From Los Ángeles today, a tragic story.
The passing of Robert Scott Carey.

386
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,113
The report of the death of the so-called
Shrinking Man comes from his brother.

387
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,949
Carey's death was the result of an
attack by a common house cat,

388
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,754
a former pet in the Carey home.

389
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,431
He was the victim of the most fantastic
ailment in the annals of medicine.

390
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,599
<i>Thus ends the life of a man</i>
<i>whose courage and will to survive</i>

391
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,918
<i>lasted until the the very end</i>.
<i>A man whose fantastic story</i>

392
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,795
<i>was known to virtually every man,</i>
<i>woman and child in the civilised worid</i>.

393
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,231
- Mr Carey?
- Yes?

394
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,477
- You may go up. She wants to see you.
- Is she all right?

395
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,116
The doctor gave her a heavy sedative
but it's hardly working at all.

396
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,880
- I see.
- I'll get that prescription filled.

397
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,514
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Fine.

398
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,351
<i>My return to consciousness</i>
<i>was a plunge into a new level of pain</i>.

399
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,199
<i>I realised I had fallen into a box</i>.

400
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,791
<i>Its walls enclosed me</i>
<i>like some gigantic pit</i>.

401
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,109
<i>I had to escape out of the box</i>.

402
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,392
<i>Somehow I had to reach Louise,</i>
<i>to survive</i>.

403
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,756
<i>The stairs stretched above me</i>
<i>as far as I could see</i>.

404
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,679
<i>Cliff rising upon cliff</i>.

405
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,075
<i>I knew I could never scale them</i>.

406
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,319
Louise!

407
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,674
Louise! The cellar! Look in the cellar!

408
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,589
Louise! Please look for me! Louise!

409
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,992
<i>Eventually Louise would</i>
<i>come to the cellar</i>.

410
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,191
<i>Until then, I had to keep myself alive</i>

411
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,474
<i>with whatever resources I could discover</i>
<i>in my basement universe. And in myself</i>.

412
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,273
<i>The cellar floor stretched before me</i>
<i>like some vast primeval plain</i>.

413
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,268
<i>Empty of life. Littered with the relics</i>
<i>of a vanished race</i>.

414
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,677
<i>No desert island castaway</i>
<i>ever faced so bleak a prospect</i>.

415
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,034
<i>I had discovered a water supply,</i>
<i>and even a dwelling place</i>.

416
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,392
<i>Now, the search for food</i>.

417
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,989
<i>I knew my ill-fitting clothes</i>
<i>were unsuited</i>

418
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,316
<i>to the exertions that lay before me</i>.

419
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,759
- You can't stay here, Louise. Not now.
- I... I don't know, Charlie.

420
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,793
- I don't know what I wanna do.
- Lou, let me help you.

421
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,036
You can stay with us,
but get out of here.

422
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,438
If I could just be sure.
Charlie, maybe he's hurt someplace.

423
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,438
- Maybe he's lost.
- We've looked everywhere. He's dead.

424
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,189
I'm his own brother. I wouldn't
say a thing like that if I wasn't sure.

425
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,472
- You saw the cat.
- All right, all right.

426
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,038
Charlie, have you thought
how horrible it must have been?

427
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,836
I just keep thinking that he needed me
and I wasn't there.

428
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,712
- I wasn't there.
- Louise.

429
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,151
You've got to get it out of your mind.

430
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,318
I'll never get it out of my mind.

431
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,875
I'll talk to the real estate people.

432
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,197
<i>I never doubted that</i>
<i>sometime Louise would come</i>.

433
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,960
<i>I couldn't allow myself to doubt</i>.

434
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,632
<i>I had only to exist</i>.
<i>To search out enough food to sustain me</i>.

435
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,717
<i>I was driven by hunger</i>.

436
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,957
<i>And also by the horrible thought</i>
<i>that without nourishment,</i>

437
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,355
<i>the shrinking process was quickening</i>.

438
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,273
<i>I was weak and faint</i>.

439
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,519
<i>Yet I knew, in order to exist,</i>
<i>I must eat</i>.

440
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,110
<i>The food was still</i>
<i>a long climb ahead of me</i>.

441
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:35,511
<i>But now, stretching endlessly before me,</i>
<i>I found a deep abyss</i>.

442
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,632
<i>It was only a box and the space between</i>.

443
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,277
<i>Yet to me it was the Grand Canyon</i>
<i>and the Mammoth Caves combined</i>.

444
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,554
<i>Deep, dark, mysterious and dangerous</i>.

445
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,558
<i>There was no possible way to cross,</i>

446
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,550
<i>no matter how inventive,</i>
<i>how resourceful I thought myself</i>.

447
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,437
<i>This time, in sight of my goal,</i>
<i>it seemed as if I must meet defeat</i>.

448
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,353
<i>Suddenly I saw an opportunity,</i>

449
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,518
<i>if I could move the stick</i>
<i>to the other side</i>.

450
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,511
<i>I cursed myself. If only I were</i>
<i>a little bigger. A little stronger</i>.

451
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,152
<i>I realised there was</i>
<i>just this one chance,</i>

452
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,751
<i>and I had no choice, I had to take it</i>.

453
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,351
<i>If I could leap from the paint stick</i>
<i>and reach the other side</i>...

454
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:44,269
<i>But there was no time to think</i>.
<i>Only to act</i>.

455
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,191
<i>My prison</i>.

456
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,350
<i>Almost as far as I could see, a grave,</i>
<i>friendless area of space and time</i>.

457
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,756
<i>And I resolved that as Man had</i>
<i>dominated the worid of the sun,</i>

458
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,918
<i>so I would dominate my worid</i>.

459
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,958
<i>In my hunt for food,</i>
<i>I had become the hunted</i>.

460
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,594
<i>This time I survived</i>.

461
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:03,318
<i>But I was no longer alone</i>
<i>in my universe. I had an enemy</i>.

462
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,274
<i>The most terrifying</i>
<i>ever beheld by human eyes</i>.

463
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,439
Charlie, there's a trunk I'd like to
take with me if you don't mind.

464
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,155
- It's in the basement. I'll show you.
- I'll put these in the car first.

465
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,998
Oh, all right.

466
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,470
Oh no, it's flooded!

467
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,831
The water heater.
I better have a look.

468
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,475
- Oh, this is terrible.
- I'll turn the water off.

469
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,390
Louise! Look for me! Louise! Charlie!

470
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:11,390
Charlie, I'm here! Charlie! Louise!

471
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,115
The water! Here in the water!

472
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,117
Charlie!

473
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,791
I smell gas. Is that pilot off?

474
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,877
I'll turn it off.

475
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,356
Listen to me! Louise!

476
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,394
Louise! Hear me! Please! Please!

477
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,313
- Can you fix it?
- There.

478
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,397
I'll get a plumber down here tomorrow.

479
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,398
Charlie!

480
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,476
- Where's your drain?
- It's there. It must be clogged.

481
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,636
Charlie! Look for me!

482
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,511
- Is that the trunk, Louise?
- Oh, yes, but don't bother about it.

483
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,518
- It's so wet. I'll pick it up later.
- It's OK.

484
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,359
I want you packed
and out of this house tonight.

485
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,830
- Is that everything, Louise?
- Yes, that's everything.

486
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,880
<i>I still had my weapons. With these</i>
<i>bits of metal I was a man again</i>.

487
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,514
<i>If I was to die,</i>
<i>it would not be as a helpless insect</i>

488
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,790
<i>in thejaws of the spider monster</i>.

489
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,756
<i>A strange calm possessed me</i>.

490
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:28,238
<i>I thought more clearly</i>
<i>than I had ever thought before,</i>

491
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,433
<i>as if my mind were</i>
<i>bathed in a brilliant light</i>.

492
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,553
<i>I recognised that</i>
<i>part of my illness was rooted in hunger,</i>

493
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:42,232
<i>and I remembered the food on the shelf</i>.
<i>The cake threaded with spider web</i>.

494
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,033
<i>I no longer felt hatred for the spider</i>.

495
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,791
<i>Like myself, it struggled blindly</i>
<i>for the means to live</i>.

496
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,719
<i>If I was to fight it,</i>
<i>if I was to win the food,</i>

497
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,718
<i>then it must be now</i>
<i>while strength remained,</i>

498
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,117
<i>while I was still of sufficient size</i>
<i>to scale the wall</i>.

499
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,789
<i>It was not decision that</i>
<i>drove me to the crate, but reflex,</i>

500
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,072
<i>as instinctive as the spider's</i>.

501
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,357
<i>My legs trembled</i>.
<i>Not with fear, but weakness</i>.

502
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,678
<i>Yet somehow I felt within myself</i>
<i>a new source of power</i>.

503
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,192
<i>A giant strength,</i>
<i>urging me to the death struggle</i>.

504
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,912
<i>My enemy seemed immortal</i>.

505
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,792
<i>More than a spider, it was</i>
<i>every unknown terror in the worid,</i>

506
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,596
<i>every fear fused into</i>
<i>one hideous night-black horror</i>.

507
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,877
<i>Still, whatever else had happened,</i>
<i>my brain was a man's brain</i>.

508
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,755
<i>My intelligence</i>
<i>still a man's intelligence</i>.

509
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,238
<i>An idea came to me. The scissors</i>.

510
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,956
<i>Too heavy for me to employ as a weapon,</i>
<i>they might have another use</i>.

511
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,435
<i>If I could impale the monster</i>
<i>with my hook,</i>

512
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:52,112
<i>fastened by a line to the scissors,</i>
<i>then push the scissors off the ledge</i>.

513
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,633
<i>Whatever the risk, it was worth a try</i>.

514
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,670
<i>I knew, sooner or later,</i>
<i>it would come charging down that web,</i>

515
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,829
<i>skimming out blackly toward me</i>.
<i>One of us had to die</i>.

516
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,671
Come on down!

517
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,710
Come on, you devil, I'm waiting for you!
Come on!

518
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,079
<i>This was the prize I had won</i>.

519
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,192
<i>I approached it</i>
<i>in an ecstasy of elation</i>.

520
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,910
<i>I had conquered. I lived</i>.

521
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:58,672
<i>But even as I touched the dry,</i>
<i>flaking crumbs of nourishment</i>

522
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,555
<i>it was as if my body</i>
<i>had ceased to exist</i>.

523
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:08,392
<i>There was no hunger. No longer</i>
<i>the terrible fear of shrinking</i>.

524
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,590
<i>Again I had the sensation of instinct</i>.

525
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:27,511
<i>Of each movement, each thought</i>
<i>tuned to some great directing force</i>.

526
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,674
<i>I was continuing to shrink, to become</i>...

527
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,395
<i>What? The infinitesimal?</i>

528
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,035
<i>What was I?</i>

529
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,754
<i>Still a human being?</i>

530
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,350
<i>Or was I the man of the future?</i>

531
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,237
<i>If there were other bursts of radiation,</i>

532
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,592
<i>other clouds drifting</i>
<i>across seas and continents,</i>

533
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:30,316
<i>would other beings follow me</i>
<i>into this vast new worid?</i>

534
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:35,389
<i>So close,</i>
<i>the infinitesimal and the infinite</i>.

535
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:42,351
<i>But suddenly I knew they were really</i>
<i>the two ends of the same concept</i>.

536
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,680
<i>The unbelievably small and the</i>
<i>unbelievably vast eventually meet,</i>

537
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,917
<i>like the closing of a gigantic circle</i>.

538
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,315
<i>I looked up,</i>

539
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,355
<i>as if somehow I would</i>
<i>grasp the heavens, the universe,</i>

540
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:05,588
<i>worids beyond number. God's silver</i>
<i>tapestry spread across the night</i>.

541
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:12,475
<i>And in that moment I knew the</i>
<i>answer to the riddle of the infinite</i>.

542
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:17,071
<i>I had thought in terms of</i>
<i>Man's own limited dimension</i>.

543
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,999
<i>I had presumed upon Nature</i>.

544
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:26,150
<i>That existence begins and ends</i>
<i>is Man's conception, not Nature's</i>.

545
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,277
<i>And I felt my body dwindling,</i>

546
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,758
<i>melting, becoming nothing</i>.

547
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:40,273
<i>My fears melted away</i>
<i>and in their place came acceptance</i>.

548
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,559
<i>All this vast majesty of creation,</i>
<i>it had to mean something</i>.

549
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,672
<i>And then I meant something too</i>.

550
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:54,670
<i>Yes, smaller than the smallest,</i>
<i>I meant something too</i>.

551
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,315
<i>To God, there is no zero</i>.

552
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,476
<i>I still exist</i>.
