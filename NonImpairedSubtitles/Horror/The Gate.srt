1
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,005
Mom? Dad?

2
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,632
Al?

3
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,071
Hello?

4
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,669
Al?

5
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,821
Thunderbolt.

6
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,703
<i>Papa.</i>

7
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,615
<i>Papa.</i>

8
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,837
<i>Papa.</i>

9
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,482
Cut. Yeah, see?

10
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,023
Chain it to the tractor.

11
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,466
Okay. Bring her in.

12
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,232
- That's it.
- Be careful.

13
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,905
That's it.

14
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,511
Yeah, okay, now put those...

15
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,548
Yeah. Secure it over there.

16
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,719
Yeah, the other tree.

17
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,250
That's it. Tighten it up.

18
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,387
Okay. Up, up.

19
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,659
Go.

20
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,257
Whoa, move it.

21
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,535
Back it up, keep it going.
Back her up, that's it.

22
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,324
Hey, Terry,
what's that thing called again?

23
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:10,127
- A geode, a thunder egg.
- I don't think we should be doing this.

24
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,737
Hey, chill out. They'll never know.

25
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,670
- My dad will have a seizure.
- It's your own fault.

26
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,106
You should've called me
before they filled it in.

27
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,610
- Yeah, but...
- There's gotta be more down there.

28
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,147
And you know how much you can get
for a big one? A hundred bucks.

29
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,661
It smells like
something died in there.

30
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,121
- Looks like a cave.
- Wicked.

31
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,823
- Be careful.
- Here.

32
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,463
Jeez.

33
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,765
That's nothing.

34
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,839
What is it?

35
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,341
What the hell was that noise?

36
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,112
I don't think
we should be doing this.

37
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,955
Who cares? We're rich.

38
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,959
Come on.

39
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,802
Al, don't, wait a sec.

40
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,598
You promised I could have these.

41
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,641
I said that three months ago.
They've been sitting in my room.

42
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,038
But, Al...

43
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,611
Quit calling me Al.
My name is Alexandra.

44
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,977
Well, aren't we gonna launch them?

45
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,880
Well, you can do whatever you want.
I've gotta go.

46
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,646
Where? You promised
we could launch them.

47
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,881
I'm going shopping
with Lori and Linda.

48
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,321
The Lee sisters.

49
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,287
Al, wait.
What about the Thunderbolt?

50
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,728
Just forget about the Thunderbolt.
It's gone.

51
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:52,268
What do you need her for, anyway?
I mean, what's the big deal?

52
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,205
Well, ever since
I burnt a hole on the roof...

53
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,970
...my dad says I can't launch
any of my rockets without supervision.

54
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,238
Hey, I'll supervise.

55
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,575
Hey. You guys, wait for me.

56
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,513
Come on.

57
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,281
Get into the car.

58
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,810
- What are those for?
- Live cargo.

59
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,981
Forget it. It got wet in the trash.

60
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,581
Totaled.

61
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,645
How long do you think
they can live without air?

62
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,616
- That's cruel.
- Come on.

63
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,380
It's neat.

64
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,889
Glen.

65
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,899
Glen.

66
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,410
It's just irresponsibility, I don't know.

67
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,914
Is it too late to call
Mrs. Vandegrift?

68
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,917
Oh, Daddy, please.
You can't call a babysitter.

69
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,181
I'm gonna be 16 in two weeks.

70
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,155
You said I was mature enough
to accept the responsibility.

71
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,126
And honestly, I promise,
there won't be any problems.

72
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,856
Well, what do you think, Glen?

73
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,262
- Can you be trusted?
- I don't know.

74
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,461
If your father and I agree...

75
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,402
...to let the two of you stay alone
for three whole days...

76
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,907
...how can we be sure you'll behave?
- It was Terry that started it.

77
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,012
If Terry jumped off a bridge,
I suppose you jump off too.

78
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,738
Sure, why not?

79
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,309
Look, I can take care of Terry
and I can take care of Glen.

80
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,818
And I can take care of this house.

81
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,746
Please?

82
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,487
All right.

83
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,186
But you, young man,
are grounded for the weekend.

84
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,094
And that means that you do not
leave this house until we come back.

85
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,292
Grounded? For real?

86
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,098
For real.

87
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,336
And after dinner, pal,
you fill in that hole.

88
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,937
Okay.

89
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,852
Good night, Glen.

90
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,289
No, leave it on.

91
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,737
Glen, what's with you today?

92
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,696
It's... I don't know.

93
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:46,537
- It's something about that hole.
- What do you mean?

94
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,737
I don't know. It's just weird.

95
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,708
Well, you filled it in, didn't you?

96
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,410
Yeah, but Terry told me something.

97
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,714
What?

98
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,017
Well, he said a long time ago,
when they were building our house...

99
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,127
...a workman got killed.

100
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,729
And the other workmen
didn't wanna tell the police...

101
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,729
...so they sealed him up
in one of our walls.

102
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,293
Look, son...

103
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,129
...let me tell you something
about Terry.

104
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,836
You remember last year,
when Terry's mom died?

105
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,341
Yeah.

106
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,178
Well, ever since then,
Terry's been a little strange.

107
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,886
I think he's kind of angry inside
that his mom is gone.

108
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,385
So you just remember that
when he gets destructive...

109
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,822
...or tries to scare you.

110
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,327
I think he's just a little confused,
that's all.

111
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,529
- You know what I'm saying?
- I think so.

112
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,799
You want me to turn the light on?

113
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,498
- No, it's okay.
- Good night, tiger.

114
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,104
- Dad?
- Yeah?

115
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,782
Never mind. Good night.

116
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,418
Good night, pal.

117
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,840
Don't forget that Angus
gets his pills every day.

118
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,809
Make sure they're hidden in his food,
or he'll spit them out.

119
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,779
- I don't want them on the furniture.
- I know, Mom.

120
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,180
- Goodbye, hon.
- Goodbye.

121
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,654
- Bye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

122
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,457
- Bye, Dad.
- See you, guys.

123
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,321
- Bye. Bye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

124
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,090
And don't forget, the numbers
where we'll be are on the refrigerator.

125
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,996
Al, if you need us for any reason,
don't be afraid to give us a call.

126
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,797
- It's just being responsible.
- I know, Mom.

127
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,736
- Remember, you stay in this weekend.
- Okay.

128
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,376
I want the house clean
when we come home. No parties.

129
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,567
- Okay.
- Okay.

130
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,372
Lori and Linda.

131
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,279
Hey, wow, great party.

132
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,585
I don't know. Here, there.

133
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,531
But you totaled his car.

134
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,238
Hey, how did they get that dog
up here?

135
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,038
Where?

136
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,345
Put me down.

137
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,189
Excuse me.

138
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,238
Hey, blow off, Angus. You stink.

139
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,909
I'd like to smell you when you're 97.

140
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:16,013
- He's not 97.
- In dog years.

141
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,749
It's just not gonna break.

142
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,049
Why don't we get the Lee sisters
to look at it?

143
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,316
Yeah.

144
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,055
No, we can throw it off
the roof tomorrow.

145
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,825
- Come on, let's go party.
- She won't let us.

146
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,026
Sure, she will. Why not?

147
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,831
She's just... Oh, forget it.

148
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,516
Told you. Look at it.

149
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,995
Is it supposed to do that?

150
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,833
I don't know.

151
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,937
Maybe it just got compressed air when
it was being formed or something.

152
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,607
Look, it made some kind of marks.

153
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,249
Those are words. What does it say?

154
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,385
It's weird.

155
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,351
She makes her way
down the dark hallway.

156
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,251
And the scream
keeps getting louder.

157
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,586
And there's also this noise,
like a laugh.

158
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,059
And there's
this weird tearing sound.

159
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,734
So she gets to the door
and then she opens it really slowly.

160
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,174
There, in the rocking chair...

161
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:29,313
...was the decomposed corpse
of her dead father.

162
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,649
And in his lap is the severed head
of her boyfriend.

163
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,585
And he's tearing out hair
by the handful.

164
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,528
- You made that up.
- I believe it.

165
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,493
- Come on, it's bullshit.
- Weird things happen all the time...

166
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,188
...so we make up ghost stories...

167
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,063
...to explain the powers inside us
that we don't understand.

168
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,068
- What kind of powers?
- Like what?

169
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,865
Well, like...

170
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,874
- Well, you guys ever do levitation?
- I've seen that. It's an illusion.

171
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,413
No, it's a matter of concentration.
It really works.

172
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,108
- Here, I'll show you.
- Do you believe in all that stuff?

173
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,747
Me too.

174
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,397
Now, everyone, just clear your mind.

175
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,136
You broke your concentration.

176
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,776
- No, I broke my finger.
- Too much junk food.

177
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,105
It doesn't matter. It's not the weight.

178
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,248
Hey, my man, come here.

179
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,679
- He's too small.
- Hey, Glen, go back to your room.

180
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,877
No, come here. It'll be all right.

181
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,156
- Let's see if we can levitate him.
- It's a cinch, he's a midget.

182
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,796
- Okay, we'll just use two people.
- Sit down.

183
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,363
Brad?

184
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,535
Okay, hold your arms out,
one on top of the other...

185
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,169
...and make little circles...

186
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:03,000
...to transmit
and stimulate the energy.

187
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,308
And everyone else, concentrate.

188
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,313
Now, everyone,
just clear your mind...

189
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,853
...and think of Glen
as light as a feather.

190
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:20,354
Concentrate.

191
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:25,729
Okay, like dust...

192
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,831
...drifting in front of the windows.

193
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:33,528
Like dandelions in the breeze.

194
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,901
Rise. Rise.

195
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,208
- Rise.
- Hey.

196
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,713
Help, come on. Put me down.

197
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,954
- Is he okay?
- It's just an illusion.

198
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,998
Glen.

199
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,532
Maybe I won't do that again.

200
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,471
Glen.

201
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,802
Glen, you all right?

202
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,542
I think it's because he cried
in front of everybody.

203
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:24,554
Hey, Glen, don't be embarrassed.
Crying's nothing.

204
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,883
Remember when Trevor Stubblefield
pantsed me...

205
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,753
...in front of the whole auditorium?

206
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,658
Yeah, and I barfed on Steve Slavitt
after the 12-minute run.

207
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,504
- I wanna call Mom and Dad.
- Glen, no.

208
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,301
- I want you to call them.
- What am I gonna tell them?

209
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,444
"We're scared because we
levitated Glen and he broke the light"?

210
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,171
- You must love Mrs. Vandegrift.
- Al...

211
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,873
Look, Terry can sleep over
and keep you company.

212
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,985
Let's all get some sleep.

213
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,916
I'm gonna lock up.

214
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,359
You really barfed on Steve Slavitt?

215
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,357
Yup.

216
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,272
Terry.

217
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:59,433
I love you.

218
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,973
Mom?

219
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:09,450
- I need you.
- Mommy?

220
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,087
I love you.

221
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,324
Terry, come to me.

222
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:31,067
Terry, I've missed you so.

223
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,985
No. Oh, no.

224
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,821
Oh, no.

225
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,055
Angus.

226
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,632
What's going on?

227
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,233
I'm really sorry.

228
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:06,535
- Yeah, he was really old.
- Yeah.

229
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,434
He was 97.
They don't live much beyond that.

230
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,442
Well, you wanna come over later
and mess around?

231
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,540
Sure, yeah.

232
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,454
Guess I'll see you later, huh?

233
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,782
See you later.

234
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,589
Dad.

235
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,700
Oh, great.

236
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,428
What did you do with Angus?

237
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,330
Hey, don't worry about it.

238
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,033
Aren't you gonna call Mom
and Dad?

239
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,142
No, I'll take care of it.

240
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,505
Well, if you're not going to, I am.

241
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,079
Glen, Mom and Dad
are gonna be home tomorrow.

242
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,342
I don't care.
I want them to know what happened.

243
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,750
You're not calling them.

244
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:49,970
- Nice try.
- Fine. I'll just call them later.

245
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,370
<i>What's the matter?
Isn't Romper Room on today?</i>

246
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,272
Buzz off, clown face.

247
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,413
Don't you have to go
change your Pampers?

248
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,479
Don't you have to go
and join the circus?

249
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,742
Hey, you guys, come on.

250
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:29,206
<i>In a time before the earth,
before the sun...</i>

251
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:35,580
<i>...and before the light of the stars,
when all was darkness and chaos...</i>

252
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:39,553
<i>...the old gods, the forgotten gods...</i>

253
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,693
<i>...ruled the darkness.</i>

254
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:48,127
<i>What was theirs now belongs
to the world of light and substance.</i>

255
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:53,202
<i>And the old gods, the rightful masters,
are jealous...</i>

256
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:57,774
<i>...watching mankind with a hatred
that is as boundless as the stars...</i>

257
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:03,039
<i>...with plans for the destruction
of man that are beyond imagining.</i>

258
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,646
<i>There's a passageway
between our physical world...</i>

259
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,187
<i>...of light and pleasure...</i>

260
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:17,384
<i>...and their spiritual world
of madness and pain.</i>

261
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:21,292
<i>A gate behind which
the demons wait...</i>

262
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:26,129
<i>...for the chance
to take back what is theirs.</i>

263
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:07,108
Eric really likes you.
You gotta come to the beach with us.

264
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,303
- Well...
- And everybody's going.

265
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:12,210
We're having a bonfire
and everything.

266
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,784
I don't know. I mean, I just can't go.

267
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,956
Look, just leave him some Gerbers.
He'll be fine.

268
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,682
Al, you can't go out.
What about Angus?

269
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,622
What about
what happened last night?

270
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,318
You have to call Mom and Dad.

271
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,158
- Glen, cool out.
- What's he talking about?

272
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,162
Tell them.

273
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,294
Angus died last night.

274
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,439
- Tell them about the other stuff.
- There is no other stuff.

275
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,612
What's the matter with you guys?

276
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,974
Something really scary
happened last night.

277
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,050
- What?
- The levitation.

278
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,379
You guys were there.

279
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:52,055
Hey, little man,
that was just an illusion.

280
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,986
What do you know, lover boy?

281
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:57,252
- What is your problem?
- You, Alexandra.

282
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,022
- You're acting like a baby.
- Just shut up.

283
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,329
- Fag.
- Hey.

284
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,895
<i>Très uncool.</i>

285
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,937
Well, what are we waiting for?

286
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,574
- Look...
- You can't back down now.

287
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,073
You have to go.

288
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,475
I have to do something about Angus.
Take him to the animal shelter.

289
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,842
- Eric will do it.
- Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

290
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,679
We'll all go to the mall, get munchies
and stuff, and we'll all meet up there.

291
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,787
Come on.

292
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,386
Don't be too long, Eric.

293
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,652
Yeah, okay.

294
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,397
- See you.
- See you at the mall.

295
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:41,061
Come on, Alexandra, he'll be okay.

296
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,470
Oh, no.

297
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,931
We're in big trouble.

298
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,366
Tell me about it.

299
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,974
How could it come back by itself?

300
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,869
I think I know what this means.

301
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,739
You know, with the levitation
and all that other weird stuff.

302
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,844
What?

303
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,448
You got demons.

304
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,952
- Demons?
- Come on.

305
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,087
Better try to cover it up first.

306
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,192
I'll take this side.

307
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,459
I don't think
this is gonna be enough.

308
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,564
Give me a break.

309
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,337
Slow down.

310
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,398
How do you know so much
about this stuff?

311
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,973
I've got something to show you.

312
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,977
Shit, closed.

313
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,713
Sorry, dude, no vacancies.

314
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,225
They're called Sacrifyx.
Dad brought it from Europe.

315
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,056
And it's got all this stuff in it.

316
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,324
See, these guys are, like,
really serious about demonology.

317
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,832
And it's like they're trying
to warn you.

318
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:37,099
See? These guys knew.
They wrote their own music.

319
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:40,277
<i>They got their lyrics from this thing
called The Dark Book.</i>

320
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,777
That's like the Bible for demons.

321
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,306
And here's the creepy part.

322
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,881
This is their only album.

323
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,213
And after they made it,
they all died in a plane crash.

324
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,979
And look at this, the demon lord.

325
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,818
- Terry, come on.
- Wait a minute.

326
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:59,190
See, the lyrics in the album
tell you how to summon the demons.

327
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,423
Now, there's this certain time
when constellations are aligned...

328
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,124
...when you can open the gate
and let the old gods...

329
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,429
Those are the demons.
- come through.

330
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,868
Well, I checked, and it's, like, now.

331
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,939
- Terry, but...
- What?

332
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,940
Terry, this is a record album.

333
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,909
There are these songs
that tell you about the whole ritual...

334
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,241
...for opening the gate.

335
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,178
We did it.

336
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,885
Here.

337
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,421
Start by reading this aloud.

338
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,716
You know what it means?

339
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,624
"Gods of darkness,
breeders of chaos...

340
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:38,461
...come forth and take possession
of this vile world."

341
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,102
And you need blood.

342
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,602
Remember when you cut yourself?

343
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,472
It's all in here.

344
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,871
The hole.

345
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,945
Okay? The geode.

346
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,476
And look at this.

347
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,779
Levitation.

348
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,480
What's that suppose to prove?

349
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,251
It proves we're in big trouble.

350
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,355
I didn't tell you about
the most important part of the ritual.

351
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,359
The sacrifice.

352
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,000
We didn't kill anybody.

353
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,534
It doesn't have to be a person.

354
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,703
It could be an animal.

355
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,596
Well, then how come
we haven't seen any demons?

356
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,901
I think it's because the sacrifice
wasn't complete.

357
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,376
If we had put the offering in the hole,
we would have blown the gate open.

358
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,880
I think right now, it's, like,
only opened a crack.

359
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,212
They can influence us,
but they can't get through.

360
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,048
It's just...

361
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,224
How can this be true?

362
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,917
Wait, you haven't heard
anything yet.

363
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,994
<i>- Be gone.
- What's this?</i>

364
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:23,935
<i>- Be gone, be gone.
- The album, backwards.</i>

365
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,142
Tells you how to close the gate.

366
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,220
"We consecrate this ground,
this world of light.

367
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,225
We curse the abominations
of darkness.

368
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,398
We block the passage of evil.

369
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,726
May the old devils depart.

370
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:27,062
May they burn in the fires
of their own damnation.

371
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,637
May they freeze
in the infinite cold and darkness...

372
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,637
...of their own hideous creation."

373
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,210
Isn't that kind of insulting?

374
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,243
I guess it's supposed to be.

375
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,415
I mean,
we're trying to get rid of them.

376
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,345
Maybe you should do it
one more time.

377
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,984
All right.

378
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,281
Be gone, be gone, be gone.

379
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,753
Thou art hideous,
filth-eating, unspeakable...

380
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,823
What the hell are you doing?

381
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,827
What's under the door?

382
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,499
Hey, did you guys dig
in that hole again?

383
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,271
We accidentally summoned demons,
who used to rule the universe...

384
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,440
...to come and take over the world.

385
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,876
Yeah, we found out about it
from one of Terry's albums.

386
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,910
Well, they're gone now.

387
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,973
So, what's under the door?

388
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,395
See? They're gone.

389
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,031
It worked.

390
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,565
You guys are weird.

391
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,163
I thought you were going
to the beach today.

392
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,602
I was, but I spent all my money.

393
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,502
On what?

394
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:52,222
What, are you gonna just stand there,
or do you wanna launch it?

395
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,818
- Come on.
- All right.

396
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,302
Listen to this.

397
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:07,698
"Beware, conjurer.

398
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,634
Once set free into our world...

399
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,172
...the power of the old gods
is unimaginable...

400
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:16,403
...as they seek two human sacrifices
to establish their hell on earth.

401
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:20,050
The ruination of mankind
lurks just beyond the gate.

402
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,379
The demons can only be destroyed
and the gate closed once again...

403
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,249
...by a true spirit of gentle passions,
wielding energy...

404
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,254
...derived from pure love and light."

405
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,625
Okay, Houston, ready for liftoff.

406
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:34,797
- Ready?
- Ready.

407
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,232
Ready.

408
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:46,036
Five, four, three, two, one.

409
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,108
Blast off.

410
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,336
Yeah.

411
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,809
All right.

412
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,380
Yeah.

413
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,121
Who's that?

414
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,623
Well, there's one way to find out.

415
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,293
Demons aren't gonna ring
the doorbell.

416
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,496
Worse. Lee sisters.

417
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,074
You are just really lucky
to have us around.

418
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,675
We got you a great new top.

419
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,244
- And I got these new jeans, but I...
- Hey.

420
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,642
I thought you were going
to the beach tonight.

421
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,513
- We're having a slumber party.
- You're not invited. Don't get retarded.

422
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,655
Alexandra, what's your problem?
Eric always...

423
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,486
And we have a surprise for you.
We're gonna streak your hair.

424
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,322
Hey, don't touch that.

425
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,327
I'm just looking at it.

426
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:42,999
Come on, that's my dad's.

427
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,225
Put that down.
He never lets us play with it.

428
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,735
Okay, okay, don't have a cow.

429
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,478
Way to go.

430
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,473
Here.

431
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,454
Thunderbolt.

432
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,749
She didn't throw it out.

433
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,049
Are you guys in bed yet?

434
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,894
Almost. Put it back.

435
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,164
What are you doing?

436
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,996
Probably fagging off.

437
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,298
- What'd you do to your face?
- None of your beeswax, four-eyes.

438
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,168
I think it's a definite improvement.

439
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,934
Hey, eat your feet, dwarf.

440
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,873
Suck my nose till my head caves in.

441
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,104
- Why don't you grow up?
- Drop dead.

442
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,304
- Up yours.
- Piss off.

443
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,643
Why don't you just shut up?

444
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,144
Just go to bed.

445
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,558
Did you ever want a brother or sister
or anything?

446
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,228
Nope.

447
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,057
Man.

448
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,319
Oh, boy.

449
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,234
"Dark master.

450
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,308
Demon of unimaginable size
and power."

451
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,178
Terry?

452
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:28,829
Terry.

453
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,500
Terry.

454
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,301
Are you awake?

455
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:28,346
Al!

456
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,151
Al, they're back!

457
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,294
- The monsters came back!
- What? What is it?

458
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,361
They broke the window.
They're in my room.

459
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,430
What are you talking about?

460
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,338
Oh, my gosh.

461
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,236
Terry?

462
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,577
Hey, Terry, wake up.

463
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,112
Terry?

464
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:03,750
Terry.

465
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,452
What did you do to your hair?

466
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,827
Real cute.

467
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,714
- Al!
- Glen, get over here!

468
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,011
- Help her.
- Help!

469
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,653
Al, Al!

470
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,551
- Pull!
- Get it off of me!

471
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,825
Pull. Pull.

472
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,519
- Come on.
- Come on.

473
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,935
- Go!
- Let's go.

474
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,937
- Run, run, run!
- Hurry, come on!

475
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,839
- Come on!
- Down there, go.

476
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,537
- Where are we going?
- Run.

477
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,847
Somebody tell me what's going on.

478
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,653
Mom. Dad.

479
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,364
You've been bad.

480
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,986
Glen, come on.

481
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,008
What are we gonna do?

482
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,267
Back door.

483
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,440
What are we gonna do?

484
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,416
Oh, shoot.

485
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,054
Hurry up, Al. Hurry up, Al.

486
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,224
Would you guys shut up?

487
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,605
I don't see anything.

488
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,467
- Come on.
- I'm trying.

489
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,278
Let me take a look first.

490
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,514
Good idea.

491
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:20,188
Al, I think you better come back.

492
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,290
Shut up, you guys.

493
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:24,016
Al, come back.

494
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:25,694
What do you want?

495
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:26,988
What is it?

496
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,000
Come on.

497
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,807
- Hurry up, Al, come on!
- Come on, hurry up!

498
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,042
Hurry!

499
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:46,842
Look.

500
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,890
Oh, gross.

501
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:02,760
You okay?

502
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,365
What the hell is going on?

503
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,901
- Can somebody knock her out again?
- I'm calling the police.

504
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,900
Answer it!

505
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,155
Hello?

506
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:39,029
<i>You've been bad.</i>

507
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,575
We have to close the gate.

508
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,646
We have to go to the hole
and do it right.

509
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,942
You guys were serious
about that demon stuff?

510
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,380
What does it look like?

511
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,552
What the hell are you talking about?

512
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,782
The spells, they're in the basement.

513
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,827
Who's gonna go get them?

514
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,857
Are you sure
we can get rid of them?

515
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,934
Yeah, I've got all the spells
and cures to banish the demons.

516
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,660
Demons? What kind?

517
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,771
Don't ask.

518
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,338
How do you know what to do?

519
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,635
Just trust me. I know what I'm doing.

520
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,277
Great.

521
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:29,183
- Al.
- What is it?

522
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,177
Forget it.

523
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,962
Over there.

524
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:52,506
What? Do they hate music?

525
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,180
Great. Now what do we do?

526
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,023
- The Bible.
- What?

527
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,353
Prayers. The Bible.

528
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:12,926
That's what they always use.

529
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,826
These guys are older
than the Bible.

530
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:18,592
Do you have anything better?

531
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,669
How do we know what to read?

532
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:23,862
We'll find something.

533
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,201
Yeah, we went to Sunday school.

534
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,003
We should have called Mom
and Dad before this.

535
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:33,012
- I wish Mrs. Vandegrift was here.
- It's a little too late for that.

536
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,946
- We found one.
- Good.

537
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,354
Okay, let's do it.

538
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,330
The gate's open.

539
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,322
I know it is.

540
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,523
No, it isn't.

541
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,293
How do you know, Terry?

542
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,630
Because we'd all be dead meat
by now.

543
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,636
We'd be the sacrifices.

544
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,138
Sacrifices?

545
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:03,278
I told you, the demons
need two human sacrifices to stay...

546
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,744
...and make their hell on earth.

547
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,075
We don't all have to go.

548
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:12,779
Yeah, maybe it would be better
if we waited inside.

549
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,616
My heroes.

550
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,779
You've got to be kidding.

551
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,018
I hope this works.

552
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,747
Me too.

553
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:57,055
"Deliver me from my enemies,
Father in heaven.

554
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:01,533
Deliver me
from the works of the devil. Quickly.

555
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:05,036
And save me
from the devils of blood.

556
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:24,257
Thou shall bury the evil thing,
brought to the earth no more.

557
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,888
God is the light.
Pray God will pray for thee.

558
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,191
For God is my high tower."

559
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,701
It's working. Hey, that's pretty good.

560
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,537
Hey, it works.

561
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,108
I can still hear them.

562
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,715
There's one more part here,
then they should be gone.

563
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,111
Don't get so close.

564
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:50,650
It's okay, it's working.

565
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,287
- Get back.
- Nobody...

566
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,319
- Terry!
- Terry!

567
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,497
- Terry!
- What are we gonna do?

568
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:02,687
Terry!

569
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,431
- Terry!
- Terry!

570
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,033
- Terry!
- Terry!

571
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,671
Where is he?

572
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,349
Hi.

573
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,093
Terry, answer me!

574
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,831
Terry, answer me!

575
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,701
Help me!

576
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,012
It's not gonna work!

577
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:57,412
Let go.

578
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,313
Help!

579
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,534
Help!

580
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,299
Get me out of here!

581
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,645
Help!

582
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,982
Here he comes.

583
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,209
Get over here.

584
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:37,051
Terry, grab it!

585
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,152
"Deliver me from my enemy."

586
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:44,500
- Stop it!
- "Deliver me from infamy."

587
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,898
- Glen, stop!
- "Save me from the devils of blood."

588
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:53,900
Glen, stop it!
You're making them mad!

589
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,601
Grab my feet. Hurry.

590
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,714
- Pull me.
- Get us out of here!

591
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,814
Got it!

592
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,579
- Come on.
- Pull me up!

593
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,687
Al, pull.

594
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,575
Hurry.

595
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,408
Hurry up.

596
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:38,916
I lost my shoe.

597
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,182
Where's the Bible?
Where's the Bible?

598
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,386
- I don't know what to read.
- Read anything.

599
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:57,336
"In the beginning, God created
the heavens and the earth."

600
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,414
- It's gone.
- It's gone?

601
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,386
- It's gone!
- All right!

602
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:49,785
- It's gone!
- All right!

603
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,551
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

604
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:55,422
All right, all right!

605
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,761
Come on, let's go!

606
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,958
Yeah!

607
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,300
- All right.
- We did it.

608
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,169
Yeah.

609
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,147
Hello?

610
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,380
Wait.

611
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,897
- It's just us.
- What happened?

612
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,429
It worked.

613
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,260
I knew it.

614
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,024
Are you sure?

615
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,830
No, we're all dead.
Welcome to heaven.

616
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,337
What were you guys doing
in there?

617
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,669
We heard noises.

618
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,316
- No.
- What?

619
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,984
Al, what is it?

620
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:41,699
What have you been doing?
Mudwrestling?

621
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:43,303
It's not funny.

622
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:44,700
What are you doing here?

623
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,341
- Came to party.
- Yeah.

624
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,033
Thought we'd surprise you.

625
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,510
Well, look, I've had enough surprises
for one night.

626
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:57,417
- Could you guys just please leave?
- Come on, Al, be real.

627
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,153
Al, we invited them.

628
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,846
- Maybe you should just go with them.
- Fine.

629
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,288
- Come on, let's go.
- We can take a hint.

630
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,621
- What a drag.
- Let's go.

631
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,459
She's just not ready
for me yet, guys.

632
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,228
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

633
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:24,011
Boy. Mom and Dad are gonna
be pissed when they see this.

634
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,977
Yeah. What should we tell them?

635
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,316
- Frisbee.
- Frisbee.

636
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:37,388
It's gonna be dawn soon. Why don't
we all clean up and get some sleep?

637
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,390
Are you kidding?

638
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:41,995
I'm not gonna sleep for a week.

639
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:43,387
Yeah, come on.

640
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,658
- Let's go watch some TV.
- Yeah, okay.

641
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,302
I'm gonna get cleaned up.

642
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,438
- Al?
- Yeah?

643
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,099
You're better
than Mrs. Vandegrift any day.

644
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:02,113
You know, I think it wouldn't be so bad
to have a sister.

645
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,222
<i>No, stop. No.</i>

646
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,662
I wonder if we can still sell it.

647
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:15,524
I don't know.

648
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,825
- Here, catch.
- Glen.

649
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,461
Way to go.

650
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,263
Terry!

651
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,811
It's the Workman.

652
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,019
I just made it up.

653
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:59,035
No, no, no.

654
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,869
Let go of me.

655
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,804
Terry!

656
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,845
Let go!

657
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,679
Help!

658
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,548
No!

659
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:39,078
Help. Help.

660
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,050
Help!

661
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,121
- Let go.
- Glen.

662
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,199
- Let go! Let go!
- Glen!

663
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,599
Glen!

664
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,139
What the hell was that?

665
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:15,640
The Workman. It got Terry.

666
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,177
- The what?
- He just made it up, and it got him.

667
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:19,643
He took him into the wall.

668
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,407
What do you mean?

669
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:25,513
It's their first human sacrifice.

670
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,146
Dad's gun.

671
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,651
It's all my fault.

672
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,520
Dad's gun.

673
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:32,887
- Glen.
- It's all my fault.

674
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,494
Go get Dad's gun.

675
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:35,925
It's all my fault.

676
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,497
Glen.

677
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,692
Glen, go!

678
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,302
Hurry!

679
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,011
- It's me, Glen.
- Help!

680
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,949
Glen?

681
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,980
Hurry!

682
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,821
Come on.

683
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,327
Help!

684
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:16,035
Help! Al, help!

685
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,172
Get him off of me. Get him off.

686
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,041
Al, come on!

687
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:49,663
Close the door.

688
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,807
Hurry!

689
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,107
Hurry!

690
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:58,778
- Where's the gun?
- Over there.

691
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,144
Did Terry say that there was some way
we can kill them?

692
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,789
Energy derived from...

693
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,791
I can't remember.

694
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,259
Shit.

695
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:12,616
Let go! Let me go!

696
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:16,087
Glen, please, help me!

697
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,884
Glen!

698
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,993
The second sacrifice.

699
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:48,322
Love and light.
That's it. The Thunderbolt.

700
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,392
Energy derived from...

701
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,785
Come on. Where is it?

702
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,020
Come on.

703
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:31,903
Please.

704
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,855
Hell on earth.

705
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,767
No!

706
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,030
Come back here!

707
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,901
Take me instead!

708
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:14,939
Come back!

709
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,270
What do you want?
Another sacrifice?

710
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:21,142
Come back! Take me instead.

711
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,977
Come back.

712
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,050
Come back.

713
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:23,636
Glen.

714
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:25,911
Help us.

715
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,117
Glen.

716
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:32,681
Help us.

717
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,556
Come on.

718
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:24,460
Happy birthday, Al!

719
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,897
Yeah!

720
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,009
Angus.

721
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,147
Angus.

722
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:00,649
Good boy.

723
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:08,918
Al.

724
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,859
Glen.

725
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,295
Glen.

726
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,600
Glen.

727
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,842
- Angus.
- Terry.

728
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:29,649
All right.

729
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,071
Think they'll notice?

730
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:54,765
Give me a break.

731
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,645
You're my best buddies.
