PRODUCTION: TOHO EIZO COMPANY, LTD.

00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,636
IN COOPERATION WITH P.S.C.

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,395
HAUSU

5
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,236
It is hot, push the button already!

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,674
Okay!

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,314
What refreshing air!

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,238
Thanks!

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,477
Soon it's summer holidays!

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,190
You're going with your father to your summer house...

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,632
And you're going with everyone else to summercamp, Fanta!

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,033
I want you to come with me!
I'll be bored!

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,595
Nevertheless you'll be by the
side of your beloved Mr. Togo!

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,072
That was mean!
And you're supposed to be my friend!

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,080
Are we going to class!
- Yes.

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,111
Tell me, Fanta...

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,518
Why did you think me
so strange before?

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,118
Because you looked like a
witch from a horror movie.

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,071
You really did!

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,469
Fanta, you Fancy! - That's mean!
You don't get a copy of the photo!

21
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,599
So, did the photos turn out okay?
- Mrs. Teacher!

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,198
Soon it's holidays.
- I'll go with father to Karuizawa!

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,997
Really? Are things good for him? - Yes!
Tomorrow he's back from Italy.

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,829
Good for you!
And you?

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,596
I'm going with Mr. Togo
to his sister.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,709
Ah, how nice.
- Congratulations! - What?

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,510
You're getting married!
- How do you know that?

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,718
From Mr. Togo.
So, what is he like?

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,115
I'm sure he loves you more than anything!

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,312
It's definitely the big love!

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,877
It is an arranged marriage.
Off into the class!

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,554
Yes!

33
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,156
How nice...

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,079
Holidays!

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,879
Wait for me, Fanta!

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,317
I'll give you the copies!
- Great! - Promise!

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,632
Hey, wait!
- Hello!

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,439
Hello!

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,512
Bye-bye.
- Cheerio.

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,592
Oshare!

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,594
Bye-bye!

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,469
Daddy!

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,076
Welcome back!
- Welcome!

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,116
I thought you weren't coming 'til tomorrow!
How's your work on the movie music going?

45
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,189
Leone said it's even better
than Morricone's! - Really?

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,550
You have grown again.

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,396
You too, daddy! - Hey!
- Do i get a souvenir?

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,158
Sit down a while, please.

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,955
What's up?
- Hm...

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,874
Now...

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,754
In one week the holidays start.
- Yes.

52
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,553
Dad!

53
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,111
Don't tell me, we can't
go to Karuizawa!

54
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,674
But of course we're going!
Of course we are.

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,832
What is it then?

56
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,678
Someone's coming with us.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,550
Who? A man? A woman?

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,750
Please come out, my precious.

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,874
Oshare, is it?
Let me look at you!

60
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,512
Pleased.

61
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,710
She's coming with us?
- Yes.

62
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,678
This is Ryoko Ema.

63
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,192
She is gorgeous!

64
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,395
Many thanks! And you are very pretty
when you smile!

65
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,872
Be nice to me, ok?

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,316
Please be nice to her.

67
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,153
Then she will be your new mother.

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,759
My new mother?

69
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,835
Now, I've wanted to tell you
for a long time, but...

70
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,953
She designs jewelry.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,879
Even so she's also a good cook,
she makes everything!

72
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,309
You must not sew on
any more buttons now.

73
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,954
<i>And the sleeves?</i>

74
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,233
How mean of you,
to say "even so"!

75
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,392
<i>Why, there he is, good day!</i>

76
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,279
Please listen to me.

77
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,680
It's been eight years
since your mother died.

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,871
We should start to slowly bring
happiness back in our lives.

79
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,480
I won't in any case
go with you to Karuizawa!

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,915
Hey!

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,439
Wait!

82
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,276
Mummy, i'm here again!

83
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,876
Mummy, daddy can't do that, can he?

84
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,070
When I finished first at the
sportfest, daddy cried.

85
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,993
I want to hurt you, dad.
Because i hate you.

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,594
There we are, all three of us.

87
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,236
Mother in her silk dress...

88
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,877
Mummy...

89
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,798
How are you, auntie?

90
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,030
Let's sit!
- Yes!

91
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,311
How nice! Holidays by the sea,
the six of us, all together!

92
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,833
But Oshare's going to Karuizawa.
I wish she would come with us!

93
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,916
But Fanta! You will get to spend
ten days with Mr. Togo.

94
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,393
Oh yes, Melody! He is so cool
and very good-looking!

95
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,270
You consider him manly?

96
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,759
Wow, Kung Fu, that was cool!
You are a lot manlier!

97
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,517
Keisuke Togo. The name itself is cool.
Isn't it, Gari?

98
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,152
Listen up. Fanta is a
dreamer, and that's just fine!

99
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,591
I am sorry, Fanta.
- Never mind, Sweet!

100
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,831
Mr. Togo is quite pretty, really.

101
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,756
Do you think his sister, who
leads the camp, is a good cook?

102
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,869
Do you want to get even fatter?
- Mean! I'll hit you!

103
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,876
Stop it! We'll all peacefully
train our bodies there!

104
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,317
Well said!
That's the spirit!

105
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,195
Oh, Oshare! - Good morning!
- Is your daddy back?

106
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,838
Oshares dad is the greatest!
Movie composer, rich and...

107
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,959
Shut up.
I hoot at this daddy.

108
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,072
Hi! Good morning!

109
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,478
Teacher!
- We're in a fix!

110
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,634
My sister's baby
is coming too soon!

111
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,758
But teacher!
- And because of that

112
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,516
she can't bring any guests
this summer.

113
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,751
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,188
Does that mean our camp is called off?
- What? - yes.

115
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,596
How mean!
- Be a man!

116
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,515
Yes! Take responsibility!
- Don't be so mean to him!

117
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,831
She's right!
- Typically Fanta!

118
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,109
Don't be so mean!

119
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,994
Look, those are mean flowers.
- What?

120
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
Calm down all.
- What is it?

121
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,909
Are you coming with me?
- Where?

122
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,792
To Karuizawa? - With your father?
- No, to my mother's parents' house.

123
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,478
To my aunt.

124
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,872
<i>And so I simply invited them</i>
<i>to come along to you, auntie.</i>

125
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,876
<i>I'm sorry that i write this letter,</i>
<i>even though we hardly know each other.</i>

126
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,714
<i>Please don't think anything bad of me.</i>

127
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,237
<i>I'm close to tears at the moment.</i>

128
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,109
<i>I want to go back to mother's home districts.</i>

129
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,916
<i>And to let you comfort me</i>
<i>in mummy's place.</i>

130
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,154
<i>Therefore...</i>
<i>Please let us come.</i>

131
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,638
Oh, aren't you cute!

132
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,076
Where did you come from?

133
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,751
<i>Oshare! Oshare! Oshare!</i>

134
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,388
Bye-bye!

135
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,274
Hello!

136
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,230
KOGARASHI

137
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,470
What have you got, Snowflake? Come here.

138
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,676
<i>You are welcome, Oshare!</i>

139
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,916
<i>I have waited so long</i>
<i>for a letter from you.</i>

140
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,788
<i>Please come to me!</i>

141
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,272
<i>Oshare, come to me. Come to me.</i>

142
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,474
And you had to take extra time off.
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,393
It's ok.

144
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,756
Let's go, just the two of us.

145
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,878
Yes, let's.

146
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,477
I have really spoiled her
too much.

147
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,199
Precious...

148
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,708
I have an idea!
- An idea?

149
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,396
I'll go after her,
to her mother's home districts.

150
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,313
I want to speak to you alone.

151
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,432
No hard feelings.

152
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,470
This is my first test
as a mother.

153
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,710
I'll be sure to bring it back.

154
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,877
Your gorgeous...

155
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,876
secretive smile.

156
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,999
Ryoko... i'm relying on you.

157
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,477
And I will think it all over
thoroughly one more time myself.

158
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,828
There, in the country.

159
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,554
Auntie...

160
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,955
Good morning!

161
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,193
It's a good morning!

162
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,112
The bucket is stuck!

163
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,917
Ah, it's already eight!
- Oshare and Mr Togo are late!

164
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,074
Hello? Mr Togo? What's happened?

165
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,069
Fanta's crying!
- We'll miss the train!

166
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,433
The injury is not bad.
But I have to see the doctor first!

167
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,037
What? Only one bus a day?

168
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,630
Then I'll follow you with the buggy!

169
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,399
Mr. Togo will follow
us with the buggy!

170
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,236
But where is Oshare?
- She's probably waiting on the platform.

171
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,873
Bye-bye!
- Have fun!

172
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,474
Oshare!
- Oshare isn't here!

173
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,872
Sure, she is here. - But Kung Fu...
- Maybe she's already on the train?

174
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,713
There she is!

175
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,958
Oh, Oshare!

176
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,000
You're late!
We were worried!

177
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,637
I'm sorry. But Snowflake
had suddenly disappeared!

178
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,237
Snowflake?
- Come already, Mac!

179
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,591
Wait, wait!

180
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,870
Chocolate, candy, biscuits,
love and dreams.

181
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,317
Here, here are our places.
- There? - Here.

182
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,675
Snowflake!

183
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,553
So there you are!

184
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,197
That is Snowflake.
- Isn't he cute!

185
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,555
The train leaves the city
with a white dream on board.

186
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,428
It accelerates,
and in the landscape...

187
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,833
What a beautiful rainbow!
- It's only ten!

188
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,796
And smile! Okay!

189
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,751
You always have an enormous appetite, Mac!
- A good indication!

190
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,119
They don't know the agonies of an
empty stomach! Right, Snowflake?

191
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,993
Did you know that?

192
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,910
Old cats can open doors.
But only ghost cats

193
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,390
can close them again.

194
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,000
What is this place anyway?
- What kind of person is your aunt?

195
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,592
My mother and my aunt
were very close.

196
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,555
When I was six, my mother brought
me along to her family once.

197
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,751
Since then I haven't seen
my aunt.

198
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,433
IN 1941 THE WAR WAS RAVING...
In Japan prevailed

199
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,798
IN 1941 THE WAR WAS RAVING...

200
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,755
The Great War. Ah, that's her house!
My late grandfather was a doctor.

201
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,479
That's my grandmother.

202
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,475
And that is mummy! Pretty, isn't she?
- Her hair resembles yours!

203
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,792
My aunt and her fiance.
- Ah, a cat!

204
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,235
Wow! - He was to take over the practice
after the wedding.

205
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,159
You say "was".
Didn't they marry?

206
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,271
No. The war is to blame. - Tasty!

207
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,957
THE NEXT YEAR
No. The war is to blame. - Tasty!

208
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,318
THE NEXT YEAR

209
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,470
You only think about food!

210
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,798
The draft...

211
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,114
What are they doing?

212
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,155
A promise...

213
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,953
SURELY I'LL COME BACK!

214
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,039
I'LL WAIT.
- How long?

215
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,798
Forever, she means!

216
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,993
How romantic!
- Kiss of Fire!

217
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,393
The men were so masculine in those days!
- Indeed!

218
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,189
But Kung Fu is still cooler!

219
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,311
Why didn't she go along?

220
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,028
With knobs on.
- Right.

221
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,318
It hit him!

222
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,239
He was hit!

223
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,512
AFTER THE WAR...

224
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,436
AFTER THE WAR...
The soldiers returned after the war

225
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,913
The soldiers returned after the war

226
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,116
OH NO!
but not my aunts fiance.

227
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,151
but not my aunts fiance.

228
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,392
She's still waiting for him.
- Ah, how romantic!

229
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,391
How sad.

230
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,589
5 YEARS LATER: PEACE RULES ONCE MORE
How sad.

231
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,116
That is mum's wedding.

232
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,077
All in white, how beautiful!

233
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,317
I will also marry in white!

234
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,194
Do you think you will marry?
- Of course!

235
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,992
How beautiful!
- There she is!

236
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,749
I wonder how auntie is doing?

237
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,996
When my grandmother died,

238
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,228
my aunt stayed all alone
in this enormous house.

239
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,993
She teaches the piano to the girls
in the neighbourhood.

240
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,670
Piano, you say?

241
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,119
Ah, here it is!

242
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,788
SATOYAMA

243
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,835
Where are you going? - I don't know...
- I'm going that way.

244
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,390
Later!
- Later!

245
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,400
Which way?

246
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,198
That way! - Yes, it's probably that way!
- Let's go!

247
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,835
You show us the way, ok?

248
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,154
MELODY
- Fast!

249
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,274
FANTA
- Okay!

250
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,394
GARI
- "So green was my valley!"

251
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,394
SWEET
- I'm afraid!

252
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,479
KUNG FU
- Always cheerful!

253
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,714
MAC
- Appetite: Unbeatable!

254
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,668
OSHARE
- Oshare!

255
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,635
Terrible, isn't it?

256
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,910
It's as if a ghost could appear anytime!
- No way! Ghosts don't exist anyway.

257
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,155
Sweet, you chicken! Leave the ghosts
to me! - Mmh, tasty!

258
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,999
Hello!

259
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,269
A wonderful landscape!
- It's as if we were in another world!

260
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,589
Fanta, don't say those things!
- What about the things you say!

261
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,309
We're lucky! We'll ask for
the way here! - Hello! Good day!

262
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,390
Good day! - Hello!
- Looks tasty! I want those!

263
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,031
No, don't, Mac!
- Ah, help! - What is it?

264
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,791
Just come! Just come, girls!

265
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,395
Ah... where to?

266
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,509
To the manor!
- My auntie lives there.

267
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,956
You...

268
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,793
You are the niece of the lady of the house,
correct?

269
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,272
You look a lot like her,
especially around the eyes!

270
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,790
There it is, the "Hausu".

271
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,794
That?

272
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,998
Let's go!
- Yes! Many thanks!

273
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,595
They don't make them like that
anymore.

274
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,391
The miss has made her decision...

275
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,473
extrordinarily delighted.

276
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,471
Ah, there it is!

277
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,235
Oh, for real!
- Wow, look at that!

278
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,320
A madhouse!

279
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,990
How big it is!
- An amazing house!

280
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,671
Really amazing, isn't it, Melody?
- Yes! - Wow...

281
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,435
What the..?

282
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,832
Hello, good day!
- Hello!

283
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,800
A telegram!
- A patient, doctor!

284
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,073
Sesam, open up!
- But, but, Kung Fu!

285
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,715
Oshare, you vain thing!

286
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,395
Fashion puppy!

287
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,435
Snowflake?

288
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,159
Welcome.

289
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,799
Auntie!

290
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,030
Ah, you're pretty, all seven of you!

291
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,836
Good day!

292
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,828
You have grown!
Your hair looks like your mother's!

293
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,674
How long has it been since we saw each other?

294
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,916
Since grannies funeral...
That's about ten years!

295
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,915
What? So long?
That's a long time ago...

296
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,390
I have waited for you
all this time.

297
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,311
Please forgive me, auntie.

298
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,396
I heard that you teach piano?
- Yes, i did before.

299
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,394
But now i'm alone.

300
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,317
What has happened to your legs?

301
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,151
Don't worry about it. Now,
that you're here, all is fine.

302
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,833
Stop! A photo! - You must also come,
auntie! - So, come.

303
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,275
Okay, Cheese!

304
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,518
Butter! - Margarine!
- Marmelade! - Sexy!

305
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,874
Oh no, how bad!

306
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,430
Oh please,
don't make such a sad face.

307
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,391
When i'm so happy
that you're visiting!

308
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,872
So, please smile again, yes?

309
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,675
Look here!

310
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,753
Oh, that's beautiful!
- A present for you! Tasty, isn't it?

311
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,632
Mac! Could it be... ...that you
simply took it? - Glutton!

312
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,156
I have paid for it!

313
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,194
It's hair looks like yours, Mac!

314
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,110
So, please come in, everybody.

315
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,795
It is so cool! Very refreshing!
- Melody, stop! - What?

316
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,875
The shoes! - Are you taking something off?
- Ah, again typically Melody!

317
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,637
So, dear chandelier,
be so kind and illuminate? us!

318
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,152
...you must not!

319
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,149
Tada!
- Oh!

320
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,592
Great! Kung Fu, you're awesome!

321
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,272
Do you like to play the piano?
- Yes, a lot.

322
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,315
In that room over there
stands a large wing.

323
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,955
Feel free to play it.
- I'd love to!

324
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,195
A cat that eats geckos.
Strange. - I will clean the house!

325
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,155
Das schafft nicht mal
ein Putzteufel wie du. It is too big!

326
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,797
We'll help you.
- Thank you, it's kind of you.

327
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,152
Ah, Melody's playing!

328
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,078
Your wing, auntie!

329
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,271
Ah, a parlour!

330
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,598
Was this the conversation room?

331
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,232
The Music Room!

332
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,314
Melody!

333
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,119
That is auntie's bedroom!

334
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,870
It's beautiful! - Yes!
- It's full of cat pictures!

335
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,872
Miau, miau!

336
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,076
What is that?

337
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,512
Ah, it's just
a skeleton from visual instruction!

338
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,672
This room was the conversation room
for Oshares grandfather.

339
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,871
Please don't scare us like that!

340
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,878
I have made it into a piano
practice room.

341
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,713
?Yes, that's been here a long time...

342
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,157
Back then there were a lot of rich people
here in the village.

343
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,594
Later on I even had pupils
from the city! I was very well liked.

344
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,193
Auntie...
- Yes?

345
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,872
Doesn't anyone come here for
lessons anymore? - No.

346
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,193
Ah, after this fright
I've become very hungry!

347
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,950
I really have to eat something!
- Mac!

348
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,470
That's ok!
But the problem is...

349
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,634
I'm afraid i can't
do any kitchen work.

350
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,918
No problem!
We'll all do it together!

351
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,880
Ah, then I am thankful!

352
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,316
You have been so lonely, auntie!

353
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,070
Yes, I was really lonely.

354
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,277
But because of that a lot of young girls
visit me now!

355
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,312
Lucky you!

356
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,556
We'll distribute the tasks!

357
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,114
Already done!
- That's right! I'll do the cooking.

358
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,791
And i will clean up! Is there a
broom around? - Yes, in there.

359
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,988
Where is the kitchen? We have to
cool down the melons! - I'll show you.

360
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,034
I want to come along.
- Of course!

361
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,071
A big clock...

362
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,912
I wonder where it is?

363
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,716
Mac, here it is!
- Yes!

364
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,269
Wow! What a kitchen!
- Isn't it?

365
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,235
Dear furnace, the girls
will want to warm you now!

366
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,434
What's a furnace?
- A stove.

367
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,114
What is a stove?

368
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,313
A stove is a stove!

369
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,874
I was alone all this time.

370
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,717
Therefore i've started
to entertain myself with all of you.

371
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,877
Ok then... Dear fridge,
may I cool down my melons?

372
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,751
He's not well. What about
the natural fridge?

373
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,594
The well?
- How cool!

374
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,433
It is outside, come!

375
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,229
It is decided.

376
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,673
I am the boss,
until Mr. Togo arrives. - Done!

377
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,837
I'll be in the kitchen a minute! - Don't
break any plates with your karate!

378
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,434
I won't!

379
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,951
Kung Fu, help!

380
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,152
Step aside for a minute.

381
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,479
Wow!

382
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,955
What have you got there?
- It's just a mouse!

383
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,994
How cute!
- Ah, you've got one there too.

384
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,271
I still remember this well
very clearly.

385
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,633
The water will cool down
the melons. - Mmh, tasty!

386
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,873
Hold the second half!
Okay, one...

387
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,714
...two, three!

388
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,274
What if we can't
reach them anymore?

389
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,236
No problems, Mac. In the old days we
always did it like this. - Oh!

390
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,954
What a strange nickname!

391
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,315
She eats a lot, so we call her
Mac, from the english "stomach"!

392
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,557
Oshare, you tattletale!

393
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,840
Mac, you're so pretty chubby,
real tasty! - That is not nice,

394
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,279
Auntie! Soon I'll starve to death
if I don't get supper!

395
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,235
It was just a joke!
Come, let's make supper!

396
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,314
I'll heat up water for the bath!
- You are full of energy.

397
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
Auntie!
- What?

398
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,672
Why are you wearing glasses outside?

399
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,110
I'm afraid of the
strong sunshine.

400
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,515
The fur looks just the same!

401
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,755
Perhaps she came from the picture?
- Pooh! - Fanta, you Fancy!

402
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,836
Not so loud!
Think about auntie!

403
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,676
No worries.
She feels uneasy because of the sun.

404
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,759
But she isn't eating anything!
Surely she's hungry!

405
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,478
One, two...

406
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,475
...three!
- ?Mac, are you going to the bathroom? - No.

407
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,836
The melons? I'm coming!
- Pooh!

408
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,673
Mac!

409
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,919
Ah, thanks!

410
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,878
She is all tousled!

411
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,593
Without glasses you are really
pretty, Gari! - Really?

412
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,228
But

413
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,796
without glasses i can't see!

414
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,668
My condolences!

415
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,236
Let's clear this up fast!
- Yes, then we'll play! - Hide-and-seek!

416
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,989
Mac needs a long time though!

417
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,795
She didn't go until the evening though.
- But...

418
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,718
The well is really close!
- If you worry, go look for her!

419
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,070
She really goes through a lot
of trouble for everyone.

420
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,033
Mac!

421
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,791
Ah, how beautiful!

422
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,551
Where can she be?

423
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,554
Ah, She hasn't taken them out yet.

424
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,716
It really is beautiful!

425
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,595
Fanta...

426
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,829
No! No! No!
- Mmh... tasty!

427
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,718
What's happened? You okay?
- You're completely dirty!

428
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,556
"Love in the mud"?
- Get yourself together! What is the matter?

429
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,952
What has happened?
- Auntie!

430
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,757
She didn't feel well!
- You're making such noise...

431
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,752
The head, the head...

432
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,990
The head, the cut off head!
- Fountainhead, cauliflower head, lettuce head?

433
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,749
The head, the cut off head!

434
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,673
The cut off head?

435
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,559
I... i...
In the well! In the well!

436
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,032
I will go check.

437
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,389
You can walk? - When you
are here, I feel better.

438
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,995
Just leave it to me.

439
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,993
Let's go!
- It happened by the well.

440
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,552
Fanta, are you ok? Get yourself together.

441
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,633
All is fine. You poor thing...

442
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,998
So that's it!
- Such rubbish!

443
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,749
Here's your cut off head!

444
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,798
It is cooled down good!

445
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,191
Fanta pulled all of our legs!

446
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,028
Fanta! Do you still think
those strange things?

447
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,472
Stop it now.
I'm going cleaning.

448
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,873
On the way though was a
sweet potato field. Mac is probably there.

449
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,840
She really likes
roasted sweet potatoes.

450
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,310
Maybe she's playing hide-and-seek?

451
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,551
She's really impossible.
I'll go look for her.

452
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,676
Leave some of the melons!
- A big piece for Mac! - Okay!

453
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,709
Say, Fanta...

454
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,918
I'm all sweaty.
Will you come with me to the bath?

455
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,993
You can't go to the
bath before all the others!

456
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,911
It's ok, auntie!
After all, she's our sponsor!

457
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,989
I'm sorry that i bath before you.
- Is ok. I like to clean.

458
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,555
Oh yes!
- What?

459
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,713
Where are the bed sheets?
- There!

460
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,029
Where do you think Mac went?

461
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,153
Don't worry, she'll be back soon.

462
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,398
She hasn't eaten the melons yet.

463
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,076
Ah, i'm thirsty!

464
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,429
Wherever do you think Mac is?

465
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,312
Oh! Did you open the door?

466
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,199
Where could the sheets be?

467
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,788
Sweet!

468
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,037
Sweet!

469
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,993
Sweet!

470
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,390
...eet! ...eet!

471
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,870
It's nice here in the country.

472
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,630
Is the water warm enough?

473
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,953
Yes, thanks!

474
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,432
But I have to wash my hair.
Could you heat up some more?

475
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,310
Of course, Oshare-sugarpuppy!

476
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,078
So, let's begin!

477
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,033
An illusion?

478
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,789
The cicadas are really loud!

479
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,193
Where did Mac go to?

480
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,193
That can't be!

481
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,757
Must have been my imagination.

482
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,394
Sweet?

483
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,433
Sweet?

484
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,516
Aren't you in a good mood!

485
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,869
When i was little, we once went
out to eat with the whole family.

486
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,272
I feel like
I did on that evening!

487
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,197
Fanta, you don't have
to worry.

488
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,870
You'll soon see Mac again.

489
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,472
Excuse me!
- Okay.

490
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,438
What was that?

491
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,832
Oh no, another one!

492
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,832
Auntie

493
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,195
has climbed into the refridgerator!

494
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,598
That's rubbish!

495
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,637
See?

496
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,153
<i>I was so lonely.</i>

497
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,395
That melody...

498
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,038
<i>Melody!</i>

499
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,273
<i>Melody! Melody...</i>

500
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,708
<i>Melody!</i>

501
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,157
You are welcome, Oshare!

502
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,115
I have waited so long
for a letter

503
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,516
from you.

504
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,118
Please come to me! Oshare,

505
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,516
come to me!

506
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,512
Come to me!

507
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,878
Auntie!

508
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,188
Oh, Snowflake!

509
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,513
Old cats can open doors.
But only ghost cats

510
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,593
can close them again.

511
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,315
No, it can't be!

512
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,479
Melody?

513
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,159
That was Melody!

514
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,832
Quick, let's go!

515
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,959
To the piano room!

516
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,918
That was Sweet!

517
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,995
Sweet!

518
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,153
And away flies the pain!
You have an odd fingerprint!

519
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,878
Why do you make such noise
over this little scratch? - I'm sorry.

520
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,919
But i thought
the wing would bite me.

521
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,833
What? The wing?

522
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,516
You sound like Fanta!
- She does! - Help!

523
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,071
How awful!
- Again!

524
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,397
Sweet is with the bed sheets...

525
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,917
She's sleeping?
- No! Come quickly!

526
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,151
We'll have a look.

527
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,876
Where?
- There!

528
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,193
Sweet!

529
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,313
What's going on here?
- Everything's in a mess!

530
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,432
Sweet?
- Sweet!

531
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,912
Sweet...
- Fanta!

532
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,834
Melody!
- What is it now?

533
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,391
Quickly, go to her!
- No! I don't want to go all alone!

534
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,711
Go now!

535
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,149
Melody?

536
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,235
Melody?

537
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,558
Fanta!

538
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,719
Do you have a sheet of paper?

539
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,432
Oh, here is Sweets apron!
- And her bra!

540
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,478
What is that?

541
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,234
Has she stripped here
all alone?

542
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,796
Sounds fun. What are you doing?

543
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,078
She can't have simply
disappeared, or?

544
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,755
Snowflake! What are you doing here?

545
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,151
The doll is also naked!

546
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,431
Here are her panties!

547
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,235
They stink!
- Indeed!

548
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,750
I saw it!

549
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,513
The mattresses and sheets
threw themselves at her!

550
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,675
That's crazy talk. - She's
surely in bath washing herself!

551
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,236
I'll go look for her there.

552
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,952
Listen to me,
Mac hasn't come back yet.

553
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,155
All of us are probably going
to disappear. What are we going to do?

554
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,912
Don't worry, Fanta. Your beloved
teacher will be here soon.

555
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,788
He's a man.
You can rely on him!

556
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,875
Perhaps he is your
knight on a white horse!

557
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,430
Oh my lovely Princess Fanta!

558
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:28,878
OH, PRINCESS FANTA!
Oh my lovely Princess Fanta!

559
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,238
OH, PRINCESS FANTA!

560
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,793
OH, PRINCESS FANTA!
Help me, help me!

561
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,558
HELP, MR. TEACHER!
My lovely teacher!

562
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,871
I LOVE YOU!
I helped you! I love you!

563
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,199
The And! No, that's wrong: The End!

564
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,430
Really? That is strange!
- Yet I said it!

565
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,116
Just a moment!
Oshare went to the bath!

566
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,870
That's right! She's not here anymore either!

567
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,556
Maybe she needs the time to
make herself beautiful, as always!

568
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,192
Then she's probably
upstairs. Let's go see!

569
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,676
Come, let's go!

570
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,673
Up here!

571
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,311
She's always putting make-up on for hours!
- She's probably upstairs!

572
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,716
How funny!

573
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,675
Oshare!
- Oshare!

574
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,753
Weird, she's not here either!
- Is everyone hiding?

575
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,675
Oshare!
- Is everyone hiding?

576
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,196
What the..? Has she also undressed?

577
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,868
What the?
- Oshare?

578
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,157
Got you!

579
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,714
Oshare!
- O gosh, i nearly died!

580
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,874
No wonder, that Fanta
almost died from fear!

581
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,717
Mr. Togo will be here soon.
We'll have to hold out 'til then!

582
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,639
Mr. Togo?
- Yes, with his old jaloppy!

583
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,394
There she goes, as if he
was an airplane pilot!

584
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,279
Airplane!

585
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,478
Oh, nothing, nothing.

586
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,036
Don't worry! If we call the police
in the village, they'll be here shortly!

587
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,471
Where's the phone book?

588
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,718
Wait. I'll call them.

589
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,229
<i>Help, please help me!</i>
<i>I beg you!</i>

590
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,238
<i>Hello?</i>

591
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,908
<i>Help!</i>

592
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,560
<i>Help!</i>

593
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,631
<i>Help!</i>
<i>- Please, come here!</i>

594
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,275
What's up?

595
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,030
It doesn't work.
It's probably broken.

596
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,279
Where are you going?
- To the police station.

597
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,998
I'll get a policeman to investigate
all this. - You're leaving us here?

598
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,556
In this uncanny house?

599
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,077
Don't fear.
Auntie is still here.

600
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,431
I'll be back soon.

601
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,836
Take me with you!
- We'll go with you.

602
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,676
Don't take a step outside the house,
'til i come back.

603
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,156
Oshare, take me with you!

604
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,308
It won't open! It won't
open! - What shall we do?

605
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,398
Follow me!

606
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,036
Oh no!
- It's closing!

607
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:25,638
<i>Let me carry noble silk</i>

608
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:38,993
<i>and go with you to the dance.</i>

609
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:51,273
<i>My ears are filled</i>
<i>with the sound of singing,</i>

610
00:57:53,240 --> 00:58:03,434
<i>my silver shoes tremble...</i>

611
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,875
Hey, idiot!

612
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,716
Be so kind and go play with your
toy car somewhere else!

613
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,829
I'm sorry!
But there's a jam ahead!

614
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,958
I'm really sorry!

615
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,035
I know that!

616
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,911
I'm afraid!

617
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,073
It's like in a horror flick!
- A really old one.

618
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,431
Step aside.
- Ah, a Karate flick!

619
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,510
Stop that, it's not doing any good.
- Why?

620
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,593
Surely there's a mechanism.

621
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,274
A mechanism?

622
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,393
Auntie lives alone.

623
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,112
So she's set it up so that the doors
close automatically during night.

624
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,872
Do you think she can do that?
- Sure of it. It must be.

625
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,798
I heard a while ago that
she studied music in Tokyo.

626
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,479
So she's educated.
- Educated...

627
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,394
That's it!
- What? - What?

628
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,793
We simply ask her, how to
open the door! - Exactly!

629
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,555
Auntie?

630
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,155
Auntie!
- Auntie?

631
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,598
A human hand!
- What does that mean?

632
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,159
That's Mac's tie!

633
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,191
Could it possibly be...

634
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,675
What do you mean by that?

635
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,672
Oh, nothing, it's nothing.

636
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,956
Melody, give us courage, play something!

637
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,674
No!

638
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,314
I'm afraid!
- Please!

639
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,676
Yes, that's a good idea! - That b
to the g simply strengthens me!

640
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,754
Shouldn't Oshare slowly

641
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,914
be coming back?

642
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,594
Somehow everything happens
as in your fantasy, Fanta.

643
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,874
But... simply too many
unnatural things happen here.

644
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,631
But say, Gari,
what were you thinking a while ago?

645
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,077
Can't tell.

646
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,155
Why?

647
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:09,314
I'm not sure yet. And Fanta
would faint from fear.

648
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,557
Why?
- No.

649
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,472
That's Oshares voice!

650
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,999
It is! When did she come back?

651
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,429
Oshare!
- Shall we look for her?

652
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,799
Let's!

653
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,150
No! I'm staying here. Okay, Melody?

654
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,313
Shall we go?
- Yes.

655
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,319
Oshare!

656
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,677
Melody, turn around! Melody!

657
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,479
Oshare!

658
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,072
Melody, turn around! Melody!

659
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,839
Oshare!

660
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,031
What the? They're gone.

661
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,192
Oh, how indecent!

662
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,550
"Desert, idle days".

663
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,668
Oshare!

664
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,679
Give me the lamp.

665
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,918
That is unscientific. Absurd!

666
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,878
Unnatural and unpleasant!

667
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,759
Strange.

668
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,949
<i>Great! Kung Fu, you're awesome!</i>

669
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,314
Sweet!

670
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,637
Forgive me!

671
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,639
Kung Fu!

672
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,073
It can't be!

673
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,397
I don't believe my eyes!

674
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:48,079
Is something like that even possible?
What are we going to do now?

675
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,480
Look there, legs out of the room!

676
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,199
Fanta!

677
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,232
Melody!

678
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,750
Fanta! Wake up!

679
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,235
Fanta!

680
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,638
Wake up! Fanta!

681
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,669
Wake up! Wake up!

682
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,517
Don't be like that!

683
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,512
Here, drink that!

684
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,710
Melody! Melody!

685
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,669
You were right!
This house is an angry ghost!

686
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,759
What is that? Goldfish! - Fanta!
Oshare herself is now a ghost!

687
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,958
It can't be! No!

688
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,791
You don't have to believe it. But
the three of us must stick together!

689
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,189
That's right. To survive.

690
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,675
Yes.

691
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,872
These noodles are class!

692
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,078
Many thanks! Here you are!

693
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,433
Ah, there they are!

694
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,831
Thanks, that was delicious!

695
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,115
Excuse me.

696
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,028
Perhaps we'll see each other
again sometime!

697
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,311
Live well!

698
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,877
Mr.?
- That's good as hell!

699
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,710
Fast! That way we can protect
ourselves a little!

700
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:29,318
"In the village lives no longer
any single young women.

701
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,515
I am all alone."

702
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:42,311
"But i will always remain
in this house, waiting.

703
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,274
He is surely not dead.

704
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,234
Surely he will be back.

705
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,433
He did promise me."

706
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,189
Strange!
- Fanta!

707
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,400
Oshare? What's happened?

708
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,832
I...

709
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,156
I'm now in auntie's world.
- Auntie's world?

710
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,398
Lips! - Too big! - Auntie
has already been dead for many years.

711
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,237
Many years? And who was
the woman we met today?

712
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,035
She's longing to marry,
and thus lives on after her death.

713
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,711
And when unmarried girls
come here,

714
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,156
she eats them up.

715
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,319
Only then can she
carry her bridal gown.

716
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,795
And now it's your turn.

717
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,077
Nice meal.

718
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,473
We're all going to die!

719
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,918
Away, begone!

720
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,919
Oshare, help us!
We're friends, after all!

721
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:10,192
Impossible!
Oshare is no longer herself!

722
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,236
Oshare!
- Fight!

723
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,395
Dear God, protect us!

724
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,315
What's that? What's that?

725
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,595
I can't allow that!
- Are you going to leave us?

726
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,710
The telephone!
- I'm afraid!

727
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,752
She said before,

728
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,795
it's broken!
- That was a lie! - Wait!

729
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,635
Trust me!

730
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,674
No! No!

731
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,389
I get no air!

732
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,515
Oshare! Miserable ghost! Come here!

733
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,517
Why, here's no house
to be found!

734
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,750
"I will remain here waiting,
with Snowflake in my arms.

735
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,628
In this house."
Snowflake! Snowflake!

736
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,272
Kung Fu!
We have to kill Snowflake!

737
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:46,152
Everybody okay?
- Kung Fu, hold out!

738
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,796
Mac!

739
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,879
Sweet!

740
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,871
Melody!

741
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,991
Kung Fu!

742
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,038
She made it!

743
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,279
The diary!

744
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,991
"Surely he will be back.
He did promise me."

745
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,749
Promise...
"I will wait!"

746
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,229
Gari!

747
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,595
The cat's blood!

748
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,197
"With Snowflake..."

749
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,319
"In this house..."

750
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,915
Mr. Togo! - Who knows, if he'll come.
- He promised!

751
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,675
Did not!
- Did so!

752
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,312
He promised me! - But not auntie!
Not the house!

753
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,990
Not the house.

754
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,517
I'm lucky! Where is it?

755
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,999
The girls were...

756
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,679
eaten.

757
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,915
Eaten!

758
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,110
Tasty!

759
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,796
Do you like melons?
- I hate them!

760
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,952
What do you like?
- Bananas!

761
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,671
Bananas! Bananas!

762
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,508
Nanaba, Nanaba, Nanaba...

763
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:02,839
"Got a letter from Oshare. Finally
girls are coming here again!

764
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,674
Snowflake fetched it."

765
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,912
Snowflake? Snowflake!

766
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,433
I can't see! My glasses!

767
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,994
Gari!

768
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,435
Gari! Gari!

769
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,432
Don't leave me!

770
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,228
Snowflake!

771
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,435
Oshare! Oshare!

772
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:12,315
It's all made up, isn't it?
That you're an angry ghost...

773
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,269
Thank God! Thank God!

774
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,389
Oshare!

775
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,875
Fanta!

776
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,869
Fanta!

777
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,156
Oshare!

778
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,079
It isn't true, is it?

779
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,272
It isn't true, is it?

780
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,998
I'm so tired.

781
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,475
Mum...

782
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:09,038
<i>With one gaze</i>

783
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:16,110
<i>you have bewitched me,</i>

784
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:22,556
<i>in this room,</i>

785
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,829
<i>in which one can see the flush of dawn.</i>

786
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:36,670
<i>The butterflies,</i>

787
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:43,276
<i>which from the darkness</i>

788
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:49,431
<i>into the flowery garden dances,</i>

789
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:56,518
<i>will soon be here.</i>

790
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,200
<i>Don't you want from this day on</i>

791
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:13,634
<i>to stay in my house as my wife?</i>

792
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:19,831
<i>Let us live together in intimate</i>

793
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,710
<i>togetherness!</i>

794
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,032
Pardon, is anyone at home?

795
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,151
<i>Without love</i>

796
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:45,229
<i>the morning never comes.</i>

797
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,638
Pardon!

798
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,396
Is anyone at home?

799
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,957
Pardon, is anyone at home?

800
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,117
<i>When my hand</i>

801
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:27,076
<i>touches your body,</i>

802
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:33,197
<i>the little birds</i>

803
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:38,236
<i>fall asleep.</i>

804
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:47,310
<i>My heart's pendulum...</i>

805
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,111
<i>swings alone...</i>

806
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,118
Good morning.

807
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:59,951
<i>Will you reject</i>

808
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,188
<i>my love?</i>

809
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,752
Oshare!

810
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:17,512
<i>Don't you want from this day on</i>

811
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:23,429
<i>to stay in my house as my wife?</i>

812
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:29,631
<i>Let us live together in intimate</i>

813
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,918
<i>togetherness!</i>

814
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,029
Come.

815
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,671
I'd love to, many thanks.

816
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,873
I'm very happy,

817
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,954
that you come to visit.

818
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:06,030
How are your friends?

819
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,557
Asleep already?

820
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,199
Now...

821
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:26,034
They'll soon wake up.
They're all hungry.

822
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:34,315
One always wakes up,
if one has hunger.

823
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,068
Even when the body decays,

824
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,195
you may always live on
in the heart of another

825
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:15,713
together with the love
of that person.

826
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,712
Therefore the story of love

827
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:27,874
must always be retold.

828
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:34,433
So that the one you love
can live on forever.

829
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,752
Live forever,

830
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,076
the feelings of the beloved,
which never fades,

831
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,475
only one promise...

832
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,633
That is love.
