1
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:06,251
One turtle, crawl, crawl, crawl.

2
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:11,667
Two fish, swim, swim, swim.

3
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:17,334
Three big lobsters, swim swim, swim.

4
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,834
Lobsters don't swim... they jump.

5
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:26,834
Three big lobsters, jump, jump, jump.

6
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,042
Four little girls...

7
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:31,917
...laugh!

8
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,251
I'm going in now.

9
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:38,126
Play on the shore
and don't get too near the water.

10
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:41,209
If you fall in, the Big Lobster will grab you.

11
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:46,042
If he does, I'll eat him.

12
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,209
If you eat the Big Lobster,
then the demon will eat you.

13
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,834
There are no demons here.

14
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,834
Really?

15
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:57,292
Look. What's that in the water?

16
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:18,209
Aha! It's me!

17
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,667
See, I'm fine. I was just joking. Look!

18
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:53,001
Go, Daddy!

19
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,209
Great! Great!

20
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,876
Hurray Daddy! Yay, Daddy!

21
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:32,751
You're so silly.

22
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:38,501
Sheng!

23
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:41,264
What are you doing here? Where's your Dad?

24
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,709
My condolences.

25
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,917
Thank you, your Holiness.

26
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:44,292
Here's a little money
and two ancient salted fish.

27
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:45,751
Please accept them.

28
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:49,251
As a Taoist priest,
my sole purpose is to help the world.

29
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,417
I can't accept such precious things.

30
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:56,459
Hey everyone!
Now that the demon's been caught...

31
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,251
...it's up to you to decide
what to do with it.

32
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:00,251
Kill it!

33
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:01,542
Isn't it dead already?

34
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:03,251
Kill it again!

35
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,126
Revenge!

36
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:04,876
Revenge!

37
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,042
I... want... revenge!

38
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,001
You're all mistaken. That's not the killer.

39
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,834
It's just a stingray.

40
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,501
He's gentle, kind-hearted and cheerful.

41
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:22,501
A fish of good character. Just a bit too big.

42
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:23,584
Who are you?

43
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,584
I am the unshaven Buddhist monk,
Chen Xuan Zang.

44
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,334
I am a demon-hunter.

45
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:32,751
We know about stingrays,
but we've never seen one so big.

46
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,334
The Priest says it's possessed by a demon.

47
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,834
Mayor, look.

48
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,876
That's really not the demon
you're looking for.

49
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,792
A good father was savagely
killed by the demon.

50
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:49,001
How his innocent family suffers.

51
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,126
While you ...you just talk nonsense.

52
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,042
You scumbag!

53
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:57,209
Scumbag! Scumbag! Scumbag!

54
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,209
Everyone, listen to me.

55
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,292
The real demon has not yet appeared.

56
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:01,876
Shut up!

57
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,251
Have you ever lost a husband?

58
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,167
Madam, I don't have a husband.

59
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:15,834
Have you ever lost a husband?

60
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,084
Madam, believe me.

61
00:07:17,126 --> 00:07:18,166
I've never really had a...

62
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:27,251
Kill him!

63
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:29,667
This stingray is innocent!

64
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,042
The demon is still in the river!

65
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,727
Everyone's got to stay out of the water!

66
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,001
That's nonsense!

67
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:35,564
He's clearly working with that demon.

68
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:36,792
String him up! Burn him!

69
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,167
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

70
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,709
Everyone, listen up.

71
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,792
I've already killed the demon.

72
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,959
It's perfectly safe here.

73
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,260
You can go in the water with nothing to fear.

74
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,834
Go!

75
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,084
Go in!

76
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,584
It's fine. It's really safe.

77
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,917
Look, it's safe.

78
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:28,209
It's really safe now.

79
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:31,834
We're safe now.

80
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:25,542
Hey!

81
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,626
Danger! Get out, fast!

82
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:51,334
Hey! Danger! Move!

83
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:54,126
Get out! Danger!

84
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:57,126
Hey!

85
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,376
Danger!

86
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,292
Look over here! Over there!

87
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:17,584
The demon...

88
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,042
Help!

89
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,709
Your Holiness, why did that happen?

90
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,584
We're fine... we're fine.
Once you're on shore, everything's okay.

91
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,167
Yes... everyone stay calm.

92
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,834
Get on shore. We'll be safe here.

93
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:41,084
Sheng, Sheng!

94
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:49,834
Give us back our money!

95
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,417
What are you doing?!

96
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,334
You tricked us!

97
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:55,376
What are you talking about?

98
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:56,584
I caught a demon for you, didn't I?

99
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:57,792
Who knew there was another one?

100
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,251
What do we do now?

101
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,251
Stay calm.

102
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,501
We're so high up... we'll be fine.

103
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:04,084
How high are we?

104
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,126
Very high... look!

105
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,542
Don't move! Stay down, and you'll be fine!

106
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,334
Don't run! Stay down!

107
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,542
Just play dead! Don't run!

108
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:06,542
Sheng!

109
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:08,584
Sheng!

110
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:09,667
Mommy!

111
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:15,001
Sheng, stay still. Don't move.

112
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,167
Mommy!

113
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:21,459
Stay still! Stay where you are!

114
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:23,501
Mommy!

115
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:26,709
Little girl... don't move!

116
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,001
Mommy!

117
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,417
Sheng!

118
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:37,417
Mrs. Gen!

119
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,917
No... Sheng!

120
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:50,209
No!

121
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:55,167
Knife!

122
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:57,542
Knife! Where?

123
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,084
Give me the knife!

124
00:12:59,167 --> 00:12:59,834
Here it is!

125
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:02,959
No!

126
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:07,209
Sheng!

127
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:09,876
Mommy!

128
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,001
Sheng!

129
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,834
It's gonna be okay.
Don't be afraid. Mommy's here, Sheng.

130
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,417
Mrs. Gen!

131
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:50,959
Come out!

132
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:54,251
Mrs. Gen!

133
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:57,376
Come out!

134
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:24,667
Give... give me back my daughter...

135
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:42,001
My baby! My baby!

136
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,376
Please help!

137
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,542
Please save my baby.

138
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:49,751
Please help!

139
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,084
Hey, this robe was very expensive.

140
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,417
Sorry... please help.

141
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,876
Hey, you have to compensate me.

142
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:40,167
Okay... that really, really hurts. Let go!

143
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,292
No.

144
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,126
My baby's back! My baby's come back!

145
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:32,667
Thank you!

146
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,552
You're very welcome.

147
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:37,542
Your Holiness.

148
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,126
Your skills are greater than mine,
your Holiness. Please help.

149
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,792
No I won't. Hands off!

150
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,501
I can't defeat him in the water...

151
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,501
...but if you and I jump down
and bounce him onto shore...

152
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:46,751
Then we can do something.

153
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,626
Hands off or I'll kill you!

154
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:51,042
I swear! I will beat you to death!

155
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:52,292
I'm cold-blooded!

156
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:53,667
Thank you, your Holiness.

157
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,209
Let me!

158
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:25,167
Let me!

159
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,876
Let me!

160
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:54,001
Kill it!

161
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:56,751
Make way! Make way!

162
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:58,501
Calm down!

163
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,147
Everyone listen up. Let me handle it.

164
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,334
I'm a professional demon-hunter.

300 Nursery Rhymes

166
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,167
My child, my child... why are you so bad?

167
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:45,542
Bullying, cheating... how can you do that?

168
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:51,001
Learn to be good... learn to be loving.

169
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:57,126
Love is in your heart...
filling your life with warmth.

170
00:20:57,584 --> 00:21:02,751
Be good, be good and come home soon.

My arms are always ready to embrace you.

172

My child, repent with a sincere heart.

173
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:19,042
You'll always be my dearest child.

174
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:24,584
Be good, be good and come home soon.

175
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:30,251
Study hard for a better future.

176
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:35,459
Turn back and become a filial child again.

177
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:41,834
We were all born pure, like children.

178
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:24,667
You're a demon-hunter too?

179
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:27,501
Based on what?

180
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,080
The Demon Hunter's Handbook.

181
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,251
What Handbook?

182
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:39,501
300 Nursery Rhymes?

183
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:42,459
It brings out the goodness within demons.

184
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,001
We are all born naturally good.

185
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:47,484
And also I add my own unique style...
hope everyone likes it.

186
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:50,126
Says who?

187
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:50,792
My Master.

188
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:51,334
And you believe him?

189
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,292
You might not... but I certainly do.

190
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,751
Actually, I like childish pranks too.

191
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:18,667
Look!

192
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:20,126
She is the real demon-hunter.

193
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,959
Hello, everyone! You're very welcome!

194
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:24,407
Thank you!
Just let me know if you have any trouble again.

195
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:27,751
No need for this. All donations are welcome!

196
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:32,584
All donations are welcome!

197
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:51,792
Master

198
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:57,459
Xuan Zang

199
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:04,917
I failed again, Master.

200
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:06,459
I know.

201
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:09,126
The Water Demon you encountered today...

202
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:10,667
...used to be kind.

203
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,167
One day he was saving a child by the river.

204
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,751
The villagers had mistaken him
for a kidnapper.

205
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:18,501
They killed him and tossed
his body into the river...

206
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:22,417
...feeding his body to the fish and creatures.

207
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,667
He was filled with such hatred and resentment

208
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,792
that his spirit transformed
into the Water Demon.

209
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,792
He returned to seek revenge on the villagers.

210
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,292
A question, Master, if I may?

211
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,334
Is the 300 Nursery Rhymes
really that powerful?

212
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,917
Why do you ask?

213
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:37,709
I just want to destroy the demons,

214
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,292
like the other demon-hunters.

215
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:42,292
Killing is not the best way.

216
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:47,584
Never forget our principles and beliefs.

217
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:50,542
A good man turns into a demon

218
00:24:50,626 --> 00:24:53,084
when his heart is overcome by evil.

219
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:58,626
We must remove the evil
and keep only the goodness.

220
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:04,751
The 300 Nursery Rhymes
wakes up our inner goodness,

221
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:07,167
conquering the evilness in our hearts.

222
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,459
Are you doubting our beliefs?

223
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:11,417
No.

224
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,292
Just my own powers.

225
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,292
But you did your best.

226
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,084
You saved a baby, didn't you?

227
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:20,584
I could have saved more people...

228
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,376
...but I wasn't able to.

229
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:50,042
Master, you didn't see that girl.
She was only 4 or 5.

230
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:54,292
And I just couldn't save her.

231
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:58,126
They're dead because of me.

232
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,084
So many deaths.

233
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:08,667
Master, I'm so useless.

234
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:11,334
Maybe you chose the wrong disciple?

235
00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:14,376
I did not choose the wrong disciple.

236
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:16,417
Absolutely not.

237
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,876
You're just missing that little 'something'.

238
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,209
What's that little 'something'?

239
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,292
Just that little 'something'.

240
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,292
When you attain your enlightenment,

241
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:34,334
you willfully understand and by that time...

242
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:37,834
...you will know the boundless
powers of the Nursery Rhymes.

243
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,042
Go, go.

244
00:26:41,126 --> 00:26:43,126
Master!

245
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:45,251
I know... just keep at it.

246
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:47,084
Master!

247
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:48,709
Just go!

248
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,584
How come there's no one here?

249
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:14,084
Great! We can be alone now.

250
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:19,501
Don't worry, Handsome.

251
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:21,751
Let's not hold back anymore.

252
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:24,001
Calm yourself.

253
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:27,001
I can't... just looking at your gorgeous face.

254
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:28,417
Then stop looking.

255
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:29,876
You're terrible.

256
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:47,251
Welcome, you two! To the Gao Family Inn.

257
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:50,126
This way, please... you came just in time.

258
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,126
It's empty now,

259
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,626
but soon it will be crowded.

260
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,251
Allow me

261
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:59,417
to present our signature dish.

262
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,584
Take a look.

263
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:04,167
This is our famous roast pig... freshly made.

264
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,667
Crispy skin, tender meat,
juicy... yet not greasy.

265
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,501
How do they make such delicious roast pig?

266
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,709
Even the decor here is unique.

267
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:39,417
Look at those gorgeous candelabrum.

268
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:42,542
But not as gorgeous as you, of course.

269
00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:45,834
Must you keep talking about my looks?

270
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,459
Are you so shallow?

271
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,334
What girl doesn't want a handsome boy?

272
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:52,874
Come on... don't be angry.

273
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,251
Come on... let me look at you.

274
00:28:57,542 --> 00:29:00,209
Look until you get so sick of me and die.

275
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,334
Did you get enough?

276
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:07,667
How come you're still alive?

277
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:10,709
What did you think of our roast pig?

278
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,292
It was great! Did you make it?

279
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,626
No, no. The owner KL Hog is our chef.

280
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,792
Presenting the "Master of Meat"

281
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,417
Um... yummy and tasty.

282
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,959
Sir, how did you make the pork so delicious?

283
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:14,042
Hey! She asked you a question.

284
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,751
So rude of you not to answer.

285
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:18,126
Come, let's go!

286
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,876
Sir... please join us.

287
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:24,417
I have so much to say to you.

288
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:34,084
Come on... let's go!

289
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:37,001
Or you won't get to see my gorgeous face.

290
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:40,042
Oh, really? Thank goodness!

291
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:42,834
I was just joking.

292
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,959
Why would I want you to be upset?

293
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,084
Just turn away.

294
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,501
I'm already upset.

295
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:48,834
You're so mean.

296
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:53,251
Sir, do you find me unattractive?

297
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:58,501
Then why won't you talk to me?

298
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:02,709
Please just say something.

299
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,334
I beg you... please talk to me.

300
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:15,417
Welcome to the Gao Family Inn!

301
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,834
You certainly have good taste.

302
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,792
All our guests

303
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:22,834
love our food and décor.

304
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:25,126
Look at our stylish candelabrum.

305
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,626
Doesn't it feel romantic?

306
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,876
From the number of repeat customers...

307
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:34,334
...you can tell how good our food is.

308
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:36,417
Come...

309
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,292
This is our signature dish.

310
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:43,334
Our famous roast pig.

311
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:46,042
It's crispy outside, yet tender inside.

312
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:48,459
It melts in your mouth.

313
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:52,084
I guarantee you'll be back for more.

314
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,084
We're very busy today.

315
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,001
Please wait... I'll find a table for you.

316
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:19,917
Sir.

317
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,209
I have a table for you. This way please.

318
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,542
I'm a demon-hunter.

319
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:26,299
Just reveal yourself.

320
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,792
What do you mean?

321
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:35,251
Oh really?! Go ahead!

322
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:42,709
Okay, you're asking for it.

323
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,709
Miss, can I help?

324
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,626
Yes! How can I help?

325
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:06,084
Get lost.

326
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:06,792
Sure.

327
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,751
Please no more. I'm gonna explode!

328
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:21,084
Can you be more gentle? Thanks.

329
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:39,376
Enough of this!

330
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:40,834
Just come out!

331
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:43,751
Come on!

332
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:46,626
Come on!

333
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:17,876
Come out and help.

334
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:21,084
I've been waiting to help. What should I do?

335
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,917
I've got the demon's essence in his throat.

336
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,417
Now go suck it out quickly.

337
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:25,167
Okay.

338
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:30,757
How do I suck it out?

339
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:32,209
With your mouth.

340
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:33,751
You mean you want me to use my mouth...

341
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,209
...to suck it out?

342
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:36,167
How else?

343
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:39,126
Got it!

344
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:46,022
May I ask... is there another method?

345
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:49,667
Hurry! I can't hold on much longer!

346
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,084
How about I hold him down
and you suck instead?

347
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,584
What do you think?

348
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:02,959
You idiot! Stop fooling around!

349
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:04,917
Or we'll gonna die!

350
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:09,417
Okay, fine. I can do this.

351
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,167
Sorry... I can't.

352
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,084
Run!

353
00:40:23,376 --> 00:40:24,501
He won't come chasing after us, will he?

354
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:26,709
No, he's injured, too.

355
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:31,292
Are you all right?

356
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,334
No big deal... it's nothing.

357
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:36,584
Give me a hand.

358
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:40,471
Demon hunters don't care about formalities.

359
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:41,906
Push this pressure point for me.

360
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:51,709
That Pig Demon was very powerful.

361
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:53,834
Of course.

362
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,761
We could receive the highest bounty for him.

363
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,084
Isn't that what you're here for?

364
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,161
I'm not doing this for money.

365
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,792
I'm doing this to help the people.

366
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:04,626
With skills like yours?

367
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:06,665
You must have a death wish.

368
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:08,459
I don't care.

369
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,001
That weapon of yours is amazing.

370
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:14,251
It's my demon-hunting heirloom...
the Infinite Flying Ring.

371
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:16,542
Infinite Flying Ring.

372
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:18,584
You're wounded.

373
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:19,251
What?

374
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:20,631
Your nose is bleeding.

375
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,327
A little too much excitement.

376
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:29,251
I'm Chen Xuan Zang. What's your name?

377
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,792
My name is Duan.

378
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:35,542
Miss Duan... thank you for saving my life.

379
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:37,709
You're thanking me?

380
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:46,709
Miss Duan, Miss Duan.

381
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:51,084
When a girl closes her eyes,
it means she wants you to kiss her.

382
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:55,751
Stop pretending.
Come on... you know you want to.

383
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:16,126
Xuan Zang. So... how did it go last night?

384
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:17,415
What are you talking about?

385
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:18,667
You were flirting.

386
00:42:18,876 --> 00:42:21,334
What do you mean, Master? That's impossible.

387
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:23,251
How do you feel about romantic love?

388
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:25,167
That's just Lesser Love...

389
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,501
it's got nothing to do with me.

390
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:28,834
I'm in search of Greater Love.

391
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:32,042
Want a bite?

392
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:33,334
No.

393
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:42,042
Master, please don't.
It's against our beliefs.

394
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:47,417
Eating the goose is just a physical act.

395
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,626
You may want something but you say otherwise.

396
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:53,667
That's the little 'something'.

397
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:59,084
How dare you eat my goose leg! Have you paid?!

398
00:42:59,167 --> 00:42:59,807
I have no money.

399
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:00,709
No money?!

400
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:06,876
Stop right there, baldy!

401
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:09,876
Stop running!

402
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:19,084
Master, so you knew
about the Pig Demon all along.

403
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,376
The man's name was KL Hog.

404
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:25,167
He was as ugly as a boar...

405
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,167
...but he was a kind man.

406
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:29,792
He loved his wife dearly,

407
00:43:30,334 --> 00:43:33,626
but she cheated on him with a handsome man.

408
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:36,459
They murdered him with a nine-pronged rake.

409
00:43:36,584 --> 00:43:38,751
When his love turned to hatred,
he became a demon.

410
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:42,251
He swore he would kill all women
lusting after handsome men.

411
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:45,001
How tragic for him.

412
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:46,126
Master,

413
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,084
I'm unable to handle such a strong demon.

414
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,248
Maybe you should take over.

415
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:51,959
Well, sure... but I'm quite busy these days.

416
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:55,376
To defeat such a powerful demon...

417
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:56,376
...you must go

418
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:58,917
find the strongest King among kings.

419
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:01,082
He might teach you
the secrets of conquering demons.

420
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:02,209
Who is he?

421
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:03,376
The Monkey King, who has been imprisoned...

422
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,292
...by Buddha under
Five Fingers Mountain for 500 years.

423
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,584
Monkey King?

424
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:09,334
He's just a legend... no one has ever seen him.

425
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:10,709
He's quite easy to find.

426
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:12,042
At the foot of Five Fingers Mountain...

427
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:13,332
...look for an old temple.

428
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:14,792
In front of it,
you can find a statue of Buddha.

429
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:17,542
...13,000 feet high and 2,560 feet wide.

430
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:18,959
The Monkey King is there.

431
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:19,963
Really? It's that easy?

432
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:23,209
You'd have to be blind...

433
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:24,917
...to miss something 13,000 by 2,560 feet.

434
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,959
There's no time like the present. Get going.

435
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:30,251
Also, that Monkey King...

436
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,917
...is tricky, evil and full of hatred.

437
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,126
Be careful.

438
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:37,084
How do I convince him to help me?

439
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:39,709
Use your knowledge... and this

440
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:48,709
300 Nursery Rhymes

441
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:16,126
We've come here from the West to hunt demons!

442
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:19,376
Any demon-hunters are our enemies.

443
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:21,501
We kill demons and demon-hunters too!

444
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:23,876
No matter how strong you are,

445
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:25,251
you're dead if you meet us.

446
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:27,542
Are you a demon-hunter?

447
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:28,626
I'm not a demon-hunter.

448
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:34,251
But you're out so late at the demon's lair.

449
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:35,709
You still deny it?

450
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:38,334
Are you a demon-hunter?

451
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:43,042
Me?

452
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:43,876
Wait!

453
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:47,459
He's my husband. We just had a fight...

454
00:46:47,751 --> 00:46:50,126
...I ran out and he came to get me.

455
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:53,292
You got it wrong, really!

456
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:55,167
He's only a music teacher.

457
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:56,667
You take out...

458
00:46:57,126 --> 00:46:59,167
...your song book and show her.

459
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:01,917
Hurry!

460
00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:04,417
See?!

461
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:15,001
Fine. Prove you're a couple.

462
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:16,876
Do it right here.

463
00:47:21,334 --> 00:47:23,542
What do you mean?

464
00:47:23,626 --> 00:47:24,792
Do it! Now!

465
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:25,626
Do it?

466
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:27,584
We couldn't possibly

467
00:47:27,626 --> 00:47:29,876
do it here in public.

468
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:31,459
I'd rather die than do it with her.

469
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:34,292
What?! You'd rather die.
You think I want this!

470
00:47:37,251 --> 00:47:38,792
Don't hit her! I'll do it!

471
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:40,709
I'll do it!

472
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:43,334
You can do it.

473
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:45,167
Just look at me.

474
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:48,084
You can do it.

475
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:52,834
You've really gone too far!

476
00:47:53,459 --> 00:47:55,584
We're gonna die...

477
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:02,501
Hurry up or you're next!

478
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:04,251
You're animals!

479
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:07,751
You slaughter the innocent! Beasts!

480
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:09,292
Such beasts!

481
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,584
Fine! Take off your clothes!

482
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:13,042
You're worse than animals!

483
00:48:13,084 --> 00:48:14,001
Come on!

484
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:15,834
Come on! I'll help you... hurry!

485
00:48:36,584 --> 00:48:38,417
Hey, just keep going.

486
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,501
So you're all in this together?

487
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,251
Alright, game's over.

488
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:44,126
Too bad. No fun.

489
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:45,167
Pay up!

490
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:47,209
Did it go well?

491
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:48,876
Go well?!

492
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:53,167
You've ruined it!
Look at how you sprayed the blood!

493
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:55,292
You're still spraying!

494
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:57,917
It's broken... mechanical failure.

495
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:00,084
You're all... useless!

496
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,417
Please don't be angry, Boss!

497
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:06,709
Boss? What's going on?!

498
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:11,876
I had no choice. I'm already yours.

499
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:13,626
What do you mean?

500
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:17,209
Have you forgotten?
You kissed me and felt me up that day...

501
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:18,209
What? He kissed you and felt you up?

502
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:19,167
Shut up!

503
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:24,542
Lady Warrior, I apologize

504
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:25,751
if I have offended you.

505
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,917
I'm just a simple, common demon-hunter.

506
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:30,667
I have... my dream.

507
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:33,042
I only live for the Greater Love.

508
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:34,876
Lesser Love

509
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:35,667
isn't for me...

510
00:49:36,584 --> 00:49:38,664
...but no matter what I say,
you'll never understand.

511
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:42,626
I'm a demon-hunter too. I can understand.

512
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:44,001
That's good.

513
00:49:45,084 --> 00:49:46,584
But my wish is...

514
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:49,489
...to find the man of my dreams.

515
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:51,751
To start a family with him...

516
00:49:52,042 --> 00:49:54,001
...then live a simple life...

517
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:56,376
...and that man is you!

518
00:50:01,209 --> 00:50:02,709
You're crazy!

519
00:50:07,042 --> 00:50:08,792
What shall we do with him, Boss?

520
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:09,917
Take him away!

521
00:50:10,126 --> 00:50:11,959
Let me go!

522
00:50:16,459 --> 00:50:18,917
I need to pee.

523
00:50:20,459 --> 00:50:23,626
Boss, this guy goes around
with a Nursery Rhyme book...

524
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:25,292
...going on about
Greater Love and "Lesser Love".

525
00:50:25,459 --> 00:50:26,584
Clearly, he's an evil guy...

526
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:29,501
...who abducts women and children.

527
00:50:29,584 --> 00:50:31,251
Boss, you must be possessed!

528
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:33,834
Even a sophisticated guy
like me can't seem to attract you.

529
00:50:34,001 --> 00:50:37,501
Seeing you fall
for him really breaks my heart!

530
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:38,709
Which one is your heart?

531
00:50:38,876 --> 00:50:40,209
These two... my nipples!

532
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:42,172
You've made it so obvious to him,
your feelings.

533
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:43,531
This guy doesn't appreciate you.

534
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:45,084
He's so rude.

535
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,001
Not just rude... it's downright inhumane!

536
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:50,126
What do you think, San?

537
00:50:50,376 --> 00:50:51,334
I feel...

538
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:53,126
Can you first remove that get-up please?!

539
00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:55,542
It's broken. I can't get it off.

540
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:56,292
Someone help me.

541
00:50:57,209 --> 00:50:57,917
Stay away!

542
00:50:59,542 --> 00:51:01,542
I feel... when I died just now...

543
00:51:06,626 --> 00:51:07,751
...he seemed to

544
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:10,334
show some empathy.

545
00:51:10,709 --> 00:51:12,542
But when so much blood spurted out...

546
00:51:12,626 --> 00:51:13,709
...and he didn't suspect anything...

547
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:16,459
...that shows his low level of intelligence.

548
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:19,001
Frankly speaking, he's an idiot.

549
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:21,376
So, who's more dumb, you or him?

550
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:26,709
Him, for sure...

551
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:28,584
wright?

552
00:51:40,584 --> 00:51:43,626
Little Sis, was it rude of him

553
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,709
to refuse my advances?

554
00:51:44,792 --> 00:51:46,417
Yes,

555
00:51:46,584 --> 00:51:48,751
but this also shows his positive qualities.

556
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:52,417
He knows what kind of woman he wants.

557
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:55,584
You understand me so well,
unlike those stupid men!

558
00:51:56,542 --> 00:51:59,209
Although he looks weak and vulnerable...

559
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:02,542
...if you like him,
I'll support you all the way.

560
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:06,126
You're wrong... he's braver than any of us.

561
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:08,959
Although he looks like a nobody...

562
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:09,667
...he dares to fight the demons

563
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,292
with just his Nursery Rhymes...

564
00:52:12,792 --> 00:52:14,334
...and not even for fame or fortune!

565
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:16,292
Now that's what
I'd call a true man of courage.

566
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:21,042
I get it... now I understand.

567
00:52:21,126 --> 00:52:23,709
Right? I get it now.

568
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:26,334
But... he doesn't like me.

569
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:28,501
That's not true. I'm sure he likes you.

570
00:52:28,751 --> 00:52:30,334
But you shouldn't act so tough.

571
00:52:30,876 --> 00:52:33,459
You should try to be more feminine.

572
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:34,542
Come on, just try it!

573
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:43,751
Not like that. Why don't you try this?

574
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:46,848
I don't know how.

575
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:49,312
Don't worry...

576
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,376
The Obedience Charm

577
00:52:55,001 --> 00:52:59,501
You'll do exactly what I do!

578
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:01,542
Go!

579
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:12,042
Sorry, I just need to pee.

580
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:14,086
But you won't let me out,
so I have to do it here.

581
00:53:14,709 --> 00:53:15,667
Sis, help me.

582
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:17,251
Back off! You're spraying it on me!

583
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:18,901
Back off! You're spraying it on me!

584
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:21,280
But I haven't started peeing yet.

585
00:53:21,334 --> 00:53:22,209
How could I have sprayed you?

586
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:23,751
Plug it up with a stopper!

587
00:53:24,126 --> 00:53:25,376
Plug it up with a stopper!

588
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:28,417
You're so cruel.

589
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:30,709
There's no need to plug it up.
I can hold it in.

590
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:31,709
But I don't have a stopper!

591
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:32,792
If you won't plug it, I'll rip it out!

592
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:34,834
If you won't plug it, I'll rip it out!

593
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:41,459
Is there any justice in this world?!

594
00:53:41,876 --> 00:53:42,959
Great, yank it out for me!

595
00:53:43,876 --> 00:53:44,834
Cut the crap!

596
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:56,167
Sorry... I didn't mean to...

597
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:01,084
Get lost!

598
00:54:01,126 --> 00:54:02,251
Great, it's finally stopped.

599
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,042
What the hell did you do?!

600
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:07,834
I swear... I'll kill you!

601
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:25,542
You friggin' S.O.B.!

602
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,126
Okay, go for it! Go on... if you dare!

603
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:00,917
Where's my sword?!

604
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:02,626
I'll get it!

605
00:55:10,126 --> 00:55:11,834
I can't take it anymore!

606
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:14,084
Kill him!

607
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:18,167
What's wrong with you?! Stop it!

608
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:25,292
Stop playing tricks on me!

609
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:25,959
Wait!

610
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:28,417
I said, stop playing tricks on me!

611
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:21,373
Prepare the battle chariot!

612
00:56:21,417 --> 00:56:22,459
Ready!

613
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:23,417
Get in!

614
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:26,126
Start up the "Ironblood System"

615
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:31,626
The "Ironblood System"?

616
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,751
The "Ironblood System" uses hammering...

617
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:35,792
...to push air from the air sacs
through the tubes to...

618
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:38,959
...push the propellers and move
the gears to generate power...

619
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,408
...then refills the air sacs
and repeats the procedure...

620
00:56:41,459 --> 00:56:44,042
...that generates inexhaustible
kinetic energy.

621
00:56:46,709 --> 00:56:47,749
Then the chariot can move.

622
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:55,876
Hurry! It's catching up!

623
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:57,584
Full speed ahead!

624
00:57:14,709 --> 00:57:15,309
Fast, isn't it?

625
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:24,772
Can you please be a bit more careful?

626
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,959
What should we do?! The Pig Demon's up ahead!

627
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:42,751
Do I look scared?! Just crash into him!

628
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:53,422
Don't miss me too much.

629
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:27,292
Wake up!

630
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:34,084
Don't scare me... Don't die!

631
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,417
Wake up!

632
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:41,334
Caught you! See how worried you were...

633
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,417
...and you still won't admit you love me?

634
00:58:44,626 --> 00:58:45,751
I knew it!

635
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:18,126
I almost forgot about that Pig!

636
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:29,959
Almighty Foot,
why must you always compete with me?

637
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:32,917
We all followed the demon's aura here.

638
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:35,167
Whoever captures the Pig Demon first...

639
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:37,084
...is the best demon-hunter of all!

640
01:00:37,376 --> 01:00:38,667
All right, let's forget the Pig Demon.

641
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:40,251
How about a one-on-one fight?

642
01:00:57,084 --> 01:01:01,251
The Pig Demon's tough,
and even tougher under a full moon.

643
01:01:01,626 --> 01:01:05,251
Who else could beat him, other than me?!

644
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:08,667
Look who's bragging!

645
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:10,376
Hello there, Prince Important!

646
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:15,167
They say your Sword Play
is the best in the world!

647
01:01:15,751 --> 01:01:19,501
It's time for my Almighty Foot to take you on!

648
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:23,834
I'll let you be Number One.

649
01:01:24,709 --> 01:01:30,417
It's lonesome at the top.

650
01:01:31,959 --> 01:01:34,584
How could you commoners understand?

651
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:37,084
Keep it low-key, okay?

652
01:01:37,459 --> 01:01:38,876
Stop throwing the petals.

653
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:41,709
Boss, didn't you tell us to throw them?

654
01:01:43,959 --> 01:01:46,084
What does the cough mean?

655
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:48,792
Are we throwing the petals or not?

656
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:51,834
No!

657
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:53,417
But you still have to pay us!

658
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:54,667
I know!

659
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:57,209
Actually,
I don't know what she's talking about.

660
01:01:57,667 --> 01:01:59,959
Wow! Where did you pick up
these four "lovely blossoms"?

661
01:02:00,251 --> 01:02:02,959
Out in the wild.
I was lucky to find these four!

662
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:05,251
Why not just walk on your own two feet?

663
01:02:05,834 --> 01:02:07,459
That would make me the same as you.

664
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:09,792
I, Prince Important, have my own style.

665
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:11,792
You're not important, just impotent!

666
01:02:14,959 --> 01:02:17,167
Listen,
you can't just make random accusations.

667
01:02:18,626 --> 01:02:19,626
Can't you read this word?

668
01:02:19,917 --> 01:02:21,197
It's "impotent"... no, wait, no!

669
01:02:21,209 --> 01:02:22,126
It's "important".

670
01:02:22,626 --> 01:02:24,334
I'm Prince impotent... no, no!

671
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:26,126
I'm not Prince Important!

672
01:02:26,251 --> 01:02:27,376
I'm impotent.

673
01:02:28,751 --> 01:02:32,084
You... I was... I tell you, when I was a child
I was impotent. Buddha would know.

674
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:34,448
No, wait, no...
I've been very important since I was born.

675
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,084
I'm trying to stay impotent.

676
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:36,834
Enough!

677
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:39,167
You all have amazing fighting skills.

678
01:02:39,209 --> 01:02:40,751
Why not unite to fight the demon?

679
01:02:41,084 --> 01:02:42,917
If you let him go now,
stronger under the full moon.

680
01:02:43,001 --> 01:02:44,441
And then all our lives will be over.

681
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:47,094
With no fame or fortune left to compete for.

682
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:49,376
You don't deserve to be demon-hunters!

683
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:51,792
And who is this beggar?

684
01:02:52,209 --> 01:02:54,459
I'm not a beggar. I'm also a demon-hunter.

685
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:57,501
Oh, got it... give him some food.

686
01:02:57,709 --> 01:02:59,789
We don't share the same goals and beliefs.
I must go.

687
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,709
Well said! I admire you so much!

688
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:04,376
I support you. I'll go with you!

689
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:05,626
Go away!

690
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,584
You keep blocking my way to Buddhahood.

691
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:08,626
Give me back my book.

692
01:03:10,626 --> 01:03:12,501
What's wrong? We were doing so well.

693
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:15,417
Give me back the 300 Nursery Rhymes!

694
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,626
300 Nursery Rhymes??

695
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:20,501
Are you sleeping?

696
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:23,959
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

697
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:26,834
Give me some face
in front of all these people.

698
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:29,542
300 Nursery Rhymes??

699
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:33,334
Fine!

700
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:47,209
You! Hey, what are you doing?!

701
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:48,501
Go ahead...

702
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:52,167
...hit me.

703
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:57,251
Useless garbage... Idiot!

704
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:58,626
Go to hell!

705
01:04:01,042 --> 01:04:02,876
Take a good honest look at yourself.

706
01:04:03,251 --> 01:04:05,292
If not for me, would you be alive today?

707
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:07,667
You think you're Prince Charming?

708
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,376
Demon-hunter, my foot!

709
01:04:22,126 --> 01:04:24,334
This fellow here is the true hero in my heart!

710
01:04:25,334 --> 01:04:27,292
Want to go for a drink...

711
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:28,959
...and get to know each other, Handsome?

712
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:32,542
Shh... I'm a humble guy.

713
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:34,772
It's such a burden to be so handsome.

714
01:04:35,251 --> 01:04:37,501
You ugly people couldn't possibly understand.

715
01:04:38,376 --> 01:04:42,042
Forget the drink then, let's just get a room.

716
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:47,084
I'm not available.

717
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:50,042
Boss!

718
01:04:50,376 --> 01:04:51,292
Leave me alone!

719
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:54,792
Miss, do you have time for a drink?

720
01:04:57,376 --> 01:04:58,542
Sir? Do you have time?

721
01:04:59,459 --> 01:05:01,376
Well, I've never dated a man before...

722
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:02,667
this is my first time.

723
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:03,584
So be gentle.

724
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:06,209
I'll try.

725
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:22,417
Five Fingers Mountain Starting Point

726
01:05:53,042 --> 01:05:59,292
Five Fingers Mountain Starting Point

727
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,542
At the foot of Five Fingers Mountain,
look for an old temple.

728
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:07,084
In front of it is a Buddha statue...

729
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:09,917
...13,000 feet high and 2,560 feet wide.

730
01:06:10,126 --> 01:06:11,292
The Monkey King is there.

731
01:06:55,001 --> 01:06:58,209
Water Reflection Mirror

732
01:09:09,001 --> 01:09:09,917
Get off me!!

733
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:12,280
I'm here to find the Monkey King.

734
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:12,959
I... I...

735
01:09:13,834 --> 01:09:15,195
Monkey King... I'm the Monkey King!

736
01:09:15,209 --> 01:09:16,169
You're the Monkey King?!

737
01:09:16,209 --> 01:09:17,542
Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.

738
01:09:18,584 --> 01:09:20,167
Mr. Sun, I'm so honored to meet you.

739
01:09:20,459 --> 01:09:21,459
I'm Chen Xuan Zang.

740
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:24,167
Mr. Chen! Mr. Sun!

741
01:09:24,459 --> 01:09:25,209
Mr. Chen!

742
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:29,334
You're finally here... after 500 years!

743
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:35,001
No, Mr. Sun!

744
01:09:35,959 --> 01:09:38,334
Sorry, I'm a bit overwhelmed.

745
01:09:39,626 --> 01:09:40,626
Sit... sit, sit!

746
01:09:44,542 --> 01:09:46,126
Mr. Chen, how handsome you are!

747
01:09:46,751 --> 01:09:47,876
You, too, Mr. Sun!

748
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:49,626
According to the legend...

749
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:51,387
...you seem just a little bit... different.

750
01:09:52,334 --> 01:09:53,126
Here's the story...

751
01:09:54,584 --> 01:09:55,376
500 years ago,

752
01:09:55,876 --> 01:09:58,667
I was an ordinary monkey.

753
01:09:59,459 --> 01:10:02,542
I had a tiny disagreement with Buddha...

754
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:06,751
...and he used the Buddha Sutra...

755
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:08,167
...to blast me down here!

756
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:11,376
But I recognized that I was at fault,

757
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:14,459
so I locked myself up in this tiny little hole

758
01:10:16,834 --> 01:10:19,334
and for 500 years I've never left once.

759
01:10:21,001 --> 01:10:21,792
I've just...

760
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:25,876
...studied and studied the Buddha Sutra.

761
01:10:26,126 --> 01:10:27,084
Look at me.

762
01:10:27,459 --> 01:10:30,626
I've already dissolved
the demon spirit within me

763
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:32,292
and expelled it from my body.

764
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:35,334
I've even lost my demonic look.

765
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:38,042
So now within me, all that remains is

766
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:40,792
...truth, goodness and beauty.

767
01:10:42,084 --> 01:10:43,584
So the Buddha Sutra is good,

768
01:10:43,626 --> 01:10:45,251
great and amazing!

769
01:10:45,459 --> 01:10:46,917
Actually, Mr. Sun, I've come here to

770
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:49,084
discuss another important matter with you.

771
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:50,584
Please go ahead.

772
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:53,334
Please teach me a way
to tame the Pig Demon.

773
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:54,209
KL Hog?

774
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:55,876
Yes, he's evil and has killed so many people.

775
01:10:55,959 --> 01:10:57,376
No one has a clue what to do.

776
01:10:57,917 --> 01:10:59,417
There is, in fact, a way...

777
01:11:04,376 --> 01:11:05,126
Come...

778
01:11:07,501 --> 01:11:09,751
This seal is the Holy Fire Spell.

779
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:13,042
I brought it down from heaven.

780
01:11:13,626 --> 01:11:16,167
It can destroy all demons and monsters.

781
01:11:16,584 --> 01:11:17,917
But I don't want to kill him.

782
01:11:18,167 --> 01:11:20,487
I just want to awaken his inner truth,
goodness and beauty.

783
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:22,209
Right... didn't I just say that?

784
01:11:22,751 --> 01:11:24,709
Its primary function is just that...

785
01:11:24,876 --> 01:11:27,251
to awaken truth, goodness and beauty.

786
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:29,792
Oh no... it's too precious!

787
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:31,876
Not at all, it's only worth a few bucks!

788
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:34,917
But still... I can't.

789
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:36,376
Take it, I insist.

790
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,792
I said it's a gift... just take it!

791
01:11:41,126 --> 01:11:41,751
Mr. Sun,

792
01:11:42,834 --> 01:11:46,292
is this the seal Buddha used to suppress you?

793
01:11:53,126 --> 01:11:55,876
By refusing my gift, you've offended me!

794
01:11:58,167 --> 01:11:59,209
Don't you know who I am?

795
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:03,542
You know the
13 Gangsters of Flower Fruit Mountain?

796
01:12:04,751 --> 01:12:06,167
I'm Number One!

797
01:12:09,251 --> 01:12:12,459
In those days, I had a cleaver in each hand...

798
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:16,626
...from South Heaven Gate
to Penglai East Road...

799
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,942
...chopping back and forth
for three days and three nights...

800
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:21,907
...blood flowed like a river...

801
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:25,251
...just chopping up and down...

802
01:12:26,251 --> 01:12:28,167
...without blinking an eye!

803
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:30,292
Didn't your eyes get dry...

804
01:12:30,584 --> 01:12:31,959
...from not blinking for so long?

805
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:35,834
What?! Does it really matter
if they're dry or not?!

806
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:37,417
What does that have to do with anything?!

807
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:38,626
I was just curious.

808
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:41,209
Do you get the point?!!

809
01:12:41,917 --> 01:12:44,667
Was I talking about my dry eyes?!!

810
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:45,876
I was just wondering...

811
01:12:46,584 --> 01:12:48,876
...such a long time without blinking.

812
01:12:49,334 --> 01:12:50,667
Don't freaking talk to me

813
01:12:50,709 --> 01:12:52,167
about my eyes getting dry or not!!

814
01:12:52,626 --> 01:12:53,709
Damn it!

815
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:57,667
Mr. Sun, please calm down!
I didn't mean it like that!

816
01:12:58,001 --> 01:12:59,584
I meant I killed without so much as a blink.

817
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:00,959
And all you're concern about is my dry eyes?!

818
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:02,417
Fine, I'll show you!

819
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:03,834
Damn it!

820
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:06,584
Are they dry?!

821
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:10,751
Are they? Are they dry?!

822
01:13:13,626 --> 01:13:14,501
Are they?

823
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:16,417
Can you see?!

824
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:17,542
Can you see?!

825
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:19,084
Yes.

826
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:24,126
What else have you got?

827
01:13:24,792 --> 01:13:27,917
Bring them all out!
Let me smash them all for you!

828
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:29,334
Take them out!

829
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:36,584
That's why I can't speak sensibly
with you young people!

830
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:38,042
You ask to borrow something.

831
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:40,167
No problem... I'll lend it to you.

832
01:13:40,251 --> 01:13:41,542
Mr. Sun...

833
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:43,209
I'm fine now, thanks.

834
01:13:45,084 --> 01:13:48,667
Young people nowadays have no appreciation.

835
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:52,542
Where's the gratitude and respect?

836
01:13:52,751 --> 01:13:53,834
Mr. Sun, you want it?

837
01:13:55,084 --> 01:13:56,459
Don't interrupt!

838
01:13:57,292 --> 01:13:58,501
You want to eat it? Open it yourself!

839
01:13:58,584 --> 01:13:59,417
I don't want to eat it.

840
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,334
You told me to bring it out for you to smash!

841
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:03,209
Oh my goodness!

842
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:14,959
Let me out of here!

843
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,084
It's been 500 years!

844
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:44,959
How much longer do you
want to keep me trapped here?!

845
01:14:46,459 --> 01:14:49,042
I've changed...

846
01:14:50,209 --> 01:14:51,751
...done the enlightenment thing...

847
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:57,334
Buddha, why won't you believe me?!

848
01:14:57,917 --> 01:14:59,667
You ask Buddha why he doesn't believe you?

849
01:14:59,751 --> 01:15:01,251
But do you believe in him?

850
01:15:02,209 --> 01:15:04,876
If you did in fact experience enlightenment,
he'll be even

851
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,326
He would never give up on you.

852
01:15:08,459 --> 01:15:10,667
You're saying
I didn't really experience enlightenment?

853
01:15:11,042 --> 01:15:12,709
Let it go. That's not the point.

854
01:15:13,126 --> 01:15:15,847
If you just do goodness with all your heart,
you'll reap the rewards.

855
01:15:17,751 --> 01:15:20,376
Help me tame the Pig Demon
to show you're doing good.

856
01:15:20,584 --> 01:15:23,459
It's your chance to fight evil
and give back to society.

857
01:15:23,709 --> 01:15:26,334
You want my help? Impossible!

858
01:15:27,709 --> 01:15:31,209
Do you know how hard
these 500 years have been?

859
01:15:33,126 --> 01:15:37,417
I haven't had a single bite
of my favorite food, bananas!

860
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:46,917
You want to get the Pig Demon. Lure him here.

861
01:15:48,459 --> 01:15:51,584
Though he was hurt
by his wife and her lover...

862
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:54,501
...he still loves his wife deeply.

863
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:59,417
He always liked to watched
her dance in the moonlight.

864
01:16:00,292 --> 01:16:01,876
He even wrote a song

865
01:16:01,917 --> 01:16:03,667
for her to show his love.

866
01:16:04,209 --> 01:16:05,209
So it's simple.

867
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:07,167
Get a pretty girl...

868
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:08,917
...to sing and dance

869
01:16:08,959 --> 01:16:12,084
to that song under the full moon.

870
01:16:12,626 --> 01:16:14,584
And the Pig Demon will naturally show up.

871
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:16,001
And then?

872
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:18,167
And then leave the rest to me.

873
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:20,927
What are you doing?

874
01:16:21,584 --> 01:16:23,904
Mr. Sun, what do you think about me
dressing up as a woman?

875
01:16:24,876 --> 01:16:26,356
Mr. Chen, stop embarrassing yourself.

876
01:16:31,626 --> 01:16:32,667
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

877
01:16:33,042 --> 01:16:35,709
It's only just a banana.

878
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:39,709
Why are you still following me?

879
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:42,792
Because I'm worried about you.

880
01:16:43,376 --> 01:16:45,626
I was up there when I heard
you say you needed my help.

881
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:46,542
So I came down.

882
01:16:46,626 --> 01:16:48,334
Who said we needed your help?

883
01:16:48,667 --> 01:16:50,542
Didn't you just say you needed a pretty girl?

884
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:53,626
Go away! This is serious stuff.

885
01:16:53,834 --> 01:16:55,167
Sorry, Mr. Sun!

886
01:16:55,584 --> 01:16:56,626
A pretty girl!

887
01:17:00,001 --> 01:17:01,501
You know just what to say.

888
01:17:01,626 --> 01:17:04,251
I've always been this way...
I say what I think.

889
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:06,459
You're making me blush!

890
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:08,126
You look even nicer that way!

891
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:10,376
How about you stop saying what you think?

892
01:17:11,584 --> 01:17:12,959
He offended you just now!

893
01:17:13,084 --> 01:17:16,542
Let me apologize for him with this gift.

894
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:19,292
Oh no, I can't accept. That's too much.

895
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:23,042
Give me a chance.

896
01:17:23,709 --> 01:17:25,501
We don't even know each other well.

897
01:17:25,584 --> 01:17:28,001
All good friends begin as strangers.

898
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:32,042
Mr. Sun, keep this up and I'll leave!

899
01:17:32,709 --> 01:17:35,917
If you leave, what will I do?

900
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:38,542
You're naughty! We're not alone here!

901
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:39,709
Who else is here?

902
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:42,501
Fine... let's go catch the Pig Demon!

903
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:48,751
Miss, you just said you wanted
to help us lure the demon.

904
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:50,042
Can you dance?

905
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:51,917
I only know one dance.

906
01:17:57,542 --> 01:17:58,626
Good!

907
01:17:59,501 --> 01:18:00,876
Step.

908
01:18:01,626 --> 01:18:02,501
Step.

909
01:18:03,459 --> 01:18:04,167
Step.

910
01:18:06,876 --> 01:18:07,709
Down.

911
01:18:09,126 --> 01:18:10,417
Up.

912
01:18:11,876 --> 01:18:12,542
Up.

913
01:18:15,042 --> 01:18:15,709
Come on!

914
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:21,792
Try it!

915
01:18:23,584 --> 01:18:24,459
Lift your butt a bit.

916
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:28,876
Quite good.

917
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:30,792
Miss, your dancing's really good!

918
01:18:32,376 --> 01:18:33,834
Not at all!

919
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,167
Not as good as you!

920
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:36,376
You're really good!

921
01:18:37,584 --> 01:18:39,334
Really!

922
01:18:39,834 --> 01:18:41,584
So may I go up and lure the Pig Demon now?

923
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:44,334
Good! Really Good!

924
01:18:46,626 --> 01:18:47,866
This guy looks really familiar.

925
01:19:26,042 --> 01:19:31,792
My love is gone, she'll never return.

926
01:19:34,376 --> 01:19:40,167
I silently mourn my lost love.

927
01:19:41,709 --> 01:19:48,959
Though flowers wither, they'll bloom again.

928
01:19:50,126 --> 01:19:57,667
My long-lost love is beyond the clouds.

929
01:19:59,334 --> 01:20:06,334
Unrequited love fills my heart with sorrow.

930
01:20:07,084 --> 01:20:15,042
In our lives we can't change our destiny.

931
01:20:15,876 --> 01:20:23,501
Once we're parted, we can love no more.

932
01:20:23,876 --> 01:20:31,001
Could this be the fate heaven planned for me?

933
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:15,376
KL Hog!

934
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:21,584
KL Hog!

935
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:23,709
Long time no see.

936
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:38,751
Let's

937
01:21:42,417 --> 01:21:44,126
Thank you so much, Mr. Sun!

938
01:21:44,417 --> 01:21:46,018
You've done great service to the people!

939
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:47,376
Not at all.

940
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,167
After 49 days,

941
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:05,001
the Pig Demon will be reduced to ashes.

942
01:22:05,501 --> 01:22:07,542
I know you have your own demon-taming beliefs,

943
01:22:07,751 --> 01:22:11,042
so I'm handing these two over to you now.

944
01:22:11,751 --> 01:22:12,711
Thank you for your help!

945
01:22:14,459 --> 01:22:16,499
Are you tired?
You should go home and get some rest.

946
01:22:17,042 --> 01:22:19,042
Didn't I tell you?
When a girl closes her eyes,

947
01:22:19,126 --> 01:22:20,709
she wants you to kiss her.

948
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:31,042
Miss Duan, I think I can help you!

949
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:32,626
Mr. Sun!

950
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:41,834
Sorry... I know I'd treated you badly before.

951
01:22:42,209 --> 01:22:43,542
But I've changed.

952
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:47,501
I've decided to become a gentle,
faithful wife and mother.

953
01:22:48,084 --> 01:22:49,459
Would you accept me now?

954
01:23:00,376 --> 01:23:01,167
What are you doing?

955
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:03,959
I've decided to marry you!

956
01:23:04,459 --> 01:23:06,626
This represents my love for you.

957
01:23:10,334 --> 01:23:12,792
Why are you looking at me?
Where else can I freakin' go?!

958
01:23:13,959 --> 01:23:16,126
Ignore him. Are you willing?

959
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:22,292
This Infinite Flying Ring
grows roots in your flesh.

960
01:23:22,417 --> 01:23:24,001
You will never be able to take it off.

961
01:23:27,751 --> 01:23:28,552
What are you doing?!

962
01:23:29,084 --> 01:23:29,917
I don't love you.

963
01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:32,126
I don't want to marry you.

964
01:23:32,751 --> 01:23:35,209
If I can't remove the ring,
I'll remove my finger!

965
01:23:47,417 --> 01:23:48,626
I get it now.

966
01:23:49,542 --> 01:23:51,126
I won't bother you anymore.

967
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:01,917
I spent three days
putting your book back together.

968
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:05,459
But I can't read very well
so I made a mess of it.

969
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:07,917
I don't want it.

970
01:24:16,126 --> 01:24:17,126
She's gone...

971
01:24:19,334 --> 01:24:20,334
Too bad.

972
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:23,667
Miss Duan has such a great body.

973
01:24:24,501 --> 01:24:25,584
How do you know?

974
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:28,334
I saw it with my eyes.

975
01:24:29,334 --> 01:24:30,584
Why didn't I see it?

976
01:24:30,876 --> 01:24:32,501
Must be because you're blind.

977
01:24:34,709 --> 01:24:36,751
Mr. Sun, thanks again for helping me.

978
01:24:37,126 --> 01:24:38,042
Goodbye.

979
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:40,126
No need to rush off... leaving so soon?

980
01:24:41,584 --> 01:24:42,584
Are you okay?

981
01:24:42,751 --> 01:24:43,959
Yes, I'm fine. What could possibly be wrong?

982
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:45,542
Goodbye, goodbye!

983
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:23,834
Mr. Chen...

984
01:25:25,084 --> 01:25:27,209
...is the moon full tonight?

985
01:25:27,459 --> 01:25:28,751
Very full.

986
01:25:29,584 --> 01:25:30,959
That's wonderful!

987
01:25:31,834 --> 01:25:34,209
The cave opening's blocked by that lotus.

988
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:37,042
I can't even remember
when I last saw the moon.

989
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:09,376
Finally, I tricked you!

990
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:50,251
Oh, it's you!

991
01:26:50,334 --> 01:26:53,542
You really thought
you could buy me off with a banana?!

992
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:57,251
Actually, the lotus was the real seal
and this is the real me!

993
01:26:57,417 --> 01:26:58,738
You've released me from the seal!

994
01:26:58,876 --> 01:27:01,042
I've finally escaped Buddha's control!

995
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:02,959
All you did was get out of the cave.

996
01:27:03,167 --> 01:27:03,968
Buddha's still here.

997
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:06,042
Still here?!

998
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:16,084
Go to hell!

999
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:31,792
Put down your hands!

1000
01:27:32,376 --> 01:27:33,376
Buddha be praised.

1001
01:27:38,001 --> 01:27:43,126
Put them down!

1002
01:27:51,626 --> 01:27:55,542
Put them down!

1003
01:28:09,209 --> 01:28:11,584
So now, allow me to deliver you to Buddha!

1004
01:28:15,834 --> 01:28:16,667
Who's there?!

1005
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:29,709
The legendary King of Demons,
the Monkey King?!

1006
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:33,292
Why are you so short?

1007
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:34,959
He may be short,

1008
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:37,251
but he's more demonic than ever!

1009
01:28:37,501 --> 01:28:39,376
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!

1010
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:42,001
This is worth skipping dinner!

1011
01:28:42,834 --> 01:28:45,084
Is this a Peking opera costume?

1012
01:28:45,167 --> 01:28:46,126
It's so cute...

1013
01:28:46,542 --> 01:28:49,251
So you're always frowning... are you unhappy?

1014
01:28:49,459 --> 01:28:51,501
If you're unhappy, I'll play with you!

1015
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:55,126
Didn't we agree that he's mine?!

1016
01:28:56,126 --> 01:28:59,042
Same rule. Whoever wins, goes first!

1017
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,167
Okay!

1018
01:29:00,876 --> 01:29:04,542
Stone, paper, scissors!

1019
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:07,626
Are you upset?

1020
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:09,917
Stop throwing the petals!

1021
01:29:11,584 --> 01:29:12,709
Hey, come on!

1022
01:29:13,459 --> 01:29:15,209
I'm in a hurry! Let me go first!

1023
01:29:39,334 --> 01:29:41,292
Pretending to be an animal, in front of me?!

1024
01:29:42,751 --> 01:29:44,542
It's just a crazy monkey!

1025
01:29:44,626 --> 01:29:46,917
It deserves to be stepped on!

1026
01:30:08,501 --> 01:30:12,167
Today, you will die by my Almighty Foot!

1027
01:31:02,459 --> 01:31:04,626
Oh look! Almighty Foot has stepped on a nail!

1028
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:14,959
My foot has been pierced!

1029
01:31:15,376 --> 01:31:18,126
My food has been pierced!
Yes, I know!

1030
01:31:18,876 --> 01:31:22,626
I know! I can see that! Good!

1031
01:31:23,251 --> 01:31:24,376
Quite Please!

1032
01:31:28,876 --> 01:31:32,292
Oh. My foot! My foot!

1033
01:31:32,834 --> 01:31:33,917
Can I please get some help?

1034
01:31:34,084 --> 01:31:35,417
With what?

1035
01:31:35,709 --> 01:31:37,167
Moving that foot!

1036
01:31:37,876 --> 01:31:40,501
You should have said it sooner.

1037
01:31:42,251 --> 01:31:43,542
Why didn't you say it sooner?

1038
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:48,209
You should have said it sooner. Say it!

1039
01:31:50,167 --> 01:31:51,751
Why didn't you say it sooner?

1040
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:57,209
Why didn't you say so? Should have said so.

1041
01:31:57,667 --> 01:31:59,501
Help me move the foot!

1042
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:00,709
Why didn't you say it sooner?

1043
01:32:00,792 --> 01:32:01,834
Move him!

1044
01:34:22,709 --> 01:34:24,626
Wow! That wasn't bad. I really had fun today!

1045
01:34:25,501 --> 01:34:28,334
Yeah, me too! Of course,
it was all just for fun...

1046
01:34:28,751 --> 01:34:29,667
Time for me to go!

1047
01:34:49,126 --> 01:34:50,917
Your turn!

1048
01:35:00,542 --> 01:35:01,959
I'll kill whoever touches him!

1049
01:35:02,084 --> 01:35:04,751
No! Run!

1050
01:35:08,209 --> 01:35:10,417
How dare you do this to him?

1051
01:35:11,084 --> 01:35:12,209
What do you take me for?

1052
01:35:36,376 --> 01:35:39,417
Run! You're no match for him! I beg you!

1053
01:35:39,459 --> 01:35:40,376
I'm not going!

1054
01:35:48,001 --> 01:35:49,626
What then?!

1055
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:51,959
What did you do to him?!

1056
01:35:52,751 --> 01:35:54,834
Don't think I'm so nice!

1057
01:36:24,001 --> 01:36:27,042
I've caught you again...

1058
01:36:28,626 --> 01:36:32,626
...and you still won't admit you love me?

1059
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:38,834
I love you.

1060
01:36:40,709 --> 01:36:42,667
I've loved you...

1061
01:36:44,792 --> 01:36:46,209
...from the moment I saw you.

1062
01:36:47,751 --> 01:36:50,209
How much?

1063
01:36:52,167 --> 01:36:53,626
Very much.

1064
01:36:54,334 --> 01:36:56,167
There's never been a day that...

1065
01:36:59,209 --> 01:37:00,876
...I don't think about you.

1066
01:37:01,501 --> 01:37:05,376
How... long... will you love me?

1067
01:37:07,417 --> 01:37:09,126
1,000 years...

1068
01:37:15,417 --> 01:37:16,709
10,000 years...

1069
01:37:17,792 --> 01:37:19,501
10,000 years...

1070
01:37:20,542 --> 01:37:22,626
...that's too long.

1071
01:37:23,834 --> 01:37:25,292
Just love me...

1072
01:37:25,959 --> 01:37:27,209
...now.

1073
01:37:56,417 --> 01:37:58,417
Didn't I tell you?
When a girl closes her eyes,

1074
01:37:58,459 --> 01:38:00,251
she wants you to kiss her.

1075
01:38:52,167 --> 01:38:54,334
I just destroyed the woman you love.

1076
01:38:54,376 --> 01:38:55,709
There's nothing left of her.

1077
01:38:56,667 --> 01:38:58,959
How can your Buddha help you now?

1078
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:19,084
You're hurting so much that you want to die!

1079
01:39:19,376 --> 01:39:21,751
What can your Buddha do for you now?

1080
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:40,334
The Buddha Sutra

1081
01:39:42,917 --> 01:39:44,792
Buddha!

1082
01:40:19,459 --> 01:40:20,584
Buddha!

1083
01:40:21,084 --> 01:40:22,709
You had me imprisoned for 500 years!

1084
01:40:23,584 --> 01:40:26,042
But now I'm free!

1085
01:40:26,501 --> 01:40:28,501
And now I will destroy you!

1086
01:43:46,584 --> 01:43:48,959
Now how do you feel about
Greater and Lesser Love?

1087
01:43:49,042 --> 01:43:51,042
About love between a man and a woman?

1088
01:43:51,334 --> 01:43:52,655
Love between a man and a woman...

1089
01:43:52,751 --> 01:43:54,959
...is all part of the Greater Love.

1090
01:43:56,001 --> 01:43:59,542
Love is neither greater nor lesser.

1091
01:44:01,084 --> 01:44:04,667
Having experienced pain,
I can truly understand life's suffering.

1092
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:07,876
Knowing stubbornness, one can let it go.

1093
01:44:08,876 --> 01:44:11,709
Knowing what one wants, one can release it.

1094
01:44:12,251 --> 01:44:14,917
Now you understand that little 'something'.

1095
01:44:15,501 --> 01:44:16,709
Do you now know your mission?

1096
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:18,459
There is suffering in this world.

1097
01:44:19,084 --> 01:44:20,709
It's not I who can rescue
the world from hardship

1098
01:44:20,792 --> 01:44:22,501
and deliver mankind from misery

1099
01:44:22,584 --> 01:44:24,745
That power lies
only in the 22 scripture books in India

1100
01:44:24,792 --> 01:44:26,667
Go on your journey
to the West for the scriptures.

1101
01:44:26,751 --> 01:44:30,667
It will be full of challenges and demons.

1102
01:44:31,126 --> 01:44:33,084
These three each have skills...

1103
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:36,709
...and can protect you at all times.

1104
01:44:37,876 --> 01:44:40,001
I hereby grant you
your holy robe and ritual items.

1105
01:44:40,626 --> 01:44:43,667
From today, you are a disciple of Buddha.

1106
01:44:43,834 --> 01:44:45,126
Your holy name is Tripitaka.

1107
01:44:45,209 --> 01:44:46,042
Go forth!
