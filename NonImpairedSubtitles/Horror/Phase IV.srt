<i>That spring, we were all</i>
<i>watching the events of space</i>

2
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,619
<i>and wondering what</i>
<i>the final effect would be.</i>

3
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,019
<i>Astronomers argued over theory</i>

4
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,419
<i>while engineers got</i>
<i>pretty excited about variables</i>

5
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:59,299
<i>and magnetic fields.</i>

6
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,739
<i>Mystics predicted earthquakes</i>

7
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,539
<i>and the end of life</i>
<i>as we knew it.</i>

8
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,459
<i>When the effect came</i>

9
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,818
<i>it was almost unnoticed</i>

10
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:36,738
<i>because it happened</i>
<i>to such a small</i>

11
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:40,578
<i>and insignificant form of life.</i>

12
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,419
<i>One biologist,</i>
<i>an English man, Ernest Hubbs</i>

13
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,658
<i>saw something, got nervous</i>
<i>and started investigating.</i>

14
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,498
<i>While I was playing around with</i>
<i>number theory at the university</i>

15
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:10,338
<i>Hubbs was already on</i>
<i>to something.</i>

16
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,178
<i>Ordinary ants</i>
<i>of different species</i>

17
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:17,058
<i>were doing things</i>
<i>ants don't do.</i>

18
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:21,858
<i>Meeting, communicating.</i>

19
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:25,698
<i>Apparently making decisions.</i>

20
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,979
<i>By summer the rest of the world</i>
<i>had moved on to other things</i>

21
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,899
<i>but Hubbs kept making notes.</i>

22
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,218
<i>While the threat grew.</i>

23
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,459
<i>Only fragments</i>
<i>of what he knew got out</i>

24
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,858

67
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:43,074
You did your major work

68
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,434
applying game theory to
the language of killer whales.

69
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:49,314
Well, it seemed cheaper
than applying it to real air.

70
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,194
Did you actually succeed
in making positive contact

71
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:53,154
with the whales?

72
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:56,034
Only with
the emotionally disturbed.

73
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,954
How were you able
to determine that?

74
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:00,834
We talked.

75
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:03,714
Is that a joke?

76
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:07,074
Look, I'm sorry, I'm strictly
a pencil and paper guy

77
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,034
I wouldn't know the front end
of a whale

78
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,874
from...
A hole in the ground.

79
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:20,034
I know that game's
your business, James,

80
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:24,834
you play them very well.
That's why you're here.

81
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,234
But this is a serious game.

82
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:31,074
Well, that's the best kind,
isn't it?

<i>But it would be better to</i>
<i>let him learn at his own pace.</i>

89
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:27,714
There are certain
equatorial ants

90
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,634
that would attack anything -
insects, mammals -

91
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:34,434
anything at all that threatens
their food supply.

92
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,794
The smell
triggers their behavior.

93
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:40,674
Yeah.

94
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:45,474
They are picky eaters.

95
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:01,985
Now this thing here.

96
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,905
You see what we're doing,

97
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:06,785
we're running lines
from these fuel tanks

98
00:14:06,786 --> 00:14:09,665
and if those ants get over
that water trap

99
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,066
we're gonna set fire
to this here ditch

100
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:15,425
and watch 'em all burn.

101
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:19,265
What do you think?

102
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,625
Done a lot of good work.

103
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:31,745
I'd say they started pulling out
three, four weeks ago

104
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,625
a couple of families at a time.

105
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,066
What else?

106
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:37,986
That's about the size of it.

107
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,866
I guess it must have been
some kind of infestation

108
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,786
but...Well, I couldn't say
for sure.

109
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:45,666
Maybe the heat
got too much for 'em.

110
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,105
There's a collapsed house
down there.

111
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:49,506
Well, I wouldn't know
about that.

112
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:50,945
I didn't really get to know
those people

113
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:54,306
they were...
They were city folk mainly.

114
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:56,705
Tell me about the towers.

115
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:59,585
Don't know,
wasn't there.

116
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:01,986
Of course
it's been a dry year.

117
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:03,906
You know we do get ants
in dry years.

118
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:04,866
Hmm.

119
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:06,786
I talked to an entomologist

120
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:09,185
up at the state department
of agriculture at one time,

121
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:12,065
he said these things
were cyclical.

122
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:15,425
They weren't talking about
those ants.

123
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,825
Mildred, come on out here.

124
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:19,745
That's alright.
It isn't alright.

125
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:20,705
These people will think

126
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:24,545
I've got you chained up
in there.

127
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:28,385
These gentlemen are from
the university,

128
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,265
they're gonna develop
a new spray for those ants.

129
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,706
You know what I think.

130
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:35,586
Ha! You know if she didn't have
something to worry about,

131
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:37,506
she wouldn't know what to do
with herself.

132
00:15:37,507 --> 00:15:39,905
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
leave for a few days

133
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:43,745

134
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,545

Look I...
Mr. Eldridge.

136
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:52,866
I--I--I don't understand this.
It's for your own protection.

137
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:57,666
Evacuation?
What's this all about anyway?

138
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,586
Why this isn't right.
They can't just push us off--

139
00:15:59,587 --> 00:16:01,985
didn't you hear
what the man said?

140
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:05,345
It's for our protection.

141
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:15,906
When do they get
their farm back?

142
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:18,786

<i>The controller would like</i>
<i>to get the final figure</i>

157
00:18:58,915 --> 00:19:01,794
<i>before the fiscal period ends</i>
<i>on the 14th.</i>

158
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:04,674
<i>Shall we put you down</i>
<i>for one more week?</i>

159
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:07,554
I'm sorry,
this is not a precise business.

160
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:08,993
<i>Well, can you give us</i>
<i>an estimate?</i>

161
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:11,873
We cannot study the ants
until they make an appearance.

162
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:14,274
<i>Can we put you down</i>
<i>for ten more days?</i>

163
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:17,154
This is not
a controlled experiment,

164
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:20,513
in our judgment another
occurrence in this area

165
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:21,954
is highly probable.

166
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:24,353
But we cannot command
the ants to appear.

167
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:28,193
<i>Well is there something</i>
<i>you could do to hurry them up?</i>

168
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:32,033
We have been thinking
about that.

169
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:32,993
<i>You know, of course,</i>
<i>there is concern</i>

170
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:35,873
<i>over possible outbreaks</i>
<i>in other areas?</i>

171
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,793
Ah, I share that concern.

172
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:41,633
My associate, Mr. Lesko,
has something to say.

173
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:43,074
Listen, I want you
to do me a favor -

174
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:46,433
I want you to call Miss Dobson,
d-o-b-s-o-n.

175
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:50,273
6-6-2-0-7-9-9 in Los Angeles.

176
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:54,594
Tell her not to take
the plane to Vegas on thursday.

177
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,033
Tell her it'll be
a couple more weeks and...

178
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:57,953
She'll hear from me, okay?

179
00:19:57,954 --> 00:19:59,394
<i>Did you say</i>
<i>a couple of weeks?</i>

180
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:00,833
That's right.

181
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,234
<i>Mr. Lesko, that's not</i>
<i>going to be possible,</i>

182
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:07,553
<i>accord--</i>

183
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:43,554
let's see some activity.

184
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:13,793
Hi, there?

185
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:05,154
Clete!

186
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:06,593
Ants.

187
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,473
They got the horse,
clete, light the fire.

188
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:14,273
Kendra. Oh, my god.

189
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:19,554
Grandpa,
can't you something?

190
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:25,793
Oh, my god.

191
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:28,194
Clete, get over here.

192
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:30,593
Can't you do something?

193
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:33,473
Give me the gun.

194
00:22:34,915 --> 00:22:37,313
No, no, no.
Let me go.

195
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,674
Clete, get her in the house,
get her in the house.

196
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,594
Don't kill him.

197
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,953
Don't kill him.

198
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,394
All set?

199
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:16,194
Keep down now.
That's right. Hang on.

200
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:19,074
Now this is really interesting.

201
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:20,994
You see what I do is I get to
the parameters of the problem

202
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:24,834
by breaking down the movement of
a vector of a single anthill.

203
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:27,233
Now, I don't know what
they're doing, I don't care,

204
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:31,073
I'm just breaking down
their simple basic move.

205
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:34,913
Stop, go.

206
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:39,713
Turn,

207
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:43,074
duration.
That's it period, okay?

208
00:23:43,074 --> 00:23:44,513
Now I take my ant signals,

209
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:45,954
I run them through
the digitizer,

210
00:23:45,954 --> 00:23:47,393
I record them on tape,

211
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:49,794
I write them down and
I search for a correlation

212
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:52,674
between what they say
and what they do.

213
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:54,113
Now assumption.

214
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:56,993
What we're seeing and hearing
are commands

215
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:59,393
being directed
at the central mass.

216
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,073
They warned us.

217
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:10,433
Relax.

218
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:21,473
I forgot to turn out the light.

219
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:30,113
Stop! Cut it out!
What's the matter?

220
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:32,033
Cut it out!

221
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:34,433
Come back here.

222
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:38,753
Goddamn it, will you sit...

223
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,953
They're all over the place.

224
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:48,353
Clete, take care of the women.
Get some help.

225
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,753
Now I make various adjustments,

226
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:52,673
make up for time lag
and a couple of other things

227
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,113
don't worry about it.

228
00:24:54,114 --> 00:24:56,513
Then I come up with...

229
00:24:56,514 --> 00:24:58,913
Ha, are you ready for this?

230
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,273
I come up with a positive
correlation on the order of 80%

231
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:03,713
between this little squiggle

232
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:07,073
and the command we commonly
know as stop.

233
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:09,953
And a positive correlation
between that little squiggle

234
00:25:09,954 --> 00:25:11,393
and go.

235
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:12,833
And that means
these little mothers

236
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,273
talk to each other.

237
00:25:14,274 --> 00:25:18,593
Now I think if I--
hey, the lights.

238
00:25:18,594 --> 00:25:20,513
They've got into
the generator. Don't move,

239
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:23,393
the back up unit
cuts in automatically.

240
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:28,193
I'm going to counter
with 100% yellow.

241
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:14,273
You're letting some get away.

242
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:18,113
Maybe they've learnt something.

243
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:08,321
Come over here, James,

244
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:12,640
this is really fascinating.

245
00:28:19,842 --> 00:28:22,721
People are dead
back there.

246
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:25,601
Yes, a tragedy.

247
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:28,961
I don't understand it,
they accepted the order,

248
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:31,361
why should they come here?

249
00:28:31,362 --> 00:28:35,201
Irrational behavior,
very sad.

250
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:39,041
Now just look at this, James.

251
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:41,921
Consider the execution
of this maneuver,

252
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:43,841
in order to explode
the generator,

253
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:45,761
they had to create
a living chain--

254
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:51,040
listen, Hubbs, those people
are dead, don't you understand?

255
00:28:56,802 --> 00:29:01,601
People get killed sometimes.

256
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,881
I think this yellow
should hold it's potency

257
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:10,240
for three or four days.

258
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:12,641
We can
start collecting now.

259
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:04,481
Little sons of bitches.

260
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:06,881
No, no, no.

261
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:10,241
They're not individuals,
they are individual cells.

262
00:31:10,242 --> 00:31:13,121
Tiny functioning parts
of the whole.

263
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:16,961
Think of a society, james,
with perfect harmony,

264
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,841
perfect altruism
and self sacrifice,

265
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:25,121
perfect division of labor,
organized for preordained roles.

266
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:28,961
Think of the building,
elaborate and complex structures

267
00:31:28,962 --> 00:31:31,361
according to plans
that they know nothing of,

268
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:33,761
but can execute perfectly.

269
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:39,041
Think of their ability to evolve
and adapt

270
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:42,401
in ways that are so beautiful,

271
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,321
and still so unknown

272
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:49,601
and all contained
in one simple form.

273
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:53,441
So defenseless
in the individual,

274
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:56,801
and so powerful in the mass.

275
00:31:59,682 --> 00:32:01,601
Well...

276
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:06,881
Let's begin with
the first behavioral series,

277
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:13,121
heat, cold, isolations,
starvation,

278
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:16,481
slow pressure,

279
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:22,721
and threat.

280
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:27,521
Mantises prey on ants,
as you know.

281
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:29,921
Now if--

282
00:32:29,922 --> 00:32:33,761
if you're still with us, James.

283
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:37,601
When are we gonna
get her out of here?

284
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:39,521
That's going to be
a little difficult, I'm afraid.

285
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:43,841
Um... turn on the microphone,
please?

286
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:46,721
Call in and have them send out
a helicopter.

287
00:32:46,722 --> 00:32:52,481
I'm afraid the bureaucrats
will be rather unhappy

288
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:55,840
with all of our casualties.

289
00:32:57,762 --> 00:32:59,681
Now...

290
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:03,041
Mantises,
at this end of the maze,

291
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:04,481
the ants are at the other.

292
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,841
What are we gonna do
with the girl?

293
00:33:07,842 --> 00:33:09,761
What is your concern with her?

294
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:13,121
She's in shock,
we can't just... she's a kid.

295
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:16,481
Don't shout.

296
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:19,361
This is a problem that
will have to be dealt with

297
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:23,681
over the next few days
until we're finished.

298
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:26,081
If you won't call the base,
I will.

299
00:33:26,082 --> 00:33:28,481
I'm very much afraid that that
will end our mission.

300
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:31,361
Screw our mission.

301
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,681
I've finished eating.

302
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:38,561
You know,
I don't know your name.

303
00:33:38,562 --> 00:33:40,481
Oh, Kendra.
I'm Jim.

304
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:42,401
That's Dr. Hubbs.

305
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:44,801
Come in, come on.

306
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:46,721
You sort of had a close call
out there, didn't you?

307
00:33:46,722 --> 00:33:51,521
How do you feel?
Well, I'm ready to go home now.

308
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:52,961
Um... I'll send
a message today.

309
00:33:52,962 --> 00:33:55,841
Somebody will come along
and pick you up tomorrow,

310
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:58,721
if that's convenient.

311
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:08,321
They killed my horse.

312
00:34:08,322 --> 00:34:11,681
Kendra, I'm sorry.

313
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,121
Kendra!

314
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:14,561
Stop it, stop it.

315
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:15,521
Back away.

316
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:17,441
Don't touch anything.

317
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:20,321
It's alright.

318
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:31,361
That should do it.

319
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:33,760
You've been bitten.

320
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:21,184
<i>So we thought if you</i>
<i>knocked down one of the towers,</i>

321
00:36:21,185 --> 00:36:23,585
<i>taking proper precautions</i>
<i>of course,</i>

322
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:26,465
<i>you might get</i>
<i>an interesting reaction.</i>

323
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:27,904
We'll consider it.

324
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:30,305
<i>Just an idea doctor.</i>
Appreciated.

325
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:33,664
<i>Oh, one other thing.</i>
Yes?

326
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:36,544
<i>We got a report about a family</i>
<i>in your vicinity;</i>

327
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:40,864
<i>you haven't contacted</i>
<i>any civilians, have you?</i>

328
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,745
No.

329
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:06,784
<i>Monday, 2:00 a.m.</i>

330
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:10,144
<i>Lesko continues</i>
<i>to make progress,</i>

331
00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:12,544
<i>deciphering the ant language</i>

332
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:16,864
<i>from the tapes recorded</i>
<i>during the first skirmish.</i>

333
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:19,744
<i>If he maintains this pace,</i>

334
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:23,104
<i>we should be ready</i>
<i>for their next move.</i>

335
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,984
It's a rather crude language,

336
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,904
I think if I keep building up
my library of sound words

337
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:41,824
I might even...

338
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:45,184
Strike up a conversation
with them.

339
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:49,504
Of course then the ants
would have to come back.

340
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:52,864
We'd have to be here
for a while.

341
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:54,304
When's the helicopter coming?

342
00:38:54,305 --> 00:38:57,184
Oh, it'll be here.

343
00:38:57,185 --> 00:39:01,984
I'm sorry about that.
Oh, not your fault.

344
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,824
Listen, you really wanna see
something?

345
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:08,224
Another way of visualizing
their signals.

346
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:11,104
Watch this.

347
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:25,984
I don't have the faintest idea
what it means.

348
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:04,288
Hey?

349
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:06,208
Remember me?

350
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:07,648
Oh, y--y--yeah!

351
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:10,048
How do you feel?

352
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:14,367
Oh...Better.
That's good.

353
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:15,328
H--h--how is um...

354
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:16,768
dr. hubbs?
Yeah.

355
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:20,608
Oh, he'll survive.

356
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:22,048
I'm really sorry about that I...

357
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:23,968
Listen, if I were you
I'd have popped those ants

358
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:25,408
pretty good myself.

359
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:29,248
You know
you've got a mean swing.

360
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:32,128
Well, the main thing is
you're alright.

361
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:35,968
We'll get you out of here today.

362
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:37,888
What's the matter?

363
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:41,728
Don't tell me
you like this place?

364
00:41:43,649 --> 00:41:47,967
My grandparents are dead,
aren't they?

365
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:50,848
Yeah, they are.

366
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,648
What?
Don't you have parents?

367
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:58,528
Well, you must be hungry.

368
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:02,848
Come on,
I'll get you some breakfast.

369
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:04,288
Okay.

370
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:08,128
Follow me through
the hardware department.

371
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:20,608
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

372
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:23,488
What do you do here?

373
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:28,288
Just a little research into
statistical probabilities.

374
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:32,608
Really?
It must be interesting.

375
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:38,368
Well, we've got powdered eggs,
powdered milk,

376
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:42,208
powdered juice,
dehydrated bacon,

377
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:45,088
just like home.

378
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:46,528
James?

379
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:48,448
Are you alright?
Oh, yeah.

380
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:52,288
See you in a little while.
Okay.

381
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:03,328
Good morningJames.

382
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:06,688
As you can see
we're under siege.

383
00:43:06,689 --> 00:43:08,128
What the hell's that?

384
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:09,568
It's more than
reflected sunlight.

385
00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:11,488
Our temperature is already up
five degrees.

386
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,888
There's another
interesting detail.

387
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:17,248
How do you suppose those ants
managed to build

388
00:43:17,249 --> 00:43:21,568
on a poisonous strip where they
absolutely cannot live?

389
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:23,008
Did you say five degrees?
Hmm.

390
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,448
In an hour and a half.

391
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:27,328
And of course the sun's
not yet at full strength.

392
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:30,688
Now watch this.
An hour and a half?

393
00:43:30,689 --> 00:43:35,488
Oh, you must watch this,
this is fascinating, there.

394
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:37,888
Beautiful adaptation,
isn't it?

395
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,808
We challenge with
yellow chemistry,

396
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:41,728
they respond with
yellow creatures.

397
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:43,648
We're gonna fry in here.

398
00:43:43,649 --> 00:43:47,488
Question,
what do they want?

399
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:50,848
What are their goals?
They have no goals.

400
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:54,688
Well, you saw how
they disabled the truck.

401
00:43:54,689 --> 00:43:56,128
Listen, Hubbs,
I came down here

402
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:59,008
to get in a couple of weeks
of science in the sun,

403
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:01,888
I did not sign up for a war
against a bunch of goddamn ants.

404
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,328
And furthermore, why the hell

405
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:07,168
did you leave the truck
out there in the first place?

406
00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:09,088
Bait.

407
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:10,528
Bait?

408
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:12,448
Well, I had to get them
to attack us, didn't I?

409
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,368
They're rather intelligent,
you know.

410
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:19,168
I thought you'd observed that
geometric pattern in the field?

411
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:20,128
You mean you saw it?

412
00:44:20,129 --> 00:44:23,008
Of course I did.

413
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:25,408
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you?

414
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:28,288
Well, I didn't think you were
smart enough to appreciate it.

415
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:31,168
With all your high class
bug talk.

416
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:35,968
I was afraid that
you'd be terrified and run away,

417
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:37,408
and I need you.

418
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:42,208
Well, you're right about that.
When's the helicopter coming?

419
00:44:42,209 --> 00:44:46,048
James,
we are faced with a power

420
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:47,968
that has appeared
and is exerting itself.

421
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:50,368
We have the opportunity
to study it,

422
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:53,248
to learn from it, to teach it
its limitations.

423
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:56,608
We can, in a word,
educate it.

424
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:59,488
You said you called.

425
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:02,368
We can try the blue, of course,
but they'd only readapt again.

426
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:05,248
So we have to consider
other alternatives.

427
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:07,648
You mean you didn't call?

428
00:45:07,649 --> 00:45:11,008
It is absolutely vital that
we give them the opportunity

429
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:13,408
to try their strength
against ours,

430
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:15,328
and learn from its consequences.

431
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:17,248
I'm gonna call in, hubbs.

432
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:19,648
And I'm gonna tell them not only
to take that girl out of here,

433
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:24,448
I'm gonna tell them to take me
out of here too.

434
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:25,888
You wanna call?

435
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:30,208
You're just as fascinated
by this challenge as I am.

436
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:32,607
Ah!

437
00:45:35,009 --> 00:45:36,928
We're cut off.

438
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:41,247
Then our success
will be all the sweeter.

439
00:45:53,344 --> 00:45:54,784
<i>Sunday, one o'clock,</i>

440
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,184
<i>the battle is on,</i>

441
00:45:57,184 --> 00:45:59,104
<i>lesko is preparing</i>
<i>the counteraction</i>

442
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:01,024
<i>I have indicated.</i>

443
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,424
<i>The air conditioner</i>
<i>is being adjusted</i>

444
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:07,264
<i>to take account</i>
<i>of the temperature rise.</i>

445
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:10,624
<i>Human beings can exist</i>
<i>in temperatures of 120 degrees</i>

446
00:46:10,624 --> 00:46:12,064
<i>or higher.</i>

447
00:46:12,065 --> 00:46:16,383
<i>But our computer shuts down</i>
<i>at 90.</i>

448
00:46:21,665 --> 00:46:24,544
Kendra?

449
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:28,383
You wanna see
what we're doing?

450
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:33,183
Come on, I'll show you,
it's interesting.

451
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,944
The name of the game today
is king of the hill.

452
00:46:38,945 --> 00:46:42,303
You see over there?

453
00:46:42,304 --> 00:46:47,103
Now we wanna knock them down
before they burn us out, okay?

454
00:47:35,104 --> 00:47:37,023
What's that?

455
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:38,464
White sound.

456
00:47:38,465 --> 00:47:39,903
That's every sound in the world
all pushed together

457
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:41,823
to make one really
terrific noise

458
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:45,183
which we're broadcasting
to those mounds out there.

459
00:47:48,544 --> 00:47:50,944
And that's what it looks like
as we send it out.

460
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:53,824
Okay?

461
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:55,744
Now when that sound
gets out to those mounds,

462
00:47:55,745 --> 00:48:01,504
it bounces right back here
and winds up down there.

463
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:03,903
Good.
Something's missing.

464
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:08,224
One of the sounds we sent out
didn't come back.

465
00:48:08,225 --> 00:48:13,984
Now let's just see if we can
find out what that sound is.

466
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:21,183
There it is.

467
00:48:21,184 --> 00:48:24,544
Now that's the sound we're gonna
broadcast to those mounds.

468
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:28,863
And when we do, interesting
things better happen.

469
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:33,663
If you think that's loud for us

470
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:37,503
think about how those ants
are gonna feel.

471
00:48:44,705 --> 00:48:47,584
That'll do it.

472
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:33,183
They're going crazy.

473
00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:39,424
James?

474
00:51:39,425 --> 00:51:40,863
James?

475
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:44,223
Damn air conditioner.

476
00:51:44,704 --> 00:51:48,543
I'm afraid I'm feeling rather--
ow!

477
00:51:52,384 --> 00:51:53,343
It's on fire.
Get away from it.

478
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:56,703
Get out of the way.

479
00:53:29,344 --> 00:53:33,183
I just... I can't believe it.

480
00:53:33,184 --> 00:53:34,624
To know our plans,

481
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:36,063
our strength,
our weaknesses.

482
00:53:36,064 --> 00:53:41,344
Even the one machine
that everything else depends on.

483
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:43,743
How could they know?

484
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:47,104
This is impossible.

485
00:53:47,104 --> 00:53:49,503
They knew.

486
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:05,823
<i>I am choosing one of</i>
<i>my less painful moments</i>

487
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:09,182
<i>to record these notes.</i>

488
00:56:11,104 --> 00:56:15,423
<i>Our equipment</i>
<i>only functions now</i>

489
00:56:15,424 --> 00:56:18,303
<i>for a few hours at night.</i>

490
00:56:18,304 --> 00:56:21,663
<i>Lesko believes</i>
<i>we're being allowed this time</i>

491
00:56:21,664 --> 00:56:23,583
<i>for some purpose.</i>

492
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:27,423
<i>A hypothesis, I do not share.</i>

493
00:56:27,424 --> 00:56:29,823
<i>If this were so</i>

494
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:32,703
<i>it would raise questions</i>

495
00:56:32,704 --> 00:56:36,062
<i>I had not considered.</i>

496
00:56:37,984 --> 00:56:43,263
"Transfer to..."

497
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:49,503
"Nag tape unit three."

498
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:54,303
"Go straight six units."

499
00:56:54,304 --> 00:57:00,063
"Right 120 degrees"

500
00:57:00,064 --> 00:57:02,943
"four units."

501
00:57:02,944 --> 00:57:05,343
"Right 60 degrees"

502
00:57:05,344 --> 00:57:08,223
"four units."

503
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:11,103
"Right 120 degrees"

504
00:57:11,104 --> 00:57:14,462
"six units."

505
00:57:32,224 --> 00:57:35,582
What are you doing?

506
00:57:36,544 --> 00:57:38,463
What are you doing?

507
00:57:38,464 --> 00:57:41,823
I'm doing something my way.

508
00:57:41,824 --> 00:57:45,183
I'm sending a message
to the ants.

509
00:57:45,184 --> 00:57:48,063
Yes, I've been thinking
about that.

510
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:51,423
The conditioning process
must be working.

511
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:55,263
But they're not all affected
as yet.

512
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:58,143
They must be informed
of their losses

513
00:57:58,144 --> 00:58:00,063
and their suffering

514
00:58:00,064 --> 00:58:03,903
so they can draw
the appropriate conclusions.

515
00:58:03,904 --> 00:58:06,303
Where is your message?

516
00:58:06,304 --> 00:58:08,703
On the plotter.

517
00:58:18,784 --> 00:58:20,223
This is no message.

518
00:58:20,224 --> 00:58:22,143
Mathematics is
the universal language

519
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:24,063
among intelligent creatures.

520
00:58:24,064 --> 00:58:25,983
If there's an intelligence there

521
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:29,823
I want it to know
there's an intelligence here.

522
00:59:29,824 --> 00:59:32,223
Go away.

523
00:59:32,224 --> 00:59:37,023
Please go away.

524
00:59:55,744 --> 00:59:57,663
Hubbs: We're reviewing data.

525
00:59:57,664 --> 01:00:01,791
Previous analysis show...

526
01:00:04,192 --> 01:00:07,071
Do you wanna drink this?
Analysis...

527
01:00:07,072 --> 01:00:08,031
What?

528
01:00:08,032 --> 01:00:12,831
Clear, they failed to achieve
a...

529
01:00:13,312 --> 01:00:17,631
They will learn
we've made up our mind.

530
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:21,951
How did they know?
How did they know?

531
01:00:23,392 --> 01:00:25,791
You!

532
01:00:44,992 --> 01:00:47,391
Kendra: Jim! Jim!

533
01:00:47,392 --> 01:00:51,231
Jim: What's going on
back there?

534
01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:56,991
Hubbs. Hubbs.
Come on, come on.

535
01:00:56,992 --> 01:01:02,271
I am not helpless,
I will not be humiliated.

536
01:01:43,072 --> 01:01:45,951
Got him!

537
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:53,151
I'm sorry.

538
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:56,991
Come on, come on.

539
01:02:23,392 --> 01:02:26,751
Could you hold me
for a minute?

540
01:03:24,832 --> 01:03:27,711
James?

541
01:03:29,152 --> 01:03:32,031
James?

542
01:03:34,432 --> 01:03:41,151
If I was irrational during
the heat of the day,

543
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:44,031
I apologize.

544
01:03:48,832 --> 01:03:51,711
Why don't they kill us?

545
01:03:52,192 --> 01:03:57,951
Why roast us in here all day,
dare us to come out at night?

546
01:03:59,872 --> 01:04:03,230
Why play these games?

547
01:04:04,192 --> 01:04:07,551
What do they want?

548
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:10,911
I've been thinking about
specialization

549
01:04:10,912 --> 01:04:14,271
among certain insects.

550
01:04:15,232 --> 01:04:18,111
Take it easy.

551
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:20,991
Try to get some sleep.

552
01:04:20,992 --> 01:04:26,751
In every ant colony...

553
01:04:26,752 --> 01:04:33,471
Workers, winged males
and the queen.

554
01:04:33,472 --> 01:04:39,231
Ants are organized
by the queen.

555
01:04:39,232 --> 01:04:44,031
Keeping her alive.

556
01:04:44,032 --> 01:04:49,310
She's the heart and soul
of their lives.

557
01:04:51,232 --> 01:04:57,471
She's at the centre.
It is she who speaks.

558
01:04:57,472 --> 01:05:00,831
If she died,

559
01:05:00,832 --> 01:05:05,435
discipline, organization
would crumble.

560
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,391
The war's over, hubbs.

561
01:05:11,392 --> 01:05:15,231
They have the power.

562
01:05:15,232 --> 01:05:19,551
Only hope now is if they answer
our message in the morning.

563
01:05:19,552 --> 01:05:21,951
Convince them
we're worth keeping alive.

564
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:28,191
I think I could locate the queen
and kill her.

565
01:05:32,031 --> 01:05:38,270
Lock the tracker onto her voice
when she speaks.

566
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:43,551
What makes you think
she'd speak to you?

567
01:05:53,632 --> 01:05:56,031
What is it?

568
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,391
Th--the--the--

569
01:05:59,392 --> 01:06:02,271
lights.

570
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:06,108
Ha-ha, it's just a...

571
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:31,550
Bare in mind
we still have our hard suits.

572
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:35,390
Yeah, two of them.

573
01:06:46,432 --> 01:06:49,790
They're sending back my message.

574
01:06:51,232 --> 01:06:54,590
Hubbs, there's more.

575
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,870
What does it mean?

576
01:07:12,352 --> 01:07:15,710
What the hell does it mean?

577
01:07:15,711 --> 01:07:20,031
A circle with a dot.

578
01:07:20,032 --> 01:07:24,831
Now I know how a rat feels
in a maze.

579
01:07:28,672 --> 01:07:32,030
Rats in a maze.

580
01:07:32,031 --> 01:07:34,431
It's almost like
a controlled experiment

581
01:07:34,432 --> 01:07:40,191
in which we are the subjects.

582
01:07:40,192 --> 01:07:45,470
Find out which rat
is the smartest.

583
01:07:45,471 --> 01:07:48,350
The strongest.

584
01:07:53,632 --> 01:07:56,511
An intelligence test.

585
01:08:06,591 --> 01:08:10,910
Could the circle be this place?

586
01:08:13,792 --> 01:08:17,631
And what does the dot represent?

587
01:08:19,552 --> 01:08:22,431
Could the dot be a person?

588
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,351
Someone they want.

589
01:08:24,352 --> 01:08:27,710
Who could they want?

590
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:31,550
They want somebody?

591
01:08:32,032 --> 01:08:34,430
I think so.

592
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:37,791
But why would they want
somebody?

593
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:41,150
To talk to them.

594
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:43,070
You mean they...

595
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:47,391
They might be angry at someone
who did them some harm?

596
01:08:47,392 --> 01:08:50,271
What would they do
with that person?

597
01:08:50,272 --> 01:08:51,710
I don't know.

598
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:55,550
Would they let the others
go free?

599
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:56,991
James.

600
01:08:56,992 --> 01:08:59,871
Come here.

601
01:09:10,432 --> 01:09:16,670
I believe
I've located the queen.

602
01:09:22,431 --> 01:09:25,790
She's in there.

603
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:04,383
♪ Oh, sweet to walk ♪

604
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:10,719
♪ In the pilgrims way ♪

605

01:10:17,919 --> 01:10:24,159

607
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:30,879

♪ Leaning on the everla--♪

609
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:04,958
Where are the grenades?

610
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:08,319
Used up when you destroyed
the towers.

611
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,718
All of them?

612
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:17,438
Then we must devise
something else.

613
01:11:37,599 --> 01:11:39,999
James, please I...

614
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,438
My boots I...

615
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:44,318
Would you please,
I can't...

616
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:45,759
You're gonna walk out of here?

617
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,639
Trek miles through the desert?

618
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,078
Destroy a colony full of
poisonous ants

619
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:51,998
and a deadly queen?

620
01:11:51,999 --> 01:11:54,399
You can't even
get your boots on.

621
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,798
Come on,Hubbs, sit down.

622
01:11:56,799 --> 01:12:01,118
What we're gonna do
is send another message.

623
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,918
You must go!

624
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:10,238
You must show them

625
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,679
we will not...

626
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:16,479
Man will not give in.

627
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,999
Did I tell you I figured out
their first message?

628
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,879
The dot is you.

629
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,198
They want you.

630
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:38,558
And they shall soon have me.

631
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,959
I'm sorry,Hubbs,

632
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,318
it's not gonna happen your way.

633
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,678
Kendra.

634
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,638
Stop!
She's there.

635
01:13:36,639 --> 01:13:39,039
That hill, the queen.

636
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,959
Hubbs, you can't do it.
Now come on, come on!

637
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,358
Queen!

638
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,759
Hubbs!

639
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:10,719
Hubbs!

640
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,559
Hubbs!

641
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,479
Hubbs!

642
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,359
Goddamn you.

643
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,758
Hubbs!

644
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,598
<i>I would still like</i>
<i>to believe that given time</i>

645
01:14:49,599 --> 01:14:53,438
<i>we could have come</i>
<i>to an understanding.</i>

646
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:56,318
<i>Some rational accommodation</i>
<i>of interests,</i>

647
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:00,638
<i>some agreement.</i>

648
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:05,438
<i>But that's not the way</i>
<i>it's going to be.</i>

649
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:14,079
<i>I've made some calculations</i>
<i>about their rate of expansion</i>

650
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,919
<i>using their intelligence and</i>
<i>their powers of organization,</i>

651
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,318
<i>and their network</i>
<i>of communications,</i>

652
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:22,238
<i>their poisons.</i>

653
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,158
<i>Their ability to adapt</i>
<i>genetically.</i>

654
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:27,038
<i>I believe that after</i>
<i>this test run now</i>

655
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:29,439
<i>they'll move rather quickly</i>
<i>into desert areas.</i>

656
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,319
<i>Taking over the countryside</i>
<i>first</i>

657
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,678
<i>then laying siege to towns</i>
<i>and cities.</i>

658
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:38,079
<i>I believe they will learn</i>
<i>as they advance,</i>

659
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:43,358
<i>anticipating our moves and</i>
<i>continue to stay a move ahead.</i>

660
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:46,238
<i>We have only one chance,</i>

661
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:49,599
<i>the counter attack</i>
<i>suggested by doctor Hubbs.</i>

662
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,958
<i>A direct assault</i>
<i>on their queen.</i>

663
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:56,798
<i>Jesus, I wish it wasn't me.</i>

664
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:08,798
There you are.

665
01:17:29,919 --> 01:17:31,838
They wanted...

666
01:17:31,839 --> 01:17:34,046
Us.

667
01:17:57,567 --> 01:18:01,406
<i>We knew then,</i>
<i>we were being changed</i>

668
01:18:01,407 --> 01:18:04,766
<i>and made part of their world.</i>

669
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:09,566
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>for what purpose.</i>

670
01:18:10,047 --> 01:18:13,886
<i>But we knew we would be told.</i>
