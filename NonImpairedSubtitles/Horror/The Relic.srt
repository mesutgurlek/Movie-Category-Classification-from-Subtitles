1
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,525
Oh, my God! The Kothoga.

2
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,662
Captain! Captain!

3
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,423
Captain, my crates.
Have you loaded my crates?

4
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,300
They can't go. They have to come off.

5
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,928
-Who the hell are you?
-My name is John Whitney.

6
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,102
The crates, they're consigned
to the Natural History Museum in Chicago.

7
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,931
-Just tell me if they're onboard.
-Crates is all we have onboard, señor.

8
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,483
No, they have to come off.
This is extremely important.

9
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,649
Nothing comes off after customs
has been on, señor.

10
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,779
-That's more important.
-Look. Look, I'll take care of you, all right?

11
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,828
If you'll just get the manifest.
The Natural History Museum in Chicago.

12
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,076
-Please, compadre.
-I don't have time for this.

13
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,204
I have to get my ship out of the harbor.
I'm eight hours late,

14
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,751
and there's weather coming in.

15
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,295
Don't worry, señor.
We'll take good care of your crates.

16
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,734
Morning, Lieutenant.
Coast Guard found it early this morning.

17
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,109
Don't really know how long it's been there
or how it got there.

18
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,816
-What are those?
-The old coal tunnels.

19
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,870
There was a time when 30 coal barges a day
would come into this slip.

20
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,118
I'm touched. Who the hell is onboard?

21
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,245
-Hollingsworth.
-Wonderful.

22
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,296
Morning, Lieutenant.
Just been to the front of the boat.

23
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,998
I got something to show you.

24
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:52,507
It's a ship, Hollingsworth, not a boat.
And the pointy end is the bow.

25
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,297
Custody hearing went badly?

26
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,549
I don't wanna talk about it.

27
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,308
She got Jerry?

28
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,101
What part of "I don't want to talk about it"
is unclear?

29
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,730
-Oh, shit.
-His ex-wife got custody of his son?

30
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,812
-His dog.
-His dog?

31
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,448
Yeah, he really loves that dog.

32
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,451
The ship's registered out of Brazil.
Came down through the seaway.

33
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,406
Paperwork looks legit.

34
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,422
It's blood. Lab's checking it for type.

35
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,256
-Any bodies?
-Nope. Not a one.

36
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,383
When the Coast Guard found it,

37
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,385
it was floundering
in the middle of Lake Michigan.

38
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,843
So they towed it in, and nobody knows
how long it had been like that.

39
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,179
-You checked the manifest?
-We're doing it now.

40
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,520
-Bring in the dogs?
-The drug unit's been over the whole thing.

41
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,695
I told them it was a waste of time.
I mean, this was obviously a drug hit.

42
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,444
Whatever they came for, they found.

43
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,953
Now, I figure they came aboard at night,
they killed everyone,

44
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,489
and they threw the bodies overboard.

45
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,200
You figured all that out by yourself?

46
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,002
-Holy shit!
-What?

47
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,710
-What?
-Cat. Nearly gave me a heart attack.

48
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,292
-Was it a black cat?
-No.

49
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,805
What's that smell?

50
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,678
-Is the bilge below here?
-I think so.

51
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,933
Give me that.

52
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,647
Give me a hand here.

53
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,226
What a stink!

54
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,702
Jesus Christ.

55
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,173
Let's all stay together.

56
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:06,345
Please walk! Walk! Walk, children. Walk!

57
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:11,438
Walk. Please, walk. Walk.
Let's all stay together.

58
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,644
-I say we go.
-Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.

59
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,354
We finally cut school
and you wanna go to a museum.

60
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,280
Maybe afterwards we could go to a library.

61
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,656
They've got mummies in there,
eyeballs in jars, dead stuff.

62
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,611
See, man, I don't know about this stuff.

63
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,665
Look, we can go in with them,
check it out, split.

64
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,289
I mean, we can't go
to an arcade yet anyway.

65
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,665
We'd be noticed.

66
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,873
-So, what are you, scared?
-No, I'm not scared!

67
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,013
Hey, didn't your parents teach you
not to stare?

68
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,645
Didn't yours teach you
not to get dressed in the street?

69
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,317
-Good morning, Dr. Green.
-Good morning.

70
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,817
-Doctor?
-What kind of a doctor are you?

71
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,239
I'm an evolutionary biologist.

72
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,737
What's that?

73
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,820
Someone trying to figure out
where our tails went.

74
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,654
Your teacher's gonna be looking for you.

75
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,785
Oh, yeah. Come on, Eugene.

76
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:15,707
Kids, do not run. Walk. Walk. Easy.
Do not run, walk.

77
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,301
Walk, kids. Walk.

78
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,047
-Walk.
-Good morning, Dr. Green.

79
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,349
-Good morning, Fred.
-These kids are driving me crazy.

80
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,269
Careful. They're our future benefactors.

81
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,772
Margo, I need to speak with you
about your grant.

82
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,695
-You've heard already?
-I've heard something.

83
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,488
-I didn't get it.
-No. It's not that bad.

84
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:45,945
It's just that the Blaisedale Foundation
has decided to delay their decision.

85
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,659
-Delay? Why?
-Greg Lee is applying for the same grant.

86
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,330
Greg?

87
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,164
-I thought he had his grant.
-Well, he's going after another one.

88
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,466
Can he do that? Another one?

89
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,841
I mean, doesn't he realize
that I have to shut down my work

90
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:08,050
-if I don't get that money?
-I don't suppose he's thought about that.

91
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,311
-Slimy.
-Margo, have a little faith in yourself.

92
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,763
-You're better than he is.
-Faith?

93
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,776
Come on. It's not the end of the world.
It's just a little competition.

94
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,274
You've got the gala coming up
night after next,

95
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,401
and the Blaisedales are going to be here.

96
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,574
-You know? The Blaisedales.
-Yes.

97
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,403
So put on your party dress,
and I'll introduce you,

98
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,910
and you show them just how bright you are.

99
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,991
I just wanna do my work.

100
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,002
You know, Greg will be there,

101
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,581
attaching himself to the Blaisedales
like a crustacean.

102
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,672
Donna, did you get the gecko
and lizard samples loaded?

103
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,133
It's through the replicator.
We got a big sample.

104
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,061
Great. Hey, Charlie.
Did we get the database back online?

105
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,763
-It's online, but I don't know for how long.
-Good.

106
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,895
-Hello, Greg. How nice to see you!
-Margo.

107
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,188
-How's the old research going?
-Fine. I'm just a little bit busy.

108
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,195
Could there be anything special
that you'd like to tell me?

109
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,653
Of course not. 'Cause if there was,
you would've just come out and told me.

110
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,829
I have every right to apply for any grant.

111
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,079
So you go behind my back
and apply for my grant?

112
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:19,129
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-It's not your grant until you get it.

113
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,003
If I don't get it, I'm out of work.
My staff is out of work.

114
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,512
-You shouldn't take it so personally.
-You really are a gerbil.

115
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,538
Margo. Well, this is a surprise.

116
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,837
-I was just... I thought...
-I asked Margo to join us, Ann.

117
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,757
-I hope you don't mind.
-Oh, no. Of course not.

118
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,756
No word from John yet,
but these crates arrived this morning.

119
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:12,386
They were supposed to be on a ship
except there was some mix-up in Brazil,

120
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,184
and they never made it.
They were sent by air freight.

121
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,387
Here, here. Take a look at this.

122
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,144
-The Kothoga.
-Could be.

123
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,271
And what does this god specialize in?

124
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:26,526
South American tribe, the Zenzera,
long thought to be extinct.

125
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,949
They made a deal with Satan
to vanquish their enemies.

126
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,992
So, Kothoga was born, son of Satan.
You have that look again, Margo.

127
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,699
Why do we keep financing
John Whitney's expeditions,

128
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,705
as if superstition
were the same thing as science?

129
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,789
Anthropologists are permitted
to believe in myth. It's part of their job.

130
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,502
In any case, our superstition exhibit
is excellent box office for this museum,

131
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,211
and that benefits you, as well.

132
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,922
Using superstition
to bring people to the museum

133
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,259
is like hiring topless ushers
for the Bolshoi Ballet.

134
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,436
Well, if they did, I might go to the ballet.

135
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,606
Do you really think the restoration
department can do something with this?

136
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,229
Certainly. Possibly even for the opening.

137
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,526
What was in this other crate?

138
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,945
Except for the packing leaves, it was empty.

139
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,116
Empty? Well, was there a packing list?
There must've been something in here.

140
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,070
Crates were nailed shut when they arrived.

141
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,412
-Strange.
-What?

142
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,040
Do you think these are eggs?

143
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:30,005
More like fungus. Probably parasitical.
Best not to take any chances.

144
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:34,844
Quite right. Let's see to having those leaves
and crates incinerated.

145
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,145
Of course you can, Margo.

146
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:01,033
Attention, please. The museum
will be closing in 1 5 minutes. Thank you.

147
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,513
Hey, man, this stuff is so cool.

148
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:25,065
-I don't think we're supposed to be here.
-Don't be such a wuss, Eugene.

149
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,193
Attention, please.
The museum is now closed.

150
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,566
Attention, please.
The museum is now closed.

151
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,825
We're gonna get in big trouble.

152
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,871
What do you think they're gonna do?
Put us in the museum jail?

153
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,959
Johnson? Davis? That you?

154
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,764
Dr. Green, I've worked myself to the bone.

155
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,264
Please let me go home. I need to rest.

156
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,850
All right, you guys.
You can finish tomorrow morning.

157
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,147
Go on. Take a hike.

158
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:46,206
Why don't we just start yelling?
Someone will show us the way out of here.

159
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,583
And call our moms and let them know
that we cut class.

160
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,538
Great idea, butt wipe.

161
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,127
Hey, man, there's a really cool
staircase back here.

162
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,056
-No, let's just get out of here.
-What are you, scared?

163
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,661
Hello? Is someone there?

164
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,261
Josh? Josh, where are you?

165
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,764
Josh.

166
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,314
Josh, come on. This isn't funny.

167
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,326
-You goofball. You almost wet your pants.
-Josh.

168
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,949
Quiet. Do you hear something?

169
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,576
-What is it?
-I don't know.

170
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,581
-Let's just go.
-Yeah.

171
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,094
-You smell something?
-You farted, didn't you?

172
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,053
No, not lately.

173
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,106
Let's get out of here.

174
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,247
That's terrific.

175
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,920
Hang on to your fucking hat, Lieutenant.

176
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,920
I want to interview every employee
whether they worked yesterday or not.

177
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,844
If they did work, I want the hours,
what part of the building,

178
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,216
if they saw the victim, what time and where.

179
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,594
Who was the last person
to leave the building yesterday?

180
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,223
-A Dr. Green.
-Good. I wanna talk to him.

181
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,773
-Did you hear?
-No.

182
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,569
-I'm guessing you're gonna tell me.
-Someone's been killed.

183
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,319
-Murder.
-Oh, my God.

184
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,536
They're not telling us who. All I know is
they cut off the whole basement level.

185
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,738
Murdered?

186
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,074
I'm betting it was Colonel Mustard
with a candlestick.

187
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:41,381
What? What are you thinking?
You think I'm an asshole, right? Is that it?

188
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,292
-Are you Dr. Green?
-Yes, I am.

189
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,718
Could you come with me, please?

190
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,967
-It's okay, honey.
-I understand...

191
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:52,266
-It's gonna be all right.
-All right, that's good. All right.

192
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,186
Take them both to the 1 5th.
I want detailed statements

193
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,103
in the presence of a psychologist.

194
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,182
Museum security wants to know
if they can open the doors.

195
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,312
No. Check to see
if they got anything on video.

196
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,394
I did that, sir. They don't have
surveillance cameras down here.

197
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,526
-Can I help you?
-Lieutenant D'Agosta wants to see me.

198
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,074
-He does?
-This is Dr. Green.

199
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,661
Yeah. Dr. Green, I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta.
I wanted to ask you some questions,

200
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,239
but I'm fresh on the scene here.
Can I find you later?

201
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,870
-Can I go to my lab?
-Not yet.

202
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,327
We'll clear the work areas
as soon as we can.

203
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,913
-What am I supposed to do?
-Enjoying your mochas, gentlemen?

204
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,586
-The smell!
-Take it outside, Martini.

205
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,293
I'm okay. I'm okay.

206
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,473
-This look familiar to you?
-Yep.

207
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,435
This is not good.

208
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,689
Never thought there was a worse way to die
than a shark attack.

209
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,320
Having my head ripped off
never occurred to me.

210
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,652
-Where is his head?
-It's over there by the sink.

211
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,453
Lieutenant D'Agosta... Oh, my God!

212
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,324
Get her out of here.

213
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,289
Lieutenant, over here.

214
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,128
No, don't step over it. It's bad luck.

215
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,675
Jesus Christ.

216
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,969
There's a half-burnt joint on the floor.

217
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,798
Seems our boy was having
a little pot on the potty.

218
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,557
Pot's a misdemeanor.
Decapitation seems a bit severe.

219
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,188
I want the blood on the walls.
Get a ballistic analysis.

220
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:29,651
Pinpoint source, speed, force,
full splatter pattern.

221
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,153
Sweep in teams of two.
Nobody goes in alone.

222
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:40,161
This place is not gonna open
until every room is clear. Now, go.

223
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,666
Now, the question is,
what does a museum guard

224
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,749
have to do with a drug hit
on a South American ship?

225
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,550
-I don't know.
-The answer is, maybe nothing.

226
00:23:56,352 --> 00:24:01,096
Dr. Cuthbert. Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta,
Chicago homicide.

227
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,940
Lieutenant, this is Tom Parkinson,
our director of security.

228
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,393
Have you identified the victim,
Lieutenant Augustino?

229
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,728
D'Agosta.

230
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,029
Victim's name is Frederick Ford.

231
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,483
Freddy Ford? What a terrible, terrible thing.

232
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,320
Yeah. I'd say
somebody was really pissed off at him.

233
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,745
Any thoughts on who that might be?

234
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,539
No. He was a very sweet man.
I have no idea.

235
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,662
I hardly knew the guy.

236
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:26,666
Lieutenant, I don't mean to downplay
the horror of this tragedy

237
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:30,466
or the urgency of your investigation,
but what about the museum?

238
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,088
I'm going to do this in layers.

239
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,591
You'll be allowed in your offices
once we've been through the building

240
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,263
and determined that there is no danger.

241
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,716
But what about our exhibition space?
When will that open?

242
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,598
We have a major exhibit about to open.

243
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:45,056
The board is hosting a gala preview
here tomorrow night.

244
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,015
It's so vital to us.

245
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,689
I can't tell you exactly when.

246
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,738
Lieutenant, we've invested so much in this.

247
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,033
It would be a disaster for us
if we had to postpone.

248
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,988
We're checking your offices and labs first
so you people can go back, do your work.

249
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,540
It won't take long. Now,
as far as the areas open to the public,

250
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,742
we may have somebody on our hands

251
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,374
who makes Jeffery Dahmer
look like a Cub Scout,

252
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,080
and I've got to be sure he's not here.

253
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:31,151
Dr. Green.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

254
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,649
Okay.

255
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,484
-What's that stuff you were looking at?
-DNA strands.

256
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,991
Did you come all the way down here
to learn about DNA?

257
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,161
No.

258
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,241
I hope you don't mind walking.
I have to return these samples.

259
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,496
Well, if I get tired, I'll let you know.

260
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,625
-What's the soup today?
-Rhinoceros megarhinus.

261
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,461
He's making rhinoceros soup?

262
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,382
It's a maceration tank.
Skin them, toss them in the warm water,

263
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,215
wait until the meat and flesh fall off,
and then give them to the beetles.

264
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,674
Beetles as in bug beetles?

265
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,143
Domestic beetles are
a fairly common insect.

266
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,222
They eat the flesh off almost anything.
They pick the bones clean.

267
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,729
Better watch yourself.
Someone left the glass case open last night

268
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,854
and a bunch hit the highway.

269
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,776
Well, they know better
than to head for the cafeteria.

270
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:17,322
I'm sorry you had to see all that
at the crime scene.

271
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,905
I said hello to that man every day
for the past six years.

272
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,328
You could have closed the door.

273
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,073
-Did you know him well?
-No.

274
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,535
Wait.

275
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,126
-Is it face up?
-Down.

276
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,753
Don't touch it. Face down's bad luck.

277
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,426
Don't tell me you're superstitious.

278
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,676
Sorry, but around here, every penny counts.

279
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,804
What the hell's all this?

280
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,682
This is one of six storage areas
for the collection.

281
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:51,265
The museum has something
like 3 million specimens.

282
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,477
Exhibition areas only show about 2%
of what the museum owns.

283
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,857
It doesn't look like a good place
to light a match.

284
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,742
According to museum security,
you were the last one to leave last night.

285
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,492
-Did you see or hear anything strange?
-No.

286
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,997
Well, I thought I heard something
as I was leaving,

287
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,747
but it could have been anything. I was tired.

288
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,329
What can you tell me about John Whitney?
You know him?

289
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,166
-Unfortunately.
-His office was vandalized last night.

290
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,381
Sir.

291
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,387
Wow.

292
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,178
Do you have any idea
what might have been in this office

293
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,805
that someone would want so damn bad?

294
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,853
I have no idea why anyone would want
anything of John Whitney's.

295
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,147
But I've been told
mine's a subjective opinion.

296
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,067
You ever see John Whitney with Fred Ford?
Were they friends?

297
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,189
No.

298
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,648
-Does John Whitney use or sell drugs?
-I don't think so.

299
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:45,574
John Whitney's not in Brazil
shipping drugs, just insignificant relics.

300
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,740
-Brazil?
-Yeah, a couple of crates came in yesterday.

301
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,541
-What was in them?
-One had a smashed relic.

302
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,084
The other was empty.

303
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,629
-So there was nothing inside?
-That's what empty means.

304
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,964
-Could it have been pried open?
-It was nailed shut.

305
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,666
Could it have been pried open
and then nailed shut?

306
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,844
I suppose so. What are you suggesting?
That there were drugs in the crate?

307
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,673
I don't suggest. Where are those crates?

308
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,476
They were burned,
but the relic's in the restoration department.

309
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,359
Perri Masai, our restorative genius,
Lieutenant D'Agosta.

310
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,401
Hi.

311
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:22,072
Well, this is John Whitney's relic
or what's left of it.

312
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,068
-Any idea what it looks like?
-With black stone, it's difficult.

313
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,027
It's a chimera of some kind.

314
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,829
-What's a chimera?
-It's a combination of creatures

315
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,284
that superstitious people
see as god or enemy.

316
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,461
What kind of superstitious people?

317
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,714
Here's my card.
If you think of anything else...

318
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,340
You're welcome.

319
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,643
Lieutenant D'Agosta,

320
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,064
it's lovely to see you
under such alarming circumstances.

321
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,068
Seven decapitations in one week.

322
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,443
Don't you just hate someone
who only takes head and never gives it?

323
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,319
You're bad, Matilda, real bad.

324
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,449
Autopsy attended by Lieutenant Vincent
D'Agosta, Chicago homicide.

325
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,744
-I heard your ex got custody of the dog.
-What, it's on the goddamn Internet?

326
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,168
You shouldn't have been late
on your Alpo payments.

327
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:23,046
We have an African American male,
probably age 55 to 60.

328
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:27,004
Height, 5'4", with his head, maybe 6'1 ".

329
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,808
Weight, 1 60, give or take,
if you know what I mean.

330
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,427
There are an undetermined
number of lacerations

331
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,310
preceding from the left anterior pectoral
region downward through the sternum,

332
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,518
terminating at the right
anterior abdominal region.

333
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:44,405
The pectoralis minor and pectoralis major
are separated to a great degree.

334
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,277
And there is spontaneous dehiscence.

335
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,702
The sternal process has been split
and the rib cage exposed.

336
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,373
Now for the head. The head is decapitated

337
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,376
between the axial process and the atlas.

338
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,954
The entire occipital portion of the calvarium

339
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,506
and half the parietal process
has been crushed

340
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,801
or rather seemingly punched through
and removed,

341
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,256
Ieaving a hole perhaps 5 inches in diameter.

342
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,719
The skull is empty.
The entire brain appears to have fallen out

343
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,475
or been extracted through this hole.

344
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:21,229
-Any idea about a weapon?
-Something big.

345
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,103
The brain is severely traumatized

346
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,235
and appears to have been severed
at the medulla oblongata.

347
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,488
The pons Varolii is intact but separate.

348
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,242
The cerebrum has been completely severed
from the mesencephalon.

349
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:39,623
And... Hey. Hey, wait a minute,
this brain's light, even for a man.

350
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,672
Something's missing, Lieutenant.
Where's the rest of it?

351
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,468
-You got everything we found.
-There is no thalamic region.

352
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:52,055
-There is no pituitary gland.
-What are you talking about?

353
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:56,761
The thalamus and hypothalamus
regulate body temperature, blood pressure,

354
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:01,349
heartbeat, it regulates hundreds
of hormones into the bloodstream.

355
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,559
-Don't you agree, Fred?
-Yes.

356
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,940
He never shuts up.

357
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,132
That was fast.

358
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,967
Glycotetraline collagenoid,
Weinstein's thyrotropic hormone.

359
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:42,940
Tenascin, oxytocin, monoxytocin,
suppressive hormones.

360
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,694
This fungus is loaded with hormones,
animal hormones.

361
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,854
What kind of fungus is this?

362
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,913
Hollingsworth, I hope
I'm interrupting your dinner.

363
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,750
Listen, dig up whatever records
we have on those bodies from the ship.

364
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,251
If there were any autopsies done,

365
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,964
check and see if any part of the brain
was missing from any of the heads.

366
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,097
I don't care how long it takes.
Hey, let me ask you something.

367
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,020
How the fuck does somebody
get custody of a dog?

368
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,482
-Good night.
-Good night, ma'am.

369
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:28,175
-Morning, Lieutenant.
-Pretty fancy.

370
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,515
It only took seven months planning.

371
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,561
You know, I really hope
you can have your party tonight.

372
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,358
So do I.

373
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,187
We may have a majorly crazy person
somewhere in this building

374
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,023
and I don't think you'd want him
showing up tonight.

375
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,074
No, we can't have that.

376
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:50,284
-This is a big deal, isn't it?
-Very big.

377
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:55,035
-This party will raise a lot of money, right?
-A lot of money. Very high profile.

378
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,714
The Mayor is coming, the media,
big companies that give lots of grants,

379
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,133
-limousines, the whole schmeer.
-Tell you what, we'll find this guy

380
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,756
so you can have your party.

381
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:08,090
Lieutenant, do you like smoked salmon
on those little round toasty things?

382
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,267
-I don't think I've ever had it.
-Well, if you don't catch your man,

383
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,312
there's going to be about 300 pounds of it.

384
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,402
Yeah, but have you tried
the lattes with the whole milk?

385
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,490
-Very smooth.
-I like espresso. Forget smooth.

386
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,405
-What the fuck do you know?
-I know I like espresso.

387
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,116
-Yeah, but have you tried lattes?
-No.

388
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,704
There's supposed to be a door
around here someplace.

389
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,837
Here it is. Here it is.

390
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,718
Jesus.

391
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,978
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

392
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,644
I don't know where the hell we are.

393
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,027
Maybe I'm reading this map wrong,
I don't know.

394
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,026
Hey! Hey! Look at this!

395
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,282
Jesus.

396
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,825
Is that a footprint?

397
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,713
-He's got to be over 7 feet tall.
-Looks like blood.

398
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,083
I think it is blood.

399
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,184
Good morning, Lieutenant.
How are you today?

400
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,892
-What have you got?
-Right.

401
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,985
-Well, we checked on that hypo...
-Hypothalamus.

402
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,952
Right. Anyway, what heads we were able

403
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,372
to salvage from the Santos Morales
were pretty decomposed.

404
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,544
But they were all missing
their hypothalamuses.

405
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,965
Why thank you, Hollingsworth.

406
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,914
It's the consistent repetition
of sequences of three

407
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:46,089
that are unique to each individual.
But before you begin DNA testing,

408
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,757
you have to be able
to identify the specimen.

409
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,052
With your financial grant,

410
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,633
the complicated, tedious task
of specimen identification

411
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,803
will become a quick,
certain, analytical technique.

412
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,856
Procedure. Mode?. System.

413
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,482
Just give me the goddamn money. Shit.

414
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,737
One of the kids i n your lab told me
where to find you.

415
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,995
Well, I was just rehearsing.

416
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,495
-You were really good.
-Y eah. Right.

417
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,170
Really good ending.

418
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,794
Hey! Hold on.

419
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:39,343
-So, what's your field exactly? Biology?
-Evolutionary biology.

420
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,019
-Are we still evolving?
-Some of us.

421
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,683
Look, Lieutenant, I'm really busy right now,
and I don't have time to be socializing,

422
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:50,270
-so if you don't mind.
-I'm not here to ask you out, Dr. Green.

423
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,480
I just thought
there might be something else

424
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,486
you could tell me
about John Whitney's work.

425
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,452
Well, I'll take you to Dr. Frock, our curator.

426
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,155
He could probably explain John Whitney
better than I can.

427
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,753
-It's Margo.
-Who have you brought me?

428
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,454
A policeman. Lieutenant D'Agosta.

429
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:13,669
Well, how goes the gradual extinction
of the human race, Lieutenant?

430
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,550
I'm doing what I can to keep it orderly.

431
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,304
You and the lieutenant are kindred spirits.
He's very superstitious.

432
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:23,933
-I don't know about "very."
-Well, you must excuse Margo, Lieutenant.

433
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,639
She believes that science
must destroy myth,

434
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:31,444
and as a consequence, she has very little
patience with superstitious people like us.

435
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,523
Margo, did I ever tell you
about my experiences

436
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,699
with the Khoe tribe in Botswana land?

437
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,573
-Yes, more than once.
-Haven't told him.

438
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:45,492
The Khoe tribe, Lieutenant, believed
that headaches were caused by sorcery

439
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:50,497
and the pin poke of the headache victim
would identify the sorcerer,

440
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,422
and then go off and murder him.

441
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:57,095
Of course, the kinfolk of the sorcerer
would feel they had to avenge his death,

442
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,467
so they'd go and in turn
kill the headache victim.

443
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,676
And I'm sure you can imagine
how it eventually all turned out.

444
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,761
-What's that?
-Well, it's a medical miracle.

445
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,393
Everybody stopped having headaches.

446
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,850
Lieutenant, what would
a superstitious police officer

447
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,186
possibly want with an old fossil like me?

448
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,897
-He wants to know about John Whitney.
-You think there's some connection

449
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,699
between the vandalism in John's office
and the murder?

450
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,323
Maybe.
What's John Whitney doing in Brazil?

451
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:24,872
Well, John's an anthropologist.
He's in Brazil studying ancient tribes,

452
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,451
their rituals, their environmental
and social relations, their culture.

453
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,286
When was the last time
you heard from him?

454
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,542
I haven't had actual contact with him
for months,

455
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,500
but just yesterday, we received
a wonderful artifact.

456
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,007
Yeah. I took a look at it.

457
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,008
That artifact's rather important
to me, Lieutenant,

458
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,966
because it may help to illuminate
a scientific theory

459
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,052
I've been expounding for some time.

460
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,387
-The Callisto Effect.
-What's that?

461
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:52,272
It's a commonly-held belief that life evolved
gradually by natural selection.

462
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,396
Dr. Frock argues that sometimes
there are sudden evolutionary changes

463
00:42:56,491 --> 00:43:00,575
that create a grotesque
and short-lived aberrant species.

464
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:05,621
Okay, so, John Whitney's down in Brazil
studying ancient tribal rituals.

465
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,413
Could any of these rituals
have anything to do with, say,

466
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,870
ripping out the human hypothalamus?

467
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,377
-I beg your pardon?
-Human hypothalamus?

468
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,094
Never mind.

469
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,803
You smell that?

470
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,516
It's that same stink
from where they found that guard.

471
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,896
Better get some backup down here.

472
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,933
2-4, 2-4, this is 2-6, you copy?

473
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,939
Shit! We're under too much concrete.

474
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,355
What the fuck was that?

475
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,193
-Was that in front of us?
-It's hard to tell.

476
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,333
The guy was a convicted rapist.
He's a suspect in a couple of murders,

477
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,751
two terms of hard time,

478
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,170
and he fits the description
given to us by the two boys.

479
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,498
Those kids didn't see him
commit the murder.

480
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,834
Lieutenant, come on.
This place, it could've been anything.

481
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,839
He attacked McNally with a fucking ax.

482
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,886
You know,
you wanna take somebody's head off,

483
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:48,967
-an ax is a pretty good way to do it.
-I know. I know, I know, I know, I know.

484
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,894
-So what's the matter?
-Something's not right.

485
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,604
-What's not right?
-Something.

486
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,056
Something what?

487
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,016
You're a pain in the ass, you know that?

488
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,443
Hey, here comes the rent-a-cop.

489
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,778
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

490
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,370
-Can I get a little help here?
-Congratulations, Lieutenant.

491
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,998
-Looks like you've got your man.
-Maybe.

492
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,912
-Maybe?
-Maybe.

493
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,966
The man was covered in the dead guard's
blood. He was carrying his wallet.

494
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,510
He tried to cut his head off with an ax.

495
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,555
-What do you need? A videotape?
-That'd help.

496
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,717
-This is nuts.
-Hey, something's wrong.

497
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,722
We got a homeless ex-con
who gets his jollies

498
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,724
from ripping out people's hypothalamuses?

499
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,227
What's he doing?
Starting a hypothalamus collection?

500
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,776
This guy gets on a boat sailing from Brazil,
he kills everyone onboard,

501
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,569
then he catches a cab to the museum,

502
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,443
where he hides in the closet
in the sub-basement.

503
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,900
I don't know anything
about boats from Brazil,

504
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,953
but it's obvious to me
that this man killed Frederick Ford.

505
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,999
Two plus two, Lieutenant,
in my book, that's four.

506
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,168
You have to let the gala go on tonight.

507
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:00,042
I don't have to let anything go on tonight.

508
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,172
Asshole.

509
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,639
-Lieutenant.
-What's this?

510
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,133
We found this under the guy's bed.

511
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,099
Jaime Martinez.

512
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:19,858
He was one of the victims
on the Santos Morales.

513
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,152
-Shit.
-This has gotta be our guy.

514
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,860
-Lieutenant, it's for you.
-Who is it?

515
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,698
-Hello?
-This is Mayor Owen.

516
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,700
What's your first name, Lieutenant?

517
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,581
-Vincent.
-May I call you Vincent?.

518
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:40,661
-Sure.
-Good.

519
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,121
You can call me Your Honor.

520
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,958
Tell you what, Vincent.
Looking forward to this gala tonight.

521
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,635
My wife is, too. She bought a killer dress
that shows off her cleavage.

522
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,055
Have you ever seen my wife's cleavage?.
It's in all the papers.

523
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,598
I can't say that I have, Your Honor.

524
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,518
Well, you're one of the few people
in the city of Chicago who hasn't.

525
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,269
That cleavage helped get me elected.

526
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,264
I'll bet you don't know what to say.

527
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:00,727
No, sir, I don't.

528
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,434
So the thing is, Vincent,
this gala tonight is very important.

529
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,770
It's important to the museum,
it's important to my wife,

530
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:11,026
it's important to the city, and it's real
important to Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.

531
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,743
-You know who they are?.
-No.

532
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,412
Well, they're good friends of mine,
real good friends.

533
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,156
They're good friends of the city.

534
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,620
Real good friends.

535
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,373
I was so upset when I thought
they would be disappointed tonight

536
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:24,206
until I heard the wonderful news
that you caught that murderer.

537
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:28,710
T errible business. Anyway, I called
to congratulate you on a job well done.

538
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,011
I'm so happy we'll be having
that gala tonight.

539
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,180
I'm gonna call the chief and tell him
just how happy I am.

540
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,256
Nice talking to you, Vincent.

541
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,816
I'm going to clear the wings
of museum personnel

542
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,230
and open only the central exhibition area.

543
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,861
And I'm going to maintain
police presence throughout.

544
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,117
How much police presence?

545
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,285
As much as I goddamn deem necessary.

546
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,919
-Tell Bert...
-What?

547
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,543
I wanna make a final sweep
while the wings are still closed.

548
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,090
Give me a team of dogs.

549
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:11,886
But we already swept with dogs, Lieutenant,
right after we found the body.

550
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,588
So get better dogs. I'll take them down
myself, and you're coming with me.

551
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:27,871
Dermestes vulpinus.
That's the dermestid beetle.

552
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:33,380
Match with 33% Hemidactylus turcicus.

553
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,093
Hemidactylus turcicus?.
What the hell's that?

554
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,136
Have you seen Greg?

555
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,309
-He's down there.
-Thanks.

556
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,389
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.
How wonderful you look this evening.

557
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,270
I'm Greg Lee.

558
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:53,650
I'm Greg Lee, Mr. Blaisedale.
How rich you look this evening.

559
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,946
Good evening, Mr. Blaisedale.
I didn't know you have a daughter.

560
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,619
Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt
your little meeting.

561
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,197
-You not going to the party?
-I'm going.

562
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,999
Don't get your greedy little hopes up.

563
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,202
Can you identify these species?

564
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,787
Now you want my help?

565
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:12,419
Look, can you identify them or not?

566
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,387
Hemidactylus turcicus.
That's a Turkish gecko.

567
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:19,839
-Gecko?
-Yeah, a lizard.

568
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,141
Yes, I know what a gecko is.

569
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:25,015
But reptilian and beetle DNA
on the same strand?

570
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,515
Well, maybe your source is contaminated.

571
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,848
It's not contaminated.
I scraped the cells myself.

572
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,274
Then it's your software.

573
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:35,151
Of course, I'd be shocked to think
that it may not be 1 00% accurate.

574
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,444
You can get back to the Blaisedales now.

575
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:05,430
Well, it looks to me as if we're just about
as ready as we're going to be.

576
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,449
You know,
they're closing down the wing soon.

577
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,994
-I wouldn't want you to miss the party.
-I'll be there.

578
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,893
We'll head down to the basement
to our storage level here

579
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,516
and work our way east to west.

580
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,223
-Make sense to you?
-Yeah, I think it'll work.

581
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,149
You got something for the dogs?

582
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,032
Pollux. Castor.

583
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,034
Hello.

584
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,683
Hello.

585
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:43,741
-Margo, are you here?
-I'm at the electron microscope.

586
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,159
Come on, girl. It's party time.

587
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,035
Wait. You're not even dressed yet.

588
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,581
I need you to take a look at this.

589
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,661
I'm not gonna take a look at anything
until you get dressed.

590
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:58,122
That parasite Greg Lee is gonna steal
your grant right out from under you

591
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:01,459
-unless you get in there and start pitching.
-All right. All right.

592
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:04,341
Try and guess what that is.

593
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,224
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.

594
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,352
-It's a dermestid beetle.
-Dermestid? Are you sure?

595
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,900
-Remember the leaves from Whitney's crate?
-Yeah.

596
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,397
That beetle ate part of one.

597
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:24,198
I ran some cells through the interpolator
searching for a match.

598
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,445
It came back "dermestid beetle."

599
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:31,622
But the analysis also revealed
a large percentage of reptilian DNA.

600
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,875
Reptilian?
Well, there must be some mistake, Margo.

601
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:39,080
-I ran it through three times.
-There must be something in the leaf.

602
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,789
Take a look at that printout.

603
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,716
Hormones. Lots of them.

604
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:50,300
Gammaglobulin AXY,
left positive, reverse transcriptase.

605
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:55,229
That's an enzyme almost always found
in association with viruses.

606
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,852
This plant is heavily infected with a virus.

607
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,059
So it's taken over some of the plant cells

608
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:04,067
and inserted its own genetic material
into the plant's genes.

609
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:07,446
But why would a virus
code for animal proteins?

610
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,753
Mr. Mayor.

611
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,631
Your Honor,
how do you feel about the exhibit?

612
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:28,758
-Very, very proud.
-Are you superstitious?

613
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,931
Only around election time.

614
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,099
Let's go, Castor. Come on, Pollux.

615
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,269
Come on, boy. Come on.

616
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,763
-Anything?
-No, nothing yet.

617
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:41,350
There's a lot of foreign smells down here,
which might knock off their olfactors.

618
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:44,357
We'll have to take it slow.
Come on, boy. Attaboy!

619
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,183
-You're looking very dapper tonight.
-You think so?

620
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,974
'Cause I don't see too many other guys
wearing these ruffles.

621
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:23,434
You look cool.

622
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,314
Your Honor, so pleased to see you.

623
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,818
So excited about being here.

624
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,118
What you got? What you got? That's right.
Come on. What you got? What you got?

625
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,070
What you got? What you got?

626
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,456
We know these hormones
are responsible for growth,

627
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:42,162
bone structure, exoskeletal physiology
and skin maintenance.

628
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,168
A huge influx of these
could easily cause it to change.

629
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,294
Of course it could.

630
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:48,671
Do you think Whitney knew
about the properties of these leaves

631
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,797
before he sent them?

632
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,300
Maybe he wasn't just using them
as packing material.

633
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,473
Maybe there was nothing missing
from the crate.

634
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,519
Maybe the leaves were the shipment.
But why? I don't get it.

635
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,178
Margo.

636
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,682
The hormones listed
in this analysis of the leaf,

637
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,769
they're all produced
by the human hypothalamus.

638
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,401
Of course,
it's a much more concentrated form here,

639
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:13,359
and one milligram of this material
is equal to more than 1 00 milligrams

640
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,943
of the hormone produced
by the hypothalamus.

641
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,949
Wait, wait. Remember when the Lieutenant

642
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,951
said something
about the human hypothalamus?

643
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,953
-Yeah.
-Do you think this is somehow connected

644
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,659
to Fred Ford's murder?

645
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:29,463
Well, if it is, whoever killed Fred Ford
really needs the hormones on that leaf.

646
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,043
We better find Lieutenant D'Agosta.

647
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,258
Where the hell is Margo?

648
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,847
He's absolutely correct.

649
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,900
-Harriet, George, I'm so pleased to see you.
-Hello.

650
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,276
-This is wonderful. Wonderful.
-Thank you.

651
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,528
Come with me.
I have someone I want to introduce you to.

652
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,905
Thank you.

653
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:59,454
Michael, Candice,
I want you to meet the Blaisedales.

654
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,906
-Harriet and George.
-Hello.

655
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,325
Come on. What've we got?

656
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,419
Detective!

657
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,297
-Run. Find, find!
-I've got you.

658
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:29,022
Johnson, Parkinson here. It's time
to shut down the outer cells. Do you read?

659
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,188
Right, sir. Still checking the lab area.

660
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,732
Lab area?
Everyone was supposed to be out by 6:. 00.

661
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,533
I just came from the lab, Mr. Parkinson.
I was the last one out.

662
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,328
You sure? It could be a long night
for anyone locked in down there.

663
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,155
It's completely deserted.

664
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,750
It's clear. Shut it down.

665
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,667
Shutting down.

666
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,809
Done.

667
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:10,775
If he's not upstairs, one of the other officers
will probably know how to find him.

668
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,729
-It's locked.
-Well, it seems that that imbecile Parkinson

669
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:17,157
made good on his promise.
He sealed off the entire wing.

670
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,780
-Come on, Professor.
-Where?

671
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,861
Down the fire stairs
and across the sub-basement.

672
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,072
-Down the stairs?
-I hope your brakes work.

673
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,996
-Champagne. How lovely.
-Yes.

674
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,923
-Thank you very much, Mister...
-Lee. Greg Lee.

675
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:37,344
And may I say how enchanting you look
this evening, Mrs. Blaisedale.

676
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:41,052
-We've gone off the map, Evans.
-This is the old coal tunnel.

677
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:42,508
-Lieutenant.
-Yeah?

678
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,514
-The scent seems to be getting stronger.
-What the hell is this?

679
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,472
Electric trams hauled coal right into
the basement from the old barges.

680
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,183
-That's how Chicago stayed warm.
-How far does it go?

681
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,688
This one goes all the way to Lake Michigan.

682
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,316
At least that's what they say.
No one really comes down here.

683
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:56,772
Let me ask you something.

684
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,074
Could somebody get off a ship
docked at the lake

685
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:00,571
and go through these tunnels

686
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,074
all the way to the museum
without being seen?

687
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,372
-Sure.
-Hey, we're moving now, guys.

688
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:06,574
Let's go.

689
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,512
-What in God's name is that smell?
-I don't like this.

690
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:25,683
Okay, we can do this.

691
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,727
Bradley and I go together.
Evans, you're behind me.

692
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,477
Hollingsworth, stay here. If I call you,
get that cannon up there. Let's go.

693
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,318
Come on, Castor.

694
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,284
There's something moving
right in front of us!

695
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,662
Castor, Pollux, heel! Heel!

696
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:56,457
Hollingsworth! Hollingsworth!

697
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,178
Hey, you okay?

698
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,851
Castor? Pollux?

699
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,150
Holy shit!

700
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,612
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
What the hell did this?

701
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,037
Castor?

702
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:32,125
-Oh, dear God! Pollux!
-Hey, Bradley, no!

703
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:33,873
-Pollux!
-Bradley!

704
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:35,833
Pollux!

705
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,334
Hollingsworth. Hollingsworth!

706
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,835
Take Evans and get your ass upstairs.

707
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,134
Find Cuthbert, Parkinson,
whoever the hell's in charge,

708
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,963
and clear out the museum. Go! Now!

709
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,382
Bradley!

710
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,385
Bradley!

711
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,224
Bradley!

712
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,984
-Are you lost, Margo?
-Of course I'm lost.

713
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,409
Just checking.

714
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,663
Pollux!

715
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:17,291
Pollux!

716
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,296
Pollux!

717
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,000
Pollux!

718
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,210
Pollux!

719
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,512
Come on, boy. Come on. Let's go.

720
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,478
Come on. What's the matter with you?

721
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:09,382
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
and thank you very much for being here.

722
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:14,178
I'd like to introduce to you
one of this museum's best friends

723
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,638
and staunchest supporters,

724
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,271
the mayor of our city,
the Honorable Robert Owen.

725
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,147
Thank you, Dr. Cuthbert.
Ladies and gentlemen,

726
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:30,699
I am so excited and honored to be here
at this wonderful museum this evening.

727
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,363
As we march forward

728
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:36,909
with fragile footsteps into the sunset
of the last few years...

729
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,164
-Is he speaking English?
-I don't know.

730
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,672
Bradley! Bradley!

731
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:53,409
Here, boy. You scared me. You scared me.

732
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,928
-This coffee's terrible.
-It's bitter. Very bitter.

733
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:26,018
-What do you think, darling?
-The telling moment.

734
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,192
Not for me. Not today.

735
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,568
...the beginning of superstition, really...

736
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:38,029
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.
-...in Egypt very early about 50,000 B.C.

737
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:43,460
But here's the pièce de résistance.

738
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:50,301
This is a very rare sacrificial palette
from Mesoamerica.

739
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,887
-The priests would sacrifice their victims...
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

740
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,807
-... by cutting out the beating heart.
-Excuse me.

741
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:01,728
-That's pleasant. Then what?
-Well, then they would eat it.

742
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:06,017
You know, I think I could use
one of these things down at City Hall.

743
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,647
Shall we?

744
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,818
Primordial forest. There's Pan.

745
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:26,332
And here we are in Brazil.
We're with the spirits of the Amazon now.

746
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:31,087
And here is the great devil god,

747
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:35,967
the Kothoga,
sitting on the skulls of his dead victims.

748
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,047
-Look out.
-Out of the way.

749
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,009
Look at this.

750
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,608
You know, I wonder what...

751
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:53,230
What the... What in the hell...

752
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:55,907
Come on. Come on.

753
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,575
-Dr. Cuthbert.
-Wait.

754
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:58,819
-Oh, God.
-Mr. Mayor!

755
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,949
Excuse me!
May I ask what you think you're doing?

756
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,999
My name's Hollingsworth,
Chicago homicide.

757
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,078
We have to get everybody out of here now.

758
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,543
We got a very dangerous situation,
Your Honor.

759
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:28,477
What the hell...

760
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:32,898
Come on. Let's go!

761
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:37,782
Holy shit, look at this.

762
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,905
We got a robbery alert
in the new exhibition space.

763
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,913
-What the hell is going on?
-I have no idea, but I'll find out.

764
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,540
-Keep moving.
-Come on, let's go.

765
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,749
Five, six, seven.
The whole board's going down.

766
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,840
Code 27.
It says we're having an earthquake!

767
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,724
This is Chicago.
We don't have earthquakes in Chicago.

768
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:11,065
Johnson, Wootton,
we've got problems up here!

769
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,273
The computer's forcing down
the last cell doors.

770
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,652
Jesus! This diorama wall,
can't we override manually?

771
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,032
Not in code status, I can't.

772
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,738
We're gonna have to reset
the whole system.

773
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,949
That's impossible.
Somebody's fucking with us.

774
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:49,228
Shit. We're shut down.
Everything is shut down.

775
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:31,990
Wootton, Johnson, what the hell's going on
up there? The fire doors are down.

776
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,497
-Shit!
-Wootton, Johnson, it's Parkinson.

777
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:35,872
Where the hell are you?

778
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,375
Phones are out.

779
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,587
And all the power's out
all over the museum.

780
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,676
Well, what about the emergency generator?

781
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:49,303
It's only for the lab area to keep their
computer systems and refrigerators going.

782
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,886
It's over in the east wing.
It's about a mile from here.

783
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,848
What about the backup batteries
for the security system?

784
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,525
Maybe we can reboot,
then get it back online.

785
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,278
It's over in the power room somewheres.

786
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,279
I'll go.

787
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:09,361
Excuse me, sir. May I ask you
a few questions? Can I ask you a few...

788
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:12,447
Don't lock the door.
I hate when you do that.

789
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,313
What the hell did that?

790
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:49,484
Control, this is Parkinson.
What the hell is going on down there?

791
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,195
Would you answer me, for Christ's sakes?

792
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,781
Someone fucking trashed
the backup system.

793
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:57,333
Wootton, Johnson, it's Parkinson.
Where the hell are you?.

794
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,036
Hey, asshole.
Aren't you gonna answer the man?

795
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,339
I can't reach the damn control room.

796
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:14,221
All right. McNally, help me get a count.
Let's figure a way out of here.

797
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:18,021
We can't lift the fire door
until we get the computer restarted.

798
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,811
The fire stairs only lead to the basement.

799
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,358
Then maybe that's what we'll do.

800
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,607
Heel. Heel. What is it?

801
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,273
What is it?

802
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,733
This is absurd.

803
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:33,285
Every police officer in the city of Chicago
is gonna be on the other side of that door

804
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:36,705
in five minutes trying to figure out a way
to get through. We wait here.

805
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:17,864
You ready?

806
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:25,501
I don't think you understand
how this works.

807
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,958
You're a junior detective.
You don't order the Mayor to do anything.

808
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,840
All I know is I've been ordered to get
everybody out of this building.

809
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:35,219
Now someone or something is in here.
You saw what it can do.

810
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,310
-Sorry, but I'm not budging.
-Is anybody there?.

811
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:43,101
-Wootton?
-No, D'Agosta. Put the Mayor on.

812
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,775
Put him on!

813
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,149
It's for you, Your Honor.

814
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,200
-Put this over your head.
-This is Mayor Owen.

815
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,027
Mayor Owen, this is Lieutenant D'Agosta.

816
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,829
-Lieutenant D'Augusta.
-D'Agosta, sir.

817
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:02,496
Vincent. Badge number 1 41 73.
We spoke once before.

818
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:05,374
-Do you remember?.
-I want you to consider very carefully...

819
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:08,046
With all due respect, sir,
you can fire me on Monday.

820
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,046
But right now, I want you
to shut your fucking mouth and listen.

821
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,423
I'm putting
Sergeant Hollingsworth in charge,

822
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:16,472
and you're going to do exactly
what he tells you to do.

823
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,140
-Or what, Lieutenant?
-Or none of you

824
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,139
are gonna live to see election day.

825
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:21,886
Hollingsworth.

826
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:25,064
-Hollingsworth, are you there?.
-Excuse me, Your Honor.

827
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,475
-I'm here, Lieutenant.
-Take the fire stairs back down

828
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,812
to the sub-basement
and head west into the service area.

829
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:34,065
Go through the passageway
for the old coal line.

830
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:36,283
You'll come up across the street
from the museum.

831
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:40,033
Now you go slow. You go quiet.
You stick together.

832
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,989
-You understand?
-I got it.

833
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,415
I'm not walking through some
filthy crawl space...

834
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:47,995
Shut up, T om!

835
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,341
-Let's go.
-Let's move.

836
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:59,223
Excuse me, but I don't care
what the Lieutenant,

837
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:02,264
whatever the hell his name is, says.
I'm staying!

838
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,846
I'm afraid my wife and I
will be staying, as well.

839
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,148
Mr. Blaisedale, we must stay together.

840
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:10,226
But she won't physically be able to go
downstairs or through tunnels.

841
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:11,652
It's best if we stay behind.

842
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:14,151
-One of us can carry her.
-It's out of the question.

843
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,697
We'll be fine here.

844
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:19,403
Okay, officer, I'll stay behind
and protect Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale.

845
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:20,828
Give me a break!

846
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,164
We're not going. What are you gonna do?

847
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,286
-Shoot us?
-All right. All right.

848
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,373
One of you stay here with them.
Now who's it gonna be?

849
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,749
-I'll stay.
-I'll stay.

850
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,373
McNally, you're staying.

851
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,878
-Hey, you got plenty of ammo?
-I'm loaded.

852
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:40,469
Okay, let's move.

853
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,259
Dr. Cuthbert. Dr. Cuthbert.

854
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,473
I'm sorry, but I don't think
you should do this.

855
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:48,226
Bullshit, Tom. You're fired.

856
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:56,068
I'll lead with the shotgun.
Bailey, you stay at the back.

857
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:59,154
The rest are single file.
Now, it's gonna be dark.

858
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,783
We go slow, we go quiet
and we stick together.

859
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,160
-Inside.
-Thank you.

860
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:07,662
-I got you.
-You all right?

861
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,415
-Come on.
-All right, stay close and watch your step.

862
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:16,046
Let's keep it going. Keep it going.

863
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,298
Can I get you a drink?

864
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,928
What is it, boy?

865
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,016
Let's go.

866
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:48,033
Oh, God, Lieutenant D'Agosta!
We've been trying to find you!

867
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,958
You gotta get out of here.

868
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,621
Oh, my God! No!

869
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,642
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

870
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:31,409
Somebody want to tell me
what in God's name that was?

871
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,415
I think it's the Kothoga.

872
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,378
John Whitney must have found it
somewhere, somehow

873
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,081
and sent it back to the museum.

874
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,758
But, for God's sake,
why wouldn't he give us warning?

875
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,302
How big were those crates
that John Whitney sent back?

876
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:43,469
Not very big.

877
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,798
How the hell does something like that
fit inside one of them?

878
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:50,478
In those crates that Whitney sent back,
the artifact was packed in a leaf specimen

879
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:54,853
that carried a parasitic fungus.
The fungus was loaded with hormones,

880
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:59,395
animal hormones that are produced
in the thalamoid region of the human brain.

881
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,903
-You mean the hypothalamus.
-I know this is crazy,

882
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:06,365
but maybe this animal started out
as something else,

883
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:10,077
a chameleon, a lizard, maybe even a dog.

884
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:14,377
It ate those leaves, and it changed
into whatever it is now.

885
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,380
Into what we just saw.

886
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:24,386
You're not crazy, Margo.
Don't you see, girl?

887
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,891
It's the Callisto Effect. It's really true.

888
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:31,560
The Kothoga myth was based on fact.

889
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,934
People of the Zenzera tribe,
when they were threatened by an enemy,

890
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:38,233
they must have fed some of those
hormonal leaves to some animal,

891
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,484
and it caused a riot in its DNA,
and it was transformed into

892
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:46,318
some horrific beast, but the beast
needed those hormones to stay alive.

893
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:49,279
So when it was big enough
and deadly enough, they stopped feeding it.

894
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:52,285
So it would have to find some other way
to get the hormone.

895
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:56,335
Their enemies. Yes, and when the enemies
were dead, it had no more hormones,

896
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,334
it would eventually die and the Zenzera
would come out from hiding.

897
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:03,509
Well, we don't have time to wait
for eventually. So, here's my question.

898
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:07,088
-How the fuck do we kill that thing?
-I have to figure out what this is first.

899
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,468
We need to get back to my lab.

900
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:10,515
I'll never make it up those stairs.
You leave me here.

901
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,139
-I'll carry you.
-Don't be ridiculous.

902
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,936
You have more important things to do.
I'm staying here.

903
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,883
Right here!

904
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:54,135
All right, it's Martin.
I'm here on the ground.

905
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:59,849
Let's clear this area. Clear the steps.

906
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:19,752
First, I liquefy and purify my sample.

907
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:23,376
Then, this machine will amplify
the DNA strand,

908
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:28,461
and, finally, scan the created gel image.

909
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:32,264
Then it's matched against a huge database
we've compiled over the last three years.

910
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,682
Very impressive.

911
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:37,845
-How long is this gonna take?
-A little while.

912
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,930
-That's terrific.
-What have you got there?

913
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,515
Good luck bullet.

914
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:46,020
-Superstitious. I remember now.
-Yeah.

915
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:49,941
-So, does your bullet have a story?
-I was on the beat my rookie year,

916
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,617
and I saw this guy
who'd locked his keys in his car

917
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,820
with his motor running.

918
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,781
He's got a clothes hanger
and he's trying to get the lock off.

919
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,115
So I go over, try to help him out,

920
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,451
and what I didn't know was
that he'd just robbed

921
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:04,585
a liquor store a block away.
So, he's concentrating so hard, you know.

922
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:08,088
He doesn't see me
till I'm right up on top of him.

923
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:10,594
I surprise him. He turns and...

924
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,389
Point blank range.

925
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,718
It doesn't pop, though.

926
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:21,389
Doesn't go off. This bullet.

927
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,571
So, what did you do?

928
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,358
I took the gun away from him
and beat the shit out of him.

929
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:36,571
Anyway, the forensics told me later
that the bullet's perfect.

930
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,323
It should have fired. I should be dead.

931
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:44,291
-So, in other words, a miracle of physics.
-Maybe just plain old-fashioned good luck.

932
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,760
This is Martin.
Has anybody seen the Mayor?

933
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,213
Give me a location on the Mayor.

934
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:02,221
What people don't realize is that

935
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:05,023
molecular biology is
the science of the future.

936
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,021
You know what I mean?
If people were just given...

937
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:10,604
I'm not taking the fall for this fiasco,
I can tell you that.

938
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:15,359
Come Monday morning,
everything will get straightened out.

939
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:19,663
And whatever prankster
created this miasma, I swear to God,

940
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,657
when I get my hands on him...

941
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:41,176
God!

942
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,971
There's no exact match here.
Surprise, surprise.

943
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,723
4%. 2%... Hey, wait a minute.

944
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,150
Hemidactylus turcicus 45%?

945
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,024
-It's a gecko, same as the beetle.
-What are you talking about?

946
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:17,822
Well, whatever this thing was,
it ate those leaves

947
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,902
and is rapidly evolving
into something reptilian.

948
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,033
-You mean it's still changing.
-It's quite possible.

949
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:22,690
Help! Pull me up! Pull me up!

950
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,866
-We got you!
-We got you!

951
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:29,112
Pull me up, man! Pull me up!

952
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:34,243
Help me! Help!

953
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,545
-Help me!
-Hold on! Hold on!

954
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:42,627
Please! God!

955
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:48,344
Help me! Help! Help me!

956
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:40,767
-It can't be.
-What? What is it?

957
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,274
33% homo sapien.

958
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:47,241
-Are you telling me that thing's part human?
-No, I'm saying more than that.

959
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:50,160
According to this data,
that thing started out as a human.

960
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:52,454
I'm gonna keep scanning.
There must be some error.

961
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,621
Lieutenant.

962
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,958
Hollingsworth. Where are you?

963
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,331
I'm just about to take them
into the coal tunnels.

964
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:01,379
Shit. I think that thing
is following us, Lieutenant.

965
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,876
I think it knows where we are.

966
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:07,462
Okay, now, listen. Those tunnels lead right
across the street. Just keep going.

967
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:09,212
Get those people out.

968
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,969
We're gonna follow you
and decoy the fucker away.

969
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:14,718
Hollingsworth.

970
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:19,185
I'll see you out on the street.

971
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,654
Where are those leaves with the hormones
that thing likes to eat?

972
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:32,077
Okay, we know this thing is part reptilian,
probably ectothermic,

973
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:34,621
so it can't handle extremes of hot and cold.

974
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:38,075
Maybe if we can change its temperature
by 30 to 40 degrees...

975
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:42,254
-What do you mean "maybe"?
-We can freeze the son of a bitch.

976
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,955
-Come on.
-Here.

977
01:27:56,688 --> 01:28:00,977
-Dr. Frock?
-Let me go first.

978
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:12,659
-Don't look.
-No, no, no!

979
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:24,504
I'm really sorry.

980
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,263
-Let's go.
-Hey.

981
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,797
Get me more guns, God damn it!

982
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:15,009
Hollingsworth, you read me?.

983
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:17,264
Hollingsworth, you read me?.

984
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:21,645
Yeah, Lieutenant, I'm here. Scared shitless.

985
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:25,060
-But I'm here.
-Just keep moving. We're on our way.

986
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:27,935
You hear me?.

987
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:31,104
-You read me?
-Yeah. I got it.

988
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:32,734
I hope you know what we're doing.

989
01:29:32,826 --> 01:29:34,908
-What was that?
-Just keep moving.

990
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:36,993
Just keep moving.

991
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:14,906
Hang on. Hang on.

992
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:19,319
Okay. Let's go.

993
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:27,202
-Bailey!
-Yeah?

994
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:29,663
It's not getting any deeper,
so keep them moving.

995
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:31,794
-All right.
-And watch your back.

996
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:36,840
Okay.

997
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,477
-Bailey.
-Yeah?

998
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:54,066
You hear something?

999
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:01,949
No.

1000
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:06,249
Bailey!

1001
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,995
Bailey!

1002
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,290
Bailey!

1003
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:18,886
Move out of the way.

1004
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,220
Move!

1005
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:24,225
Stay back!

1006
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:27,478
Move!

1007
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:30,272
-Bailey!
-What do you see?

1008
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,321
I can't run.

1009
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,382
This way, everybody. Go.

1010
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:30,617
Listen up.

1011
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:34,208
Now, whatever that was,
something made it go the other way.

1012
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,587
So stay close to me
and I will get you out of here.

1013
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,011
Give me the leaves.

1014
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:45,427
I'm gonna take them and tie them
on that grate over there.

1015
01:32:45,518 --> 01:32:47,634
I think the draft will blow the smell
down the tunnels.

1016
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,303
Come on.

1017
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:32,617
Go! Hurry!

1018
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,165
Hey, I found it.

1019
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:43,504
-Good. Go! Go!
-Oh, thank God, we're out!

1020
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:45,297
We're out, thank God.

1021
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,968
-All right. All right. Everybody.
-Hurry.

1022
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:52,721
-Let's go. All right.
-Come on, don't panic.

1023
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:25,546
I'll need some help for Dr. Cuthbert.

1024
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,681
Give me that.
Get inside the lab and lock the door.

1025
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,732
-What about you?
-Just get inside. I'll hold it off.

1026
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:43,855
-Hold it off? You've seen that thing.
-Yeah, I've seen it.

1027
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:46,233
Look, I know if we keep going,
we can find a way out.

1028
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,155
I don't want a way out. We've gotta stop it.

1029
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:49,699
I'll stay with you.

1030
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:51,401
-Get inside.
-This is crazy.

1031
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,157
-Get inside! Now!
-This is...

1032
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:03,834
-This is stupid! Don't do this!
-Lock the goddamn door!

1033
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,592
This is so stupid!

1034
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,866
John Whitney? Oh, my God!

1035
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,325
Lieutenant!

1036
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:49,751
Dr. Green! Dr. Green! Open the door!

1037
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:21,373
Open the goddamn door!

1038
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:29,585
Come on. Oh, God! Oh, God!

1039
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:35,215
Come on.

1040
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:39,546
Oh, God! Just keep coming.

1041
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,715
Oh, God!

1042
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:44,467
Just keep coming.

1043
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:46,386
Attaboy.

1044
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,274
Oh, God!

1045
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:09,458
Look, I...

1046
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:12,078
I know who you are.

1047
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,105
Oh, God!

1048
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:07,576
You go to hell!

1049
01:42:42,073 --> 01:42:44,029
Captain, we finally got through that door.

1050
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:46,232
We found two more bodies
inside the main room.

1051
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:47,692
-Not the Mayor.
-I can't tell, sir.

1052
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:49,618
-They're pretty badly messed up.
-How about the others?

1053
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:51,912
Well, we got the power up,
trying to get into the other levels,

1054
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,741
-but it's a big place.
-When I get my hands on that D'Agosta,

1055
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:57,167
-he'll be back in a fucking squad car.
-Captain.

1056
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:00,458
-Are you in charge here?
-Mr. Mayor.

1057
01:43:00,758 --> 01:43:02,089
How'd you get out?

1058
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,837
It's a long story, Captain.

1059
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:05,668
Look, these people are cold and tired.

1060
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:07,924
I'd like to get them under a roof
as soon as possible.

1061
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:10,301
-Yes, sir.
-And leave De Augusta alone.

1062
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:12,717
Or else you might be back in that squad car.

1063
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:22,059
Lieutenant!

1064
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:26,356
-Jesus! You all right? You okay?
-I'm okay. Get me up.

1065
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,282
-Get me up.
-All right.

1066
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,081
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Go, go, go!

1067
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:37,408
Get in there.

1068
01:43:40,423 --> 01:43:41,959
-Have you seen Dr. Green?
-No.

1069
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:44,040
-Did you get those people out?
-Most of them.

1070
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,796
-Hey, Lieutenant, over here.
-You did well.

1071
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:48,127
-There's somebody inside.
-Open it up.

1072
01:43:48,389 --> 01:43:49,424
Open it up.

1073
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:14,153
That's all we got here.

1074
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:25,331
Keep it.

1075
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:28,668
Let's go.
