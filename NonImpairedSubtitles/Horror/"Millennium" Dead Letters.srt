1
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,108
And Stop!

2
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,987
Where's Jordan?
Where's Jordan?

3
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:50,269
Daddy?

4
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:52,936
Daddy?

5
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,288
- What's the matter, honey?
- I had a bad dream.

6
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:09,293
Oh. Come on.

7
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:18,369
Everybody has bad dreams.

8
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:20,701
Why?

9
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,882
Everything's been left as we found it.

10
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:07,851
We covered the victim, but the perpetrator
covered his own fecal remains.

11
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:27,902
Hair and fiber are gonna be a mess.
There's tons of animal fur around.

12
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:31,067
- We started dusting already.
- Did you find a message?

13
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:36,375
On the body.
Or cut into the skin.

14
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,543
There are those in the Group who believe
we shouldn't take the case in Portland.

15
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:53,075
- Some are unconvinced the subject will kill again.
- He will.

16
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:56,586
Others think we should wait,
applying the Holmes criteria...

17
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,590
defining serial killers
involving three victims...

18
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:03,059
with a time period between
murders of at least 30 days.

19
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:05,722
He won't wait.
He'll kill again.

20
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:08,595
Ten days.
A week, maybe.

21
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:11,363
Frank, with the hundreds of cases
we're being asked to consult on...

22
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,405
and all the smaller
law enforcement agencies that need us...

23
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:16,407
why should the Group
send you down there?

24
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,105
He left a message.
I'm certain of it.

25
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:22,772
There was no report
of any message.

26
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:25,350
It's there.
I just haven't found it.

27
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,785
Okay. Portland detectives
called us in on this.

28
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,757
But for their crime stats,
they'll want to get the credit.

29
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:38,353
There's a man down there
that's worked with Portland P.D., Jim Horn.

30
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,694
we're considering him
for the Group.

31
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,290
He's had extensive background
in behavioral science...

32
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:45,302
and his work was
directly responsible...

33
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:47,702
for finding the Highway 8 Killer
in San Diego.

34
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,708
He's a real good guy. Works out
of an office in downtown Portland.

35
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,581
We're sorry.
The number you have dialed is incorrect.

36
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:03,655
- Please check the number--
- How the hell could it be incorrect?
It's my number.

37
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:05,951
If you'd like to speak
with a service representative...

38
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:07,958
enter ``1 '' now.

39
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,154
All our representatives are busy.

40
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:14,721
If you wish to hold, your call will be
answered in the order it was received.

41
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,858
The current waiting period is 45 minutes.

42
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:19,335
That's how long I've been
dealing with you, you mechanical--

43
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:23,431
Jim Horn?

44
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:26,170
Frank Black.

45
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:29,179
Welcome to Portland, Frank.

46
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:31,681
Heard great things about you
from Steve Choleski at I.S.U.

47
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:33,684
Have a seat.

48
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:36,584
- Coffee?
- Thanks.

49
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,751
I don't want to come off
like a jerk, but...

50
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,760
I go by ''James'' now.

51
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,023
Okay, James.

52
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:48,031
Thanks.

53
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,260
It's no big thing.

54
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:55,096
You profiling me?

55
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,505
You got that look
like you're profiling me.

56
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,510
No, James.
Just wondering what's wrong.

57
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:04,674
Sorry.

58
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:11,185
My wife and I are going
through a separation, and, uh--

59
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,281
I had to disconnect
the fax line out at the house...

60
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,724
and the phone company--

61
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:18,092
Man.

62
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:20,665
They can make you feel
like a worthless ass.

63
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,234
Sorry to hear
about your wife.

64
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:25,530
I see you have a kid.
Me too.

65
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:29,699
That's my boy, T.e.
just turned two.

66
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:32,971
I've never been separated.
I hear it's rough.

67
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:36,604
Yeah. This work--

68
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,417
Makes things hard,
you know?

69
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,579
I've been there.

70
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:52,120
Uh, Jim Penseyres
sent down the stuff last night.

71
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:54,756
I hope you don't mind,
but I sketched out a rough profile.

72
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:58,394
- I'm very interested.
- jim tells me you think
there might be a triggering stressor.

73
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:02,167
I couldn't agree more.
Divorce, maybe.

74
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:06,301
He's never married.
Never had sex.

75
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:10,508
You get that from there being no sexual
mutilation or intercourse with the victim?

76
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:14,313
It appears that the murder created a charged
psychological release in the killer...

77
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,516
but the only physiological release
he could perform was defecation.

78
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:23,051
I read those remains as a signature
of his hatred for women.

79
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,926
The defecation was covered.
He was embarrassed by it.

80
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,733
They haven't identified the victim yet,
but I believe he knew her.

81
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:33,600
- Why's that?
- The duct tape.

82
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:37,198
He objectified her, but he took the care
to cover just the face...

83
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,209
not the entire head.

84
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,439
He wanted as much
of his obsession visible as possible...

85
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:44,448
but he couldn't
have her looking at him.

86
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,110
Couldn't hear her fear.

87
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:50,416
That's an indication
of remorse.

88
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:54,856
It's rare to have remorse
for a stranger.

89
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,327
I'd expect him to visit
the victim's grave site...

90
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,957
tell her how bad he feels.

91
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,967
Well, I admit
I can't get a fix...

92
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:06,594
on why the staging of the body
in the animal shelter.

93
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:08,605
There could be
a hundred reasons.

94
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:11,801
Well, that will be
answered by his message.

95
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:17,104
You mean the message in the way
he posed the victim? Cutting the body in two?

96
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:20,845
Well, he takes something from the victims,
but leaves something of himself behind.

97
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:23,285
- Like what?
- He left a written message.

98
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:32,486
There was no message
at the crime scene or on the victim.

99
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:36,530
- We'll go find it.
- You're sure about this?

100
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:39,934
Yes, I am.

101
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:45,500
Frank, I'm gonna be
right up front about this.

102
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,976
I've heard a lot
about you. A lot.

103
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,573
And don't get me wrong.
I have the utmost respect for your work.

104
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:56,245
But I gotta tell ya...

105
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:59,688
I'm doubtful about some of the things
I've heard about you.

106
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:04,058
That's all right, James.
I've been there too.

107
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:43,495
The girl was Karen Anderson, 21.

108
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:47,003
Parking enforcement officer.
Just moved up from Northern California.

109
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,199
No boyfriend. Attractive.
Everyone says real friendly.

110
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:54,177
Her uniform was found in a sanitation
transfer station down in Oregon eity.

111
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,338
Blood stains
and fabric tearing confirmed...

112
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,281
he dismembered her while
she was still wearing the uniform.

113
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:07,015
That may have been how he had prior contact
with her. Simple. She gave him a ticket.

114
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:12,854
We can go over the parking tickets
she issued in the last week...

115
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,899
see if any of the violations
fit the subject.

116
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,828
Come on, Frank!
Work with me!

117
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:23,874
we've got evidence here
that is... here!

118
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,944
In hand!

119
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:29,480
If you're so focused on looking
for some specific message that isn't there...

120
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:32,482
you're going to overlook
the obvious signatures.

121
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:39,156
Come on, Frank.
You got a problem with me, let's hear it.

122
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:29,206
Down this way.

123
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:14,913
Tape.

124
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:28,356
Acetate.

125
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,485
``Hair today--''

126
00:13:57,596 --> 00:14:00,156
``Hair today,
gone tomorrow.''

127
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:11,701
These messages
are a big '`up yours''to the police.

128
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,473
He dared us to find it.
Thought we'd be too stupid.

129
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,277
The guy definitely knew
we'd search for hair and fiber.

130
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:23,115
A police freak.

131
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:26,884
Feels superior to us.
Might even be an ex-cop.

132
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,892
Older.

133
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,963
The hairs are gray.

134
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:36,194
But if this guy's that smart, he's getting
the hairs from another individual.

135
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:39,293
Maybe this person's
connected to the two women.

136
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:42,032
Maybe that's how he had
prior contact with the victims.

137
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,806
I can't shake the feeling
he's had prior contact, Frank.

138
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:57,349
Something in my head,
something in my subconscious is telling me--

139
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:07,759
When I look at the victims...

140
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,800
when I look at their faces...

141
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:14,235
- all I can see-
- Daddy! Daddy!

142
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:21,040
- T.C., get out! Get out of here!
- Jim, stop it!

143
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:23,273
He couldn't wait all week
to see you, and now--

144
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,912
Damn it. You know how I feel
about him ever seeing those.

145
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:33,820
That's why I told him
to get out!

146
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:36,257
You knew I was dropping him off.
You should have taken them down.

147
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,761
- I said 4:00.
- He wanted to surprise you.

148
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:40,889
Look...

149
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,263
if you're working and you can't
spend some time with him--

150
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:45,268
Don't start.

151
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,361
Of course I want to see him.
eome here, buddy.

152
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:03,988
I'm really gonna need
your focus on this, James.

153
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:10,019
Look, this is
my weekend with T.C.

154
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:13,393
But I realize
there are lives on the line.

155
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:15,932
Maybe if you
got away from here.

156
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:18,434
Maybe a step back will help you
take a step forward.

157
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,908
The subject is in custody.

158
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,601
Man, I can't breathe.

159
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,237
I can feel. I can see that...

160
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:32,282
when focused,
when removed...

161
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:34,875
he's actually
a very good asset.

162
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:37,113
A good man too.

163
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:41,158
Why don't you tell him?

164
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,352
Where he's at right now,
he'd never hear me.

165
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,864
You're different people, Frank...

166
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,059
at different places
and times.

167
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:52,864
Just because you didn't
hear me back then...

168
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,099
doesn't mean
he won't hear you now.

169
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:59,309
Mmm.

170
00:16:59,444 --> 00:17:02,777
- Come on, boy.
- Hey, T.e., wanna use this one?

171
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:06,317
How do you like your hamburger, James?
Medium? Rare?

172
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:08,909
- James?
- Hmm?

173
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,580
Oh, uh, medium's fine, thanks.

174
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,182
They play well together.

175
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,523
Yeah. It's great to watch 'em, huh?

176
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:20,189
They have no idea...

177
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:22,198
the things we see...

178
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,894
the things we know
are out there.

179
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,400
I hope I'm not
screwin' him up.

180
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:37,009
I never ever dreamed...

181
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:39,242
at that perfect moment that...

182
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:44,848
my time with him would be
regulated by petitions...

183
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:48,323
attorney retainers,
orders of the court.

184
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:52,829
That mother, father and son would
become nothing but a case number.

185
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:56,833
That, as a father, I risk adding
nothing to his life.

186
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:59,335
I could become nothing but...

187
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,698
a face covered in gray tape.

188
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,814
When I read Dostoyevsky,
there was a passage--

189
00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:22,724
Something like, there is nothing
more sad...

190
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:28,288
than a life that ends,
and no one knows or cares.

191
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,994
``Hair today,
gone tomorrow.''

192
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:36,233
The subject is angry
that his life will go unnoticed...

193
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:38,241
that he will have
left nothing.

194
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:42,541
The hatred of himself
is directed toward the world...

195
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,810
which has held him back
because it objectified him...

196
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:50,616
reduced him, reduced us all
to universal bar codes.

197
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:53,919
We are animals
in a caged shelter...

198
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,119
controlled by dogcatchers.

199
00:18:57,228 --> 00:19:01,597
The gray tape makes the victims
look like how he feels--

200
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,032
Faceless.

201
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:06,626
A dead letter lost
at the post office.

202
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:10,401
He's killed before,
when he was young.

203
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:14,535
Most likely,
a female prostitute.

204
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:18,514
After an early setback--
a girlfriend, a job--

205
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,107
he sought out a woman
that wouldn't turn him away.

206
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:24,518
The solicitation increased
his feelings of nothingness...

207
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,522
and so he killed her
before sex.

208
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,491
My guess--

209
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:31,528
He was never caught.
He got away with it.

210
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,722
The subject has felt guilt
ever since.

211
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:36,767
Angered at a world that should
have punished him, but didn't.

212
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:40,326
The murder, however,
was the most significant event in his life.

213
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:45,666
He's returned to this place,
to the event.

214
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,878
He wants nothing more
than to be stopped.

215
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:54,782
But he will do everything
in his control to remain significant.

216
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:42,399
'`You monkeys, you, ''he said,
shaking his finger at them.

217
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,400
``Give me back my caps.''

218
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:48,165
So, the monkeys are shaking
their fingers back at the peddler saying...

219
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:51,538
``Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.''

220
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,381
Daddy, can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

221
00:20:57,482 --> 00:21:00,383
No. You're having a sleepover.

222
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:04,615
- The monkeys will get me.
- These monkeys? Nah. No.

223
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:08,385
- If I have a bad dream--
- If I have a bad dream.

224
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,489
If you feel like you're gonna have
a bad dream, you will.

225
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:16,931
But if you think you're gonna have
a good dream, you'll have a good dream too.

226
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:19,526
Do you know
all about bad dreams?

227
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:22,629
I know enough about bad dreams
to keep them from you...

228
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,607
and T.e.

229
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,508
Say your prayers.

230
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:34,850
When I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

231
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:37,080
- If I should die before I wake...
- Yeah.

232
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:41,955
- Both your daddies need 'em.
- I pray the Lord my soul to take.

233
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,961
I don't know, Catherine.

234
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:50,228
Maybe it's because T.C.'s been
taken out of my everyday life.

235
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,667
Or...

236
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,399
he's two now, and he's becoming
a person, you know?

237
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:58,408
But I can't--

238
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:02,445
These murderers--

239
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,450
Before, they were a...

240
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,318
fascinating psychological,
societal puzzle.

241
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:19,788
Most I could even feel sympathy for 'em,
because of their horrible lives.

242
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:22,992
But now...

243
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:25,001
when I walk
into a crime scene...

244
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:30,030
all I see is my little boy's face
superimposed on the victim.

245
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:34,438
And--

246
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:39,347
And these killers
can't be simply cases...

247
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:44,483
or psychological anomalies anymore.

248
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:48,458
They're just...

249
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:52,328
monsters.

250
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:56,557
Just monsters.

251
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:27,830
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

252
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:30,025
My car's just over here.

253
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:31,658
Good night.

254
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:41,711
Help!

255
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:43,872
Help!

256
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:47,418
You okay over there?

257
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:51,079
Oh- Yeah. It's just-

258
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:53,987
My glasses fell off when I tried
to shut the door with my arms full.

259
00:23:54,092 --> 00:23:56,185
And I ca--

260
00:23:56,294 --> 00:23:59,058
Don't worry.
I-I'll find them. Thank you.

261
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:24,315
Thank you so much.
Uh, I--

262
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:28,654
They should be near the door.
I didn't really feel them fly too far off.

263
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:31,662
Oh--

264
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,300
Here they are.

265
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:13,666
He's feeling more confident.

266
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:15,705
How do you know that?

267
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,537
He killed the woman in the same location
he disposed of the body.

268
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:22,545
No. Security guard reported
nothing out of the ordinary.

269
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,275
Crime scene team found no evidence
the murder occurred here.

270
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:33,248
The blood spatter patterns are moving away
from the scene, not arriving at it.

271
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:40,921
A mobile slaughterhouse.
He would need room to work.

272
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:44,661
- Probably a van.
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:57,108
Left lens.
Partial print.

274
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:59,706
My guess it's from
the victim.

275
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:02,650
We can check the prescription.
Notify optometrists in the city.

276
00:26:02,754 --> 00:26:06,713
He's too smart. He'd use one of those
one hour places outside of town.

277
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:10,089
A place where he could go unnoticed.

278
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:13,493
mr. Black?

279
00:26:36,754 --> 00:26:38,654
That's it?

280
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:41,122
This son of a bitch
too bored with our progress?

281
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,955
He thinks we're not enough
of a challenge?

282
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,689
You show your frustration
in front of them, and he's gonna know.

283
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,029
It does us no good now to get mad
about what he thinks or wants.

284
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:53,626
We can only use it
to find him.

285
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:57,299
He wants a challenge.
Let's give him one.

286
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:16,564
Can't believe
he didn't bite.

287
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:18,904
Still might.

288
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:22,512
Ah, it'll be light in an hour.

289
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:27,415
He'll never do it then.

290
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:29,918
I say we give him
his opportunity now.

291
00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:35,591
All units, this is Charlie One.

292
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:39,355
Okay, we're going to
'`drain the weasel. ''

293
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,988
Whenever you're ready,
Alpha One.

294
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:44,067
I copy.

295
00:31:00,184 --> 00:31:02,846
All units,
suspect approaching.

296
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:15,729
Take him!

297
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:31,444
Whoa.

298
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:34,541
Are you a patient here?

299
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:37,587
- If I knew you were this strict,
I wouldn't have left my room.
- What are you doing?

300
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,555
Marjorie was my nurse.
I just wanted to pay my respects.

301
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:42,592
But my doctor wouldn't let me.

302
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,422
- It took me this long to sneak out.
- Yeah.

303
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,258
- Take him back to his room.
- It's okay. It's okay. eome on.

304
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:54,571
There's a patient here.

305
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:56,572
I thought it was the guy.
We all did.

306
00:31:56,674 --> 00:31:58,574
What if it was, James?

307
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:01,270
Is bouncing the subject's head
off the hood of the car...

308
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,347
gonna do anything to change all
the other murders that will occur today?

309
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:07,679
Come on, Frank! Some guy cut your wife
and your daughter into eight pieces...

310
00:32:07,785 --> 00:32:09,810
and you just stand there
and read him his rights?

311
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,083
He hasn't killed our wives or our families,
and he's not going to.

312
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,284
If you make every one of these personal,
you'll go insane.

313
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,885
And that's from having
been there, James.

314
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:24,766
I get so far into the heads
of the killers and the victims.

315
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:27,702
- You haven't got there at all.
- Don't you tell me where I am!

316
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:29,796
You put them in your head.

317
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:36,670
I keep reliving...

318
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:39,045
what it's like
to be cut in half...

319
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,050
or four or eight.

320
00:32:41,152 --> 00:32:44,815
This isn't about you, James.
The whole thing.

321
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,822
What's goin' on out here.

322
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:50,223
It's about us.
Me. You.

323
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:53,558
The killer
and the victim.

324
00:32:57,168 --> 00:33:00,899
I can't help
but take this personally.

325
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:03,337
Another person is
going to die, horribly...

326
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,206
because Is--
we screwed up.

327
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:11,008
I-- we did all this
for nothing.

328
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:14,346
No, we didn't.

329
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:18,717
We handed out 30 pins
from the hospital charity to be placed here.

330
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:24,726
There's 31 .

331
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,555
We wanted one taken,
but one was left.

332
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,998
He was here.

333
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,996
The flyers with the suspects
fitting our profile from the memorial...

334
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:08,765
have been dispatched to optometrists
and eyeglass labs around the area.

335
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:11,501
Plus, a resident four blocks
from the hospital...

336
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:14,908
recalls seeing an orange van driving around
the area the night of the memorial.

337
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,674
Yeah.

338
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:27,819
A saleslady from one of those
eyeglass places in Woodburn...

339
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:31,554
- recalls one of the suspects from the flyer.
- Which one did she recall?

340
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,889
- This guy.
- Are you sure?

341
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,436
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember.
He was a total ass.

342
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,528
- In what way?
- just real attitude.

343
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,837
He even had trouble
taking a number like everybody else.

344
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:50,607
- He needed one lens replaced. The left lens?
- Well, that I don't remember.

345
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:54,411
But what I do remember is that
he was getting all ``weirded'' out.

346
00:34:54,518 --> 00:34:58,249
- ``Weirded,'' how?
- I guess his glasses got a little lost in the shuffle.

347
00:34:58,355 --> 00:35:00,721
So, I asked him
for a service slip number.

348
00:35:00,824 --> 00:35:05,318
And he gets all sweaty.
And his eyes got real weird.

349
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:08,262
I went back. I asked the technicians.
Maybe they had seen them.

350
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:10,799
And I guess they were
in the tray right behind me.

351
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:14,029
But all the trays are marked
with the customer's name on it.

352
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:18,700
And he starts going,
``I have a name! I have a name!''

353
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:28,780
Pardon me, Janice.
Could you wait here a moment?

354
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:30,979
James and I will be right back.

355
00:35:41,665 --> 00:35:44,862
You were right, James.
He does have prior contact with the victims.

356
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:48,200
She's next.
This name and address are false.

357
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:50,899
Paid in cash.
But we should look for the orange van.

358
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:54,466
I'll devise a proactive strategy
with Portland P.D.

359
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:58,338
Hang in there, James.
We're close.

360
00:36:48,298 --> 00:36:50,664
Given the subject's
previous behavior...

361
00:36:50,768 --> 00:36:54,864
he'll attempt the abduction
in the back parking lot after office hours.

362
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:58,066
He'll enter the lot
from the alley past the Dumpsters.

363
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,871
We got that entrance
blocked off.

364
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:04,379
Are all the unmarked vehicles in position
at the lot's other points of entry?

365
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:06,540
- Affirmative.
- Okay.

366
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,244
Ms. Sterling usually leaves
the building around 9:15.

367
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:12,186
- So, we got about 20 minutes.
- Are you all right, Janice?

368
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:15,190
- Yeah.
- You'll be safe in here.

369
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:17,260
DetectiveJenkins,
Mr. Horn, myself...

370
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:19,261
we'll stay in here
with you.

371
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:21,991
And there's about 20 officers
outside hiding.

372
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:25,432
- This'll all be over in the next hour.
- Frank, um-

373
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:29,097
I'm not sure it's such a good idea
for me to be around.

374
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:44,086
Why don't you blow out of here?
Go home.

375
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:46,088
I'll let you know
how it went.

376
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:55,150
Nothing here.

377
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:57,413
Act like you forgot something
and come back inside.

378
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:22,307
I need to get by!

379
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:27,209
I've got a flat.
Can you help me?

380
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:34,385
Nothing.

381
00:40:34,491 --> 00:40:36,686
Unit 7, anything
up in the alley?

382
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:39,023
I'm stuck.
I can't move. I need a jack.

383
00:40:39,129 --> 00:40:41,029
Got one?

384
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:45,067
This is Unit 7. We got a car
with a flat blockin' an orange van.

385
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:47,136
What kind of car?

386
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:50,001
- Give me a make on that car.
- It's a blue Taurus.

387
00:40:54,378 --> 00:40:57,472
No, no. I can get it.Just a jack.
I'll be out of your way in five minutes.

388
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:26,274
Jim, no! No!

389
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:30,275
No!

390
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,150
Stop!

391
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,120
No backup here.

392
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:48,260
Get an ambulance on the horn.

393
00:42:21,732 --> 00:42:24,223
Just checkin' in.
I'm back to Seattle.

394
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:30,898
Everything in the van...
is inadmissible.

395
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:35,501
The victims' possessions were
found in the subject's house.

396
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:39,139
Hair and fiber.
D.N.A. samples.

397
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:41,911
District attorney feels
it's enough that he won't get away.

398
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,925
I wanted to work
with the Group.

399
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:55,122
And I know,
because of my actions, that's over.

400
00:42:55,232 --> 00:42:58,360
But...

401
00:42:58,468 --> 00:43:00,402
I need you to tell me.

402
00:43:03,673 --> 00:43:06,005
Help me, Frank.

403
00:43:08,845 --> 00:43:10,745
How do you do this?

404
00:43:14,985 --> 00:43:17,249
Why do you do it?

405
00:44:32,562 --> 00:44:35,395
<i>I made this!</i>
