1
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:58,547
B mark.

2
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:04,926
- Frame.
- Action.

3
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,493
Why do you think
this happened to you?

4
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:13,000
You mean why do bad things
happen to good people?

5
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,807
That's the real question, right?

6
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:17,839
Why us?

7
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:21,203
I mean, that's really
what everybody wants to know.

8
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:25,482
I moved into the house because
it's what we needed at that time.

9
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:30,348
We didn't ask for this
and we didn't deserve it.

10
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:33,883
The fact is, I don't know
why this happened to us.

11
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,822
We were just a regular family
like anybody else.

12
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,027
The doctors didn't believe that...

13
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:49,670
... he would survive,
and anyone who's had a sick child...

14
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:53,402
... would understand the feeling
that you're losing your grasp on them...

15
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:58,743
... and something's pulling them
from the other side...

16
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:02,646
... which is really what was happening
in that house.

17
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,653
Please, God, don't make him suffer.

18
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:09,990
Please make it work, or I'll never...

19
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:14,825
You know, I hear that talking to yourself
is the first sign of losing it.

20
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:19,737
I was not talking to myself.
I was talking to God.

21
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:24,602
Well, threatening the creator
of the universe is, like, step two.

22
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,505
That can't be good.

23
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:29,112
I was not threatening him.

24
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:32,875
I was simply letting him know
how precious you are to me.

25
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,920
You gotta pull over, Mom.
I'm gonna be sick.

26
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,520
Very funny.

27
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:40,556
No, I'm serious.
I'm really gonna be sick.

28
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:45,154
It's whatever. Just don't look,
Mom, okay? I'm all right.

29
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:55,068
Come and get me, wiener head.

30
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:56,332
Hey, Mom.

31
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,203
- Who you calling a wiener head?
- No.

32
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,970
- Morning.
- Morning.

33
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:04,647
Didn't hear you come in.
What time did you get home?

34
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,545
Around 4.

35
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:11,553
Jesus. I know it's a long way,
but how did it take you eight hours?

36
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:15,284
You really wanna know how many times
we stopped so he could vomit?

37
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,856
God.

38
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:20,497
How is he now?

39
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,734
He's all right.
I think he's still sleeping.

40
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:26,427
- Let me get breakfast. You go to bed.
- It's okay.

41
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:29,801
Wendy's helping
and I'm kind of wired from driving.

42
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:32,272
- Good morning, Aunt Sara.
- Morning, honey.

43
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:35,071
- Sorry about the chaos.
- It's better than my house.

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,545
- Take this in to the hungry hordes.
- Yes.

45
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,078
Okay, guys. Here you go.

46
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:42,844
This is not good. One of these nights...

47
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:45,182
...you'll drive off the road,
you'll be so tired.

48
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,881
- I wish we could just move there.
- And in the meantime?

49
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:49,390
Pay mortgage and a rent?

50
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:51,563
And now we've taken in Wendy
and Mary and...

51
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:54,197
One a built-in babysitter,
the other a little angel.

52
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,798
I know, but...

53
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:59,266
...every penny we have is sunken in
the business. We didn't plan on...

54
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:02,668
Nobody plans on having a child
with cancer.

55
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:05,538
You know that's not what I meant.

56
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:08,476
I know.

57
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,821
Look, you're right. Let's just do it.

58
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:29,662
Let's get a rental house in Connecticut
near the hospital.

59
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:33,727
But what are you gonna do?
And how are we gonna afford it?

60
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,066
I can come up on the weekends...

61
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,799
... get a second mortgage
on our second mortgage.

62
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:41,479
We're gonna make it through this,
right?

63
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,275
Definitely.

64
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,148
See you.

65
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:52,422
His skin may well get burned and red.

66
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:54,251
It'll blister like a bad sunburn.

67
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,152
He threw up twice today.

68
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:59,361
Well, that's his cells dying
and being reborn.

69
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:01,794
Basically, we're waging war
inside Matt's body...

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,264
... and the battle's just begun.

71
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:05,868
That's what I'm afraid of.

72
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:09,370
But he qualified for the study, Sara.
That's good.

73
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:11,599
You did the right thing
by bringing him here.

74
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,175
I know.

75
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:42,196
I don't wanna waste your time,
but how much you asking?

76
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:46,844
I'll give you the first month free if I don't
have to finish hammering in this sign.

77
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:56,385
Just needs some love and care and
a good family to bring it back to life.

78
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:59,523
- So you don't mind children?
- Where would we be without them?

79
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:01,892
It's perfect.

80
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:03,856
I mean, it's everything we need.

81
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:09,466
It's spacious and affordable and I'm
just wondering, where's the catch?

82
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:11,226
Well...

83
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:12,869
It does have a bit of a history.

84
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:17,337
I saw one
that was almost perfect, but...

85
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:20,444
It just...

86
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,673
It just wasn't right.

87
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,164
They said you'd have body aches,
but no nausea.

88
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:50,037
Doctor says to patient,
"I've got bad news.

89
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:55,209
You've got cancer
and you've got Alzheimer's."

90
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,775
Patient says:

91
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:03,211
"Oh, man. At least I don't have cancer."

92
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,549
At least you won't lose your hair again.

93
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:10,652
Well, that's something.

94
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,946
- I brought a mattress.
- I can't thank you enough.

95
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:31,240
Oh, really, don't worry.

96
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,383
- Here's the keys.
- Thanks. Is the heat on?

97
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:35,280
- Oh, it's really warm in there.
- Okay.

98
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:38,979
All right. Now you get in and settle.
I'll take this.

99
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,124
I don't know. You know, he was so sick.

100
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:46,787
And I like this place. It's what we need.

101
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:50,695
Well, I made an executive decision.
You weren't here.

102
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:54,939
And he was in so much pain. I just
couldn't put him through another mile.

103
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,338
Oh, great.

104
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,165
Hey.

105
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,734
You okay?

106
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:41,705
Yeah, it was just a bad dream.

107
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:44,599
Okay.

108
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:57,713
Pick of the house, okay?
Any bedroom you want.

109
00:11:57,922 --> 00:11:59,685
Drink this.

110
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:09,258
They're not that bad.

111
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,628
- All right. Cheers.
- Keep telling yourself that.

112
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:14,430
Great. Have you ever had one?

113
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,433
Yeah.

114
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:15,152
Matt?

115
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:19,261
Matt, did you find a bedroom?

116
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:21,695
Yeah, I did.

117
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,813
Or it kind of picked me.

118
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:40,482
- What do you mean, it picked you?
- I don't know. It's the meds.

119
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,550
I don't know what I'm talking about.

120
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:45,552
Well, which bedroom?

121
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,183
Down here?

122
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:51,156
- No.
- Why? Come on.

123
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:55,162
Look, it's nice and it's cool, and best,
it's got its own private bathroom.

124
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,391
Nobody has to hear me.

125
00:14:57,602 --> 00:14:59,069
You don't have to hide from us.

126
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,965
The fact that everybody can
hear me puking...

127
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:02,901
...it just makes me feel worse, okay?

128
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:22,220
- What do you think's back there?
- I don't know.

129
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:25,390
- Hello. Anybody home?
- You okay?

130
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:26,621
Scared me.

131
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:29,391
- Hello?
- We're down here.

132
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:31,660
First one upstairs
gets first choice of rooms.

133
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:32,836
Mary.

134
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:36,632
Mary, wait until Aunt Sara and Uncle
Peter tell us where our rooms are.

135
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:38,069
- Mary.
- No.

136
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:40,767
- No, it's not fair. I want that room.
- Little monsters.

137
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:49,018
- No, watch it.
- I got it. I got it.

138
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:52,653
I'm not gonna croak from carrying
a lamp and an empty suitcase.

139
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,984
That's not what I meant.

140
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:57,855
I was worried about you
scratching the truck.

141
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:00,587
- Carry on.
- Okay.

142
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:07,429
Well, it's a little dark, but,
hey, I was a teenager once.

143
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:11,968
What's in here?

144
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:15,138
I don't know. I couldn't open it.

145
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:22,075
Well...

146
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:25,316
The doorknob turns, but...

147
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:32,227
Maybe they sealed it for storage.

148
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:35,258
Got a great room for Billy...

149
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,866
...and Mary.

150
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:40,401
And this...

151
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:43,165
...I thought was a perfect room for you.

152
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:44,807
And why do you say that?

153
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,477
Well, because it's got a beautiful view...

154
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,170
...and lots of space...

155
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:54,078
...and a huge closet.

156
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,384
- You like? Okay.
- Yeah.

157
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:09,499
Hey. I still don't know why
you wanna stay down here.

158
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,948
- Whoa, Mom.
- What?

159
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:39,028
Are you okay?

160
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:44,023
Yeah, just thanks for cleaning my room.

161
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:45,395
No problem.

162
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:21,703
- Why'd you put the plates back?
- What?

163
00:18:23,307 --> 00:18:25,537
Well, I put the plates out,
and now they're back.

164
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:28,439
I didn't touch them, sweetie.

165
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:32,678
Are you all right?

166
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:41,549
Oh, that's...
Know what, that was my fault.

167
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,250
- They're too heavy.
- No, it's okay. I didn't drop them.

168
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:46,259
- Well, how did they...
- I don't know. L...

169
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:48,625
I just saw them up there
and I just... I don't...

170
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,734
- You know, Dr. Brooks said...
- I know what Dr. Brooks said, okay?

171
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:55,736
He said that if I'm seeing things,
then he'll drop me from the trial.

172
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:58,271
- But if you...
- I'm not seeing things.

173
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:03,810
I'm just... I'm tired. And I remember I put
the dishes too close to the edge, so...

174
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:06,415
You know, you tell me
if something like that happens.

175
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:09,877
- Promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

176
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:16,317
I'm so sorry I broke the dishes.

177
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:18,594
It's okay, sweetie.

178
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:27,468
Come on, come on.

179
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:31,437
Got you. It. You're so...

180
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:34,805
Oh, the burgers. The burgers.
Wait, wait, wait.

181
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:37,613
- Come and get me.
- All right.

182
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,017
Remember when we used to go
camping when you were young?

183
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:54,594
Every night you would...

184
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:58,634
...fall asleep counting the stars,
and you could never finish.

185
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,230
Used to drive you nuts.

186
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:06,669
You know, most of the stars
that we see are already dead.

187
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:12,375
They look pretty alive to me.

188
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,446
That's because they haven't gotten
the news yet.

189
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:33,927
Hey.

190
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:36,362
You all right?

191
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,339
Yeah. Everything's cool.

192
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:42,641
- You sure?
- Yeah.

193
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:44,939
All right.

194
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,311
Give me five.

195
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:51,511
Up high. Down low. Too slow.

196
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,617
I love you.

197
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:58,626
You know, it's sort of like a vacation.

198
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:00,762
Yeah, if Matt wasn't sick...

199
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:03,763
And you get your own room,
like a big girl.

200
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:06,198
Sure you're not gonna be scared
in here all alone?

201
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:07,928
I've got my toys.

202
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:09,470
Okay.

203
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:11,164
You go.

204
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:15,272
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

205
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:20,781
If I shall die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen.

206
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:13,635
To bind the spirits.

207
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,576
Noncontact dermatitis.

208
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:36,514
A trauma in one place manifests
on another part of the body.

209
00:23:36,721 --> 00:23:38,245
It's not uncommon.

210
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:42,654
No fever. Excellent. Less nausea.
Good. Even a bit of an appetite.

211
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,522
Outstanding. And no visual
or auditory hallucinations...

212
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,698
...or other behavioral abnormalities?

213
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:51,762
Anything?

214
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:54,762
No.

215
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:57,167
Then we can continue to stage two.

216
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:00,866
Careful.

217
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,613
Watch your step.

218
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:07,841
Okay, you're almost there.

219
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:12,755
- Thank you.
- Okay.

220
00:24:12,957 --> 00:24:15,187
I forgot my purse.
I'll be right back. Wait here.

221
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:17,724
- Okay.
- All right?

222
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:29,104
Mom?

223
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:38,576
The blue one that he takes for nausea?
Twenty-five bucks a pill.

224
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:42,978
I know. I tried.
But, Peter, I was on hold for an hour.

225
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:43,007
Matt?

226
00:25:43,347 --> 00:25:44,939
Matt.

227
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:46,977
Where are you?

228
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:49,084
I'm in here.

229
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,464
How'd you get in here?

230
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:13,032
What is this place?

231
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,452
Hop on.

232
00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:37,831
Take you for a ride.

233
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:46,140
Slow down.

234
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:58,618
Matt. Matt.

235
00:27:02,993 --> 00:27:04,688
Stop.

236
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:07,022
Let me off!

237
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:10,091
Stop.

238
00:27:11,402 --> 00:27:12,562
Matt. Matt.

239
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:20,368
- What's going on down here?
- What's the matter with you?

240
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:23,045
I guess I must've loosened it.

241
00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:50,137
Good Lord.

242
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:04,677
Now we know
why the rent was so cheap.

243
00:28:10,928 --> 00:28:13,658
What did you know, and when the hell
did you know it? Jesus.

244
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:15,422
Know what?

245
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:16,860
What this place was.

246
00:28:18,202 --> 00:28:20,432
Aren't you the one
who says we can't live on lies?

247
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:23,105
Well, that's before,
when you were a drunk and a liar.

248
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:26,305
Right, but I'm not now.

249
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:30,840
I know.

250
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:33,372
I'm sorry, Peter.

251
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:37,645
And you're right, I should've told you.
It just...

252
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:43,716
We needed a place,
and it just seemed perfect.

253
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:53,663
Okay, so we all know now
that this was a funeral home.

254
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:55,668
Big deal.

255
00:28:57,107 --> 00:28:59,769
It's not now and it hasn't been
for years and years.

256
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:02,343
It's just a house.

257
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,172
Bricks and nails and wood.

258
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:11,687
It's our house until Matt finishes
at the hospital.

259
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:13,857
And we're all under a lot of stress...

260
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:16,492
...so we need to pull together
like a team, okay?

261
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:23,463
Okay. So who wants to say grace?

262
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:25,793
Matt?

263
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:35,535
Matt?

264
00:29:57,634 --> 00:29:59,158
- Matt.
- Jonah. Jonah.

265
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:29,464
Honey?

266
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:33,432
Are you all right?

267
00:30:33,804 --> 00:30:34,771
Matt?

268
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:44,610
- What's wrong?
- It's the medicine.

269
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:55,091
Didn't you see it?

270
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:00,790
Come on.

271
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:09,263
So, what happened?

272
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:17,737
Do you remember that book we
used to read when we were little kids?

273
00:31:17,948 --> 00:31:19,438
The one with all...

274
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,844
...the weird pictures?

275
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:22,916
The Man Who Wasn't There.

276
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,883
Used to love that book.

277
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:26,487
Yeah, I remember.

278
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:32,322
As I was walking up the stair
I saw a man who wasn't there

279
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:34,690
He wasn't there again today

280
00:31:34,898 --> 00:31:37,492
- Oh, how I wish he'd go away
- Oh, how I wish he'd go away

281
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:39,225
Yeah.

282
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:43,838
Do you remember the other one?

283
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,338
Maybe. Which one?

284
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:51,143
It was one bright day
In the middle of the night

285
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,514
Two dead boys got up to fight

286
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:57,417
Back-to-back they faced one another

287
00:31:57,621 --> 00:32:00,317
They drew their swords
And they shot each other

288
00:32:00,924 --> 00:32:02,585
A deaf policeman, he heard the noise

289
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:06,251
And he came
And he killed those two dead boys

290
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:09,330
Matt, you're scaring me.

291
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:16,766
Well, join the club.

292
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:58,273
Oh, now, that didn't hurt.

293
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,509
You were dreaming.

294
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,086
Been breathing heavy,
and so, of course...

295
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:11,091
...it can either mean it was
a very bad dream or a very good one.

296
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:14,427
Well, I've had better.

297
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:24,800
I don't know, it's just, like,
that sometimes lately it's been tough.

298
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,569
What?

299
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:31,241
I don't know, like, do you ever,
like, see things?

300
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:34,417
Like, hear things that just...
They can't be there?

301
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:42,152
You don't ever wanna tell them
you can see things, okay?

302
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,623
They're not gonna understand.

303
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:50,227
I remember when my wife was dying...

304
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:54,632
...that whole last day
I sat there praying, crying.

305
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:58,302
And she never once looked up at me.

306
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:02,069
She just looked all around her.

307
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,373
At all the others in the room.

308
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:08,145
But we were alone.

309
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,520
Or so I thought.

310
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:16,459
See, she was where we are.

311
00:34:17,627 --> 00:34:19,527
In the valley...

312
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:23,391
...of the shadow of death.

313
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:31,902
Hey, you know what to do
when you find yourself in the valley?

314
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:33,843
No.

315
00:34:35,212 --> 00:34:37,203
Fear no evil.

316
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:45,578
If you wanna talk or...

317
00:34:47,924 --> 00:34:49,448
Just call. Any time.

318
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,650
Are you sure
you have to go home tonight?

319
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:54,592
If I'm not there at the site
first thing in the morning...

320
00:34:54,798 --> 00:34:58,359
...they will hire another contractor
and then, you know...

321
00:35:01,705 --> 00:35:02,967
I'm proud of you.

322
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:04,435
What, me?

323
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:06,233
- Yeah.
- For what?

324
00:35:07,411 --> 00:35:09,743
For working so hard.

325
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:13,641
And for keeping your promises.

326
00:35:14,651 --> 00:35:15,879
All of them.

327
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:24,826
You're naughty.
You can't play with that.

328
00:35:25,028 --> 00:35:26,723
It's mine.

329
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,229
You know, you're a bad doll.
You said you would make Matt better.

330
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,766
You said you would, but you lied.
"No, I didn't."

331
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:36,871
Oh, yes, you did. You said you would.

332
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:39,064
You're gonna have to have
a timeout and...

333
00:35:39,276 --> 00:35:41,403
I'm gonna put you in the timeout corner.

334
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,138
"That's really mean."

335
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:52,816
Turn the lights on, please.

336
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:55,914
Thank you.

337
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:16,506
Matt?

338
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,514
Come on, honey. Come on.

339
00:36:57,254 --> 00:36:59,722
Hey, hey, hey, watch it.
Watch the milk.

340
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:02,323
Billy, I'm serious.

341
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:04,653
- Is Mary a total goon?
- No.

342
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:06,351
"Oh, yeah."

343
00:37:07,664 --> 00:37:09,859
Is Billy a poop head?

344
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,363
"But of course, my dear."

345
00:37:11,568 --> 00:37:13,468
Language, language.
Here. Eat, eat, eat.

346
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:16,733
Come on. Stop.
I gotta go to work, okay?

347
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:18,800
Wendy is in charge.

348
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:20,076
Okay?

349
00:37:20,277 --> 00:37:22,575
I'm sorry, honey.

350
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:25,873
See you, Mom.

351
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,149
You be good or else you guys
have to deal with me.

352
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:32,121
Okay?

353
00:37:32,956 --> 00:37:35,516
I'm just kidding. It's okay.

354
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,653
Fifty-one, 52...

355
00:37:38,862 --> 00:37:43,925
...53, 54, 55...

356
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:50,664
...56, 57, 58, 59, 60.

357
00:37:52,075 --> 00:37:54,009
Here I come.

358
00:38:27,344 --> 00:38:28,368
Jonah.

359
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:34,445
Jonah!

360
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,992
Jonah!

361
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:46,889
Where are you, son?

362
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,123
Come here.

363
00:38:51,468 --> 00:38:52,901
- Don't.
- You're not leaving.

364
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:55,230
I'm sorry.

365
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,033
Wendy?

366
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,896
Wendy! Help! Wendy!

367
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:16,048
Oh, for God's sakes.

368
00:40:16,953 --> 00:40:18,079
Just leave me alone.

369
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:23,690
It's okay, it's okay.

370
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:25,724
Come on, guys. Let's go.

371
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:28,830
Billy. Come on.

372
00:40:40,577 --> 00:40:42,272
It's okay, son. It's okay.

373
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:46,882
- I just... I don't know who else to talk to.
- No, no, no. I'm glad you called.

374
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:50,644
It's all around us, all the time.

375
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:53,586
The living and the dead.

376
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,190
Invisible to everyone.

377
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:58,526
Almost everyone.

378
00:40:58,728 --> 00:40:59,717
Yeah.

379
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,954
Because we're not like
other people anymore.

380
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:05,328
You see, most people spend
their life firmly planted in this world...

381
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:09,835
...then one day, they go straight
to the other side, but we...

382
00:41:10,507 --> 00:41:12,304
We take a much more roundabout path.

383
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:16,377
We spend quite a lot of time
in the borderland.

384
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:21,247
But either way, only one thing matters.

385
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:24,018
Yeah, what's that?

386
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:29,390
Well, find out what he wants from you.

387
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:11,524
Okay.

388
00:42:22,278 --> 00:42:24,143
What do you want from me?

389
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:55,333
You know,
that was actually my favorite movie.

390
00:42:58,047 --> 00:43:00,140
- Mom?
- Aunt Sara?

391
00:43:01,818 --> 00:43:03,547
Mom.

392
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:31,680
You should've told me about this.
These symptoms can be a sign...

393
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:34,748
...that it's moved to the brain.
But Matt's MRls are all clear.

394
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:36,282
He has no tumors.

395
00:43:36,486 --> 00:43:39,455
Whatever was causing the behaviors,
it wasn't that.

396
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:42,915
I'm just afraid he's gonna lose
his mind before he can get better.

397
00:43:43,126 --> 00:43:47,460
This is a crucial time, but he is still an
excellent candidate for this treatment.

398
00:43:47,664 --> 00:43:50,030
Age counts enormously, and attitude.

399
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:51,860
Attitude?

400
00:43:52,068 --> 00:43:54,263
His own family is afraid of him.

401
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:02,745
Where's your truck?

402
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,538
I sold it.

403
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,274
Why didn't you tell me?

404
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:11,749
I just did.

405
00:44:11,955 --> 00:44:15,891
Paid the last round of bills,
this month's mortgage. Today.

406
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:18,720
Like doc says, attitude.

407
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,943
Oh, honey.

408
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:40,815
I'm so sorry.
I just love you so much.

409
00:44:41,451 --> 00:44:42,850
Mom, love hurts.

410
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:48,720
Mom, just...

411
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:52,852
Look, I want you to know that if...

412
00:44:53,062 --> 00:44:54,893
If what?

413
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:57,358
- That if I die...
- You won't.

414
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:05,973
- It's not your fault.

415
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,904
No.

416
00:45:46,816 --> 00:45:51,082
No. You can't have him.

417
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:58,155
Can't have my son.

418
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:15,100
Hey.

419
00:47:15,404 --> 00:47:16,996
We're bored.

420
00:47:17,206 --> 00:47:18,798
Please play with us.

421
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:21,169
Why don't you ask Matt?

422
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,972
Yeah, why don't you ask Matt?

423
00:47:29,452 --> 00:47:31,215
You okay?

424
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:33,144
I'm outstanding.

425
00:47:35,224 --> 00:47:37,021
Okay, come on, guys.
I'll count to 30...

426
00:47:37,226 --> 00:47:40,457
...and let's see if we can find some
new hiding places this time.

427
00:47:43,065 --> 00:47:44,464
Matt.

428
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:52,965
Go on.

429
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:08,454
One, two, three, four, five.

430
00:48:34,684 --> 00:48:35,844
There's room for me too.

431
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:37,246
Find your own spot.

432
00:48:38,554 --> 00:48:40,715
Twenty-nine, 30.

433
00:48:40,923 --> 00:48:42,823
Ready or not, here I come.

434
00:50:08,444 --> 00:50:10,674
Let me out of here!

435
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,904
Help!

436
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:14,914
Get me out of here!

437
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,286
Get me out!

438
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:21,614
Get me out of here!

439
00:50:23,392 --> 00:50:26,054
What happened? What? Come here.

440
00:50:26,262 --> 00:50:28,628
What? What is it? What?

441
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:33,290
Okay.

442
00:50:35,738 --> 00:50:37,433
- Mary?
- I'm over here.

443
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,938
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

444
00:50:40,142 --> 00:50:43,270
Wait. Be careful.
Hey, the floor must be rotten.

445
00:50:43,479 --> 00:50:45,310
- Rotten? Where?
- Well, here for sure...

446
00:50:45,514 --> 00:50:47,004
...where Mary's leg fell through.

447
00:50:47,216 --> 00:50:48,877
Just stand back, okay?

448
00:50:49,085 --> 00:50:50,518
Hey.

449
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,052
- You're okay.
- Bugs.

450
00:50:53,255 --> 00:50:56,053
Okay. Come here. You okay? Yeah?

451
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:04,593
What is that?

452
00:51:11,374 --> 00:51:14,707
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my.

453
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,755
What is it?

454
00:51:34,497 --> 00:51:36,624
Okay. Come on.

455
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:37,821
Playtime's over.

456
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:40,734
God, they're all...

457
00:51:41,637 --> 00:51:42,604
...dead.

458
00:51:43,973 --> 00:51:47,238
So sad. It's probably the only time
they ever had their photo taken.

459
00:52:01,123 --> 00:52:03,091
What are those?

460
00:52:03,826 --> 00:52:05,521
I don't know.

461
00:52:12,034 --> 00:52:13,001
You all right?

462
00:52:13,202 --> 00:52:14,794
Yeah.

463
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,367
These are really weird.
It has to be fake.

464
00:52:21,544 --> 00:52:22,772
Let me see those.

465
00:52:33,255 --> 00:52:34,882
What?

466
00:52:37,026 --> 00:52:39,119
- Nothing.
- Matt, come on.

467
00:52:39,328 --> 00:52:40,886
Just give me a chance.

468
00:52:47,937 --> 00:52:50,565
- I've seen him.
- Shut up.

469
00:52:50,773 --> 00:52:52,604
Gave you a chance.

470
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:55,206
I'm sorry, okay? Just...

471
00:52:55,945 --> 00:52:56,934
Go on.

472
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,675
Please?

473
00:53:01,851 --> 00:53:04,718
I thought that I was hallucinating,
but I have seen this kid...

474
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,650
...almost every day
since we've been here.

475
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:11,521
Okay, I wake up in the middle
of the night...

476
00:53:11,727 --> 00:53:13,991
...and it feels like he's been inside me...

477
00:53:14,196 --> 00:53:16,858
...looking out through my eyes.

478
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,191
One bright day
In the middle of the night

479
00:53:20,402 --> 00:53:23,667
Two dead boys got up to fight

480
00:53:24,006 --> 00:53:26,167
Okay, me and him,
we're just two dead boys.

481
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,382
Maybe the place is haunted.

482
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:39,881
Either way,
I mean, we need to find out...

483
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:44,048
...who put these things
under the floorboards and why.

484
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,160
Yeah, but how?

485
00:53:46,695 --> 00:53:50,153
Okay, well, don't tell anyone,
but there are these buildings...

486
00:53:50,366 --> 00:53:55,497
...all over the country where
secret knowledge is kept, known only...

487
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:58,501
...as libraries.

488
00:54:11,987 --> 00:54:15,388
Okay, so check it out:
"A Case of Materialization."

489
00:54:15,591 --> 00:54:18,958
That is Ramsey Aickman,
and this was his mortuary.

490
00:54:19,662 --> 00:54:24,190
Now, he had a very interesting hobby:
Psychical research.

491
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,460
And your guy, dead kid,
his name was Jonah...

492
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:30,364
... and he was Aickman's assistant
and a medium.

493
00:54:31,106 --> 00:54:33,472
Supposedly, they contacted
the dead through Jonah...

494
00:54:33,676 --> 00:54:36,645
... and people came to have chats
with their dead hubby or wife...

495
00:54:36,845 --> 00:54:39,336
...or find out where Auntie Mame
hid the family jewels.

496
00:54:39,548 --> 00:54:43,917
Now, he claims that he discovered
how to amplify the seances.

497
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:47,919
So he not only contacted the dead,
but he made things appear.

498
00:54:48,123 --> 00:54:49,715
What things?

499
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:51,825
Ectoplasm.

500
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:54,018
And what is ectoplasm?

501
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:59,064
A mysterious protoplasmic substance
streaming out of the body of mediums.

502
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:02,628
So it's just like in those pictures
in the box.

503
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:06,638
Photographs of ectoplasm often
show a gelatinous material oozing...

504
00:55:06,842 --> 00:55:08,935
... from all the natural orifices
of the medium.

505
00:55:09,144 --> 00:55:14,104
From mouth, ears, nose, eyes
and even the lower orifices.

506
00:55:14,316 --> 00:55:19,049
So Aickman held all those seances
in this house...

507
00:55:19,254 --> 00:55:21,620
... and people came
from all over and were convinced.

508
00:55:21,824 --> 00:55:24,725
Harvard professors,
all kinds of big shots.

509
00:55:25,294 --> 00:55:28,730
I mean, Aickman and Jonah's
seances were famous.

510
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:31,395
Well, do we know
what happened to him?

511
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,295
Well, here's where it gets
a little weirder.

512
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:35,437
So there was a seance
led by Aickman...

513
00:55:35,638 --> 00:55:37,128
... with Jonah as the medium.

514
00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:39,773
All four sitters and Aickman
were found dead.

515
00:55:40,876 --> 00:55:43,811
- Cause of death not clear.
- So Jonah killed them.

516
00:55:44,013 --> 00:55:45,640
Nobody knows. No sign of him.

517
00:55:45,848 --> 00:55:48,612
He was missing, vanished,
never seen again.

518
00:55:49,451 --> 00:55:50,418
Well, until now.

519
00:55:51,687 --> 00:55:54,656
Well, here's the weirdest part of all.
Okay, so 30 years later...

520
00:55:54,857 --> 00:55:56,688
... when they expanded the highway...

521
00:55:56,892 --> 00:55:58,450
... they did the detour through
the cemetery...

522
00:55:58,661 --> 00:56:00,720
Wait, we've been on that road
a million times.

523
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:04,194
This is the thing: When they tried
to relocate some of the old plots...

524
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,732
...they found something weird,
or didn't find.

525
00:56:06,935 --> 00:56:08,835
- What?
- Over a hundred bodies...

526
00:56:09,038 --> 00:56:11,871
...that were supposed to be there
weren't, just empty...

527
00:56:12,074 --> 00:56:13,507
...coffins filled with sandbags.

528
00:56:15,077 --> 00:56:16,704
Someone stole the bodies.

529
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:18,846
Aickman.

530
00:56:19,048 --> 00:56:21,039
Or Jonah. Aickman or Jonah.

531
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,979
Maybe, but why?

532
00:56:26,188 --> 00:56:31,125
I don't know,
but I might know somebody who does.

533
00:56:36,365 --> 00:56:38,799
- Remarkable.
- Do you think it's real?

534
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:44,137
Well, I've seen plenty of fakes,
but I've seen the real thing once.

535
00:56:45,074 --> 00:56:46,803
Paris. It...

536
00:56:47,009 --> 00:56:51,844
It was the most horrible thing
I've ever seen, but not this.

537
00:56:52,047 --> 00:56:53,708
Must've been a very powerful medium.

538
00:57:31,987 --> 00:57:33,011
What are they?

539
00:57:33,222 --> 00:57:34,553
Eyelids.

540
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:37,050
Human eyelids.

541
00:57:38,327 --> 00:57:39,419
Well, what are they for?

542
00:57:40,496 --> 00:57:42,521
Necromancy.

543
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:44,255
Corpse-bothering.

544
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:48,067
It's a loathsome form of magic.

545
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:53,970
It's seeking power through control
of the dead via relics of their bodies.

546
00:57:54,176 --> 00:57:55,370
Well, why eyelids?

547
00:57:56,145 --> 00:57:57,942
That's a good question.

548
00:57:58,881 --> 00:58:01,975
I mean, traditionally we'd close the eyes
of the dead so they may...

549
00:58:02,184 --> 00:58:03,742
...rest in darkness.

550
00:58:03,952 --> 00:58:08,946
Now, removing their eyelids keeps
their eyes open, makes them see.

551
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:13,692
Perhaps he intended them
to be watchmen...

552
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,394
...or guardians of this house...

553
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:19,398
...or of his secrets.

554
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:22,035
By the way, I mean,
somewhere there are the bodies...

555
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:26,105
...that belong to these people,
and he used them.

556
00:58:26,942 --> 00:58:30,844
I think ultimately, Aickman intended
to enhance Jonah's powers.

557
00:58:31,747 --> 00:58:33,942
Well, he amplified his seances.

558
00:58:34,149 --> 00:58:37,346
Somehow he bound the spirits of the
dead to their bodies, yes...

559
00:58:37,553 --> 00:58:41,683
...as an amplifier, probably through
some form of ritual or desecration.

560
00:58:43,492 --> 00:58:45,585
Perhaps buried outside the house?

561
00:58:50,465 --> 00:58:54,424
Perhaps it would help if we prayed
for all those poor souls that died here.

562
00:58:56,104 --> 00:58:57,867
For the boy too.

563
00:59:14,957 --> 00:59:16,049
Mommy?

564
00:59:16,258 --> 00:59:18,283
- Come back.
- Mommy?

565
00:59:19,628 --> 00:59:21,755
Please, please, help me.

566
00:59:29,771 --> 00:59:30,931
- Mommy.
- Help me.

567
00:59:33,275 --> 00:59:34,503
Matt.

568
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,404
Matt.

569
01:00:38,407 --> 01:00:40,136
Matt. Who are you?

570
01:00:40,342 --> 01:00:41,775
What are you doing in my house?

571
01:00:41,977 --> 01:00:43,342
- Matt?
- I'm a reverend.

572
01:00:43,545 --> 01:00:45,103
It's okay. We asked him to come.

573
01:00:45,314 --> 01:00:46,781
- Asked him?
- We met at the...

574
01:00:46,982 --> 01:00:48,882
- Get out of my house.
- Get off. It's fine.

575
01:00:49,084 --> 01:00:51,245
We met at the hospital.
I receive treatment.

576
01:00:51,453 --> 01:00:53,614
- Get out.
- Well, he called me for advice.

577
01:00:53,822 --> 01:00:55,813
- It's a little hard to explain.
- Try.

578
01:00:56,024 --> 01:01:01,587
I believe that there is something evil
in this house...

579
01:01:01,797 --> 01:01:04,322
...something no longer living
and not yet passed over.

580
01:01:04,533 --> 01:01:05,898
And it wants your son.

581
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:08,968
That's a dangerous situation
for someone who's close to death...

582
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:10,399
He's not.

583
01:01:11,006 --> 01:01:16,467
And I'm as hopeful as you,
but tell me, have you not...

584
01:01:17,245 --> 01:01:19,679
...felt something strange here?

585
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:26,086
I don't know what you're talking about.

586
01:01:26,288 --> 01:01:30,122
I appreciate the concern, but this is
not the type of help we need right now.

587
01:01:30,325 --> 01:01:32,259
I'd like you to leave.

588
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:34,285
Of course.

589
01:01:41,436 --> 01:01:43,233
You're not alone.

590
01:03:43,892 --> 01:03:45,723
Peter?

591
01:03:54,903 --> 01:03:56,336
Matt?

592
01:04:34,876 --> 01:04:36,537
You're kidding.

593
01:04:38,046 --> 01:04:39,673
Hello!

594
01:04:39,881 --> 01:04:41,542
Anybody home?

595
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,115
All the lights are on!

596
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:47,712
Why are all the lights on?

597
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:50,820
Ridiculous.

598
01:04:53,261 --> 01:04:54,819
Everybody in this house is sleeping...

599
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:57,657
...with the lights on
and I wanna know why!

600
01:04:57,866 --> 01:04:59,891
He's been drinking.

601
01:05:01,736 --> 01:05:04,398
Why don't we just build a fire
and throw money into it?

602
01:05:05,106 --> 01:05:06,073
It's okay.

603
01:05:06,274 --> 01:05:08,902
I gotta pay a mortgage,
I'm now paying rent.

604
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,839
Here's another one.

605
01:05:11,413 --> 01:05:13,142
God.

606
01:05:13,448 --> 01:05:17,544
Every single room has got a light on!

607
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:33,063
Here. Here we go.

608
01:05:33,835 --> 01:05:35,666
Sleep in the dark.

609
01:05:47,415 --> 01:05:49,007
There we go.

610
01:05:49,217 --> 01:05:51,242
Lights out.

611
01:05:54,956 --> 01:05:56,787
There we go.

612
01:05:57,425 --> 01:05:59,052
Yeah.

613
01:06:03,765 --> 01:06:05,232
Peter...

614
01:06:06,234 --> 01:06:09,726
...that was a cruel
and childish thing to do.

615
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:13,902
All you did was scare everybody
in this house.

616
01:06:16,011 --> 01:06:18,775
Don't. Don't. Don't.

617
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:27,078
Your family needs your strength,
not your self-pity.

618
01:06:29,357 --> 01:06:33,657
You get drunk again, don't come home.

619
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:39,593
Matt?

620
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,407
Okay.

621
01:08:08,123 --> 01:08:10,353
I'm so sorry.
I just didn't know who else to call.

622
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:11,985
It's all right.

623
01:08:12,193 --> 01:08:16,129
- Are you sure you're feeling up to this?
- Well, put it this way, I'm...

624
01:08:16,498 --> 01:08:19,592
I'm exactly the right state of being...

625
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:21,359
...to traffic with ghosts.

626
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:28,569
What is that?

627
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:31,201
Magnets. Iron magnets.

628
01:08:31,413 --> 01:08:32,744
Iron defends from evil.

629
01:08:33,748 --> 01:08:37,616
So it's no accident
that prisons have iron bars...

630
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:42,017
...to not merely contain the body,
but the evil that may lurk within it.

631
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:53,029
- What are you looking for?
- Where he died.

632
01:08:54,903 --> 01:08:58,839
Sometimes when death is violent
or filled with anger...

633
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:04,876
...or fear or any strong emotion...

634
01:09:06,314 --> 01:09:08,475
...it's as if the spirit doesn't pass on.

635
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,721
That's why we cover mirrors,
light candles, open the shades...

636
01:09:16,925 --> 01:09:19,416
...so that they may find their way out.

637
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:25,666
So a house with a trapped soul
is not so much haunted...

638
01:09:27,035 --> 01:09:29,595
...as it is possessed.

639
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:39,309
What's down there?

640
01:09:40,348 --> 01:09:44,079
Matt's bedroom.
It's where they used to...

641
01:09:46,321 --> 01:09:48,551
Keep the children upstairs.

642
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,127
Yeah.

643
01:10:01,336 --> 01:10:02,394
He's here.

644
01:10:02,604 --> 01:10:04,196
Do you see him, Matt?

645
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:08,166
I don't see anything.

646
01:10:08,376 --> 01:10:11,971
That's because you're strong, you're
healthy. You shouldn't see anything.

647
01:10:44,212 --> 01:10:46,646
So this is where you're trapped.

648
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:50,812
Don't worry.

649
01:10:51,686 --> 01:10:54,655
Whatever you may have done,
we're not here to punish you...

650
01:10:56,724 --> 01:10:59,090
...only to free you.

651
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:01,527
Like a bird...

652
01:11:02,196 --> 01:11:04,460
...caught in a room.

653
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,909
There must be another way.

654
01:11:20,148 --> 01:11:21,877
Perhaps the other side of that wall.

655
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:30,079
I have to get his remains
out of the house.

656
01:11:49,677 --> 01:11:51,702
Stop it!

657
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,968
It stopped.

658
01:13:45,693 --> 01:13:47,183
Will Matt be all right now?

659
01:13:47,395 --> 01:13:48,555
Yeah.

660
01:13:48,763 --> 01:13:50,526
The house is quiet and at peace.

661
01:13:51,165 --> 01:13:55,158
But I should warn you that sometimes
for a day or so after...

662
01:13:56,237 --> 01:14:01,140
...strange events, much like aftershocks
from an earthquake.

663
01:14:01,442 --> 01:14:04,138
But don't be alarmed...

664
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:06,910
...it will pass,
within a day or two at the most.

665
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:18,859
- Okay.
- All right.

666
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:22,660
Thank you.

667
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:24,926
It's okay.

668
01:14:27,235 --> 01:14:31,171
I wish I could say
it was my pleasure, but...

669
01:14:35,276 --> 01:14:36,607
You gonna be okay to drive?

670
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:39,245
We're all in God's hands.

671
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:13,046
It's only five more sleeps
till parents' day.

672
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:15,215
I can't wait.
I got a lot to show you, Dad.

673
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:17,441
You'll see
how I shoot the bow and arrow...

674
01:15:17,652 --> 01:15:21,884
... and how far I can swim
and they're having a father-son race.

675
01:15:22,089 --> 01:15:23,113
It's gonna be great.

676
01:15:23,324 --> 01:15:26,418
I bet you and me,
we beat all the others...

677
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:29,892
... unless you're too old
and broke down.

678
01:15:30,097 --> 01:15:33,692
Okay, well, I better go. Bye, Dad.

679
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:39,867
All right,
whatever was here is gone now.

680
01:15:40,074 --> 01:15:42,372
Now, we've all had
some really bad nights.

681
01:15:58,793 --> 01:16:00,055
Stay here.

682
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:05,028
Oh, my God.

683
01:16:05,233 --> 01:16:07,394
Oh, my... Oh, my...

684
01:16:08,603 --> 01:16:11,197
Oh, my God.
What have you done to yourself?

685
01:16:15,943 --> 01:16:19,470
All right, I'm gonna follow them. When
I get back, we're getting out of here.

686
01:18:14,929 --> 01:18:16,760
Sir?

687
01:18:17,798 --> 01:18:20,631
They'll be after you now.

688
01:18:20,835 --> 01:18:22,268
Get out.

689
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:01,634
Somebody help me!

690
01:19:11,552 --> 01:19:15,818
Please! Somebody help me!

691
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,377
Where's Matt?

692
01:20:14,582 --> 01:20:16,072
He's at the hospital.

693
01:20:16,283 --> 01:20:19,480
The doctors are gonna
take care of him, okay?

694
01:21:08,836 --> 01:21:11,396
Hi. We're not home right now,
so please leave a message.

695
01:21:11,605 --> 01:21:12,833
Thanks.

696
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:17,010
I made a terrible mistake.

697
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:20,544
Aickman didn't remove their eyelids
to make the dead see...

698
01:21:20,748 --> 01:21:22,682
...but to make them unseen.

699
01:21:22,883 --> 01:21:25,215
So all those missing bodies...

700
01:21:25,786 --> 01:21:29,347
...all those poor souls in torment,
they're still there. They're in the house.

701
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:33,451
But the boy wasn't evil.

702
01:21:33,694 --> 01:21:35,457
He was trying to free them.

703
01:21:35,663 --> 01:21:36,960
And I removed him.

704
01:21:39,533 --> 01:21:41,694
Now all that's left is their rage.

705
01:21:42,236 --> 01:21:43,635
You must get out now.

706
01:21:45,673 --> 01:21:47,231
Get out now.

707
01:22:27,615 --> 01:22:29,173
I'm sorry.

708
01:22:30,884 --> 01:22:33,853
It's okay. You're here now.
That's all that matters.

709
01:22:37,858 --> 01:22:40,725
He's sedated and comfortable.

710
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:42,727
We ran his panels.

711
01:22:43,764 --> 01:22:45,698
I'm afraid it's not good news.

712
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:47,594
His cell count is worse than before.

713
01:22:48,002 --> 01:22:51,267
The treatment has, frankly,
had no effect.

714
01:22:54,241 --> 01:22:55,970
How long do you think he has?

715
01:22:56,176 --> 01:22:59,077
With these numbers,
I don't know what's keeping him alive.

716
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,180
He could go tonight.

717
01:23:01,382 --> 01:23:04,078
There's really no way of saying for sure.

718
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,912
Then can we see him?

719
01:23:08,756 --> 01:23:10,587
Of course.

720
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:13,519
To fight.

721
01:23:13,727 --> 01:23:15,558
One bright day
In the middle of the night

722
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:17,788
Two dead boys got up to fight

723
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:19,260
He couldn't have gotten far.

724
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:21,991
- One bright day in the middle...
- Hi, this is Dr. Brooks.

725
01:23:22,202 --> 01:23:23,965
Get me security right away, please.

726
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:25,798
Two dead boys got up to fight

727
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:27,371
One bright day
In the middle of the night

728
01:23:27,574 --> 01:23:29,906
Two dead boys got up to fight

729
01:23:38,485 --> 01:23:40,180
Matt?

730
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:43,916
Matt?

731
01:23:44,258 --> 01:23:45,987
Matt.

732
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:01,965
Come over. Come here.

733
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:06,209
We're gonna play
hide-and-seek now, okay?

734
01:24:06,413 --> 01:24:08,040
Okay, go.

735
01:24:11,318 --> 01:24:13,809
- We have to get out of here. Come on.
- What's going on?

736
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:15,784
We have to go. We have to...

737
01:24:16,323 --> 01:24:17,881
Matt. Matt, no.

738
01:24:18,092 --> 01:24:19,286
Matt, no. No.

739
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:27,894
- Get out.
- Matt.

740
01:24:28,102 --> 01:24:29,797
Get out.

741
01:24:30,003 --> 01:24:32,801
Matt. No. Matt.

742
01:24:33,006 --> 01:24:35,702
Get out. Whatever you do,
do not let them put out the fire.

743
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:37,809
- What about you?
- I'm already dead.

744
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:42,712
- Matt, come out. Matt.
- Matt.

745
01:24:46,019 --> 01:24:47,782
We'll find him.

746
01:29:03,176 --> 01:29:05,406
Mom. Dad.

747
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,347
Where's Matt?

748
01:29:07,547 --> 01:29:09,742
- He's inside.
- I don't understand.

749
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:12,578
- I thought you said it was over.
- Matt's trying to end it.

750
01:29:12,786 --> 01:29:13,810
- I gotta get in.
- Ma'am.

751
01:29:14,021 --> 01:29:17,013
No, you gotta let me in there.
I have to get my son.

752
01:29:17,224 --> 01:29:20,125
- Fire.
- Please let me go. Please.

753
01:29:20,327 --> 01:29:22,158
To unbind the spirits.

754
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,385
What are we waiting for? Come on!

755
01:29:48,588 --> 01:29:50,317
Matt!

756
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:05,695
Oh, my God.

757
01:30:06,273 --> 01:30:08,241
Okay.

758
01:30:11,211 --> 01:30:12,872
All right.

759
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,372
I'm here. I'm here.

760
01:30:41,408 --> 01:30:42,932
The Lord is my shepherd.

761
01:30:43,143 --> 01:30:44,770
I shall not want.

762
01:30:45,011 --> 01:30:47,445
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

763
01:30:48,348 --> 01:30:50,714
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

764
01:30:51,551 --> 01:30:53,849
He restoreth my soul.

765
01:30:54,054 --> 01:30:56,284
He leadeth me
in the path of righteousness.

766
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:03,725
He helped my son.

767
01:31:28,121 --> 01:31:32,683
We're here. We're here. We're here.

768
01:31:46,907 --> 01:31:48,602
Matt.

769
01:31:54,614 --> 01:31:56,411
Be careful.

770
01:31:58,819 --> 01:32:00,343
Come on, wake up.

771
01:32:00,954 --> 01:32:02,182
Wake up.

772
01:32:02,389 --> 01:32:04,584
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

773
01:32:16,069 --> 01:32:18,333
No. Hold on.

774
01:32:18,538 --> 01:32:20,335
Wake up.

775
01:32:32,686 --> 01:32:35,382
Come on, Matty.
Come on, Matty, breathe.

776
01:32:37,624 --> 01:32:39,683
I love you.

777
01:32:52,005 --> 01:32:54,098
Wake up, Matt.

778
01:32:58,712 --> 01:33:00,543
I just love you so much.

779
01:33:03,016 --> 01:33:04,574
Come on, Matty, wake up.

780
01:33:05,518 --> 01:33:08,248
Please, come on, honey.

781
01:33:09,756 --> 01:33:11,314
Come on.

782
01:33:17,397 --> 01:33:19,524
You'll be all right.

783
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,540
Hey.

784
01:33:49,429 --> 01:33:51,454
He's okay.

785
01:34:10,317 --> 01:34:13,946
I don't really care
if anybody believes me or not.

786
01:34:14,788 --> 01:34:17,018
I know what happened.

787
01:34:17,223 --> 01:34:22,217
Doctors and nurses know
and my family knows.

788
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:27,056
And my son is alive...

789
01:34:28,368 --> 01:34:30,359
... and well.

790
01:34:31,338 --> 01:34:33,465
That's all that matters.

791
01:34:34,808 --> 01:34:38,039
They say that God works
in mysterious ways.

792
01:34:39,045 --> 01:34:42,811
They just don't always tell you
how mysterious those ways can be.

793
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:46,110
Consider yourself warned.
