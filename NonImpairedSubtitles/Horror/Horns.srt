479
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,219
Hey.

480
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,012
Everyone in this town
is going fucking crazy.

481
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,764
Yeah, the town's
always been crazy.

482
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,642
No, but I think it's because
of me and these goddamn horns.

483
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,644
Yeah.

484
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,771
Wait, what?

485
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,523
The horns.

486
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,566
These horns.

487
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,820
What are you talking about?

488
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,780
Wait, can't you see them?

489

Are you high right now?

490
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,995
You been hanging out with Terry?

491
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,538
So maybe...

492
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,749
maybe the horns just
don't work on good people.

493
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,711
Yeah, I think you've been
under an inhuman amount

494
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,755
of stress recently.
And maybe you're just starting

495
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,884
to go a little, you know-
A little, oh, cuckoo.

496
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,847
But if I am this crazy and
I can imagine all this...

497
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,850
then I could easily have got so
drunk that I blacked out that

498
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:36,896
night and killed Merrin and
just forgot all about it, right?

499

Well, I didn't know

503
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,347
I didn't know where
else to go, Mom.

504
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,184
Something really bad
is happening to me.

505
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,649
Oh, sweetheart.

506
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,779
Why couldn't you
go somewhere else?

507
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,781

508
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,948
What do you mean?

509
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,077
I don't want to hear

510

512
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,750
Sometimes when you talk,
I just want to sing.

513
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,086
La, la, la, la, la, la!

514
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,045
What are you doing? Mom!

515
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:46,424
I wanna hold my breath
until you just go away!

516
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,554
Ar-Jesus Christ,
Mom, don't Don't!

517
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,139
Stop it!

518
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,396
I want to write you a letter,
a really nice letter...

519
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,564
about how much Dad
and I love you...

520
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:06,861
and how great it would be for
both of us if you would just go.

521
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,155
But where?
Where can I go?

522
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,992
I don't know. Didn't you always
want to go hiking in Alaska?

523
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,995
Didn't you want to go to
Vietnam to teach English?

524
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,247
Those were things
Merrin and I were

525
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,081
gonna do together.
You know that.

526
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't care where you go. Just
as long as I don't have to see

527
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:26,714
you. Because every time I see
you, it just makes me so...

528
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,008
unhappy.

529
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:33,012
I just want to be happy
again, sweetheart.

530
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,557
No, I understand.

531
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,609
And I don't want you
to be my son anymore.

532

00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,784
Are you gonna go away?

535
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,709
Ig.

536
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,211
I thought I heard you come in.

537
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,466
Yeah, okay, let me walk
you through this, Dad.

538
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,843
This is the part where you
tell me something awful...

539
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,470
you've been keeping to yourself.

540
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,974
Just say it, we'll
get it out of the way.

541
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,520
I don't know why you
turned out like this.

542
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,318
With your brother, it's easier.

543
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,990
We could always
play music together.

544
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,035
But with you, I never
know what to say to you.

545
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:42,624
Well, that's not bad,
all things considered.

546
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,335
I think about Merrin.

547
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,256
What a beautiful girl she was.

548
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,098
I loved her.

549
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,227
You know, in a way.

550
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,148
I envied you.

551
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,901
I was never in
love with anyone

552
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,111
the way you two were in
love with each other.

553
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,448
You couldn't hear her
laugh without smiling.

554
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,117
It was like music.

555
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,747
And when I think about
what you did to her...

556
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,626
And you never thought maybe...

557
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,879
just maybe that I didn't do it?

558
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,964
Of course not.

559
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,675
You're trying to get
away with murder.

560
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,553
And the worst part is,
I'm helping you do it.

561
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,681
What? What do
you mean by that?

562
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,474
I went to college
with the guy that runs

563
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,016
the state forensics lab.

564
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,352
Dad, are you telling me
that you got your friend to

565
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,270
set that fire at the lab?

566
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,730
When the world comes for my
son with the knives out...

567
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,358
it's my job to stand in the way.
And if you went to jail...

568
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,319
Dad, the evidence you got
burned up could have saved me.

569
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,738
How could you do it?

570
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,033
She was one of the best
people I ever knew!

571
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:03,288
She was my favorite
thing about you.

572
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,791
Yeah, me, too.

573
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,127
So if you knew how
much I loved her

574
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,171
then how could you ever
believe I'd killed her?

575
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,178
Isn't that why you killed her?

576
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:23,224
Because you loved her so much...

577
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,769
and you lost her.

578
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:32,108
Way more people kill out
of love than out of hate.

(Stan) The only thing I know
is I got a cousin who's a cop.

633
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,340
He knows who the new witness is.

634
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,760
It's a waitress who served you
the night Merrin got killed.

635
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,221
Said she saw you drive
back to the restaurant and

636
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,181
drag Merrin into your car.

637
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,183
Thanks a lot, Stan.

Okay.

you're gonna come tomorrow night
to the diner at about 9:00.

I will have hopefully
done the deed by then...

tomorrow night without
stimulants, I hope.

Hey, what's wrong, Merrin?

661

I don't really know
how to say this.

Are you kidding?
That's great.

665

Like, I can get a
leave of absence from the

I want a change of scene too.

It's not what I'm talking about.

668

I think that we need to
stop seeing each other.

Oh, I don't think we've
quite decided yet.

Okay. Well, I'll come back.

I thought everything
was going great.

674
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,563
Well, it's just that we haven't
had a chance to ever be apart.

675
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,899
And I've never had the
chance to think about

676
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,234
what I want for my life.

677
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,487
Well, okay, but I know
what I want. I want the

678
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,490
life we've been dreaming
about since we were kids.

679
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,574
But that's the problem.

680
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,618
We've been dreaming about
that since we were kids.

681
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:01,747
And we're adults now. We
need to start being practical.

682
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,709
I don't know what
you mean by that.

683
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,544
I don't want to
ever be the reason for

684
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,878
any of your regrets, Ig.

685
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,423
But how many times have we
talked about getting married?

686
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,800
I mean, how many times
have we talked about

687
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,176
what we're going
to name our kids?

688
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,594
I'm not even sure if
I want to have kids!

689
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,596
What! Well, you
sounded pretty into it the

690
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,891
last 8,000 times
we talked about it!

691
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,605
How many girls
have you been with?

692

Just me.

Yeah.

695
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,448
No one does that, Ig.

696
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,868
No one on the whole
planet does that.

697
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,871
You need to see other
people so you can figure out

698
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,914
if I am the one that
you want to be with.

699
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,083
But I don't want to
see other people.

701
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,129
Is that what you want?

702
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,720
Are you in love
with somebody else?

703
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,686
And how far has it gone?

704
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,816
Answer me!
How far has it gone?

705
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,693
Have you fucked him already?

706
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,277
Please, Ig.

707
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,863
No! Tell me! Tell me
everything that happened.

708
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,699
I need to know.
Have you fucked him already?

709
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,825
Why are you asking me this?

710
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,827
Because I want to know!
I want to know everything.

711
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:25,664
It's gonna make it easier
for me to hate you!

712
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,964
You deserve better.

713
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,301
Finally, something we agree on.

714
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,564
Please, I'm gonna be lost.

715
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,444
I'm not in love
with you anymore.

716
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:04,870
Come on, please. We're not
done talking about this.

717

(Manager) Sir, sir, sir.

721

We're gonna have to ask
you and your wife to leave.

722
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,722
Yeah? She's not my wife. She's
just someone I used to fuck.

Hey, Ig, whoa. How'd it go?
You already proposed?

727
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,069
The party's over, Terry.
Go home.

728
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,822

about? Hey, hey! I thought

729
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,992
we were gonna celebrate
tonight. What's going on?

730
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:43,826
(Car starts)

731
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,413
Iggy, what the
fuck are you doing? Hey!

732
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,305
Merrin, you all right?

733
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,585
(Eric) Good morning, Ig.

734
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,713
Can you roll down the
window so we can talk?

735
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,385
Hey, Meatbag, what's up?

736
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,263
When's the last time
you saw Merrin, Ig?

737
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,598
What's happened to her, Eric?

738
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,810
(Sturtz) What makes you think
something happened to her?

Oh, fuck.
It's all my fault.

740
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:59,610
Anything that happened to her,
it's all my fucking fault.

741
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:15,209
(Veronica) So, do you guys want
dessert? Can I get you dessert?

742
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,671
I got a cherry pie.

744
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,551
Oh, I gotta go.

745
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,638
You could sit wherever you want.

746
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,558
Oh, wait, you're that guy.
Ig Perrish.

747
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:31,976
Yeah.

748
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:35,187
I've heard you've been telling
lies about me to the police.

749
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:35,980
Yeah, I have.

750
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,108
And you know, I don't even feel
a little bit bad about it.

751
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,778
You want to tell me exactly
what you said to them?

752
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,947
Well, I told them that you're
girlfriend forgot her jacket

753
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,116
so I followed her into
the parking lot and I saw you

754
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,536
drive back and scream that
you were gonna kill her.

755
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,829
But you know that's not true.

756
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,331
And that I saw you drag
her into your car...

757
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,666
and then you drove off.

758
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,460
What? Why the hell
would you say all that?

759
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:02,131
Because I want to be in
all the newspapers and on TV.

760
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,883
I wanna be the star
witness at your trial.

761
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,677
I'm pretty enough
to be on TV right?

762
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,471
Especially if I get my tits
lifted the way that I want.

763

You're just a
fucking crazy liar!

I know I am.
I'm so bad. I'm bad.

765
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,688
Sometimes when people
ask me what you did...

766
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,523
I say that after you
beat her brains in...

767
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:24,236
that then you turned her over
and you fucked her in the ass.

768
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:28,115
You should see their
faces when I say that.

00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,072
Wow.

789
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,867
No, I must have been
really drunk still.

790
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:06,713
Why don't you let me suck
your cock in the men's room?

791
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,799
I would really like that.

792
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,927
And I bet it would
make you feel better.

793
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,846
No, Glenna.

794
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,515
Thanks, but not right now.

795
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,643
The thing is, Ig...

796
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,981
I've always been
in love with you.

797
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,193
Since we were kids.

798
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,488
But I guess you
knew that, right?

799
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,866
I guess I did kinda know that.

800
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,159
Yeah.

801
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:40,956
God, it's just I just wish
that I could leave this town.

802
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:42,958
And just...

803
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,585
What's stopping you?

804
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,335
You.

805
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:48,797
Me? No.
It can't be me.

806
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,844
Right? No. Put this shithole
town in your rear view mirror

807
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,723
and do something
good for yourself.

808
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,939
Hey, go.

809
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,948
(Cigarette lighter)

810
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,219
(Terry) Ig, I didn't
know you were here.

811
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,764
Jesus Christ, what the
fuck is on your head?

812
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:39,932
They're horns, crazy story.

813
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,975
Listen, Terry...
I need you to help me.

814
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,644
No, fucking just
listen to me, Terry.

815
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,979
The waitress from the diner,
okay, she is going to the

816
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,357
cops and telling them that
she saw me drag Merrin into

817
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,484
my car and drive away from
the diner that night.

818
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,277
Jesus, I know for a
fact that's not true.

819
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,737
Well, yeah, you know
that, and I know that

820
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,072
but how the hell are
we gonna prove that?

821
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:58,367
I mean, Merrin left the
diner with me that night.

822
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,996
What do you mean, she
left the diner with you?

823
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,207
You told me you never saw
her that night at all.

824
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,627
I didn't kill her, Ig.
I would never hurt her. I...

825
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,045
What are you
talking about, Terry?

826
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,505
I was just too scared.

827
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,673
(Punch)

828
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,840
Fuck!

829
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:15,842
(Punch)

830
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,302
Tell me, Terry!

831
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,512
Okay!

832
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:43,412
So, what just happened
with you and Ig?

833
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,873
I don't want to talk about it.

834
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,042
Are you sure?
I mean, you're shaking.

835
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,420
Look at you.
You're a mess.

836
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,007
Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you take one of these.

837
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,093
Just take one.
They're fun. Take the edge off.

838
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,429
I don't want to.

839
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,391
I need to release what
I'm feeling tonight.

840
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,151
God, you're beautiful.

841
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,945
You know that?

842
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,280
Can you pull over?

843
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,073
I need to get out of the car.

844
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,074
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't...

845
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,910
Look, it's the end of the
world out there. Why don't...

846
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:24,453
I wanna go for a walk.

847
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,998
Merrin, Are you trying to
get yourself killed? Hang on.

848
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,421
Thanks for the ride, Terry.

849
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,172
Come back!

850
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,717
I'm fine now, I promise, okay?

851
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,178
Merrin!

852
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:45,349
Don't be ridiculous.
Where are you going?

853
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,652
I'll wait for you!

854
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,085
(Turns radio off)

855
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,200
What the fuck?

856
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,786
What the fuck?

857
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,090
Merrin.

858
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,181
Merrin!

859
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,310
Merrin!

860
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,156
Merrin!

861
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,497
You fuck!
How could you?

862
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,247
What did you do to her?

863
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,833
Do you even fucking remember
what you did to her?

864
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:19,294
I didn't kill her.
I loved Merrin too.

865
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,922
Well, if you didn't
kill her, then who did?

866
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,215
(Siren)

867
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,674
Oh, fuck!

868
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,886
(Eric) We got a call on
the radio about some kind

869
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,471
of altercation
going on out here.

870
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,182
We got a pretty good
idea who's responsible.

871
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,184
Listen to me, Eric,
this is all my fault.

872
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,937
(Man) Hey, maestro,
break time is over. Let's go.

873
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:40,065
Go on back inside, Terry, none
of this thing concerns you.

874
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,734
Yeah, go back inside.
Play a fucking song!

875
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,486
You'd better calm down,
Ig. You don't want to be

876
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,613
resisting arrest. We'd be
inclined to use force.

877
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,031
What are you arresting
me for? 'Cause I got into

878
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,825
a fight with my coward
brother? Is that a crime?

879
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,245
The thing is, this club is
across the county line.

880
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,081
Which means we caught you
fleeing jurisdiction.

881
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,375
For God's sake, talk about
the most obvious kind

882
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,211
of trumped up charge. Fuck!

883
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,879
Go back inside.

884
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,005
(Ig) Fuck you, Eric.

885
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,424
(Eric) Fuck me? You fuck!

886
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,885
I wish we could bring
you in for worse.

887
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:12,138
I wish I could plant
something on you.

888
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,266
Like maybe a piece of her dress.

889
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,517
That way I could put
you away for good.

890
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,311
For God's sake, Eric,
you've known me my whole life.

891
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,438
You know I'd never hurt her.

892
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:24,442
Bullshit, Ig! You confessed
to me. Everyone in town

893
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,486
saw you fighting with her
the night she was killed!

894
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:28,280
That's not what happened.
I said whatever happened to

895
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,366
her was my fault because I ran
off on her. I left her alone.

896
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,578
Whatever that waitress
told you is lies.

897
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,122
Hey, listen, you asshole.
I'm gonna make sure

898
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,999
you get punished for
everything you did to her

899
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,168
even if I have to beat you
to death with my own hands.

900
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:43,920
(Sturtz) Do it, Eric.
Beat him to death.

901
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,256
That'll give me something
to whack off to tonight.

902
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:50,260
Only I'll be picturing
both of you naked.

903
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,720
Yeah, I like that.

904
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,348
I like to think about
you naked too, Sturtz.

905
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,477
(Ig) What the fuck?

906
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,522
(Siren)

907
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:14,659
(Eric)You know, Lee might
have sprung you for now, but

908
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,161
we're not gonna let
you out of our sight.

909
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,704
(Lee) Hey, Meatbag,
leave my client alone.

910
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,956
You're trying to make my life
as hard on me as possible?

911
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,541
Hey, Lee, I know who
the new witness is. It's the

912
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,543
waitress from the diner.
She's lying about everything.

913
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:25,503
Whoa, whoa, what is this now?
Do I gotta keep a leash on you?

914
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,380
Yeah, and Terry drove away
from the diner with Merrin

915
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,758
that night. They drove
off together in his car.

916
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,260
You're saying that Terry was the
last person to see her alive?

917
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,304
Yeah. I don't think he ever
would have done anything

918
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,639
to her but he can't
remember anything from the...

919
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,557
Why is he confessing this to you
all of a sudden?

920
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:38,767
Because of the horns, Lee!

921
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,436
Oh, my god, Ig. I can't talk
to you when you're like this.

922
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:45,315
There's no horns.
You're going crazy. Go home.

923
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,735
Why are you wearing
Merrin's cross?

924
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,988
It's not Merrin's. It's mine.
I've had it forever.

925
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:52,614
You think I'm an idiot?

926
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:56,117
You think I don't know what
Merrin's cross looks like?

927
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,082
Yeah, it's hers.

928
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,085
She gave it to me.

929
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,045
Why would she do that?

930
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,797
- Ig, it was...
- What?

931
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,175
There's things about
Merrin you don't know.

932
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:19,474
There's things about Merrin and
me that I haven't told you.

933
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,103
What are you talking about?

934
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,356
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for anything to happen.

935
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,608
You were the one she...

936
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:29,693
Ig, come on.

937
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,112
You're the reason
she was gonna fucking...

938
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:32,779
We didn't want to hurt you.

939
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,532
If you didn't
want to hurt me you're
doing a fucking lousy job!

940
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:39,285
Ig, come on.
Ig. Ig, I'm sorry.

941
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,123
Oh, fuck.

942
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:44,416
Fuck!

943
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,168
Fuck! Fuck!

944
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,587
(Lee) You like that
new girl in church?

945
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:50,547
I don't know her yet.

946
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:54,592
Ig, you like her enough
to get me to fix her cross.

947
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,261
I like her too.

948
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,389
She seems, you know, pure.

949
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:23,413
(Dogs barking)

950
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,765
(Slithering)

951
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,309
(Knock on door)

952
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,528
(Dale) Get the
hell off my property.

953
01:07:56,572 --> 01:08:00,075
I know that I'm the last person
you want to see right now...

954
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,620
but you're the only person
I can ask about this.

955
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,663
I have got nothing
to say to you.

956
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:09,375
I should shoot you
right in the heart.

957
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:11,086
No.

958
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:15,799
If you really wanted to kill
me, you'd have already done it.

959
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,009
I know that.

960
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,053
These days, I bring out
the worst in people.

961
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,472
What I want is for you
to tell me the truth

962
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:24,974
about what you did
to my daughter.

963
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,476
And then I want to kill you.

964
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:30,605
What I need to know is
did Merrin say anything to you

965
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:34,484
about leaving me or about
being with somebody else?

966
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,486
You got some kind
of nerve. Coming out here

967
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:41,074
and asking me if my daughter
was unfaithful to you.

968
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:41,491
But could you...

969
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,451
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

970
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,078
Look, you're the only
person she would have told

971
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,955
because you're the only one
who loved her like I did.

972
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,583
Don't you fucking dare
say we're the same.

973
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,505
When I was watching the cancer
devour my wife's insides...

974
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,799
the only saving grace was I
thought that was the worst

975
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,176
thing that would ever happen
to me. But boy was I wrong.

976
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:03,721
Dale, please, you have
to believe me. I loved her.

977
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:07,725
But now I don't know if I
even really knew who she was.

978
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:08,726
You think there is
a chance in hell

979
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:12,230
I am gonna say one word
to you about my daughter?

980
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,691
If you're looking for
forgiveness or compassion

981
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:18,695
or understanding, go
talk to a goddamn priest!

982
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:25,493
I know you killed her.

983
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:28,872
And I hope you die.
I hope you die...

984
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:33,751
scared and helpless in the
dirt just like my Merrin did.

985
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:39,674
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

986
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:40,967
I shouldn't have come.

987
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:45,221
Get off my porch or I
swear I will shoot you.

988
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,403
(Squealing tires)

989
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,284
(Slithering)

990
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:27,263
(Loud grunting)

991
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,953
(Scraping)

992
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,045
Aaahhh!!!

993
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,936
(Hissing)

994
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,646
Fuck.

995
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:13,453
Sometimes God works
in mysterious ways.

996
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,914
The horns had revealed
so much already.

997
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:21,627
Now I can use them to find her
killer and set things right.

998
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:49,173
(Sfx)
(Scream)

999
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,762
(Sfx)
(Scream)

1000
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:58,266
(Hissing)

1001
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,282
See, vanity doesn't pay.
And it's gonna be a long

1002
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:18,494
time before you can even
try and look pretty again.

1003
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:42,518
You know, you guys really want
to stop following me around.

1004
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:44,979
Telling us what to do now?

1005
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,522
Well...

1006
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:52,111
I mean, wouldn't you rather just
suck each other off right here?

1007
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,493
What the hell
makes you say that?

1008
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,661
Well, you know, ever since
we were kids I kind of

1009
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,748
assumed you maybe had to act
so tough 'cause you were

1010
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,542
ashamed of yourself?

1011
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,045
Was I right?

1012
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,631
When I was a kid, I used
to shoplift gay porno mags

1013
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,675
from the drug store.
And my dad found them under

1014
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,511
my bed and he cracked
me with his belt.

1015
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,972
You see, you both been brought
up to believe it's a sin, but...

1016
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:21,974
it's just being human.

1017
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:25,728
That's why I always wanted
to be partnered with Eric.

1018
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:28,397
I think about him all the
time when I'm whacking off.

1019
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:32,568
I wanna kiss you on the mouth
when you talk dirty like that.

1020
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:35,863
♪ ♪

1021
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:39,951
Have fun, officers.

1022
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,290
Oh, Wallace.

1023
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,167
Come here.

1024
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:04,267
(Snorts)

1025
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,144
Hey, Terry.

1026
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:12,149
Ig. I didn't know
you were gonna come by.

1027
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:13,859
How's it going?

1028
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,988
What's that snake
doing around your neck?

1029
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,490
I made a new friend.

1030
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:22,994
You want a drink?

1031
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:26,414
Maybe something a
little stronger?

1032
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,419
No.

1033
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,796
No, I wanna keep my
head clear tonight.

1034
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:39,844
But don't let me stop you.
Do as much as you want to do.

1035
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:51,689
Jesus Christ, Terry, how many
drugs are you doing lately?

1036
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:55,067
If you want to know
the truth, I have...

1037
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:58,904
I've had a hard time
staying sober, you know,

1038
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:00,740
ever since Merrin died.

1039
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:04,827
I've actually been on kind
of a bender myself tonight.

1040
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,039
Been having a very good time.

1041
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:14,503
That's good.
I'm glad to hear that, Ig.

1042
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,091
Shit, look...

1043
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:24,180
I know things have been tough
for you lately, okay? But...

1044
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:28,225
Well, understandably,
but I just...

1045
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,519
(Snorts)

1046
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,689
But here's where the fun ends.

1047
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:38,444
This is gonna give me
no pleasure at all.

1048
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:41,614
What are you talking about?

1049
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:48,162
Well...
you're my big brother, Terry.

1050
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:52,166
I have always depended on
you to look out for me.

1051
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,919
I have always tried to do my
best by you, Ig. You know that.

1052
01:17:54,920 --> 01:18:00,091
Except when you saw Merrin lying
under that tree in that dirt...

1053
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,594
you didn't call an ambulance
and you didn't call the cops.

1054
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:07,640
You just ran off
and left her there.

1055
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:11,102
Fuck, Ig, she was already
dead, okay? There was nothing

1056
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:13,896
I could do. The cops would
have thought that I killed her.

1057
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:16,232
Even when I got arrested,
you didn't go to them

1058
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:19,527
and tell them the truth.
No, now why would you?

1059
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,863
Why would you do that
unless you were guilty...

1060
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,157
unless you actually killed her?

1061
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:28,494
Because I'm your fucking
brother, that's why.

1062
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,453
You understand if I-

1063
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:32,039
I mean, they would have just
thought I was helping you.

1064
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,208
But you never even
tried to help me.

1065
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:37,878
All you wanted to do
was save your own skin.

1066
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:41,882
You are a selfish
motherfucker, Terry.

1067
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,135
And I hate you.

1068
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,138
Yeah, you know what?

1069
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,185
You're so fucking right.

1070
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:54,103
You're right.

1071
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:57,648
I am evil and you
should kill me, Iggy.

1072
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:01,152
That's what you should do.
You should fucking kill me.

1073
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,987
I mean, that's what
I deserve, right?

1074
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,781
I mean, after what I did,
that's what I fucking deserve.

1075
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:07,491
The way I see it, I have
every right to kill you...

1076
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:09,702
but I think I'm gonna let you
live and make you suffer.

1077
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,872
Why don't you just
finish all that off.

1078
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,170
What, all of it?

1079
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:22,214
I think I've made myself clear.

1080
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,353
Now there's nowhere left to run.

1081
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:20,356
You are gonna see
everything she saw...

1082
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:23,108
and feel what she felt.

1083
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:26,362
And the worst part is...

1084
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:30,282
you're gonna live
through all of it.

1085
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:01,522
(Scream)

1086
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,628
Iggy!

1087
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:27,923
Iggy!

1088
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,684
Terry?

1089
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:57,661
Terry! Terry! Terry!

1090
01:21:57,662 --> 01:21:59,872
Help! Iggy!

1091
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:02,082
Where are you?

1092
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,179
Help me! No!

1093
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:37,952
Punishing Terry was the
hardest thing I've ever done.

1094
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,412
But forcing him to face
his demons was the only

1095
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:42,539
way I could help him.

1096
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:04,103
(Lee) Jesus Christ, Ig.

1097
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:05,479
I looked for you everywhere.

1098
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,606
(Ig) Look, get out of
here before I do something

1099
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:10,234
we're both gonna regret.

1100
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,237
(Lee) We gotta move past this.
This is not what Merrin wanted.

1101
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:15,447
So you're the expert on
what Merrin wanted now?

1102
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:18,492
I was never gonna
tell you anything.

1103
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,452
No.

1104
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:23,288
So how long was it going
on between you two?

1105
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,623
You don't want to know anything.

1106
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:26,583
Oh, I need to understand.

1107
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:30,671
It was just a couple months.

1108
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,716
She was moving
out to California.

1109
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:36,010
We wanted to figure out if it
was real before we told anyone.

1110
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,304
And so when she got killed,
did you think it was me? Or like

1111
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:42,433
did you think that I found out
about you and lost control?

1112
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,560
If I thought you had
anything to do with this,
I wouldn't be helping you.

1113
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:45,894
Okay, well, I don't want
any more of your help.

1114
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:47,521
Yeah, I'm the only one who can
help you. I'm gonna prove that

1115
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,565
waitress is lying. I'm gonna get
Terry to confess to the police.

1116
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,316
Just fucking go, Lee.
Leave me alone.

1117
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:53,152
And don't fucking touch me!

1118
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:55,779
(Lee) The cross, dude! Fuck!

1119
01:24:00,952 --> 01:24:02,953
Are those horns?

1120
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:07,583
Goddamn right, they're horns.

1121
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:11,045
I'm glad you can
finally see them.

1122
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,796
So now you have to
tell me the truth.

1123
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:15,549
Merrin's cross can't
protect you anymore.

1124
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,801
Why should I tell you anything?

1125
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,345
You're not gonna
be able to help it.

1126
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,935
I never meant to kill her.

1127
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:29,855
You fuck!

1128
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:32,524
You fuck.

1129
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:37,946
I didn't mean to do it, Ig.
I loved her just as much as you.

1130
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:42,534
I'm the one who fixed her cross.

1131
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:44,578
She should have been with me.

1132
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:45,871
Oh, you sure as shit fooled me.

1133
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:48,874
I always thought you spent your
whole life trying to be good!

1134
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,042
I try and control myself.

1135
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,086
But you saved my life when
we were kids. You pulled me out

1136
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:55,172
of the water right here. You're
the only reason I'm alive!

1137
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,966
It was the stupidest
mistake I ever made.

1138
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,927
I should have let you drown.

1139
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:00,636
(Laughs)

1140
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,638
Then I'd be with her now.

1141
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,681
That's a fucking lie!

1142
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,604
(Chokes)

1143
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,737
Thank you for coming to see me.

1144
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:22,950
Listen, I think Ig is
gonna propose to me.

1145
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:26,078
Do you know anything about that?

1146
01:25:27,163 --> 01:25:27,871
Maybe.

1147
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:30,624
There are some things
that I've learned about

1148
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,960
myself recently and...

1149
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:39,716
I know now that I
can never marry Ig.

1150
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:48,350
Why are you telling me this?

1151
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:58,110
Will you come by
the diner later?

1152
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,779
I really think it will
help if you're there

1153
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,198
when this is all over with.

1154
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:06,326
Of course.

1155
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:11,498
Thank you.

1156
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:11,975
Terry?

1157
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:14,978
(Lee) It's me.

1158
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:16,563
Oh, Lee, wow, you frightened me.

1159
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,690
What are you doing out here?
Come on, let's get some dry

1160
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:20,400
clothes on you. I'll
drive you home. Come on.

1161
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:23,487
No, No.
I want to be alone right now.

1162
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,364
You'll get sick.

1163
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:26,615
No.

1164
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:29,826
You okay?

1165
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:31,620
Hey, hey, hey.

1166
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,914
(Sobs)

1167
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,415
Hey.

1168
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,084
Hey.

1169
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,920
Everything's okay.

1170
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:44,967
I got you.

1171
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:46,885
I got you.

1172
01:28:04,862 --> 01:28:07,739
What? What are you doing?

1173
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,742
There's nobody here.
It's just us.

1174
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:13,203
You're joking?

1175
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:15,998
I mean, we don't have
to pretend anymore.

1176
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:18,917
It's just...
It's fine.

1177
01:28:18,918 --> 01:28:22,546
No, No. No. Stop it!

1178
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:25,048
Don't! Don't do that.

1179
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:27,968
Just get off me!

1180
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:34,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

1181
01:28:34,934 --> 01:28:37,769
I've been waiting for
this for such a long time.

1182
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:41,481
I can't believe this
is finally happening.

1183
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,775
I need to touch you.

1184
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,610
No.

1185
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:46,903
Feel you, honey.

1186
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:49,781
No, look. Listen,
you are Ig's best friend.

1187
01:28:49,782 --> 01:28:53,285
You're my friend.
You're my friend.

1188
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:55,996
Please, don't you
understand anything?

1189
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:59,833
I understand everything.
I understand everything.

1190
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:03,378
Every time the three of
us hang out together...

1191
01:29:03,379 --> 01:29:07,090
it's like there's this
elephant in the room.

1192
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:09,760
'Cause we're so clearly
supposed to be together,

1193
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:12,929
but nobody says
anything. You know?

1194
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,932
And we stare at each other.

1195
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:18,727
Merrin, we stare at each other.

1196
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:22,356
No, let go of me. Don't!

1197
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,775
You don't know the
first thing about what

1198
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,068
I'm going through right now.

1199
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:27,611
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1200
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,155
What about all the signals
you've been sending me?

1201
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:33,742
What? Signals, what?

1202
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:35,952
Merrin.

1203
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:40,040
Oh my god, you thought that
I broke up with Ig so that...

1204
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,792
No. No.

1205
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,627
But you know you love me.

1206
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,713
I love you. I love you.

1207
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,590
I love Ig so much.

1208
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:50,675
(Slap)Ow!

1209
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:54,262
I love him more than the world.

1210
01:29:56,599 --> 01:30:00,644
That's the last thing she
said, that she loved me.

1211
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:02,187
Oohh!!

1212
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:06,483
You want to know
what happened, Ig?

1213
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:06,942
Shut up!

1214
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:10,070
Ow! I love... (Slap)
No, no! Please, no!

1215
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:13,824
Stop it! Help! Terry!

1216
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:16,868
(Slap)

1217
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:19,496
I gave her what she asked for.

1218
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,123
Ahh!!
Jesus!

1219
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:27,003
Please, Lee!
It's me! It's me!

1220
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,381
I fucked her tight little pussy.

1221
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:31,800
No! No.

1222
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:43,562
(Crack)

1223
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:46,189
Then I bashed her
face in with a rock.

1224
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:47,816
(Ig) No!

1225
01:31:05,334 --> 01:31:06,960
(Lee) You know what?

1226
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:10,755
Love made devils of us both.

1227
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:27,791
The way I see it, you
confessed to me...

1228
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,962
and you were so
overwhelmed with guilt...

1229
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:33,755
that you killed yourself.

1230
01:32:33,756 --> 01:32:36,132
(Hissing)

1231
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:41,263
So much... I always
wanted to try this.

1232
01:32:46,852 --> 01:32:50,730
It's gonna be fun.
It's gonna be fun.

1233
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:52,691
Okay. Hey.

1234
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:20,051
Aaahhh!!!

1235
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,229
(Car starts)

1236
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:52,000
(Eric) Mr. Perrish committed
suicide earlier today.

1237
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:55,045
We have recovered his vehicle.
Perrish's lawyer Lee Tourneau

1238
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,089
was the only witness at the
scene. Mr. Perrish confessed

1239
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:01,176
his crimes to Mr. Tourneau
and then killed himself.

1240
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,595
(TV Reporter) Is there any
validity to the reports that

1241
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:04,721
no body was found
in the vehicle?

1242
01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:07,182
(Eric) Any and all reports
originating outside the Gideon

1243
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:09,768
P.D. should be considered
hearsay and conjecture at

1244
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:13,772
this time, nothing more.
No further questions.

tonight that Ig Perrish has

reportedly driven his
vehicle into the bay.

01:35:41,777 --> 01:35:45,447
The truth is I don't know the
answer to that question myself.

1256
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:50,410
I have prayed for so
long for you to die...

1257
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:54,914
but when I saw
the news on the TV...

1258
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:58,126
it didn't help one bit.

1259
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:04,382
I didn't kill her, Mr. Williams.

1260
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:09,554
But you know who
did it, don't you?

1261
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,850
You gotta tell me.

1262
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:16,102
What will you if I tell you?

1263
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:17,520
You know what I'll do.

1264
01:36:17,521 --> 01:36:19,814
But this is my job.

1265
01:36:19,815 --> 01:36:23,443
People say you should
always do the right thing.

1266
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:26,696
Sometimes there
is no right thing.

1267
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,324
And then...

1268
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:34,454
Well then you just have to pick
the sin you can live with.

1269
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:42,253
Why don't you come inside.

1270
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:51,471
Yesterday I was wandering around
the house and I found this.

1271
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:58,520
I thought maybe I should
give it to the police, but...

1272
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:01,397
that didn't feel right.

1273
01:37:04,109 --> 01:37:07,111
She wanted you to have this.

1274
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:14,410
Thank you.

1275
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:21,042
And there's something
I would like to give you.

1276
01:37:24,129 --> 01:37:25,338
Here.

1277
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:33,263
Merrin's mother, she gave
this to her just before she...

1278
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,141
You know, son, I think...

1279
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:42,146
I think you need this
even more than I do.

1280
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,276
I think you need her
to keep you safe.

1281
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:57,036
(Sizzling)

1282
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:17,765
Well now...

1283
01:38:17,766 --> 01:38:21,769
I guess maybe that's some
kind of blessing after all.

1284
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:35,742
(Ig) The horns weren't
a curse, but a blessing.

1285
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,494
They had guided me this far.

1286
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:41,623
And when I put on her cross...

1287
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:45,001
I could feel her
protecting me again.

1288
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:48,296
♪ ♪

1289
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,155
Dear Ig...

1290
01:39:56,699 --> 01:40:00,243
you'll never read
this while I'm alive.

1291
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:05,581
I'm not even sure I want you
to read it after I'm dead.

1292
01:40:07,042 --> 01:40:10,628
I think you're gonna ask
me to marry you soon.

1293
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:14,716
You don't know how
much I want to say yes.

1294
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:18,011
But I can't.

1295
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:18,928
What?

1296
01:40:18,929 --> 01:40:21,097
The thing is, Ig, I'm very sick.

1297
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:26,602
The sort of cancer I have is
the kind that runs in families.

1298
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:30,106
I saw my mother go through it...

1299
01:40:30,107 --> 01:40:32,567
and I saw what it
did to my father.

1300
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:34,944
If I tell you I'm sick,
you're just gonna wanna

1301
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:40,366
marry me even more.
And I'll be weak and say yes.

1302
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:44,287
Then you'll give up your future
and be shackled to me...

1303
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:47,582
as I go through
hell and die anyway.

1304
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:50,793
I won't put you through it.

1305
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:53,129
I love you too much.

1306
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:57,759
My plan is to hurt you,
just enough to push you away.

1307
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,512
And hopefully one day
you can forgive me...

1308
01:41:01,513 --> 01:41:03,639
and you will move
on to someone else.

1309
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:06,559
You'll have children,
grandchildren and

1310
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,856
great-grandchildren. You will
go for long walks in the woods.

1311
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:15,318
On one of these walks,
when you're very old...

1312
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:20,573
you'll find yourself at a tree,
with a house in its branches.

1313
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:23,367
I'll be waiting for you there.

1314
01:41:23,368 --> 01:41:27,330
I'll be waiting by candlelight
in our treehouse...

1315
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:31,042
shining the light of my
cross into your eyes.

1316
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:34,545
The first message
I ever sent you.

1317
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:36,923
(Both) Us.

1318
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:40,718
I love you, Iggy Perrish.

1319
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:43,638
Your girl, Merrin.

1320
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:46,182
(Sobs)

1321
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:03,199
Iggy, you're alive.

1322
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,660
(Ig) You know-don't.

1323
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:09,288
Iggy...

1324
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,708
we have to clear your name.

1325
01:42:13,168 --> 01:42:16,045
We need to figure out
who really killed Merrin.

1326
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:17,797
It was Lee.

1327
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:22,593
If you're going after Lee,
then I am coming with you.

1328
01:42:22,594 --> 01:42:24,512
Terry, you're not
strong enough for that.

1329
01:42:24,513 --> 01:42:27,557
I am not leaving you.

1330
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:31,644
I made myself a promise.
Never again.

1331
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:40,611
If anything happens to me, I
need to know you're all right.

1332
01:42:40,612 --> 01:42:43,322
And for Mom and Dad's sake.

1333
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:03,301
(Lee) I'll be damned.

1334
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:05,261
(Ig) You and me both.

1335
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:07,388
What are you doing out here, Ig?

1336
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:11,809
You don't remember anything that
happened between us, do you?

1337
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:13,936
You wanna come inside?

1338
01:43:13,937 --> 01:43:17,607
No, actually I was hoping
we could go for a walk.

1339
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:19,317
I mean, nobody's looking for me.

1340
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:22,069
Pretty much everyone in
town thinks I'm dead.

1341
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:23,696
No shit.

1342
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:25,406
So what do you say?

1343
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:27,575
It's just a walk?

1344
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:28,826
Yeah.

1345
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,125
Okay.

1346
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:57,146
Why'd you bring us here?

1347
01:43:57,147 --> 01:43:58,981
You know why.

1348
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:03,819
Because this is where
you killed Merrin.

1349
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,784
What happened to you?

1350
01:44:10,702 --> 01:44:12,370
You lost your mind?

1351
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:15,748
Things are gonna go a
lot easier for both of us

1352
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:18,209
if you don't lie to me.

1353
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,552
Ig...

1354
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:34,934
I'm your best friend.
You've known me your whole life.

1355
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:36,936
Do you think I had
something to do with this?

1356
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:42,483
Believe me, all I want
to do is kill you.

1357
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:46,570
But I am trying to be human.

1358
01:44:46,571 --> 01:44:50,408
I am trying to be the kind of
man Merrin wanted me to be.

1359
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:55,579
And so I am giving you this
chance to do the right thing.

1360
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:01,335
We are gonna go down
to the police station.

1361
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:01,794
Okay.

1362
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:02,920
You are gonna turn yourself in.

1363
01:45:02,921 --> 01:45:06,716
(Eric)(Cocks gun)Keep your
hands where I can see them, Lee.

1364
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:08,926
Don't do anything stupid.

1365
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:10,803
Oh, Terry.

1366
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:12,763
(Lee) What the fuck you
doing here, Terry?

1367
01:45:12,764 --> 01:45:14,890
(Eric) Terry came to
talk to me just now.

1368
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:17,351
Told me some things about
the night that Merrin died.

1369
01:45:17,352 --> 01:45:19,895
Anything he said, he's just
trying to save his own ass.

1370
01:45:19,896 --> 01:45:20,813
Go fuck yourself.

1371
01:45:20,814 --> 01:45:21,480
Yeah, fuck you too.

1372
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:24,567
You told everybody
that Ig confessed to you

1373
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:27,236
and then killed himself.

1374
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:29,864
At least one of those
things isn't true.

1375
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:34,785
So now I'm wondering, what else
you were lying to me about.

1376
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:36,037
Fuck.

1377
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:40,499
I'm sorry.

1378
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,754
I'm sorry.

1379
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:48,632
I'm so sorry.
I have to-Okay.

1380
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:52,511
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1381
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:55,890
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry.

1382
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:57,850
I'm sorry.

1383
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:01,896
Okay. I'm gonna
do the right thing. Okay.

1384
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:06,484
Okay, I'm gonna fix
all of this, okay?

1385
01:46:06,485 --> 01:46:07,818
(Eric) You're doing good.

1386
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:08,944
Okay.

1387
01:46:08,945 --> 01:46:13,282
That's right.
We've been friends a long time.

1388
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:18,871
(Ig) Fuck, Lee!

1389
01:46:18,872 --> 01:46:21,957
(Terry) Why don't you
put the goddamn gun down.

1390
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:26,295
(Gun shot)

1391
01:46:29,591 --> 01:46:31,592
(Gun shot)

1392
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,303
(Laughs)

1393
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:40,434
(Lee) Back the fuck up.

1394
01:46:40,602 --> 01:46:42,603
Back the fuck up.

1395
01:46:43,605 --> 01:46:46,565
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1396
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:54,198
I'm so sorry, Merrin.
I'll see you soon.

1397
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,712
Aaarrgghh!!

1398
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:40,161
Aaarrgghh!!

1399
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,929
(Gun shot)

1400
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:00,973
No!

1401
01:48:11,276 --> 01:48:13,486
(Gun jams)

1402
01:48:24,956 --> 01:48:27,041
Please, Ig.

1403
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:34,191
(Slithering)

1404
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,250
Ig?

1405
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:11,014
(Ig) In the end
I embraced the horns.

1406
01:52:11,015 --> 01:52:13,809
Like an angel who
fell to earth...

1407
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:16,937
I became a devil one last time.

1408
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:20,482
But revenge is all consuming.

1409
01:52:20,483 --> 01:52:23,235
And my time has come
to return to you...

1410
01:52:23,236 --> 01:52:25,863
so we can be together again.

1411
01:52:38,334 --> 01:52:39,334
No, no, I swear.

01:52:39,335 --> 01:52:44,673
I mean, if this isn't paradise,
I don't know what is.

01:52:52,932 --> 01:52:55,017
Are you horny?

1414
01:52:55,643 --> 01:52:57,686
I'm getting warmer.

1415
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:00,022
Oh, fine.

1416
01:53:02,358 --> 01:53:03,817
No.

1417
01:53:04,235 --> 01:53:05,235
Yes.

1418
01:53:05,236 --> 01:53:07,112
No.

1419
01:53:17,248 --> 01:53:20,834
I'm gonna love you for
the rest of my life.

1420
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:29,843
Just love me for
the rest of mine.
