1
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,712
Gypsy caravan.

2
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:20,049
Honest-to-God Gypsies.

3
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:07,892
Do I?

4
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:10,519
- Do I have to?
- Oh, yes.

5
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:13,105
Well?

6
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,608
297.

7
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:18,445
Billy, you were 297 last week.

8
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:21,365
It takes some time
for these diets to work.

9
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,203
Heidi, what are you doing to me?

10
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:30,207
- Good morning.
- What you wanted me to do to you...

11
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,668
in the backseat
of your father's car.

12
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:34,587
I'm proving my love.

13
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,842
- You gonna get Mr. Mafia off today?
- Please don't call him that.

14
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:44,138
It's bad enough your father's
defending him. Jokes I can do without.

15
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:49,728
You'll say this is justice.

16
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,356
Keep it up,
I'll take your video card away.

17
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,982
You would not.

18
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,651
Try me, sweetheart.

19
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:59,780
- I'm glad you two think this is funny.
- Come on.

20
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:03,617
I wouldn't have taken Ginelli's case
unless I was convinced of his innocence.

21
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,995
Maybe. This time.

22
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,168
There's my ride.

23
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,714
I go to wipe out
Tataglia's inert science.

24
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,843
Bye. Love you.

25
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,360
The defense calls Max Duggenfield
to the stand.

26
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,612
Your Honor, I object.

27
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:41,575
Considering the fact
that the defendant...

28
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:44,578
is accused of ordering
Mr. Duggenfield's death...

29
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,873
Mr. Halleck, are you sure
you want this witness to testify?

30
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:51,376
If Max Duggenfield feels...

31
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,921
my client paid $40,000
to have him killed...

32
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:57,216
I want to hear him state it
in open court.

33
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,885
Call Max Duggenfield to the stand.

34
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:02,138
Mr. Max Duggenfield, please.

35
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:07,602
- What the hell are you doing?
- Remember about that detective agency?

36
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:11,522
- So this is really about...
- Pulling your ass out of the fire.

37
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:13,524
Please raise your right hand.

38
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:17,196
Do you swear to the tell the truth,
so help you God?

39
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,865
- I do.
- State your name for the record.

40
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,533
Max Duggenfield.

41
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,661
Mr. Duggenfield.

42
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:29,166
Anybody else out there...

43
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:31,878
who might want to see you dead?

44
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:35,465
- Maybe. Possibly.
- To your knowledge...

45
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:38,593
has there ever been
a price on your head before?

46
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:40,512
Well...

47
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:44,808
- Three years ago...
- Who was it?

48
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,811
Who took a contract out on your life
three years ago?

49
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:49,563
- Objection!
- Overruled.

50
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:53,651
Well, it was my wife.

51
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:58,948
She got feisty this one time.
The P. M. S. Thing maybe.

52
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,158
You know how they get.

53
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:03,536
Then there was this money matter...

54
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,622
Your Honor...

55
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:08,333
Now that she's gone through
the change...

56
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,128
everything is beautiful.

57
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,344
Grazie, Mama.

58
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:22,180
Guillermo...

59
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,392
grazie.

60
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,568
- Just doing my job.
- Fuck that.

61
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:36,237
I owe you a big one, William.

62
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:38,948
Listen.

63
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:44,538
I know you had to lobby
Mr. Lily-White-Collar-Partner...

64
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,374
to take this case, so...

65
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,377
What this is really all about is...

66
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:53,714
Even after I'm done paying your firm
a fucking fortune...

67
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:56,551
I'm still gonna owe you,
big time.

68
00:06:57,844 --> 00:06:59,262
Mangia!

69
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:19,158
Play with fire?

70
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,890
You got it, mister.
You tried the rest, now try the best.

71
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:52,235
What you think?
Come on, everybody! It's fun!

72
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:05,290
They're coming this afternoon
to fix the elevator.

73
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:08,585
And congratulations.
You made the noon news.

74
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:14,007
Hey, Billy, you pulled it off.
I never would have believed it possible.

75
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,510
Kirk Penschley proves once again...

76
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:19,179
without faith,
good deeds are dead.

77
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:23,017
Hey, kiddo, you gotta take
a few pounds off there.

78
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:26,020
Come on.
I want to show you something.

79
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:29,357
Have you looked across the street
this morning?

80
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:32,819
Check this out.

81
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,238
Do you see that Gypsy
piece of ass down there?

82
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,073
How can I miss her?

83
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:41,120
All right. Give her this quarter,
tell her to raise her skirt.

84
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,375
- Didn't your prick escape sixth grade?
- I hope not.

85
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,210
What's the matter?

86
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,212
Afraid she heard you?

87
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,883
I'm taking the afternoon off.

88
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,553
- Say "Good afternoon, Billy. "
- Good afternoon, Billy.

89
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:02,768
Don't forget tonight at the club.
We'll celebrate.

90
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,576
What's taking Hopley so long?

91
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,579
- They should have been out hours ago.
- Hi, Judge.

92
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:25,666
I want to thank you for turning me on
to that detective agency.

93
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,419
- It won me a big case this morning.
- Forget that.

94
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:31,590
We've been invaded by a bunch
of filthy, thieving Gypsies.

95
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:34,718
I don't know, Judge.
They bring a little fun.

96
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:37,346
They bring disease, crime
and prostitution.

97
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:40,599
- What fun is that?
- Who's the old guy?

98
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:43,685
Their chief. Named Lempke.

99
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:51,528
- At last. Good riddance.
- Not yet.

100
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:55,365
They've rented some land
at Lars Ancaster's farm.

101
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:57,409
You can't drive them off
private property.

102
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:02,038
Yes, you can. Unless you want the high
school football team down with the clap.

103
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:05,584
They make their money on dog fights!

104
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:07,878
Hey, Judge, no problem.

105
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:10,736
To Dell Barton
Investigative Services...

106
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,738
the best in New England.

107
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:17,077
And to winning.
May it ever be so sweet.

108
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,578
Here, here.

109
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,916
Easy, boy.
Down, boy.

110
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,752
No, no, no. No, no.

111
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:28,922
No way, my hero.
We're out of here before you explode.

112
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,592
- The party is over. Let's go.
- Can you get the cars?

113
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:35,638
I'll get the car. We'll pick up
a pound cake on the way out.

114
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:37,473
No, no, no.

115
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:49,861
- You've got to stop eating like that.
- I know.

116
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:53,240
Billy, I want you
to stop digging your grave...

117
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:55,617
with a spoon and fork.

118
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,995
I love you.

119
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,708
Otherwise, I'd keep my mouth shut.

120
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,547
I can't help it, Heidi.

121
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,133
All I think about is food.

122
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:15,972
Maybe I ought to help you
try to think about something else.

123
00:12:20,184 --> 00:12:21,894
Heidi.

124
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:24,732
Still thinking about food?

125
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,419
I want you fill this...

126
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,337
for my nose.

127
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:51,760
- What you look at?
- Nothing. Nothing.

128
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,261
Go ahead.

129
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:59,935
There's so much more to life
than food.

130
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:05,232
- Just...
- What?

131
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:07,068
Just don't stop.

132
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,111
Don't stop what?

133
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,990
- Please.
- Please what?

134
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:14,826
Please, please, please.

135
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,829
Papa, it is cold.

136
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:20,248
I'll go get my coat.

137
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:55,994
God!

138
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:12,053
- How come you get a trial so quick?
- It isn't a trial.

139
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:16,224
It's a coroner's inquest,
a much simpler proceeding.

140
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:19,561
But it was an accident.

141
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:22,731
So what's the worst
that could happen?

142
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:25,025
Nothing will happen
to your father, Linda.

143
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:29,238
- He didn't do anything wrong.
- So you'll totally get off?

144
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:32,575
There's nothing to "get off" from.
I didn't do anything wrong.

145
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:34,618
An accident is not a crime.

146
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:45,422
You saw the old woman
leave the store, Mr. Bangor.

147
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:50,427
- She was running?
- I guess so. They were stealing.

148
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,598
Yes, but she was running?
That's what I want to establish.

149
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:59,103
I can't say for sure.
I was in the back of the pharmacy...

150
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:02,523
That will be all, Mr. Bangor.
You may step down.

151
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:04,734
Chief Hopley.

152
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:16,246
Chief, perhaps you can help us.

153
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:19,041
Was Mr. Halleck traveling
within the legal speed limit?

154
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:21,794
Yes, sir.
We have witnesses...

155
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,629
and his skid marks confirmed that.

156
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:25,005
Was he Breathalyzed?

157
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,007
Yes, sir.

158
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:29,426
Results?

159
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,557
Well, sir, Mr. Halleck was
as sober as a judge, Judge.

160
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:38,394
Under the circumstances,
I'll let that go.

161
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,814
You are dismissed, Chief.

162
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,908
This court finds no grounds
on which to charge William Halleck...

163
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:56,747
in the death of Suzanne Lempke,
which is hereby ruled accidental.

164
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,083
This hearing is closed.

165
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,217
- You drive.
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,520
Sir?

167
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,400
Thinner.

168
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:42,421
Get in the car.

169
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:02,567
283. Somebody call Richard Simmons.

170
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,952
- Did you weigh yourself?
- 283.

171
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:15,706
283. No fooling?

172
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,249
No fooling.

173
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:23,297
That is 14 pounds in seven days.

174
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,675
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

175
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,220
You look slimmer.

176
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:31,848
I haven't seen you stop eating.

177
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:35,060
- Maybe it's guilt.
- That's stupid.

178
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:38,897
It hasn't affected my diet
any more than it's affected yours.

179
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:53,913
Ahhh!

180
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:57,917
- Why did I come out here today?
- For the exercise.

181
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,420
From the looks of you,
it's finally doing some good.

182
00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:03,214
There's nothing like avoiding
a manslaughter charge...

183
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:05,300
to turn a man's life around.

184
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,679
That's witty, Kirk,
and compassionate too.

185
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:11,223
- What did he say?
- Foot-in-mouth disease.

186
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:14,726
That kind of attitude
could cost you court cases...

187
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:16,728
especially in my court.

188
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,402
You leave me alone, or I'll get Billy
to run you over in that golf cart.

189
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:24,195
- Kirk.
- What?

190
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,699
Give me a little kiss, sweetheart.
Right here.

191
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:32,203
Billy, have you lost your mind?

192
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:39,086
That's surprisingly easy to do
once you've lost a few pounds.

193
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:40,588
Come on.

194
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:47,428
Mike, look at this, would you?

195
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,438
- Your psoriasis is coming back.
- Why?

196
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:58,690
"Why ask why?"
As they say on TV.

197
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:02,194
Stress probably.
Use that ointment from last time.

198
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:08,533
- Hey!
- For horses. Better for cows.

199
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:11,870
281!

200
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:15,875
I've lost two pounds since this morning?
Is that possible?

201
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:20,588
Relax. Soon you'll be able to see
your balls without using a mirror.

202
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:31,725
Listen, Cary...

203
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:35,229
I never really thanked you
for taking care of me.

204
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:40,067
Never told you what happened
right after that, did I?

205
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,402
Leda and I went to lunch.

206
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:45,280
When we came out,
that old gyp was waiting for me.

207
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:48,660
- The one with the...
- Yeah, him.

208
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:52,622
He walked up and touched me,
right here.

209
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:57,127
Did he say anything?

210
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,421
How the hell should I know?

211
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:02,924
I was worried I might catch
impetigo from him.

212
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:04,969
Or lice!

213
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,606
- I want you to go off this diet.
- Does it look like I'm on a diet?

214
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,359
When did you stop?

215
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:24,281
About a week ago.

216
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,456
That's another 25 pounds.

217
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:37,335
That's over 40 pounds
in two weeks?

218
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,131
Make up your mind.
Do you want me fat or thin?

219
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,677
I just...

220
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:52,810
I was thinking that sudden weight loss
is an early warning sign of...

221
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:57,483
- Of what?
- You know what.

222
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:01,320
Christ! If I gain weight,
I have a heart attack.

223
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:03,572
If I lose weight,
I have cancer.

224
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:06,074
I can't win.

225
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,912
I ran into Mike Houston
yesterday.

226
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:13,833
He wants you
to take a few tests.

227
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:21,091
All right.

228
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:26,262
If you don't want to do it for yourself,
and you don't want to do it for me...

229
00:21:26,346 --> 00:21:28,306
will you do it for Linda?

230
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:33,604
Everything's fine.

231
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:37,650
- "Fine"?
- Yeah.

232
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:42,696
Your blood work is five by five.

233
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,991
That's better than mine, in fact.

234
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:51,790
Let's see, cholesterol
and triglycerides are both down.

235
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,379
You haven't been this healthy since you
banged Mary Lou Singer in high school.

236
00:21:57,462 --> 00:22:01,299
Sangster,
and I never got into her pants.

237
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,971
Mike, are you sure about this?

238
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:09,600
I weigh 240 pounds. I've lost
the equivalent of a fucking suitcase.

239
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:12,895
Look, Billy...

240
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:15,982
the important thing here
is for you to relax.

241
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:18,693
Just stop thinking about this.

242
00:22:18,776 --> 00:22:21,989
Your weight will stabilize,
and you'll gain some back.

243
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,742
Believe me,
everything is gonna be all right.

244
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,121
Mr. Halleck!

245
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:32,166
I see you finally found
a diet that works.

246
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,376
You look wonderful.

247
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,086
Right, and I...

248
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,340
want a whole new wardrobe to go with
my new look, so you might want to...

249
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,302
Well, let's do it!

250
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:53,438
You're down to a pant 40.
Maybe even 38.

251
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,318
That can't be right.

252
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,655
Do you have a scale?

253
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,252
This diet you're on...

254
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:15,837
what is it?

255
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:19,549
I've tried all the others.
I might as well try this one.

256
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,301
I don't think you'd like it, Henry.

257
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:26,139
In fact,
I don't think you'd like it at all.

258
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,830
Dad.

259
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:55,587
Can I ask you a question?

260
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:03,428
Is there such a thing
as, like, male menopause?

261
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:07,475
- I mean, hormones that, like...
- What are you trying to say?

262
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:10,812
I'm worried about you.

263
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:16,109
What's there to worry about?
I found a diet that works.

264
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:18,486
Eat all you want
and still lose the weight.

265
00:24:29,123 --> 00:24:31,625
- What happened?
- I don't know. I must've said something.

266
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:36,797
Don't. You'll only upset her more.
There.

267
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:42,971
Billy, will you please slow down?

268
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:44,973
Why are you eating like that?

269
00:24:45,015 --> 00:24:47,017
I don't know
if it's all in my head.

270
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:50,645
- Dr. Mikey thinks it is.
- I hate when you call him that.

271
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:55,609
I do know one thing: I've lost three
pounds a day every day until today.

272
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:57,779
You're putting weight back on?
That's wonderful.

273
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:00,823
Today, I skipped lunch.
Instead of being three pounds lighter...

274
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:03,951
when I got home from the office,
I'm six pounds lighter.

275
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,370
You see, I have to eat like this.

276
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,372
It's a race,
and I'm losing.

277
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:12,585
- You sound mean, as if it's my fault.
- I'm sorry.

278
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:15,589
Was I giving myself a blow job
just then?

279
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:18,050
That is a horrible thing to say.

280
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:23,889
I don't remember you complaining
about it at the time.

281
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,143
Linda should go visit her Aunt Rhoda
for a few weeks.

282
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:34,400
- What?
- She can't watch you go through this.

283
00:25:34,484 --> 00:25:38,029
It's tearing her apart.
Look at what just happened.

284
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:40,281
I'll drive her there tomorrow.

285
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:56,924
Billy. Finally got through
to that specialist.

286
00:25:57,007 --> 00:25:58,175
And?

287
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:01,929
Good news. Based on your test results
and what I've told him...

288
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:04,683
it's definitely not a parasite.

289
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,935
Not a tapeworm.

290
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:10,272
- What does he recommend?
- The Glassman Clinic.

291
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:12,691
They're expecting you tomorrow.

292
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:16,987
And, Billy, even if
you don't want to go...

293
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,157
you have to,
for Heidi's sake.

294
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,659
She's upset.

295
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:24,203
Mike.

296
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:26,330
Leda was eating alone
again last night.

297
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:29,292
Is the judge sick?

298
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,793
Out of town.

299
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:34,505
His sister was
in a pretty bad car accident.

300
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:37,258
Cary Rossington
doesn't have a sister.

301
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:43,474
Then it was Leda's sister.
You have to relax.

302
00:26:43,557 --> 00:26:45,476
See you tomorrow.

303
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:04,454
Leda.

304
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:07,415
Is Cary in?

305
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:10,710
He's in Minnesota
visiting relatives.

306
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:15,883
What's wrong with him?
Has he lost weight?

307
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:18,427
What are you talking about?

308
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,140
I've lost 100 pounds.

309
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,893
That's spelled
with a one and two zeroes.

310
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:29,897
It was the Gypsies, wasn't it?

311
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,317
What do you mean, "Gypsies"?

312
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,321
Did the old man touch you?

313
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,448
What does that have to do with...

314
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:41,576
Come on in, Billy.

315
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,292
Here. You'll need this.

316
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:04,100
He is in Minnesota...

317
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,354
but he's not visiting relatives.

318
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,606
He's at the Mayo Clinic.

319
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,024
Leda...

320
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:17,781
there's no such thing
as Gypsy curses.

321
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,367
You trying to convince me
or yourself?

322
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:25,498
He came up to us as we were coming out
of La Zuppas, that place over in Milton.

323
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,127
Cary was hunting for his keys.

324
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,088
He never saw the old man coming.

325
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:35,258
I did. I tried to warn him,
but I was too late.

326
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,678
He touched him.

327
00:28:38,762 --> 00:28:41,307
Then he whispered something
in his ear.

328
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:46,020
Cary claims he didn't hear
what it was.

329
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:47,521
I heard.

330
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,192
What?

331
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:53,194
What did he say?

332
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:56,531
One word.

333
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:03,205
Lizard.

334
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:09,628
His skin was plating,
turning into scales.

335
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:12,672
It's evolution in reverse.

336
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:16,010
A sideshow freak.
Lord Jesus.

337
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:20,306
He chartered a plane
to take him to the Mayo.

338
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:25,019
Did I tell you that? He can't bear
to have people look at him.

339
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:29,941
At the end, before he left,
his hands were like claws!

340
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:35,489
His eyes were just two bright little
specks inside these deep hollows.

341
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:40,494
Like pieces of tin foil!
And his nose...

342
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:43,705
I have to go
to the Glassman Clinic.

343
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:46,416
I have a metabolic disorder.

344
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,670
Why did you come here?

345
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,089
Why are you looking
for my husband?

346
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:53,258
I just wanted
to compare notes.

347
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:55,802
God. What did he say to you?

348
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:58,763
- What did the old gyp say to you?
- Nothing!

349
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,765
I don't believe that.

350
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,726
I believe it's all your fault.
You hit that old lady!

351
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:09,024
You were the one that hit her!
You! Not Cary!

352
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:12,695
I wrote on the fence, but your husband
slapped on the whitewash.

353
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,281
He was too happy to do it.

354
00:30:16,532 --> 00:30:19,577
Have a nice stay
at the Glassman, Billy.

355
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:23,832
I hear the food's good.

356
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,377
There's no such thing
as a Gypsy curse.

357
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,671
You come back in another
couple of weeks...

358
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:33,008
after you've lost
another 40 or 50 pounds!

359
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:36,344
Tell me what you believe then!

360
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:38,848
Yes, you tell me
what you believe then!

361
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,516
You hear me?

362
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,352
You tell me what you believe then!

363
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:45,438
You tell me!

364
00:30:46,564 --> 00:30:48,566
- You gave me that.
- I did?

365
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:51,652
Mr. Ginelli,
it's Billy Halleck for you.

366
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:58,827
- What can I do for you?
- I got a crazy question for you.

367
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:00,329
Go ahead, Counselor.

368
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:06,376
Do you believe Gypsies
can curse people?

369
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:13,468
I tend to believe what my friends
tell me and what I can see.

370
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:18,056
My mother is a different story.
Hold on.

371
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:27,065
Si.

372
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:38,369
She says she believes.
She knew Gypsies in the old country.

373
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:41,705
She says whoever puts it on
has to take it off. No one else can.

374
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,833
No one else.

375
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,334
What's this all about?

376
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:48,463
I'll get back to you. Thank you.

377
00:31:55,262 --> 00:31:59,057
What happened
at the Rossington's last night?

378
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:04,939
Leda Rossington thinks that old Gypsy,
Tadzu Lempke, put a curse on Cary and I.

379
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,900
What?

380
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:12,113
I know how it sounds,
but that's what she thinks.

381
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:17,451
You see...

382
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:21,790
Cary has this skin cancer...

383
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:25,586
Billy, there is no such thing
as a Gypsy curse.

384
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:30,466
Even if there were, it wouldn't just
be you and Cary that Lempke would curse.

385
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,468
It would be the entire town.

386
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:34,011
Yeah?

387
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:37,806
The whole town didn't kill his wife
and then try and cover it up.

388
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,351
It was me and Cary and...

389
00:32:40,435 --> 00:32:42,228
What?

390
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:45,315
It would be Hopley too.

391
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,860
He was in on the cover-up.

392
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:53,031
Billy...

393
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,494
all you have to do right now...

394
00:32:56,577 --> 00:33:00,331
is to think about checking yourself
into the clinic and getting better.

395
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:01,957
That's all.

396
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,251
Look out!

397
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:12,218
We're here.

398
00:33:17,057 --> 00:33:18,975
Hopley, answer, damn it.

399
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:22,145
- Good morning, Mr. Halleck.
- Morning.

400
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:24,606
We've used the computer
to synthesize your test results.

401
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,818
Amazing.

402
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:32,114
Over 12,000 calories a day,
and you continue to lose weight.

403
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:34,909
Here you are.

404
00:33:34,992 --> 00:33:38,246
Extra whipped cream,
just as you specified.

405
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:42,834
We have some good protocols.
They'll take a week or two to work out.

406
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:46,003
What if that
doesn't tell you anything?

407
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:49,550
We'll keep running tests.
We won't give up.

408
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:52,052
Rest assured of that.

409
00:33:57,432 --> 00:34:01,145
- Where are you going?
- To get some takeout.

410
00:34:11,698 --> 00:34:14,659
Duncan, it's Billy Halleck.

411
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:18,454
The guy at the station house
said you were home sick.

412
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:20,123
You okay?

413
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:32,094
Come on, Duncan.
I know about the judge.

414
00:34:32,178 --> 00:34:34,138
What's happened to you?

415
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:38,267
I don't really think
you want to know...

416
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:40,812
but come on in.

417
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,994
So...

418
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:39,332
now Rossington looks like
what he was all along.

419
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:45,338
That's funny.

420
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,302
And look at you.
You finally found a diet that works.

421
00:35:52,388 --> 00:35:55,182
Whatever we did,
we don't deserve this.

422
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:58,769
No? You ran the old lady down.

423
00:35:58,853 --> 00:36:04,609
Rossington fixed it so points weren't
even taken off your driving record.

424
00:36:04,693 --> 00:36:09,948
And I just ran the whole pack
of them out of the county.

425
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:14,786
Come on. I'm not a criminal.
I wasn't drunk.

426
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,955
How would I know?

427
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:21,544
I didn't give you a Breathalyzer test.
I said I did.

428
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:26,174
That's just the way we do things
here in Fairview, isn't it?

429
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:29,510
What the hell.

430
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,390
- Old lady was jaywalking.
- I wasn't drunk.

431
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:38,812
Maybe there was
something else going on, though.

432
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:42,232
- Like what?
- Never mind.

433
00:36:43,775 --> 00:36:48,447
I want to find the old guy
and tell him we don't deserve this.

434
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,658
You think he put a curse on you?

435
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,995
Good old-fashioned Gypsy curse,
like in Shock Theater?

436
00:36:55,078 --> 00:36:59,125
Does it matter?
I have some things to say to him.

437
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:01,753
Maybe you want to come with me?

438
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:11,930
Christ, Hopley.

439
00:37:11,971 --> 00:37:14,183
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

440
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:17,978
Yours is just a little slower.

441
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:20,773
You'll get there eventually.

442
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:23,400
I am not going anywhere.

443
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:29,281
You find him, Billy.

444
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:32,619
You find him.

445
00:37:32,702 --> 00:37:34,120
When you do...

446
00:37:37,707 --> 00:37:41,586
I want you to kill that old bastard
and say it's from me.

447
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,714
I can't.

448
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:47,510
I can't kill him.

449
00:37:47,593 --> 00:37:51,430
I need him to take the curse off.
He's the only one who can, I think.

450
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:55,476
You think he'll take it off?

451
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,898
Are you gonna snivel up to him
and say, "I'm so sorry"?

452
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:03,776
Look how sorry I am!

453
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:06,488
Don't be stupid!

454
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:11,827
Take the gun! Go on.

455
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:14,621
Take it.

456
00:38:14,705 --> 00:38:18,834
Take the gun.
Take the gun.

457
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:20,836
Take the goddamn gun!

458
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:24,632
Take the gun!
Shoot him!

459
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:29,512
It's the only satisfaction you'll get,
'cause he'll never take the curse off!

460
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:32,640
Never!

461
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:37,270
Never!

462
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:20,358
Mike Houston was here.
Why did you leave the clinic?

463
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,444
Billy?

464
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,446
Are you all right?

465
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,617
Fine.

466
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,081
We care about you, sweetheart.
I care about you.

467
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,624
Linda.

468
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,670
The doctors at the Glassman Clinic
can't help me.

469
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:43,215
If they can't help you,
who do you think can?

470
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,134
I saw Duncan Hopley
before I came home.

471
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,099
He offered to give me his gun.
I didn't take it.

472
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:54,769
- Thank God!
- I probably should have, though.

473
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:56,980
I heard a gunshot after I left.

474
00:39:57,063 --> 00:40:01,651
Maybe Duncan saw a rat and decided
to do a little brain surgery on it...

475
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:03,653
but I don't think so.

476
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:06,657
Lempke cursed him too.
His face...

477
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,203
Please. Please! Please don't go
through that curse thing again!

478
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:13,414
What else can it be?

479
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,875
I'm not on a diet!

480
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,669
It's not anorexia!
I don't have a tapeworm!

481
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:23,008
I've been eating like mad for six weeks!
12,000 calories a day, at least!

482
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:25,302
And I'm still losing weight!

483
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:30,307
I'm being erased.

484
00:40:56,126 --> 00:40:59,630
What about the Glassman?
They keep calling me about you.

485
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:01,673
Forget the Glassman.

486
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:05,677
Heidi told me what you said
about this curse thing.

487
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:09,014
Tells you a lot, doesn't she?
Whispers little secrets in your ear.

488
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:11,683
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Forget it.

489
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:14,187
All you need to remember
is it's not "a thing. "

490
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:17,190
It's a fact, a curse.

491
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:19,859
If you don't believe me,
ask Rossington.

492
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:24,322
Heidi told me what you said about him,
so I called Leda.

493
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:26,741
He's got skin cancer.
He's being treated.

494
00:41:26,824 --> 00:41:29,285
Skin cancer, my ass.

495
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:31,831
You are running out of time.

496
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:35,376
No shit. In two weeks, I won't be able
to go to the bathroom by myself.

497
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:38,379
- You have to go back to the clinic.
- Wrong.

498
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,048
I have to find those Gypsies.

499
00:41:44,093 --> 00:41:47,514
- Do you see what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I think he's in trouble.

500
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:52,894
He's very irrational.
If I were you...

501
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,904
Oh, Mike.

502
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:06,868
Tadzu Lempke.

503
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:10,997
Their king. Also, father of the woman
you struck with your car.

504
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,750
Father?

505
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:18,504
That's impossible.

506
00:42:18,588 --> 00:42:21,175
That woman was old: 75, 80.

507
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:23,677
Lempke is 106.

508
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,223
This is his great-granddaughter
and her husband.

509
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:30,184
106.

510
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:35,189
He claimed to be 29 when he entered
the country from Europe in 1917.

511
00:42:35,272 --> 00:42:37,524
You figure it out.

512
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:40,028
You want to talk
about where they're going?

513
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:42,864
Okay.

514
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:46,367
I tracked them to Raintree.
Then Milford.

515
00:42:46,451 --> 00:42:48,620
Then Greenough,
which I had never heard of.

516
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,872
Where do you think
they're headed now?

517
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:53,041
Headed up the Maine coast.

518
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:57,087
They're always in Bar Harbor at the end
of the season. Pick them up there.

519
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:01,467
I don't have that much time.

520
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:24,324
I have the order.
All you have to do is sign it.

521
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:28,161
To sign it?
I don't know.

522
00:43:28,245 --> 00:43:30,998
Maybe you're right.

523
00:43:31,082 --> 00:43:35,002
I know you don't want to,
but it's best for both of us.

524
00:43:35,086 --> 00:43:38,381
If we take legal action,
what will he do when he finds out?

525
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:40,007
What kind of legal action?

526
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:51,687
The kind that forces you back to the
Glassman Clinic before it's too late.

527
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,447
Okay.

528
00:44:02,531 --> 00:44:04,325
I'll go back.

529
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,828
Oh, Billy!

530
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:09,831
I am so happy.

531
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,970
Dear Heidi,
I'm going after Lempke.

532
00:44:23,053 --> 00:44:25,681
The old guy knows what I did,
but not what you did.

533
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:29,018
That frees you up to believe
the curse is in my head.

534
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:33,814
Unfortunately, that's a luxury
I no longer have. I'll work it out.

535
00:44:33,898 --> 00:44:37,693
In the meantime, if there's anything
going on between you and Dr. Mikey...

536
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,738
end it, immediately.

537
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:41,239
Billy.

538
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,751
Biff Quigley.

539
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:36,256
Call me Biff. Mind telling me
why you want to know where they went?

540
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,468
- Yes, Biff, I mind.
- Fine.

541
00:45:41,344 --> 00:45:42,679
Bill?

542
00:45:42,762 --> 00:45:44,848
A man's reasons ought to be his own.

543
00:45:44,931 --> 00:45:49,019
Good. Now, since we agree
on all that...

544
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:52,648
But it's still going to cost you $800.

545
00:45:53,649 --> 00:45:57,152
- What?
- The info is a freebie.

546
00:45:58,112 --> 00:46:00,656
The $800 is for the info...

547
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:04,786
I don't give your wife and doctor.

548
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,338
Do you take travelers' checks?

549
00:46:58,593 --> 00:47:00,053
Gotcha.

550
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:11,814
Come let the Gypsy king
guess your weight and tell your fate.

551
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,860
Don't be shy.

552
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:17,988
The old man, he knows everything.

553
00:47:19,865 --> 00:47:21,700
He can see everything.

554
00:47:21,784 --> 00:47:24,995
Don't bother
to step on the scale.

555
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,790
I can tell your weight
from right here.

556
00:47:27,873 --> 00:47:31,670
159, right?

557
00:47:31,753 --> 00:47:33,421
And next week...

558
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:36,341
gonna be 143.

559
00:47:36,424 --> 00:47:39,010
And the week after that...
Ooh!

560
00:47:39,094 --> 00:47:42,264
We don't like to think
about that, do we, mister?

561
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:50,857
Sorry, mister, but you lose.

562
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:54,694
But let's see.

563
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:01,909
No.

564
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:10,168
Ah, yes.

565
00:48:15,382 --> 00:48:18,218
You can have a prize anyway.

566
00:48:21,306 --> 00:48:23,224
Haaah!

567
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:25,768
Haaah!

568
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:44,663
Billy, get in, you idiot!

569
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:46,457
Cary?

570
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,250
Hey-ah!

571
00:48:56,718 --> 00:49:01,348
You ready, Billy? You and I
are gonna get that Gypsy bastard!

572
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:03,975
What are you doing?

573
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:07,979
I'm saving you, Billy.
Isn't that what you want?

574
00:49:21,994 --> 00:49:23,871
Hold on, partner!

575
00:49:56,781 --> 00:50:01,536
Leda, this is Billy Halleck.
Can I speak with Cary, please?

576
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:06,041
Sorry, Billy. Cary can't come
to the phone right now.

577
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:09,712
Yesterday he drove his Lincoln
into a gas truck.

578
00:50:09,795 --> 00:50:12,381
A happy ending of sorts.

579
00:50:12,464 --> 00:50:15,384
He always did want to be cremated.

580
00:50:18,637 --> 00:50:21,224
I'm sorry, Leda.

581
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,401
Excuse me.
You seen this man?

582
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,072
His name's Tadzu Lempke.

583
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,201
Taddy Lempke?

584
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,043
I knew he was around.

585
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,880
- You know Lempke?
- How could you forget him?

586
00:51:29,964 --> 00:51:33,384
Big, black cancer
in the middle of his face.

587
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:37,054
I hadn't seen him
since I worked the Ferris wheel...

588
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:40,724
ten, maybe twenty years ago.

589
00:51:40,808 --> 00:51:44,228
But it was him last night.
You know what he said to me?

590
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:48,149
"Hey, Flash.

591
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:52,320
Where that pretty
little wife of yours?

592
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:56,741
Well, don't matter.

593
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:59,911
You'll see her soon. "

594
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:05,543
Mister, my wife has been dead
for five years...

595
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:07,670
and he knew it.

596
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:18,014
Did you see which way the Gypsies went
when they left here?

597
00:52:18,097 --> 00:52:20,266
No, but I heard them.

598
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:23,395
You can't miss the sound
of those old beaters they drive.

599
00:52:23,478 --> 00:52:26,899
Out 27, then north on 1.

600
00:52:30,777 --> 00:52:34,072
Listen. Thank you.

601
00:52:35,282 --> 00:52:37,242
Thank you very much.

602
00:52:39,954 --> 00:52:42,916
Mister, be careful.

603
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:45,668
That Taddy will chew you up
and swallow you down.

604
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:52,091
Yes?

605
00:52:54,135 --> 00:52:55,262
Linda.

606
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:58,599
Daddy, where are you?
I've been so worried.

607
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:01,518
It's good to hear your voice.
When did you get home?

608
00:53:01,602 --> 00:53:04,063
Yesterday.
Mom's really upset.

609
00:53:04,146 --> 00:53:06,523
Where is she now?

610
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:08,943
She's in the kitchen
with Dr. Houston.

611
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:11,195
What's Dr. Mikey doing there?

612
00:53:11,278 --> 00:53:15,075
- He's been here a lot. Why?
- Billy, is that you?

613
00:53:16,785 --> 00:53:20,038
Sweetheart, I've been talking to Mike,
and he's been saying that...

614
00:53:20,121 --> 00:53:22,207
Bitch! Bitch!

615
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,043
This is all your fault, you bitch!

616
00:54:30,779 --> 00:54:32,990
For shame! My mama!

617
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:35,910
I say you killed my own mama!

618
00:54:35,993 --> 00:54:39,706
I say you are a demon,
and we should kill you!

619
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:44,878
Is that what I am to you?
A demon?

620
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:48,215
Look at me.

621
00:55:01,145 --> 00:55:06,484
She call you
the white man from town.

622
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,446
You got no business with us...

623
00:55:10,529 --> 00:55:13,200
and we got no business with you.

624
00:55:13,242 --> 00:55:15,994
Go away.

625
00:55:16,078 --> 00:55:17,996
I'm not through with you.

626
00:55:19,206 --> 00:55:23,877
Your daughter ran out
between two parked cars.

627
00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:25,546
I couldn't see her.

628
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:28,507
Why wasn't you watching,
white man from town?

629
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:31,052
Why wasn't you watching?

630
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:33,263
You never see us!

631
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,725
- Cha!
- Fa!

632
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:43,439
Doing this to me
won't bring your daughter back.

633
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:46,401
Duncan Hopley is dead.

634
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:48,571
So is Cary Rossington.

635
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,739
Neither of them
brought your daughter back.

636
00:55:50,823 --> 00:55:55,744
Justice ain't about bringing
back the dead, white man.

637
00:55:55,828 --> 00:55:58,330
Justice is about justice!

638
00:55:58,414 --> 00:56:01,333
Your friends,
the policeman and the judge...

639
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:04,796
make sure nothing happen to you,
they keep you safe.

640
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:08,008
But I make sure
something happen to them.

641
00:56:08,091 --> 00:56:11,803
That justice, white man.
Gypsy justice.

642
00:56:11,887 --> 00:56:16,683
You know as much about justice
as I know about turbine engines.

643
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:18,852
Now take your fucking curse
off of me!

644
00:56:24,442 --> 00:56:27,194
I never take it off.

645
00:56:27,278 --> 00:56:30,197
I die with it in me mouth.

646
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:45,172
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.

647
00:56:45,255 --> 00:56:48,467
Please.
I'm asking you nicely.

648
00:56:48,508 --> 00:56:52,137
Take it off
before this goes any further.

649
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:55,141
Get out or I make it worse.

650
00:56:55,225 --> 00:57:00,230
I make it so much worse,
you think I bless you the first time.

651
00:57:00,313 --> 00:57:01,814
Like this.

652
00:57:32,597 --> 00:57:34,683
Okay, I'll go...

653
00:57:34,766 --> 00:57:37,102
but not before I curse you...

654
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:42,107
and everybody I see
by the light of this fire!

655
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:44,734
The curse
of the white man from town!

656
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,009
That's right, laugh.

657
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:10,429
Laugh now, cry later...

658
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:13,599
when this all is at your feet!

659
00:58:13,682 --> 00:58:16,602
You want to see what
the white man from town can do...

660
00:58:16,643 --> 00:58:19,479
when he puts his mind to it?

661
00:58:20,773 --> 00:58:22,609
Don't make me start, old man!

662
00:58:22,692 --> 00:58:24,944
Don't make me start!

663
00:58:24,986 --> 00:58:27,155
Take it off while you still can!

664
00:58:33,995 --> 00:58:37,624
Get out of here!
Leave this camp, murdering bastard!

665
00:58:55,352 --> 00:58:57,312
Look at this!

666
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:04,986
The curse
of the white man from town...

667
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:08,907
is on you, pal.

668
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:13,996
They don't write about it in books,
but it is on you.

669
00:59:23,005 --> 00:59:24,840
This is Billy Halleck.

670
00:59:24,924 --> 00:59:27,635
- Can I speak to Richie Ginelli?
- Hold on.

671
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:32,724
William.
How you doing, Counselor?

672
00:59:32,808 --> 00:59:36,728
Not so good, Richie.
I need a doctor.

673
00:59:36,812 --> 00:59:40,941
I'll have someone to you by morning.
Not a doctor, but he's pretty close.

674
00:59:49,993 --> 00:59:51,911
Ball bearing, huh?

675
00:59:55,498 --> 00:59:56,916
First for me.

676
01:00:00,211 --> 01:00:03,214
This kind of pain
is a first for me.

677
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:07,219
There's a reason for that.

678
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:12,558
I've worked with cadavers
that looked better than you do.

679
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:24,070
These are mine,
but you need them more than I do.

680
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:25,572
Potassium tablets.

681
01:00:28,742 --> 01:00:31,620
Will they do anything
for the pain?

682
01:00:31,703 --> 01:00:32,746
No.

683
01:00:33,872 --> 01:00:36,374
They'll prevent you
from going into cardiac arrest.

684
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:44,884
Look, if it's a diet,
you can come off it now.

685
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:46,886
You have my permission.

686
01:00:54,185 --> 01:00:56,980
Expect a visitor tomorrow.

687
01:01:00,067 --> 01:01:02,152
Who?

688
01:01:02,236 --> 01:01:05,072
Take the Bufferin
and get some rest.

689
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:55,458
You should have called me earlier,
Billy. A lot earlier.

690
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:58,295
I didn't expect you
to come yourself.

691
01:01:58,336 --> 01:02:01,548
Hey, I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

692
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:10,850
Okay, I got it.

693
01:02:12,518 --> 01:02:13,936
Fuck.

694
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:16,272
Fuck!

695
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,380
Who was I kidding?

696
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:50,892
You ever hear of something
called "committal in absentia"?

697
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,065
Sure.

698
01:02:56,106 --> 01:03:00,903
It means somebody's committed to a
mental hospital without being examined.

699
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:04,031
It's usually invoked when some guy
goes loony and runs off.

700
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,744
Christ.

701
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:15,919
Houston couldn't have done it
without Heidi.

702
01:03:18,088 --> 01:03:19,506
Damn them.

703
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:23,218
Damn them both.

704
01:03:28,932 --> 01:03:31,435
Her and this doctor,
you don't think...

705
01:03:32,979 --> 01:03:34,981
Yeah. Sure.

706
01:03:36,315 --> 01:03:39,151
I didn't want to believe it...

707
01:03:39,235 --> 01:03:42,738
until one night I saw his car
pulling out of the driveway.

708
01:03:44,282 --> 01:03:46,785
She said he just dropped by.

709
01:03:50,247 --> 01:03:54,626
Hey, relax.
You got nothing to worry about.

710
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:58,338
By the time the order goes through,
this will either be over...

711
01:03:58,422 --> 01:04:00,716
or you'll be dead.

712
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:06,055
If you make it, you can
deal with them at your leisure.

713
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:22,406
I'm gonna get you for this, Heidi.

714
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:25,075
I swear I am.

715
01:04:42,385 --> 01:04:44,596
Richie.

716
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:48,308
You're not actually
gonna hurt anybody, are you?

717
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,768
No.

718
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:52,687
But, Billy, if I'm gonna help you...

719
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:55,608
you can't ask that question again.

720
01:05:13,293 --> 01:05:18,382
Hey, hey, hey.
What do you say, fellas?

721
01:05:18,465 --> 01:05:20,717
Do I smell like a gyp?

722
01:05:23,971 --> 01:05:27,057
Who wants a little strychnine?

723
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,310
Here you go.
Here you go.

724
01:06:16,109 --> 01:06:19,654
Hey, kid, wake up.
It's a visit from the money fairy.

725
01:06:24,285 --> 01:06:25,745
What's your name?

726
01:06:25,786 --> 01:06:28,539
Spurton. Frank Spurton.

727
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:33,544
Okay, Frank Spurton.
Check it out.

728
01:06:48,977 --> 01:06:52,439
I don't do nothing
that goes on video.

729
01:06:52,522 --> 01:06:55,109
That's a good plan, Stan.

730
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:59,781
Listen. There's some Gypsies
camped out up the road.

731
01:06:59,822 --> 01:07:02,700
They light, you call me.

732
01:07:07,455 --> 01:07:10,458
Who do I ask for
in case someone else answers?

733
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:14,088
Don't worry.
I'll answer.

734
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:42,158
- You like this, don't you?
- Like it? Are you kidding?

735
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,494
I fuckin' love it!

736
01:07:50,668 --> 01:07:54,672
- Yeah.
- They're at a small farm off Route 92.

737
01:07:54,755 --> 01:07:56,674
I think they made me.

738
01:07:56,716 --> 01:08:00,428
If I were you, friend,
I'd get out of there as soon as I could.

739
01:08:00,511 --> 01:08:02,179
And lose my number.

740
01:08:29,584 --> 01:08:31,002
Thanks.

741
01:08:36,633 --> 01:08:38,218
Well, well, well.

742
01:08:52,358 --> 01:08:53,776
Hey, Billy.

743
01:09:21,347 --> 01:09:24,725
I think it's time
for us to move on.

744
01:09:31,316 --> 01:09:35,737
- This is getting out of hand.
- Wrong.

745
01:09:35,821 --> 01:09:37,906
This has been out of hand...

746
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:40,158
ever since that old gyp
touched you.

747
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:44,371
I'm just the guy
to put it back "in hand. "

748
01:09:44,454 --> 01:09:47,375
I gotta show them
they can't get away with that stuff...

749
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,919
they pulled on that kid.

750
01:09:50,003 --> 01:09:53,923
He was a mook,
but he was my mook.

751
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:55,925
Richie the Hammer.

752
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,845
Please don't.

753
01:11:17,136 --> 01:11:18,763
There! Over there!

754
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:33,112
No!

755
01:11:36,407 --> 01:11:38,325
Nooo!

756
01:11:41,662 --> 01:11:43,080
No!

757
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:45,833
Gabe!

758
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,422
No, Gabe!

759
01:11:51,339 --> 01:11:53,633
No!

760
01:12:15,489 --> 01:12:18,618
- Yes?
- F. B. I.

761
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:23,624
Special Agent Stoner.
I have a few questions, Mrs. Grimani.

762
01:12:23,707 --> 01:12:26,043
Can you identify...

763
01:12:27,502 --> 01:12:30,922
That pig killed my old mama!

764
01:12:31,673 --> 01:12:34,801
- He killed my husband.
- Mr. William Halleck?

765
01:12:34,843 --> 01:12:37,387
Was it him
at this camp last night?

766
01:12:37,472 --> 01:12:42,310
No, but we believe he hired someone
to make the attack.

767
01:12:42,352 --> 01:12:44,312
We have him in custody.

768
01:12:44,354 --> 01:12:48,650
Would you mind accompanying me
to identify him personally?

769
01:13:02,998 --> 01:13:04,917
My God.

770
01:13:05,834 --> 01:13:07,252
Not again.

771
01:13:10,923 --> 01:13:12,884
He's waiting in the car.

772
01:13:19,724 --> 01:13:21,685
There is no car here.

773
01:13:21,726 --> 01:13:25,271
I almost forgot.

774
01:13:25,355 --> 01:13:29,277
I have a photo of the man we suspect
attacked your camp.

775
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,403
It was you!

776
01:13:37,868 --> 01:13:39,370
Acid, bitch.

777
01:13:48,338 --> 01:13:50,757
You scream again,
and I'll kill you.

778
01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:56,305
You just got a face full
of soda pop and baking soda.

779
01:14:05,106 --> 01:14:06,607
Billy, get out!

780
01:14:11,362 --> 01:14:13,781
Richie, no!

781
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:19,370
This time you live
because my friend asks.

782
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:22,750
Next time,
you're one dead little whore.

783
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,253
Fuck you.
And fuck him!

784
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,967
Now...

785
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:37,807
here's the real deal.

786
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:48,151
Now here's what I want you to do.

787
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:54,449
Unless you want
to wear a Gypsy scarf...

788
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:57,703
over your face
for the rest of your life...

789
01:14:59,288 --> 01:15:04,961
hold very still!

790
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,386
Tell the old gyp to meet me
at the lighthouse in two hours.

791
01:15:45,586 --> 01:15:49,675
Your friend is a pig!
He will die thin!

792
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:53,679
But you will die first,
you bastard!

793
01:16:08,194 --> 01:16:12,365
He'll meet you there in about an hour,
over by that bench.

794
01:16:14,326 --> 01:16:15,660
Thanks, Richie.

795
01:16:19,247 --> 01:16:23,586
You want to thank me?
Get that old bastard.

796
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:03,836
Wake up.

797
01:17:05,296 --> 01:17:06,589
Wake up.

798
01:17:12,513 --> 01:17:17,184
Your dreams smell bad to me.
They stink.

799
01:17:17,267 --> 01:17:20,729
Maybe you think
you're still dreaming, huh?

800
01:17:27,152 --> 01:17:32,450
Does this look like dream to you,
white man from town?

801
01:17:32,492 --> 01:17:36,413
You kill my daughter,
and you get off.

802
01:17:36,496 --> 01:17:40,125
For that you deserve to die,
so I curse you!

803
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:44,963
But now, I got to do this
so your crazy friend...

804
01:17:45,005 --> 01:17:47,842
don't hurt my Galina.

805
01:17:47,883 --> 01:17:52,638
Already he kill her husband.
You want your little girl hurt?

806
01:17:53,681 --> 01:17:57,018
I didn't want any of this.

807
01:17:57,101 --> 01:17:59,437
You want to get rid of the curse?

808
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,565
First, you've got to give it...

809
01:18:02,648 --> 01:18:04,860
to this pie.

810
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:15,746
Then you give this pie...

811
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:23,588
With the curse inside,
to somebody else.

812
01:18:39,271 --> 01:18:40,397
Okay.

813
01:18:42,983 --> 01:18:46,445
You gain weight quick now.

814
01:18:46,528 --> 01:18:50,866
So quick, you don't know
what's going on.

815
01:18:50,908 --> 01:18:54,078
But somebody...

816
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:57,624
got to eat this pie soon.

817
01:18:57,707 --> 01:19:01,962
Everyone who eat pie
die quick and bad.

818
01:19:02,629 --> 01:19:05,465
You got somebody?

819
01:19:05,548 --> 01:19:07,509
Yes.

820
01:19:07,592 --> 01:19:11,471
Yeah, you got somebody.

821
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:31,118
But why you don't do right?
Eat your own pie.

822
01:19:31,159 --> 01:19:34,287
You die thin,
but you die clean.

823
01:19:36,164 --> 01:19:38,333
Get away from me.

824
01:19:38,417 --> 01:19:40,877
Our business is done.

825
01:19:50,972 --> 01:19:55,184
Die clean, white man from town.

826
01:19:55,268 --> 01:19:57,270
Die clean.

827
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:14,038
- Daddy, are you okay?
- I'm still thin, but I'll be fine.

828
01:20:14,121 --> 01:20:17,333
Listen.
Daddy's coming home tonight...

829
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:19,335
but I want it to be a surprise, okay?

830
01:20:19,376 --> 01:20:21,171
Yeah. Sure.

831
01:20:21,254 --> 01:20:24,382
- I want you to stay at Georgia's.
- Daddy, no!

832
01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:26,760
Yes.

833
01:20:26,843 --> 01:20:28,303
There are some things...

834
01:20:28,386 --> 01:20:31,848
I need to talk
to your mother about.

835
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,516
Promise you'll stay at Georgia's.

836
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,644
- All right.
- Thanks, honey.

837
01:20:35,685 --> 01:20:37,563
Let me talk with your mother.

838
01:20:39,607 --> 01:20:41,484
Billy, is that you?

839
01:20:43,277 --> 01:20:46,322
There are some things I have to do
before I come home.

840
01:20:46,405 --> 01:20:48,407
I'll see you
in a couple of days.

841
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,253
Wake up...

842
01:21:39,336 --> 01:21:43,716
white woman from town.

843
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:45,969
Oh, Billy.

844
01:21:46,052 --> 01:21:47,387
Oh, Billy! Oh!

845
01:21:47,429 --> 01:21:50,724
Whoa. At least wait
until I get up to 140.

846
01:21:50,765 --> 01:21:53,310
I didn't expect you home
until the end of the week.

847
01:21:53,393 --> 01:21:56,479
I couldn't wait to see you.
I even brought you a present.

848
01:21:57,605 --> 01:21:59,607
It's on the kitchen counter.

849
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:04,113
I know why you came home early.
I know what you've been thinking.

850
01:22:04,196 --> 01:22:08,909
I swear there's never been anything
between Mike Houston and me.

851
01:22:08,951 --> 01:22:12,538
We can talk about it
in the morning.

852
01:22:12,621 --> 01:22:16,542
I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'm exhausted.

853
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:19,545
All right.

854
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:24,426
- I'm going with you.
- No, no.

855
01:22:24,468 --> 01:22:26,511
It's early.

856
01:22:26,595 --> 01:22:30,057
Why don't you check out
what I brought you?

857
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,809
You're gonna like it.

858
01:22:32,893 --> 01:22:35,604
You sound like
your old silly self.

859
01:22:35,646 --> 01:22:38,149
I'm starting to feel
like my old silly self again.

860
01:22:38,232 --> 01:22:40,151
- Take a look.
- It's in there?

861
01:22:40,234 --> 01:22:41,653
Go. Go.

862
01:22:50,995 --> 01:22:52,914
Is it strawberry?

863
01:22:52,997 --> 01:22:54,458
Uh-huh.

864
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,461
Oh, Billy,
that's my favorite.

865
01:22:58,671 --> 01:23:00,130
I know.

866
01:23:05,177 --> 01:23:10,641
Getting even is also
what it's all about, you bitch.

867
01:23:28,911 --> 01:23:30,204
Heidi?

868
01:23:32,999 --> 01:23:35,001
Heidi.

869
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:37,628
You awake?

870
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,471
Did you try it?

871
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,814
Yep. You tried it.

872
01:24:17,337 --> 01:24:19,589
Strawberry pie.

873
01:24:19,672 --> 01:24:21,717
Mmm.

874
01:24:27,348 --> 01:24:31,727
I wouldn't want to eat too much
of it myself, though.

875
01:24:31,769 --> 01:24:33,812
It's diet food.

876
01:24:47,661 --> 01:24:49,245
Look at you.

877
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:54,335
Size six again.
Maybe even a size four.

878
01:25:39,716 --> 01:25:41,384
Daddy!

879
01:25:43,052 --> 01:25:47,349
You look so thin,
but I'm glad to see you anyway.

880
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:51,729
I'm sorry I didn't stay
at Georgia's...

881
01:25:51,812 --> 01:25:55,190
but I needed to talk to Mom
before I saw you.

882
01:25:55,274 --> 01:25:57,276
Things haven't been great
between us...

883
01:25:57,359 --> 01:25:59,320
because of what
you've been going through.

884
01:25:59,403 --> 01:26:01,322
So I came back
after you went to sleep.

885
01:26:01,363 --> 01:26:03,491
We worked things out.

886
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:06,661
And I just had a piece of your pie
for breakfast.

887
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:09,331
- You had...
- Yes, Dad. It was delicious.

888
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:12,876
And things are cool
between Mom and I.

889
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:16,171
I have to play soccer with Lisa,
but I'll catch you later.

890
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:22,386
Bye. Love you.

891
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:28,476
My God, what have I done?

892
01:26:58,424 --> 01:27:01,594
Billy, you're home.

893
01:27:01,678 --> 01:27:03,638
Dr. Mikey.

894
01:27:03,721 --> 01:27:06,432
Early for a house call, isn't it?

895
01:27:08,935 --> 01:27:10,895
It's not what you think.

896
01:27:12,564 --> 01:27:15,442
Heidi was upset.

897
01:27:15,526 --> 01:27:17,945
I just stopped by
to see how she was doing.

898
01:27:17,986 --> 01:27:22,574
Don't sweat it. I might have done
the same thing in your shoes.

899
01:27:22,616 --> 01:27:25,661
After all,
I was acting like a jerk.

900
01:27:25,744 --> 01:27:30,458
But I'm fine now.
Even put a little weight back on.

901
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:33,670
I was just digging into a slice
of this breakfast pie.

902
01:27:33,753 --> 01:27:36,965
- Care to join me?
- I really shouldn't.

903
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:41,469
Come on, Mike.
I've settled everything with Heidi.

904
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:45,348
Now it's your turn.
The pie's delicious.

905
01:27:45,432 --> 01:27:47,351
You sure I'm not intruding?

906
01:27:47,435 --> 01:27:48,978
Positive...

907
01:27:54,108 --> 01:27:56,485
white doctor from town.
