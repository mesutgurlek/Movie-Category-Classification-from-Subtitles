2
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,903
I was put here to kill.

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,985
You were too,
whether you know it or not.

4
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,526
We kill because it solves problems,

5
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,991
because after all the options
have been exhausted

6
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,780
and everything else fails,

7
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,949
we have one way to solve problems.

8
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,665
And that's why we're here.

9
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,374
That's not why I'm here.

10
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:23,293
I'm here to protect our troops,
to protect our interests.

11
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,008
I was put here to help create
a democracy, to enforce justice.

12
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,469
Yeah? And how do you do that?

13
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,680
You do that with this, this right here.

14
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,848
After everything else fails,
it all comes down to this, baby.

15
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,358
This is justice. Power is justice.

16
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,645
Killing solves problems,
that seems like the solution.

17
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,358
It's called right and wrong.

18
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,865
Does not compute.

19
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,868
Where does right and wrong
factor in to this place?

20
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:54,077
You tell me - what difference
does right and wrong make here?

21
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,788
Shit, man, right and wrong
only matters where it has impact.

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,544
There's always a right and wrong,
as long as you have the choice.

23
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,081
You ain't got no choice here.
Only choice is living or dying...

24
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,547
Going through life without a choice
is like driving without the headlights on.

25
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,467
Hey, hey, hey, quit fucking around, man.

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,928
What's the point of seeing
when you can't steer anyway?

27
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,808
Fuck you, turn the lights on.

28
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,344
Fuck you.
Fuck you!

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,854
Turn the fucking lights on.
You don't know what's out there.

30
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,029
No, no, no, no, no, you don't stop.
You do not stop!

31
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,565
I just hit a fucking kid.

32
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,608
You don't stop for anything at night.

33
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,698
What the fuck was that?
It was a fucking kid.

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,237
What's a kid doing in the desert?

35
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,576
I don't give a fuck
if you just hit your grandmother.

36
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,333
You do not sidestep protocol.
You do not stop for anything at night!

37
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,290
What if he's still alive?
Bailey's right.

38
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,046
You're not supposed to stop,
it's the rules. It could be an ambush.

39
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,879
You put this piece of shit in gear and go.
That's an order!

40
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,386
Fuck you. I'm doing the right thing.

41
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,014
Kill those goddamn floods.
Kill those goddamn floods!

42
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,673
Kill those fucking lights.
Kill those fucking lights right now!

43
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,260
That's just who he was.

44
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,050
He pulled four people out of there
and then tried to put the pin back in.

45
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,514
He tried to
put the pin back in?

46
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,223
I didn't know you could do that.

47
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,763
Apparently you can.

48
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,524
Did you know
he was working on an opera?

49
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,769
Barthenoy's many friends,

50
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,904
some of whom
have gathered here today,

51
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,738
suggested that he was a man
who loved his country

52
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,245
and gave his life
protecting not only our freedoms,

53
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,156
but the lives of his fellow soldiers...

54
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,577
In essence, doing God's work.

55
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:31,214
Barthenoy was not only thoughtful,

56
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:36,379
a responsible and a loving man,
but a hero.

57
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,674
He is an example for us all.

58
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,347
But although he is a hero,

59
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:51,314
Barthenoy had not yet clarified
his spirituality

60
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,229
and his relationship with Jesus.

61
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,533
Well, Jesus said, “I am the way,
the truth and the life.

62
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,367
“No man cometh unto the father
but by me, ”

63
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,327
John 1436.

64
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:09,370
Had Barthenoy the opportunity
to look into the future

65
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,460
and predict his own untimely passing,

66
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:18,095
a passing which, because of his youth,
is perhaps more tragic than most,

67
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:22,383
one wonders if this burden
would have been left unnnished.

68
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:27,680
And so now is the time for us
to look into our own lives

69
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,439
and ask the question,

70
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,068
have we embraced the path
of the righteous?

71
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,072
And if not, how long should we wait?

72
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,028
Until we are sick?

73
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,160
Until we are facing death ourselves?

74
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,540
Or until we stand before God in heaven
asking for atonement?

75
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,918
For none of us,
except lord Jesus Christ,

76
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,125
none of God's children
can see their futures

77
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,916
and none can live forever here on earth.

78
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,661
Man. Dxd you check the gas?

79
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,492
Check the gas?

80
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,033
That gauge don't work.
You gotta use the stick.

81
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,452
Gas is all out.

82
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,289
Here's to Bart.

83
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,002
To ban.
To Bart.

84
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,848
Is it just me, or was that priest guy...

85
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,383
Minister.

86
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,143
..Was that minister saying
that Bart was going to hell?

87
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,431
Joey!
I'm not saying that he is.

88
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:57,694
I'm just...I'm just saying
that the minister,

89
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,650
his whole gig was that, you know,

90
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,613
“unless you accept lord Jesus Christ
as your only saviour,

91
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,152
“you're not going to heaven.”.

92
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,413
Whatever. Heaven's just
a Christian recruiting tactic.

93
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,826
Wiccas believe that after death

94
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,963
one's spirit leaves one's body

95
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,671
and transcends time and space

96
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:25,636
and becomes part of a greater divinity
of nature, mother earth.

97
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,516
Now, does that just work for witches?

98
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,269
Or can mere mortals get in too?

99
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,977
It works for everyone, even assholes.

100
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,312
Perfect. I'm an asshole!

101
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,981
Do you think he joined the military
to get away from me?

102
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,149
What?
No, honey,

103
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,990
I mean, seriously, do you think
he was trying to get out of marrying me?

104
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,530
No.
No.

105
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,073
No, I do not.

106
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,619
In fact, I think he was building up
his courage to ask you.

107
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,162
Really?

108
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,626
Really, I do.

109
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:05,762
He even had me looking at rings for him
so that he'd be ready to ask you.

110
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,636
Youre an asshole

111
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,080
I'm sorry. I'm just...

112
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,620
Don't, don't apologise.

113
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:42,291
Like, this is...None of this seems real.

114
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,551
How do you do it?

115
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,431
How do you stay so strong?
You seem so strong.

116
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,718
My inner strength is, um,

117
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:57,435
a manifestation of my rigorous regimen
of heavy sedation.

118
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,440
What...
Pills.

119
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,567
Lot of pills.

120
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,855
Vicodin. Valium. All the 'v's.

121
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,743
I actually cycle them with beer
or this little fella right here,

122
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,278
Vicodin.
Yeah?

123
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,912
Can I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:17,326
Um, I can get you more
and whatever you need.

125
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,369
Thanks.
Ok?

126
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:26,176
Oh, fuck. I just don't know
if I can make it.

127
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,678
He was in all of my plans.

128
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:33,138
We were gonna get a place
together...Eventually.

129
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,802
When he was ready.

130
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,346
I know.

131
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,106
And there was so much
I wanted to say to him.

132
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,644
God, if I could just have...

133
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:49,441
“Just one more day with
him, just one more.

134
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,861
It's gonna get easier.
It's gonna get better.

135
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,122
Ok? Just give it some time.

136
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,375
I know, I know, I know.

137
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,542
I know it will, and I'll meet someone else.

138
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,260
He did, he did love you, ok?

139
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,170
It won't be him.

140
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,263
You know he never told me
he loved me?

141
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,809
He never said it.
I told him, but he never said it to me.

142
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,228
He did love you, he does, he did.

143
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,862
He did love you.

144
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,615
He did, he did love you, ok?

145
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,401
Ok? Yeah?

146
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,866
Thank you.

147
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,449
Oh.

148
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,776
No. Oh, God.

149
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,287
We can't do this.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

150
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,743
I don't want to make things worse.

151
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,537
How can it get any worse?

152
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,955
What the fuck?

153
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,148
Oh!

154
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,546
The sick...
You're fucking kidding me.

155
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,889
Fucking shit.

156
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,727
This is...This is a dream.

157
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,858
This is a dream.

158
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,896
It's all just, ..All a nightmare.

159
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,190
Just., .Wake up.

160
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,905
Wake up- fucking. . -Fucking ..

161
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,581
Fuck!

162
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,586
Ok, just ride this shit out,
ride this shit out.

163
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,088
This is...This is...

164
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,296
This isn't real. This isn't real!

165
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,009
Fuck! Fuck!

166
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,719
Fuck.

167
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,284
- Come on.
- Come on, please, wake up.

168
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,448
Please wake up.

169
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,536
Joey.

170
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,875
Please wake up.

171
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,047
Joey, Joey.

172
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,060
Who is it?
It's me, man.

173
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,687
Who's 'me'?
It's me, Bart.

174
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,347
Let me in, please.

175
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,266
Hilarious. Who is it?

176
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:42,778
It's me, your friend, Bart.
Please let me in the door.

177
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,314
Fuck off, douche-bag.

178
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,780
It's fucking early in the morning
and this shit is not fucking funny.

179
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,415
Jesus, fuck! What the fuck?
Who is that?

180
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,623
Ok, it's me.
I swear to God it's your friend.

181
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,460
What the fuck? What the fuck?

182
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,215
Who is that?
It's Bart,

183
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,968
please, open up, man.

184
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,425
Fuck! Bart?

185
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,431
It's me. It's Bart.

186
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,308
Fuck!

187
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,434
Get the fuck out of here!
Owl.

188
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,267
Get out of here, dude!
Fuck!

189
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,931
Get out of here!
Jesus.

190
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,441
What the fuck did you do that for?

191
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,570
What the fuck is going on, dude?

192
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,358
I don't fucking know, man.

193
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,026
I don't know.

194
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,160
You're supposed to be dead.

195
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,073
So I gather.

196
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,333
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you, ok?

197
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,375
I just need your help.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

198
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,553
Oh, God, this is just a dream,
this is just a fucking dream

199
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,089
and I gotta fucking wake up.

200
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,008
Wake up. Wake up, wake up right now.
Wake up.

201
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,270
I tried that. It doesn't work.

202
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,056
So it's not a dream.
So I'm fucking insane.

203
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,895
That's it. I'm fucking...
I lost my mind.

204
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,186
Maybe we're insane communally,
together.

205
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,901
And if I'm insane, that means
you're not fucking here.

206
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,440
But if you're insane...

207
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,325
Fuck, you can't be fucking insane,
'cause you're fucking dead.

208
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,078
Oh, God, fuck. How do you know
I'm not just fucking imagining you?

209
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,659
I don't know the test for that, man.

210
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,167
Let's just pretend that you're not insane,

211
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,957
I'm actually alive and we're having
this fucking conversation, ok?

212
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,124
That'd be more productive right now.

213
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,589
Fuck, I feel like shit.
Yeah, but you look terrific...

214
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,926
Oh, fuck! Look at your fucking eyes!

215
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,466
Shit!

216
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,135
Fuck, yeah, it's fucked up.
Look at them.

217
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,601
Jesus! Fuck, that is not fucking cool!

218
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,188
Nasty. Oh, fucking shit, you smell!

219
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,978
Fuck, you got a fucking reek on you.
God!

220
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,694
You're really making me feel a whole lot
better about this whole situation.

221
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,030
You're fucking decomposing.
Jesus Christ, you're fucking rotting.

222
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,786
Dude.

223
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,824
This is not fucking happening, dude.
This is not fucking happening.

224
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,038
I was at your funeral, man.

225
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,172
About that - that was a mistake.

226
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,877
I think I was buried alive.
No, dude.

227
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,417
Yeah.
I fucking touched you, dude.

228
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,551
You were fucking dead.
It was fucking cold.

229
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,088
It was nasty...

230
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,552
Fucking neighbours. Really?
Nothing changes.

231
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,308
They're still doing that?
Yeah, still.

232
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,968
- Fuck.
- Turn that thing down!

233
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,763
My funeral, my fucking funeral.

234
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,306
Really? Yeah.

235
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,270
How's Janet?
She's fine.

236
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,687
She's fine. I mean terrible.
Terrible, devastated.

237
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,230
You know, destroyed.

238
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,694
Um, and, you know,
she's just trying to deal.

239
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,610
We all are. You know, we were nervous
when you went over there.

240
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,199
We just wanted you to come back safe
and, you know, that..

241
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,955
Your Uncle Dave called
and was real nice.

242
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,118
He told me, and then I had to
call and tell Janet,

243
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,786
and she was just...

244
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,377
But...But you're fucking here.
Fucking Jesus Christ!

245
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,213
It's a fucking miracle, right?

246
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,377
Jesus...
What's wrong? What's wrong?

247
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,966
Everything- yeah?

248
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:59,760
I think it's my fucking liver, 'cause
I don't know anything about livers...

249
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,552
We gotta fucking get you
to hospital, dude.

250
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,096
Fucking... you are awful.
No.

251
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,606
We gotta fucking end a doctor,
end out what's wrong with you.

252
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,358
No doctors. It's just my stomach.
Your stomach?

253
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,359
'Cause you fucking haven't eaten
in three weeks.

254
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,895
I'm gonna go get you a snack.

255
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,984
You want a fucking snack,
you got a snack, huh?

256
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,821
I got pizza. It's cold, but, um,
you know, it's cold pizza.

257
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,987
I can nuke it, 'cause it tastes beher
if I throw it in the nuker.

258
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,030
No, just bring if.
Ok...

259
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,039
You found the medicine cabinet.
Yeah.

260
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,334
Ok.

261
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,674
Anchovies?
Yeah.

262
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,761
Since when? Just...
That's disappointing.

263
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,559
Oh! Fucking... dude, that's my rug.

264
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,115
Woman on p.A.;
Dr forrest, dial 114, please.

265
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,956
Dr forrest, please dial 114.

266
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,042
Buried alive?
Yeah.

267
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,378
I was definitely, um...

268
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,794
I was definitely buried...

269
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,463
Um...It's the 'alive' part.

270
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,303
I thought I was dead.
Everybody thought..

271
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,842
You were dead.

272
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,181
Here, check this out.

273
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,977
Do you have any stds?
Syphilis, hepatitis, anything?

274
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,066
I was killed to death in a gunfight.

275
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,575
Can you lean forward for me, please?

276
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,946
And just look straight ahead.

277
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,580
I'm kind of decomposing.

278
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,467
Can you take your shirt off for me,
please?

279
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,344
I need you to cough and...
Sure.

280
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,763
Military issue.

281
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,704
What's the problem?
No, no, I can't explain!

282
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,164
What's going on? What's going on?
Get down here!

283
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,874
What is it? What's going on?

284
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:36,041
Is it Bart? Barthenoy Gregory?

285
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,013
Dude, cops. We gotta...

286
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,139
We gotta go, there's cops.

287
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,563
I think that this is maybe more
than just a bug.

288
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,527
Fuck.

289
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,612
What now, man?

290
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,698
I know what I need to do.

291
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,237
Smoke some dope.

292
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,658
Ok, uh, so you take the couch.
The couch is all yours.

293
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:15,876
Um, yeah, and, you know, I think we just
gotta put a positive spin on this...

294
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,882
You know what I mean?
Put it into a positive light...

295
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,668
You know, in Korea,
the word for 'problem',

296
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,586
same word, 'opportunityi.

297
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,097
So, really, we don't have a problem here.

298
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,757
We have an opportunity.

299
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,222
A gargantuan, fucked-up opportunity.

300
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,103
We'll figure this all out tomorrow,
buttercup.

301
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,638
Jesus!
Shit.

302
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,352
Oh, Jesus!
Bart?

303
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,483
Christ..

304
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,397
Argh!
Oh, fuck, Bart.

305
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:45,443
Fuck! Fuck, bad

306
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,537
Fuck! Bart! What the fuck, dude?

307
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,494
Ban?

308
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,159
Barf? Oh. Jesus.

309
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,171
What the fuck is happening?

310
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:04,133
Jesus. I just don't believe it.
I know, right?

311
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,137
And what did the doctor say?

312
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,549
We didn't really get
a reasonable diagnosis,

313
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,970
God, it's unbelievable.

314
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,230
Promise you're not gonna
tell anybody, right?

315
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,436
No. I mean, yes, I swear.

316
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,692
Not anybody - not Janet, not his Mom,

317
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,855
not until we igure out, you know,
what's going on.

318
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,819
So he's not breathing, right? I mean...

319
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,860
Oh, God.
I couldn't end a pulse.

320
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,074
This is disgusting, yeah.

321
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,080
Like, he smells dead, at least.

322
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,954
So, why don't you want to tell Janet?

323
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,124
I don't want to tell nobody nothing,
not till we igure out what the fuck.

324
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,883
So what's the prognosis?

325
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,171
Well. His aura looks like shit.

326
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,965
Oh, his aura looks like...

327
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,303
Is he dead?
Yeah, he's dead.

328
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,348
Dead dead?
Doornail dead.

329
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,890
What the fuck?

330
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,434
He was walking around,
puking up blood,

331
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,944
being a general pain in the ass
not four fucking hours ago.

332
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,854
And then he just arrested?
Arrested?

333
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,568
Died.
Oh.

334
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,736
Maybe, like, his vital signs are so low
he just appears to be dead,

335
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,951
he's been embalmed, Joey.

336
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,332
So...What do we do?

337
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,053
Chop off his head.
What?!

338
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,971
You have to chop off his head
and drive a stake through his heart.

339
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,934
Why would I do that?

340
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,442
Because he's undead.

341
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,898
Undead?

342
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,438
He's a vampire.

343
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,231
A vampire!

344
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:51,152
Yes, Joey, a vampire,
a creature of the night.

345
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:56,074
And tonight he'll probably
come back again from death.

346
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,789
A vampire? You're a fucking idiot.
What's wrong with you?

347
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,999
Joey, I'm serious.
Yeah, I'm serious, Matty.

348
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,708
You're a fucking retard, ok?

349
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,592
There's a science explanation
for what's happening here.

350
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,923
Ok, like what?
Like he's sick.

351
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,714
He has a virus. Gulf war syndrome.

352
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,928
Joey, I'm a nurse.
He died over a month ago.

353
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,719
We buried him two days ago,
what does this look like to you?

354
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,728
Ok. Alright.

355
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,107
Vampires have fangs, right?

356
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,018
Look, huh?

357
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,652
Eugh, gross.

358
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,279
No fangs.

359
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,030
Maybe they take some time to grow in.

360
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,783
Yeah, maybe your theory is shit
'cause he died, like, a month ago,

361
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,161
ok, so what's he doing on your floor?
I don't know.

362
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,696
That's what I called you for.

363
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,412
You have to chop off his head.
Ok, or else?

364
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,168
Or else, Joey, he'll roam the countryside

365
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,297
in search of victims to satiate
his thirst for human blood.

366
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,173
This is ludicrous, ok?

367
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,505
He's not a vampire. He's a dead guy.

368
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,512
I'm gonna take him to the mortuary
and let the morticians deal with him.

369
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,423
Alright, do what you want.
It's not my problem.

370
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,968
But if they don't chop off his head,
he will be back.

371
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,228
Oh, my God, where I live,
on planet earth,

372
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,763
there's no such thing as vampires.

373
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,306
You know, believe what you want,

374
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,942
but when he rises again and starts
taking the lives of the innocent,

375
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,230
the blood will be on your hands.

376
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,740
It's up to you, Joey.
He will need to drink human blood.

377
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,867
If he doesn't, his soul will be
in eternal agony.

378
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,200
If you're really his friend, you'll put
his soul to rest and chop off his head,

379
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,865
mathilda, not a word to anyone.
Promise me!

380
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,330
I promise, I do. Kisses.

381
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,299
<crunchin@>

382
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,455
Holy shit, dude.
You scared the piss out of me.

383
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,116
Fuck. Why am I so stiff?

384
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,376
I usually say that in the morning too.

385
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,583
Was I asleep?
You were dead.

386
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,962
Hey, your hanging-over favourite, huh?

387
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:15,095
Eggs, smoked oysters
and spam with molé.

388
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,928
Just the way you like it.

389
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,094
No? What? It's your favourite.

390
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,604
Yeah. I don't have much of an appetite.

391
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,140
L_..I'm in the kitchen,
I make it special for you

392
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,024
and now, what, I don't have feelings?

393
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,820
Dig in.

394
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,534
Mmm! Atlaboy_.

395
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,374
Good, right? Nice.

396
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,504
Oh, my God!

397
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,140
That is so wrong.

398
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,308
Fuck.

399
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,818
Ok, you gotta help me.

400
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,199
Alright. Ok, this is good.

401
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,992
This is good, mmm.

402
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,426
Dr kaple, dr kaple.

403
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:48,439
This is ward 819.
Dr k apfe, calf the operator,

404
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,303
May I help you?

405
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,856
Um, I'm just here for some blood.

406
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,893
You're not a nurse.
That's true.

407
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,732
It's true, but, um., .
But what?

408
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,398
I don't have all day.
No nurse, no blood.

409
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,817
Right, um...
You got a security pass?

410
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,112
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

411
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,244
Got a security pass.

412
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,331
Ok, ok, I don't want to hurt you, ma'am.

413
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,918
I just want some blood.
Oh, here we go.

414
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,166
Ok. What type?

415
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,382
What?
What blood type?

416
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,298
L...L don't know. It doesn't matter.
Just hurry up, please,

417
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,513
what are you using it for?
Hey, that's none of your business.

418
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,644
I'm a nurse. Of course it's my business.

419
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,771
I can't indiscriminately dole out
pints of blood

420
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,399
to every strung-out buffoon
who wanders in off the street.

421
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,655
Someone could get the wrong type
and blam, that's it.

422
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,408
So, what blood type?

423
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:27,037
No, just_..Just give me
some fucking blood, lady, ok?

424
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,573
And hurry up,
or I'll give you a bullet sandwich.

425
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,084
Good. Good.

426
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,211
Thank you.

427
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,467
We get your type in here
from time to time - weirdos,

428
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:46,883
jumping from one fly-by-night
hobbyist cult to another,

429
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:53,351
you know, the gothic cult,
the witch coven, landmark forum.

430
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:58,019
You are searching for something,
for fulfillment.

431
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,064
Or maybemmaybe you're a cutter.

432
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,776
Maybe you're a junkie.

433
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,739
But have you asked yourself
if any of this is working?

434
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:11,328
If any of this is making your life better?

435
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,834
When was the last time
you had a stress test?

436
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,665
I don't know what that is.

437
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,455
I can give you a very simple test

438
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,546
to find out exactly where
your engrams are at.

439
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,461
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please put the blood in the bag.

440
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,596
Have you heard of dianetics?
No.

441
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,224
You know, you don't have to do this,
you know.

442
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,727
Scientology can help you ind
your place in life.

443
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,263
Thank you for your help.
Your purpose.

444
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,181
You're very helpful.
You don't have to...

445
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,352
Shit.

446
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,524
Why, you poser! Give me that back,
you rat bastard!

447
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,236
Please.

448
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,952
Give it back! Security!

449
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,663
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

450
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,123
- What's wrong with your eyes?
- Oh, my God!

451
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,914
You stay right there!
Whats wrong with you?

452
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,925
You'll be full of lead, both of you.

453
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,634
Thank you.

454
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,395
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Here we go!

455
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,777
Drive. Drive, come on.

456
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,484
Holy shit, holy shit.

457
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,740
How'd you do, huh?
Oh, I fucking did good.

458
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,151
Yeah?
I did good. Yeah.

459
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,160
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

460
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,741
Oh, fuck.

461
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,703
Where's the fucking... oh, fuck.

462
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,833
Drink up, baby.
Ah.

463
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,621
Drink it up. There you go.

464
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,131
Look at ya. Look at ya!

465
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,045
Drinking fucking blood,
this is fucking surreal.

466
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,383
Whoa.
This is real surreal. You feel good?

467
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,769
Oh!
Whoa! Whoa! Not nice.

468
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,527
Yeah, girl. Working girl, right?
Yeah, yeah.

469
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,027
We should do this more.

470
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,491
You know, we didn't do this enough
when you were alive.

471
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,500
I feel like I've fucking...

472
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,753
I feel like I've been
given a second chance.

473
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,790
You have been.
Nobody gets a second chance, nobody.

474
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:09,710
No... I-I got a second chance
and I'm gonna fucking use it.

475
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,800
I'm gonna do it the way
I shoulda done it the first time.

476
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,884
There you go.

477
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,424
And no mistakes.
No mistakes.

478
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,058
No regrets.
No surrender.

479
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,470
Because I'm fucking alive, my man.
God bless you.

480
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,185
Fuck.

481
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,726
God. God.

482
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,818
Oh, hi, Joey. How are you?

483
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,402
Hey, mrs agmanic.

484
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,192
Ah.

485
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,361
Is that Bart?
It's Bart.

486
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,156
He's.., he's...
Yeah, he's real sleepy.

487
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,949
He's been doing...
He's drinking, so...

488
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,163
Is he drunk?
Yeah.

489
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,793
Burning the candle at both ends.

490
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,546
I can help if you...
No, no, I'm ok, mrs agmanic.

491
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,298
You'll hurt his head.
Yeah, he's asleep.

492
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,959
He fell asleep in the car, you know.
I'll bring you some...

493
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,879
He's sleepy, I don't wanna wake him-
I'll bring you orange juice...

494
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,513
No, thank you.
I'll bring you coffee,

495
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,471
ok, mrs Agmanic_

496
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,102
God. Alright, get you down here.

497
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,730
Come on, baby. Ahh.

498
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,351
Oh, fuck him, alright.

499
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:15,318
No? Not...Not even a tingle?
This is stupid.

500
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,945
Ok, alright.
No, let's just experiment.

501
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,989
Alright, so the crucifiix
doesn't work.

502
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,954
Hold out your hands.
Joey!

503
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,039
This is actual holy water, ok.

504
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,546
An actual catholic priest
blessed this shit right in front of me,

505
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,333
please, just hold out your hands.
No, this is ridiculous.

506
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,719
This is ridiculous, ok?
This whole thing is fucking ridiculous.

507
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,722
Hold your hand out.

508
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,428
Ok

509
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,846
well?
Oh, fuck.

510
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,856
That's not wat..
What the fuck is...

511
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,813
Holy shit!

512
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,477
What the fuck?!

513
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,237
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

514
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,114
Fuck, Bart, I'm fucking sorry, dude.
Oh, my God!

515
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,150
Why did you do this?!
Fuck. What do I do?

516
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,411
What's wrong?
Why did you pour water on my hand?

517
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,243
It didn't do shit.
Oh, you fucking asshole.

518
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,827
Such an asshole, man.

519
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,039
Who was stroking your hair last night
when you were drinking blood?

520
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,125
You were, yeah.
Human blood. Fuck it.

521
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,790
Look, alright, ok, ok,
I did some research,

522
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,550
and you're either
a zombie or a vampire,

523
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,007
good. Zombie or a vampire.

524
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,389
I knew there had to be
a scientific explanation for this.

525
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,723
Well..- Look, we basically
categorise you as definitely undead...

526
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,728
Alright, there's one catch, Joey.

527
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,060
There's no such thing
as vampires or zombies.

528
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,817
Not according to the Internet.
God, the Internet.

529
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,943
What do they say about bigfoot
on the Internet?

530
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,446
Bart, you're clearly not bigfoot-
you're way too short,

531
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,108
you're not covered in hair,
your feet are too small.

532
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:42,029
Ok, ok, alright.
So, zombie, check this out.

533
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:45,324
“A zombie is a dead human
or animal corpse

534
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,083
“that has been resuscitated
from death

535
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,416
"“by virtue of a curse, plague
or other unnatural cause."

536
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,922
Huh? Huh? Who does that
sound like, right?

537
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:58,053
“Zombies are automatons with
little to no mental functions," - you...

538
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,760
“Limited reasoning power," - you...

539
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,892
“And virtually no innate drive, ” - again,
you...

540
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,601
"“Aside from the urge to feed on
the flesh or brains of the living."

541
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,982
So I'm a zombie.
No.

542
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:18,774
Horst in 'schriften und hypothesen uber
die vampyren' dehnes a vampire as

543
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,571
“a dead body which continues
to live in the grave,

544
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,238
“which it leaves, however, by night

545
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,874
“for the purpose of sucking
the blood of the living,

546
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:32,003
“whereby it is nourished,
preserved in good condition,

547
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,415
“instead of becoming decomposed
like other dead bodies.”.

548
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:40,930
And scoffern in 'stray leaves
of science and folklore' writes,

549
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,931
"the best definition
I can give of a vampire"

550
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,685
“is a living, mischievous
and murderous dead body.

551
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,267
“A living dead body.”.

552
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,266
So I'm a vampire.

553
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,696
You're a revenant.
A revenant?

554
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:03,452
One who returns from the dead
in corporeal form.

555
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,949
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

556
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,043
So, what the hell do you do...

557
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,580
Drink holy water and recite
the lord's prayer backwards, what?

558
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,297
There is, er, one.., one cure

559
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,461
and that is chopping off your head

560
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,380
and driving a stake
through your body.

561
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,471
Well... oh, fuck!

562
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,389
Fuck.

563
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,728
So, what are we gonna do?

564
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:40,398
Here we go, here we go.

565
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,440
Here we go.

566
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,406
Hey, man, how you doing, huh?

567
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,787
Hey, man, we got
some work for you. Hop in.

568
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,869
Oh, thank you very much, sir,

569
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:54,036
but how about just some money
so I can buy some food?

570
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,921
Please don't touch the car.
We'll give you some food, ok?

571
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,381
So come on in, we got food for you.
Oh...No, man. Thanks.

572
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,887
How about just a dollar, maybe $2-
ok.

573
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:09,222
Well, here's the thing - your sign says
you will work for food.

574
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,809
So we've got work for you,
then we're gonna give you some food...

575
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,564
You'll work for food.

576
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,520
You understand what I mean?
So come on in.

577
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,357
Hey, man, I'm just trying
to make ends meet, you know.

578
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:24,150
So you will work for food?
Money would be better.

579
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,365
I mean, I'm just trying
to make things happen,

580
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,781
and kind of burn the candle
at both ends.

581
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:35,578
Burn the candle at both ends?
Burn the candle at both ends.

582
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,757
So whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's revisit this for a moment ok?

583
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,135
What do you mean 'missed'?
You want me to kill them?

584
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,670
These are the dregs of society.

585
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,010
They have no jobs, no family,
you know what I'm saying?

586
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,549
They make no contribution whatsoever.

587
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,093
You think someone's gonna notice

588
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,637
if they don't show up
at the freeway exit ramp one day?

589
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,851
I'm not killing anybody.
You gone fucking crazy?

590
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,891
You know what, maybe I am crazy.

591
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,606
You show up, come back
from the dead magically,

592
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,692
soliciting my help to procure
human blood so you don't rot.

593
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,653
Yeah, crazy -
reasonable explanation,

594
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,443
here we go, filthy meal coming up.

595
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,408
Hey, there, pops,
got some work for you for food.

596
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,073
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

597
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,412
Why don't you hop in, ok?
How about some money, man?

598
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,077
Give me some money.
No, no, no, no.

599
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,996
We have food for you
if you work for us, like the sign says...

600
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,540
You know, the sign
that you're holding?

601
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:22,582
What?
The sign.

602
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,126
"What?
“will work for food."

603
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,590
Who the fuck do you think I am,
your nigger?!

604
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,505
Oh, wow.
Get outta the car, white boy!

605
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,423
Alright, alright. Alright.
Outta the car! Put them up.

606
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,593
Ok hey, will you work for food?

607
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,105
I don't do that shit, man.
Huh?

608
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,061
I ain't no faggot,
I don't do that shit.

609
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,520
No, no, no, no, I, ..

610
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,310
Hey, you're looking for boystown -
Santa Monica boulevard.

611
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:43,854
Now get the fuck out of here

612
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,772
before I give you something
else to think about.

613
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,315
You faggot motherfucker!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

614
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,859
Whoa! Whoa!
Get the fuck off!

615
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,403
This is working out great, Joe.

616
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,618
What have you got next?
I'm sorry, man.

617
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:58,285
I mean, I'm surprised nobody responded
to my craigslist ad...

618
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,920
What, really?
Yeah.

619
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,504
That surprises me.
Everybody responds to those things.

620
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,168
I know.
Huh, what are you gonna do?

621
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:18,103
Ohm Jesus!

622
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,811
Oh, what is wrong with you?

623
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,030
Fuck.

624
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,698
I don't know what that's about.
We gotta igure it out soon.

625
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,616
Hey, bro! Bro! Just wait a sec.

626
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,002
- Get in the car.

00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,002

684
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:22,238
Dude, he shot you with his gun.
This is a trip! Look at you!

685
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,158
Oh, my... oh, yo, ok. Alright.

Take him, take him.
Get him, get him, get him.

689
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,167
What are you talking about?
We gotta go.

Alright, get him in there.

00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,103
Oh, daddy's gonna eat.

00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,194
Baby's gonna have a nice meal.

697
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,154
Oh, my God, that ruled!

You got dinner, buddy. Nice!

fucking gringos, huh?

702
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,669
You didn't see that one coming,
did you, ese, huh?

703
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,504
Maricén hull'?

704
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:20,297
Yo, so suck him off or, you know,
drink his blood. You know, do it.

705
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,682
I.._i don't know, man.

706
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,343
Fucking drink his blood, ban.
Do it.

707
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,353
You're wasting it.
He's bleeding all over the seat.

708
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,937
Jesus Christ. You know, he shot you!
You know he shot you, right?

709
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,477
He tried to kill you.
It was us or him!

710
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,361
Seriously, Bart!

711
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,649
Dude, you're decom-fucking-posing,
are you kidding?

712
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,910
You're wasting away.
Don't you wanna get better?

713
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,662
Dude, you have no choice.

714
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,369
Drink his blood.

715
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,635
There you go. That's my guy.

716
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:03,765
Look at that oh! Oh, Jesus Christ

717
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,517
E fades) I-my shir.

718
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,469
We're gonna need more rocks.
No, we got plenty of rocks.

719
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,508
No, we got enough rocks to sink him

720
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,723
but we don't got enough rocks
to hold him down

721
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,560
once his putrefying flesh
starts to swell up with gas...

722
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:38,272
Then he becomes a big, white
fermented meat bobber

723
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,607
bubbling up on the surface
for all to see.

724
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,271
We're gonna need more rocks.

725
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,940
Where the fuck do you end this shit?

726
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,608
I retain odd little titbits
of information.

727
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,617
Up and over.

728

Hey, Joey.

738
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,231
Joey, I can see you in there.

739
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,858
I'm naked.
Oh, come on!

740
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,360
From the waist down.
Oh, come on, Joey, open the door.

741
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,897
Hold on!  Coming!

742
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,690
Coming.

Joey, what are you doing? Come on!

744
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,619
Oh. Ok, you should knock more.

Matty Janet.

746
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:24,799
The police came to my house.
They said barfs body's missing.

747
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:29,303
My God, you're kidding?
Save it, Joey. I already told her.

what's going on?

750
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,140
I wanted to tell you, I did, I did,

751
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,522
but he didn't want me
to tell anyone.

752
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,559
I thought...L think maybe
he was embarrassed.

753
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,853
Are you sure you wanna do this?

754
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,360
(Dqor creaks;

Why? Why are you doing this to me?

You fucking arsehole,
I loved you, why?

Hes cmd.

764
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,734
We have to stop this. It's too hard.

765
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,274
There are dark forces at play.

766
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,033
We have to end this, now.

767
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,944
Dark forces?

768
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:20,661
And what do you mean, 'end it'?
She means cutoff his head.

769
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,951
What'?!
It's the only way, Janet.

770
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,664
The...Ihe only way to what?

771
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,921
The only way to put
his soul to rest.

772
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,208
No! I wanna see him again.

773
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,089
Has he wed yet?

774
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,300
Whai do you mean, 'killed'?

775
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:40,218
He has to drink blood
to survive, Janet.

776
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,261
Has he wed yet?

777
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:46,604
You're not cu., .
You're not cutting off his head.

778

This is insane.

779
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,856
Has he killed yet, Joey?

780
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,863
Joey?!
A...A little bit.

781
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,577
What?
It was in self-defence.

782
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,660
And did he drink his victim's blood?

783
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:05,497
Um, yeah, he did do that.

784
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,785
See?

785
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,796
Janet, we have to
put his soul at peace,

786
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,423
You understand?

787
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,380
He can't do it himself.
It's up to us.

788
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,091
No! You're not fucking touching him...

789
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,257
You never liked him and
you never wanted us to be together.

790
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,346
Get out of here now!

791
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,885
Go!
All lwanna___.

792
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:26,271
Go2  Go.

793
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,101
Oh. That went well, I thought.

794
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,191
That's., .That's my room.

795
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,484
So, did you come clean
with your best pal?

796
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,197
Beg your pardon?

797
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:48,620
Perhaps there's more than one reason
to 'give him peace'.

798
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,754
Do the right thing, Joey.

799
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,879
Fucking blow me, Matty.

800
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,175
(Sombre musnq

801
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:13,812
I they say.

802
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,651
..' It must have been.

803
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,987
.' Surrender.

804
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,587
.' I te!! Them.

805
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:42,215
.' All that [Here is to remember, . I.

806
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,008
Oh, my God.

807
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,472
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you.

808
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,311
It's so good to see you too.

809
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,521
How did you ind out?

810
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,813
I couldn't believe it
when mathilda told me, I...

811
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,947
Oh, my God, look at your eyes.

812
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,825
Oh, yeah. That's fucked up, right?

813
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,203
I usually wear sunglasses.

814
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,203
What the hell's going on?

815
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:14,418
Oh, sometimes, I guess,
people just rise from the dead.

816
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,336
From the dead?
Yeah.

817
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,297
From the dead!

818
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,262
.' Angels are there just for lovers.

819
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,193
I can't believe you'd do this to me.
Baby...

820
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:40,777
I had to bury you!
I had to say goodbye.

821
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:48,490
.' You're no! The lover for me.

822
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:54,166
.' Hoping for proof they don't see.

823
00:56:55,329 --> 00:57:00,335
.' Somehow awaiting your crime.

824
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,466
.' I fa!!

825
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,187
..' Vwth my heart.

826
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,244
So you're still not hungry
or are you basically, like, nervous

827
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,000
you're gonna puke everything up
in a damned bloody mess?

828
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,084
I'm not feeling very rubicund lately.
Rubicund?

829
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,340
Nice. That's a pretty gay word.

830
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,141
Oh, you got your
cell phone back, huh?

831
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:57,024
Yep. Janet gave it back to me.
What?

832
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,526
She sent me a bunch of voicemails
when I was dead.

833
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,153
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

834
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,779
Said she wanted to hear my voice.

835
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:06,568
She pissed that you're not accepting
her calls, sending her to voicemail?

836
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,536
- You're so fucked, man.
- Sorry.

837
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,072
You just send her to voicemail.

838
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,286
Where's the quick-e-mart man?
I don't know.

839
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,837
Oh. There he is yes.

840
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,966
Ok.
You alright?

841
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,755
That's a nice shirt.
Great shin.

842
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:33,436
- Did you steal it from a gypsy?
- Cowboy gypsy?

843
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,391
That's a great hat.

844
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,360
Ohhh!

845
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,112
Hey!
What are you doing?

846
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,273
You stupid white motherfuckers,

847
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,659
you just walked into the wrong
motherfucking liquor store.

848
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,536
Put your white motherfucking heads on
the motherfucking counter now!

849
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,572
Get the fucking money
out of the fucking machine

850
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,286
and put it in the fucking bag!

851
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,123
I hate fucking square-ass, tight-fuck
white people like you.

852
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,787
And I can't stand no slant-eyed,

853
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,705
chink-nip motherfucker
like you neither,

854
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,591
ge! The fucking money!
Think I'm playing with you?!

855
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,468
Give me that.
Get your ass over there.

856
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,505
What the fuck's wrong
with you fuckers?

857
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,220
On your knees! Put your hands
behind your fucking head!

858
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,804
Skirnpy-ass yellow bastards.

859
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,560
Anybody moves, I'll shoot 'em.

860
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,768
Anybody makes a sound, guess what?
I'm gonna shoot 'em!

861
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,355
I'm glad you assholes
came up in here,

862
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,942
I didn't plan on busting up
no white folks tonight, just gooks!

863
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,698
But I always do over the white man
when I get the opportunity.

864
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,450
Fork it over, motherfucker!

865
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,987
Put that fucking shit
on the counter! Now!

866
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,325
Yeah.

867
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,455
Isn't that a little racist?
What?

868
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:41,211
Wh-what-what...What the fuck
did you just say?

869
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,248
You always do over the white man
when you get the chance,

870
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,791
that what you said?

871
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,255
Fuck you! Look what you
white folks did to my people.

872
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,011
Look how you force down
the black community!

873
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,344
You specifically target someone
based on their race, that's racism.

874
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,384
Back me up on this, Joey.

875
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,348
Yeah, back him up, motherfucker.

876
00:59:57,511 --> 01:00:01,232
Shit, are you kidding me, man?
Are you fucking kidding me?

877
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:04,393
