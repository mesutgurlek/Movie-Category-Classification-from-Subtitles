[Sighing]

308
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,397
[Gagging]

309
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:16,604
Don't eat your heart out, baby.
Thas my job.

310
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,650
[Growling]

311
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:23,586
Wow, I guess I finally found a girl
with a little something extra.

312
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,068
[Both Sighing]

313
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,128
So, what are
your hobbies?

314
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,310
[Pants Unzip]

315
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,642
There's something
I need to ask you about. Um...

316
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,150
My girls know betterthan
to talk with their mouth full.

317
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,151
Whoa.

318
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,019
Two chicks. Thas cool.
[Chuckles]

319
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,684
You care for a little deep throat?
[Chuckles, Growls]

320
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,362
Deputy,
you don't understand.

321
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,422
My brother's been gone
for days.
Ma'am, I understand just fine.

322
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,435
Right now,
I'm up to my eyeballs
in missing persons.

323
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,437
I'll get
to your brother...

324
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,269
after I've gotten
to all these cases first.

325
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,332
I'm sorry.
That could
take forever.

326
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,709
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.
- Fucking cops are unbelievable.

327
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,876
- Great.
- Now thas just ridiculous.

328
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,148
A pretty lady like you
being treated like that.

329
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,917
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help
overhearing.

330
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,824
My name is,
uh, Rafe Guttman,
Guttman Investigations.

331
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,226
I specialize
in missing persons.

332
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,231
Can I get that back?

333
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,290
I'm savin' trees.
Just doin' my part.

334
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,767
I have an office.
Maybe you and I
could go talk...

335
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,770
Watch what
you're doing, huh?
Rafe Guttman.

336
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,772
We could talk about this.
Unless you want
to stay here...

337
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,469
and let the A-Team get
to your brother's case.

338
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,274
I've had a few run-ins
with the cops myself, Miss...

339
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,872
I didn't catch your name.
Verdoux, Katherine.

340
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,110
Look, Mr. Guttman...
Call me Katherine.

341
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,983
I'm not sure that I'm ready
to hire someone right now.

342
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,354
What are you waiting for?
Every minute you delay,
is harder to find your brother.

343
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,552
You gotta trust me.
I'm an expert.

344
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,561
Well, I guess
it couldn't hurt to talk.

345
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,359
Of course it wouldn't.
And I'll be gentle.

346
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,195
And, you know,
I can't believe it,

347
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,497
but I'm actually
going to ask a woman this:

348
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,402
Uh, haven't I met you
somewhere before?

349
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,737
Must be my imagination.

350
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,902
Well, anyway, we're here.

351
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,344
And I know you're already
feeling a little bit better
about me, aren't you?

352
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:32,008
[Chuckling]

353
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:36,020
Why don't you plunk it down
right over there?

354
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,215
So tell me
about your brother.

355
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,656
We had a fight.
He went out,
and he never came back.

356
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,627
[Chuckling]
Thas one hell of a tiff.

357
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,859
That sort of stuff
happen all the time?
We argue a lot.

358
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:52,131
Then he goes out,
gets drunk with his friends,
and usually he comes home.

359
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,229
Yeah, not this time.

360
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,934
I'll tell ya what,
I'm gonna need the names
of those friends.

361
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,340
I'm gonna need some phone numbers,
some addresses.

362
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,812
Maybe a photo, charcoal rendering.
You got anything like that?

363
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,681
Yeah, I did bring
a picture with me.

364
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,656
- What are you lookin' at?
- [Laughs] Uh, your clutch.
I'm a purse freak.

365
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,758
I'm looking at you.
I swear to God I know you.
We've never met?

366
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,202
I don't think so.

367
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:31,265
Well, you know something, dearie,
if is any consolation to you,

368
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,277
you're just not my type.

369
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,506
That is comforting.
Believe me.

370
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,950
Can I get you something?
Maybe a cookie, popcorn,
a little Prozac, dear?

371
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,680
I'm fine.

372
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,848
So this is your brother.
Jesus Christ.

373
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,690
Wow. Same parents?
[Laughing]

374
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,286
- Can I keep this?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

375
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,025
I might have to wear this
in a locket.

376
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,001
How much is this gonna cost me?
A hundred and fifty a day,
plus expenses.

377
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,833
Now I know
I made a mistake.
No, come on.

378
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,806
Don't club me
with the dramatics.

379
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:07,277
I've got a half-price sale
this week on missing brothers.
How's that?

380
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,813
[Sighs]
Okay.

381
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,281
[Phone Rings]
One sec.

382
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,478
Hello. Guttman Investigations.
You've got Guttman.

383
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,818
What the fuck are you doing
calling me here?

384
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,325
For Chriss sake,
what do you want now?

385
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:26,057
You're reminding me why
being married to you drove me
to the brink ofhomosexuality.

386
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,567
I'm not hiding out on you.
Business has been dreck.

387
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,967
I don't care what
yourslimebag lawyersays,
I'm not holding out on you.

388
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,506
Don't you get it?
You cleaned me out.

389
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,633
You're a high colonic
in a dress.
What a sleaze.

390
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,473
I gotta go.
Fuck you.

391
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,706
Hey, where you goin'?
Somethin' spook you?

392
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,807
No, I'm fine. Don't worry.
I will pay you foryour time.

393
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,717
I don't want paid for my time.
I want paid for helping you.

394
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,746
Like it or not, Katherine,
I'm all you've got.

395
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,055
I'm gonna win this one
foryou, honey.

396
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,061
And you.

397
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:02,498
You just couldn't possibly
get any cooler, could you?

398
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,501
Excuse me?

399
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,402
I am Rafe Guttman.
[Scoffs]

400
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,497
Guttman Investigations.

401
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,839
There's my card.

402
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,345
Nice card, Rafe.

403
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:20,110
Let me give you a hand
with your card, Rafe.
All right.

404
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,747
Let me put that there forya.
I'm considering the gauntlet
officially thrown, friend.

405
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,553
Yeah.
Listen, uh, you're Zeke,
aren't you?

406
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,857
I'm Zeke.
Zeke, I'm looking
foryour friend, Caleb.

407
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,059
You seen him?
I don't know anyone
named Caleb, Rafe.

408
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,796
You don't know shot selection either.
You really gonna do that?

409
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,930
You really thinking of that?
You're gonna pot the cue ball, man.

410
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:46,444
Why don't you go to hell.
Why don't I get out of the way
of the shrapnel.

411
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,206
Goddamn it!
[Rafe]
What did I tell ya?

412
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,184
Whas happening, Tonto?

413
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,550
[Laughing]
[Zeke]
Your shot.

414
00:25:56,621 --> 00:26:00,079
Are you still here, man?
I'm still here,
and that cue ball's still potted.

415
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,457
I see you boys both
have a nose thing.
[Laughing]

416
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,758
Maybe you watch
a little too much QVC, huh?

417
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,094
Thas quick.
Fuck you.

418
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,464
[Laughing]
Consider me fucked.

419
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:18,501
Whas next on the shit shot
agenda here forZeke?
You cannot be serious.

420
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,602
Really, you should think about
putting the three in the...
[Zeke] Look.

421
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,773
- I don't know where Caleb is, all right?
- Uh-huh.

422
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:27,011
- Him and Reggie,
they went off to get laid.
- Long trip.

423
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,076
Why don't you get the fuck
outta my face, tiger?

424
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,954
I'm there foryou, Zekey.
What about you, Stephen Hawking?

425
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,992
You seen Caleb?
You seen his girlfriend?

426
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,722
[Chuckling]
He ain't got no girlfriend.
[Chuckling] No.

427
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:42,199
They went to a whorehouse.
Oh, you like whorehouses,
don't ya?

428
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,498
At this point in your life,
you're pretty much at peace
with having to pay for it.

429
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,595
Hey, you got an address
on that whorehouse?

430
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:52,166
Um, Bowmont, I think.
Bowmont?
You got a numberfor me?

431
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,371
Come on,
squeeze it out.

432
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,780
325.
[Laughing]

433
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,943
You are making
such progress.

434
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,386
I'm gonna get Nurse Ratched
to notch back on your dosage.

435
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,620
This is real cute.
I hate to break it up,
but I wanna play some pool here.

436
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,991
Shot number three.
[Zeke]
Uh-huh.

437
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,394
- I don't know, man.
- Fuck off!

438
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,367
I'm telling you, man,
thas a bad, bad angle.

439
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,960
Oh!
Oh, asshole!
Jeez!

440
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,972
[Rafe]
Six-pack in the side cleavage.

441
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,338
You know what?
Step outside.

442
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,502
You know, Zeke,
not right now.

443
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,671
Just not in the mood
for a blow job.

444
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,715
I gotta rock, kids.

445
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:43,353
Oh, Mrs. Johnson,
you were robust, vital.

446
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:46,192
Thas the Mrs. Johnson
I'll remember.

447
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:52,032
Before the horrid ravaging
reduced herto the frail,

448
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,539
the emaciated,
worm-eaten thing...

449
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,041
that she became.
Is so fuckin' bright
in here.

450
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,373
Why do they need the lights on?
Let us pay tribute
to the Mrs. Johnson...

451
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:04,313
we all knew and loved.

452
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,373

Don't forget tasteful.

Sorry to disturb you,
but I have something
you should see.

I thought you said
Mr. Guttman had finished
his investigation.

He has finished.

your job is done.

Yes, Miss Verdoux?
Where did you find this?

623
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,453
I found that
at the McCutcheon
Mortuary,

624

907
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:19,688
Should I kill you
or let you live
and make you my dog?

908
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:22,162
Vincent.
Vincent, give me the key.

909
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,668
- [Growls]
- Please. The key.

910
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:29,603
- ForGoïs sake, hurry.
- You leave that thing
right where it is.

911
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,038
- [Current]
Give me the key.
- Vincent.

912
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:36,101
Give it to me, and I will send this
demon slut back where she belongs!

913
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,541
Vincent,
what are you doing?

914
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,745
What I should have done
from the start.

915
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,515
- [Gasps]
- [Laughing]

916
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:49,922
No!

917
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,563
Thanks, honey.

918
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,695
Do us both a favor.
Kill him!

919
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:06,037
[Gasps]
Fuck, no.
I want to let him live.

920
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:10,136
I want this sanctimonious shit
to watch what happens
now that I'm free.

921
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,789
- Katherine?
- How did you get in here?

922
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,292
Katherine, I have something
I have to show you.

923
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,954
You don't give up, do you?
Is like a sickness
with you or something.

924
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,463
I went to the Mount Hope
Cemetery last night.

925
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:32,023
The McCutcheon Mortuary held
an internment there yesterday.

926
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:35,935
I took some photos.
These photos are the contents
of the coffin they interred.

927
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:39,600
I think you're gonna
want to look at 'em.
Just take a look.

928
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,448
Thas very nice.
You're worse than I thought.
You are really sick.

929
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:48,984
There were two bodies
in that coffin
when I took the pictures.

930
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:52,021
Two bodies.
Get your fuckin' hands off me.
Sure.

931
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,750
At least come to the cemetery,
for Chriss sake! Take a look!

932
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:57,452
[Sighs]
Sorry, Jonas.
[Security, Rafe Arguing]

933
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:02,055
Excuse me, sir.
Can you please tell me
why you come here?

934
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:10,172
There was a woman
at that table, wasn't there?

935
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,868
[Katherine On Tape]
You're into prostitution...
I wasn't talking to myself.

936
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,310
[Katherine]
I know there was somebody
at that table. Oh, my God.

937
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,682
[Katherine]
Look, there'sJ.C.
[Rafe] Where?

938
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,980
I don't see him.
Right there.

939
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,986
Well, I'll be damned.

940
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:27,818
There he is
with the demented Ewok,
Professor Loveless.

941
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,324
You know, Katie Scarlett,
never...

942
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:34,159
trust any man of God
with a boner.

943
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,461
I mean an erection.
Sorry.
No, boner's the right word.

944
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,660
Wow.
What is he doing there?

945
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:43,035
It doesn't make any sense.
Les get our facts
in order.

946
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:48,635
We have Reverend Current
leaving a topless bar.
Thas an odd one.

947
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:53,739
And we have photos
and videotape with people
who didn't photograph or record.

948
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,750
Follow that thread
of thinking.

949
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:59,686
Did not photograph.
Did not record.
I don't want you to flee.

950
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:02,122
I'm gonna advance a weird,
Duchovnyan riff.

951
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,591
What if what we're
dealing with here...

952
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:08,654
is, in fact... vampires?

953
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,791
Are you crazy?
Why is that crazy?

954
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,859
Because I advance the theory
that the perpetrator
of our crimes...

955
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:17,235
is an eternal spirit who
sustains itself solely...

956
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,137
through the intake ofhuman
hemoglobin through a set
of protracted fangs?

957
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:22,541
Shut up, Rafe.

958
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:26,844
Although... you have been right
about a lot of other things.

959
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,850
Wow.

960
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:31,113
Were you being nice
to me there, Katherine?

961
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:35,453
No. I just said you have been right
about a lot of other things.
Okay.

962
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,358
[Ringing]
Hello.

963
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:41,989
[Caleb]
Katherine, is that you?
Caleb?

964
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:43,999
[Whispers]
Is Caleb.
I need your help.

965
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,001
I'm in trouble.
Where are you?

966
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,537
I'm at the old power plant
on the south side.

967
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,663
They're coming for me.
You gotta help me. Please.

968
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,732
I'm in trouble.
They're coming for me.
Hurry. Hurry!

969
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:58,941
Katherine, I'm not complaining,
but I wish your brotherwould
have picked a less creepy place.

970
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:02,280
I feel like I'm in a bad
Tales from the Crypt episode.

971
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:05,081
Sorry.
I had Mexican for lunch.

972
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:09,454
Next time I'll ask him
to be more considerate.
Caleb!

973
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:14,758
Come on.

974
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,535
Caleb!
Where are you? God.

975
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:28,202
I think is really sweet
you wanna find your brother,

976
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,541
but we should split.

977
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:33,946
I'm getting some really bad
juju off this place.

978
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:40,515
Katherine.
Oh, my God.

979
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,991
Here, hold this.
Is he dead?
Is he breathing?

980
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,397
Hey, man, don't touch me
unless you love me!

981
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:50,932
Come on, dude, les party.

982
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,991
[Caleb Snarling]

983
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,970
- [Katherine] Rafe, no.
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

984
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,268
- [Groans]
- Sorry, Katherine,

985
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,969
but that wasn't
your brother anymore.

986
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:05,173
Wrong! I'll always
be your brother... sis.

987
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:07,113
Katherine,
run from your brother.

988
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,673
Hurry!
I am.

989
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,776
Hurry!
I am.

990
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,946
[Caleb]
Katherine,
I'm coming foryou.

991
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:14,956
[Maniacal Laughter]

992
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:21,290
[Caleb]
I like this.
See the ladder? Up.

993
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:26,000
Katherine.

994
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,028
- [Caleb] Katherine? Katherine?
- [Rafe] Shit. We're screwed.

995
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,974
Les go back.
No, no, wait a minute.
I see a way.

996
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,739
What do you mean?
Jesus Christ, Katherine,
what are you doing?

997
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,305
Come on!
Is the fucking Grand Canyon!

998
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,682
- Just shut up and follow me!
- What are you doing with that chain?

999
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,256
That is the craziest
fuckin' thing I have ever...

1000
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,019
Hi, dickhead.

1001
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:53,755
That is the second craziest
fuckin' thing...

1002
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:59,063
This is a mistake!

1003
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,702
Have a little
chloroform, darling.
Too bad.

1005

[Noonan]
Is about fuckin'time.

1006
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:20,221
I've gone to hell,
and is worse than I imagined.

1007
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,190
Noonan, where am I?
Where's Katherine?

1008
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,727
Now, don't you start
with that bullshit.

1009
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,696
She was at the factory.
McCutcheon had her.

1010
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,494
And that guy who worked
for Current was there.
And her brother.

1011
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,694
What is this shit?
Get me outta here.

1012
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:35,862
[Chewing]
Why don't you shut up?

1013
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,372
Do you hear me, thumb dick?
They've got Katherine!

1014
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,808
Now get me outta here!

Still causing trouble, is he?
Officer, would you mind helping me?

1017
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:51,617
[Rafe]
Listen, ifwe don't
stop these things,

1018
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,951
they're gonna
destroy the city.

1019
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,897
- Listen, you fat fuck...

Remind me, Tammy.
Why do vampires hate sunrise?

[Gasping]

1025
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:38,496
No. Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,365
Oh, no!
[Screams]

1027
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:51,869
You want to keep it down?
I'm trying to rest!

1028
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,213
I knew I should have
taken that private room.

1029
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,553
- [Slurping]
- Caleb, please let me go.

1030
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:04,150
- Sorry, no can do.
- [Gasps]

1031
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,217
I gotta play by the rules here.

1032
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,230
I know how you feel.
I didn't want to be a vampire either.

1033
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,822
At first.

1034
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,597
But afteryou get used to it...
is pretty damn cool!

1035
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:19,405
Besides, you know me.
I've always been a night owl.

1036
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:23,605
And getting to live forever
doesn't hurt either, does it?

1037
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:24,805
You got that right.

1038
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,180
Before we get down to business, darling,
I'm gonna take you fora test ride.

1039
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,742
[Chuckling]
Oh, sis, can I watch?

1040
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:35,188
Ah, first customer of the night.

1041
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,522
What the hell
do you want?
I'm here to see Lilith.

1042
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:44,499
I know I can't fight you all,
so I've come to join you.

1043
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:48,333
- Is that right?
I'll be sure to tell her.
- No.

1044
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,903
No, I want to tell her myself.

1045
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,909
Come on, Jimmy, I know you
a little better than that.

1046
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:58,879
Into the parlor,
Reverend, sir.

1047
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:01,712
Get your filthy hands
off of me!
[Lilith] Feisty.

1048
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:03,718
I like that.

1049
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:07,222
[Gasping]
I like that
even better.

1050
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,520
Mmm!

to beat a dead vampire here,

to thank you for coming
to my rescue back there.

Maybe. I don't know.

I guess Katherine
learned in the end...

that the fastest way
to a man's heart

They're a regular
