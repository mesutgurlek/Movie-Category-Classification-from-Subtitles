1
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,479
I drove out to the orphanage today.

2
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,023
I go every month, remember?

3
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,318
The children are so cute.

4
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,613
If I have a child, maybe I'll raise her
out there in the country.

5
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,493
Show her flowers and trees.
Plus, it's close to Seoul.

6
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,538
The tow truck?

7
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,748
They said it'll take a while.

8
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,966
I love your voice.

9
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:06,637
It feels romantic
to hear your voice in the snow.

10
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,564
Hold on a moment.

11
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,526
Got a flat tire?

12
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,737
Yes, I called a tow truck.

13
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,616
In this snow,
it could take a while.

14
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:29,452
Hold on.
Let me take a look.

15
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,878
I said it's okay,
but he's looking at it.

16
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,007
Really?

17
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,885
Just wait for the tow truck.

18
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:52,725
No, it's not hard
to change a flat tire.

19
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:02,109
But why bother
when a tow truck's coming?

20
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,654
Hold on a sec.

21
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,697
Status?

22
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,618
Okay, got it.

23
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,329
Hello? Ju-yeon?
I'd better get going.

24
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,250
Lock the doors
and just wait for the tow truck.

25
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,796
What?

26
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,218
Hold on.

27
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:43,484
<i>Love is...</i>

28
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,821
<i>Sweet like...</i>

29
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,449
<i>A mother's...</i>

30
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,577
Tow truck's on its way.

31
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,831
Why does he bother?

32
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,878
Too many people here today.

33
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,135
Sorry to be working
on your birthday again.

34
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,014
I'll be home soon.

35
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,237
Your car's completely sunk.

36
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:33,242
Thank you, but I'll just wait
for the tow truck.

37
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,036
Thank you.

38
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:14,492
<i>STUDENT SAFETY VEHICLE</i>

39
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,501
Why isn't he leaving?

40
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,171
Mister...

41
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,007
Mister...

42
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,095
Wait...

43
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:30,706
Your skin's so soft,
looks like it'll be easy.

44
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,674
Please don't kill me.

45
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,262
Why not?

46
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,141
I'm...

47
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,939
pregnant.

48
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,950
Please, let me live.

49
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,123
Dong-su! Dong-su!

50
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:04,586
- What?
- Come here, quick!

51
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,557
Chief!
Why'd you come here?

52
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,560
Stay at home.
We'll keep you posted.

53
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,980
What's going on?

54
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,732
What happened to my daughter?

55
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:09,192
Don't look!

56
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,737
Nothing's for sure yet.

57
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,313
- Detective Cho!
- What?

58
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,649
What's this?

59
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,944
Move it.

60
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,656
It looks like a head.

61
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:57,866
Flip it.

62
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,690
Forensics!
Come here, quick!

63
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:32,484
We found the head!

64
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,283
Look after Chief Jang!

65
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,666
Chief! Sir!

66
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,461
Ju-yeon! Ju-yeon!

67
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,414
Stop taking pictures!

68
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,832
You call yourselves humans?!

69
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,375
Block them off!

70
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:21,319
At least, heaven helped us.

71
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:26,533
Otherwise,
we might never have found her.

72
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,621
How ironic.

73
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:36,710
I was a police detective
for over 30 years...

74
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,339
and I couldn't even protect
my own daughter.

75
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,727
Stop smoking, sir.

76
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,901
I'm sorry.

77
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:05,697
Really.

78
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,912
I'm so sorry.

79
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,752
To you...

80
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,924
and to Ju-yeon...

81
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,058
I'm so sorry.

82
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,090
<i>Forgive me, Ju-yeon.</i>

83
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:08,385
<i>I wasn't there for you.</i>

84
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,554
<i>Always late...</i>

85
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:14,808
<i>Never there when you needed me.</i>

86
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,895
<i>But Ju-yeon...</i>

87
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,023
<i>I promise you this.</i>

88
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:34,786
<i>I'll make him pay for your pain.</i>

89
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,838
Soo-hyun...

90
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,593
For how long?

91
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,554
There's no rush.
Do you want one or two months off?

92
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,389
All I need is two weeks, sir.

93
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,640
Take more days.

94
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:41,644
No, I'll see you in two weeks, sir.

95
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,857
That'd be good for us...

96
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,736
But are you sure?

97
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:03,416
Then I'll see to it.
I hope you recover from your grief.

98
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,251
Get some rest.

99
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,678
How could this happen?

100
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,181
Didn't he get engaged
just last month?

101
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:22,685
I don't believe this.

102
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:26,815
The capsule is equipped
with GPS and a microphone.

103
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:29,359
Cool, isn't it?

104
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,614
Good job.

105
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,116
Thanks.

106
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:37,784
Sure.

107
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,458
Aren't you going back?

108
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,793
Huh?

109
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,462
Anything else to tell me?

110
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,464
No.

111
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,008
Right.

112
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:59,055
As you know,
I snuck this out.

113
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,934
If something goes wrong,
you and I will...

114
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,562
Don't worry.

115
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:07,939
Nothing will go wrong.

116
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:22,120
It looks like the police...

117
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,624
think these four
are the main suspects.

118
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:32,922
They've been accused
of similar crimes before.

119
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,845
- Hi, Soo-hyun.
- Hi.

120
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,807
Did you have dinner already?

121
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,560
I'd better get going.

122
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,521
I brought some groceries for Dad.

123
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,652
I'll be going then.
Take care, sir.

124
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,447
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

125
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,219
Shit.

126
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,963
Quiet!

127
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,342
Remember this?

128
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,098
You really don't know?

129
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,732
Fine.

130
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,458
Sir.

131
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:16,961
What the hell is with him?
He's turning himself in?

132
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,215
Says he killed the girl found
at Bangho Creek two months ago.

133
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,260
And the missing Shinchon girl case
a few years back.

134
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,388
All of a sudden,
he has a conscience?

135
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,600
What the hell? Who did this?
You bastards?

136
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,518
No, sir.

137
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,688
An ambulance came
so I ran up to see.

138
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,066
And this bastard
was practically dying.

139
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:40,276
What the heck happened?

140
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,695
Well, he didn't say anything yet.

141
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,783
What the hell happened last night?

142
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:50,495
Help... me... please.

143
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,623
Help... me...

144
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,291
What's he saying?

145
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:59,921
Some bastard hammered his balls.

146
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,298
What?

147
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,926
That's insane!

148
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,678
Who broke your balls?

149
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,251
Who are you?

150
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,303
What the hell!

151
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:47,481
The buses have stopped running.
Where are you headed?

152
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,067
Pardon me?

153
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,236
Where are you going?

154
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,779
To Sung-min Apartments.

155
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,948
Sung-min?

156
00:32:56,015 --> 00:33:00,494
Well, it's kinda on the way.
Hop in.

157
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,662
I'll give you a ride.

158
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,789
It's okay, but thanks.

159
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,958
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

160
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,543
No, really. It's okay.

161
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,839
It's just down the road.
Hop in.

162
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,059
It's fine.

163
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,774
You sure it's on your way?

164
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,403
Don't worry. Get in.

165
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,674
What?

166
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,635
Huh? Nothing.

167
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:05,601
Is this a school van?

168
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:31,252
Ah... shit.
Where'd I put it?

169
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,746
Why?

170
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:09,457
Huh?

171
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:15,254
Why do you look
like you stepped in shit?

172
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,548
Never seen a thing like this?

173
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:37,169
Who's there?

174
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:57,106
Why do you need this
for the insurance money?

175
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:01,318
I have to identify
the policy holder.

176
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,446
There are too many people
with the same name.

177
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,700
These are all old pictures.

178
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,463
Perhaps this one would do.

179
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,430
I'll ask a few more
standard questions.

180
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,309
Do you have additional
contact numbers for him?

181
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,605
I don't.
But his son does.

182
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:42,026
Sang-won! Sang-won!

183
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:45,279
Where'd he go?

184
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:52,453
I think it was Yang-pyung
or Chung-pyung...

185
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:58,959
Can you verify that this person is
the man I'm looking for?

186
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:06,717
Is this Mr. Jang Kyung-chul?

187
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,598
It's Kyung-chul alright.

188
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,476
But...

189
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,729
is this a recent picture?

190
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,902
Why does he look so scary?

191
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,821
Insurance, my ass.

192
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,035
He doesn't give a shit
about anyone.

193
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:37,748
He abandoned his parents
and his son.

194
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,501
Like he'd really take out
a family insurance policy?

195
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,045
It doesn't make any sense!

196
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,213
Don't talk like that!

197
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,674
Am I wrong?

198
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,634
No use protecting him.

199
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:53,347
- Shut up! You old fool!
- You call that a "son"?

200
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,975
Shut up!
Don't get me started!

201
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:59,228
How can you say that?

202
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,379
If you can't say something nice,
don't say anything!

203
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,982
Fuck!

204
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,531
By the way...

205
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:16,495
doesn't the family get the money
if the policy holder dies?

206
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,441
Are you Sang-won?

207
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,782
Do you know
where your dad lives?

208
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,163
Shit!

209
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,167
Why?

210
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,576
She's a really good singer.

211
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,662
- Maybe I can go.
- Of course you'll go.

212
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:29,081
My mom's gonna kill me.

213
00:43:30,732 --> 00:43:33,585
Go straight home, girls. Okay?

214
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,754
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,759
Please drive them straight home.

216
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,927
Of course.

217
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,804
- Thank you.
- Sure.

218
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,304
Shit.

219
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,601
- Can I help you?
- Is Jang Kyung-chul here?

220
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:35,314
- Why? Is there a problem?
- We're the police. Where is he?

221
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,690
He's driving the kids home.

222
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,901
Shit. Call his cell phone, now!
Hurry!

223
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,831
<i>LEARNING CENTER</i>

224
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,966
Shit.

225
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,727
<i>Do not cry on me.</i>

226
00:46:02,884 --> 00:46:08,782
<i>Do not cry like a baby.</i>

227
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,536
Let's see.

228
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,283
You have fair skin.

229
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,915
It's okay.

230
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,042
It'll be over quick.

231
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:08,967
I lost my damn job.

232
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:14,514
Looks like things are fucked up.

233
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,103
But...

234
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,232
Shit!
Who says I can't like you?

235
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,736
What's wrong with that?

236
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,531
I can like you if I want.

237
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:35,785
Damn bitches in the world
are always against me.

238
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,247
I can! Can't I?

239
00:47:41,983 --> 00:47:44,794
Shit.

240
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,925
It'll be over quickly.

241
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:53,178
I'll make it quick for you.

242
00:48:09,302 --> 00:48:11,571
<i>Jang Kyung-chul.</i>

243
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:02,140
What?
You're alone?

244
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,564
Are you a cop?

245
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,081
Must be right.

246
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:35,674
The cops found me this quick?

247
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,718
You're shitting me.

248
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:45,809
Guess you don't know
who you're dealing with.

249
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,812
Damn cops.

250
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:51,523
What do you expect...

251
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,193
Anyway...

252
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,035
You son of a bitch!

253
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:49,289
Bastard!

254
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,581
What the hell?

255
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:23,753
The bastard's a complete psycho.

256
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,770
Shit!

257
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:35,575
Oh, fuck...

258
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:13,488
Don't know where you're headed,
but you can hop in.

259
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,409
You don't want a ride?
There won't be other cars.

260
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:24,123
Why are you
all the way out here alone?

261
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:30,463
You're pretty lucky, Mister.
Catching a cab out here.

262
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,758
It's on the way
for the man in the back.

263
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,635
You don't mind, right?

264
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,512
Of course not.

265
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,281
It must've been hard
to get a cab here.

266
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,451
Cars hardly ever go by here.

267
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:06,707
I don't come here much.
Just for work.

268
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,587
You're really lucky, Mister.

269
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:14,048
Did ya hear?

270
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:17,927
Strange things have been
happening around here.

271
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:21,222
So there aren't
any passengers out at nights.

272
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,724
But I have two tonight.

273
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:29,689
Looks like I'm lucky, too.
Right, Mister?

274
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:40,032
Way out here
in the dark night.

275
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,966
What, Mister?

276
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,094
What's so funny?

277
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,096
Mister?

278
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,015
Yes?

279
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:09,812
You said we're all lucky, right?

280
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,025
Yeah, I did.

281
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,693
So?

282
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,947
The way I see it...

283
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,910
I think you're damn unlucky.

284
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:52,206
Crazy bastards.

285
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:32,973
You're young.
It'll heal fast.

286
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,851
And soccer...

287
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:39,438
Don't play so rough
that you break your wrists, okay?

288
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,651
Who plays soccer with
their wrists anyway?

289
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:47,363
Go easy, son. Got it?

290
01:02:53,602 --> 01:02:56,122
Get going now.

291
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,836
Hey, shithead.

292
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,508
I ain't your son!

293
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,638
Shit.
Watch the way you talk!

294
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,688
Take off your glasses!

295
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,025
Take 'em off!

296
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,031
Shit!

297
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,283
Come here, you!

298
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,493
Come here!

299
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,704
Excuse me?

300
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,040
Please come and get
your prescription.

301
01:03:55,873 --> 01:04:00,227
Damn old folks always
talking down to people!

302
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,897
I'll rip your mouth off!

303
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,364
Watch yourself.

304
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,579
How old are you?

305
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,250
Twenty-two.

306
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,629
Nice and young.

307
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:29,256
Got a boyfriend?

308
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,842
Excuse me?

309
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:35,554
Bet you have many, huh?

310
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,893
Ah... no. I don't.

311
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,646
You fuckin' playing with me?

312
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,609
A pretty girl like you
without a boyfriend?

313
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,533
You don't know how to do it?

314
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,495
Excuse me?

315
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,122
If you don't, you don't.

316
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,283
Actually...

317
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:22,745
I was about to have
a good time last night.

318
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:28,208
But some bastard
came and ruined everything.

319
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,632
So...

320
01:06:34,698 --> 01:06:37,259
let's make this easy.

321
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,414
Take it off.

322
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,875
What?

323
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:17,132
Strip.

324
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,554
Try and enjoy it.

325
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,809
So, take it off.

326
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:49,289
Strip before I cut up
your face, bitch!

327
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,339
Strip now, bitch!

328
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:51,185
That's it.

329
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,904
Take off your bra.
Hurry.

330
01:09:14,274 --> 01:09:17,377
Please...

331
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:34,144
<i>Good.
Take off your skirt.</i>

332
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:11,033
You son of a bitch!

333
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,785
Who the fuck are you?

334
01:11:48,428 --> 01:11:50,822
You bastard!

335
01:12:09,157 --> 01:12:10,717
Wait!

336
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:14,763
Stay here.
He'll need to be treated.

337
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:21,603
Don't act so weak.
This is just the beginning.

338
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:26,024
Remember...

339
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,987
your nightmare's
only getting worse.

340
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,327
Close your eyes, Miss!

341
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:39,746
Look away and plug your ears.

342
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:19,179
Son of a bitch!

343
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:53,588
Damn motherfucker!
You wanna die?

344
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:04,766
You wanna fight me, huh?

345
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,894
<i>Damn son of a bitch!</i>

346
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:10,188
Motherfucker.

347
01:15:11,214 --> 01:15:15,944
Fine! Let's see who's the bitch here!
You bastard!

348
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:30,560
What happened, sir?

349
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,899
Did you have an accident?

350
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:48,703
His car must've stalled.

351
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,597
Damn dogs.

352
01:17:49,664 --> 01:17:51,474
Always going wild...

353
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,687
at the smell of blood.

354
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,597
Yes, sir.

355
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:33,975
Is everything okay?

356
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:41,649
Just worried that's all.

357
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:48,948
The police think
I'm chasing after Jang.

358
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:53,995
<i>The cops are after him
themselves as well.</i>

359
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,290
<i>I was thinking...</i>

360
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:05,757
How about dropping it now?

361
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:09,552
- Sir...
<i>- You've done enough.</i>

362
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,389
I want you to stop.

363
01:19:12,455 --> 01:19:13,973
But, sir...

364
01:19:26,177 --> 01:19:28,488
Forget it.

365
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:31,574
Talk to you later.

366
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:35,954
It's me. Se-yeon.

367
01:19:37,605 --> 01:19:42,001
<i>- Soo-hyun.</i>
- Hi, how are you?

368
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:44,003
Good.
How are you?

369
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:48,007
Well, just busy
working on something.

370
01:19:48,908 --> 01:19:51,594
Really?
What kind of work?

371
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:55,598
You know what I do.

372
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:59,519
<i>I'm asking about
what we don't know.</i>

373
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:02,939
<i>Dad gave you
the police files, right?</i>

374
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:05,733
<i>Soo-hyun?</i>

375
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:10,155
I know how you feel,
but I hope you'll stop.

376
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:13,867
It won't bring her back.

377
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:21,666
<i>Whatever you do to punish him,
things won't change.</i>

378
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:26,045
<i>Revenge is for movies.</i>

379
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,339
<i>That bastard's a psycho.</i>

380
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:33,553
Sorry. I have nothing
to say to you.

381
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,264
How come?

382
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,766
We're practically family.

383
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,812
You know how I am
these days?

384
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:48,443
I keep looking back,
thinking I'm being followed.

385
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,531
And you have nothing to say?

386
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:03,208
So, please.

387
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:07,086
This is pointless.
Please drop it.

388
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,424
Sorry, I'd better go.

389
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:15,929
And this is not pointless.

390
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,140
<i>Soo-hyun!</i>

391
01:22:15,763 --> 01:22:17,115
Water!

392
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,658
Get me water!

393
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,846
Aren't you sick of it?

394
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:44,434
Try it.

395
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:45,643
You can't get sick of it.

396
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,733
Once you taste this,

397
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,030
you can't eat any other meat.

398
01:22:57,096 --> 01:22:59,699
Crazy bastard.

399
01:23:06,981 --> 01:23:09,250
What did you just say?

400
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:18,593
Why you little...

401
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:23,681
Gone insane from
eating human flesh?

402
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:28,353
Wake up!
I'm Jang Kyung-chul!

403
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:52,960
Yeah, I must be damn crazy.

404
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:56,297
This meat's so good,
I lost my mind.

405
01:24:01,452 --> 01:24:05,348
Why do I cry when I get tense?

406
01:24:10,044 --> 01:24:12,146
Crazy bastard.

407
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:21,447
Remember when we first met?

408
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:28,204
Trying to form a militant group
to fuck over the world!

409
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:34,460
Those were the days.

410
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:37,505
We weren't afraid of anything!

411
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:41,300
Cut the bullshit
and give me a cigarette.

412
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:18,796
Bet he's a family member
of a bitch you killed.

413
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:20,798
If not, he's some total maniac.

414
01:25:27,163 --> 01:25:29,307
He's our kind.

415
01:25:30,249 --> 01:25:34,145
He's enjoying the excitement
of the hunt.

416
01:25:36,422 --> 01:25:41,819
Catching and letting go
of the prey.

417
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:43,571
He's playing the hunter.

418
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:46,866
He relishes torturing his prey.

419
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:50,077
Man...

420
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:55,792
I think you're screwed this time.

421
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:04,425
<i>The bastard must've gone crazy
after losing his bitch.</i>

422
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:09,931
You've created a monster.
How interesting.

423
01:26:28,891 --> 01:26:32,286
Get some sleep.
We've got plenty of rooms.

424
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:35,498
You can sleep anywhere.

425
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:40,628
I'll go prep my next meal.

426
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,648
Damn bastards.

427
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:16,289
<i>He's enjoying the excitement
of the hunt.</i>

428
01:27:16,355 --> 01:27:20,293
<i>Catching and letting go
of the prey.</i>

429
01:27:20,359 --> 01:27:23,004
<i>He relishes torturing his prey.</i>

430
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:29,176
<i>He's playing the hunter.</i>

431
01:27:29,243 --> 01:27:31,804
<i>Your nightmare's
only getting worse.</i>

432
01:27:42,882 --> 01:27:45,443
Amusing...

433
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,582
Now...

434
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,918
I used up all the guts?

435
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:08,174
Not here, either?

436
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,509
Then...

437
01:28:31,305 --> 01:28:33,240
Shit.

438
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:19,870
Come on.

439
01:29:21,272 --> 01:29:26,377
Didn't you see your sister?

440
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:31,590
If you fight it,
it'll be more painful.

441
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:39,849
I'll end it quickly for ya.

442
01:29:42,835 --> 01:29:46,897
So why be suspicious of us?

443
01:29:46,964 --> 01:29:50,317
We didn't ask for money
or the house!

444
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:53,654
Couldn't let us in, huh?

445
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:55,906
I'm sorry.

446
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,451
I'm really sorry!

447
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:06,959
Should've apologized
a long time ago.

448
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:10,755
Damn bitches.

449
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:15,801
Always acting up
when it's too late.

450
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:18,345
Wait.

451
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:21,015
Hands, feet,
then head, was it?

452
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:26,479
Close your eyes.
Better not to look.

453
01:31:27,606 --> 01:31:30,501
Where the hell?

454
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:41,762
How'd you come in
without making a sound?

455
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,632
<i>I'm... pregnant.</i>

456
01:32:22,995 --> 01:32:26,807
I was wondering about you.

457
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:30,352
You don't look like a monster.

458
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,773
Sick bastard.

459
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,928
Hands, feet, then head.
Right?

460
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:48,764
Just like you did.

461
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:51,225
Nothing more, nothing less.

462
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:54,979
You sick psychos!

463
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:54,718
Son of a bitch.

464
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:18,951
Why? Why? Why?

465
01:38:25,357 --> 01:38:28,210
Why, why...

466
01:38:29,862 --> 01:38:31,964
Why...

467
01:40:06,124 --> 01:40:08,810
I'm actually relieved.

468
01:40:08,877 --> 01:40:12,064
You had me worried sick
about you.

469
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,069
It's secret agent
Kim Soo-hyun, right?

470
01:40:18,303 --> 01:40:21,573
Want me to show you
what he's been up to?

471
01:40:27,771 --> 01:40:30,207
Make him stop.

472
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:33,210
He can't become a monster
to fight the monster.

473
01:40:36,613 --> 01:40:39,466
You know that's wrong.

474
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:43,303
Where is he now?

475
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:47,099
Your wounds are treated.
You'll be okay.

476
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,815
You and that bastard
were out for two days.

477
01:40:57,551 --> 01:40:59,778
What happened?

478
01:41:01,763 --> 01:41:04,157
Sir?

479
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:06,118
Hand the bastard over.

480
01:41:09,187 --> 01:41:10,789
I'm far from done.

481
01:41:10,856 --> 01:41:12,999
What are you going to do?

482
01:41:14,901 --> 01:41:17,170
You know...

483
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:22,300
It feels like a huge rock is
pressing down on my chest.

484
01:41:24,077 --> 01:41:26,346
Big and heavy.

485
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:36,273
I promised Ju-yeon that
I'd make him feel the same pain.

486
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:41,278
It's not over.

487
01:41:43,388 --> 01:41:46,032
Far from it.

488
01:41:48,393 --> 01:41:51,872
Okay, no more questions.

489
01:41:51,938 --> 01:41:54,249
By the way,
how's the capsule working?

490
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:57,002
Unless he has diarrhea...

491
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:06,344
Don't worry.
The bastard's completely out.

492
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:09,431
He'll be out
for another day at least.

493
01:42:18,256 --> 01:42:19,858
Sir?

494
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:22,444
You've changed a lot,
you know?

495
01:43:57,355 --> 01:43:58,915
Hello.

496
01:43:58,982 --> 01:44:01,418
Pain killers, please.
With dexibuprofen.

497
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:03,879
Dexi what, sir?

498
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,757
- Just give me the strongest kind.
- Sure.

499
01:44:10,827 --> 01:44:14,681
<i>Where are you?
Guess you aren't around.</i>

500
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:17,809
Are you listening?

501
01:44:17,876 --> 01:44:20,562
Of course you are.

502
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:27,402
It's been a blast.
Totally unexpected fun.

503
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:31,489
You!

504
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:34,743
<i>Want me to guess
who you are?</i>

505
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:38,997
<i>Your bitch was Ju-yeon?
From Yeon-hee-dong, right?</i>

506
01:44:39,898 --> 01:44:42,918
You hear me?

507
01:44:42,984 --> 01:44:45,879
<i>But, you made a mistake.</i>

508
01:44:47,739 --> 01:44:50,175
You took me for granted.

509
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:54,095
You'll regret not killing me.

510
01:44:54,162 --> 01:44:55,931
I'll get you soon.

511
01:44:55,997 --> 01:44:57,557
Hello, there.

512
01:44:57,624 --> 01:45:02,520
Wait.
I'll show you what real pain is!

513
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:06,524
What are you doing!

514
01:45:06,591 --> 01:45:08,568
Hey, you!

515
01:45:11,304 --> 01:45:12,864
By the way...

516
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:16,576
before she died, she said...

517
01:45:16,643 --> 01:45:18,620
that she was pregnant.

518
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:22,290
<i>Begged for her life.</i>

519
01:45:25,318 --> 01:45:27,587
<i>Did you know?</i>

520
01:45:36,162 --> 01:45:40,850
Go! Go! Get here quick!
Or the man I left inside is dead!

521
01:45:42,627 --> 01:45:45,563
Should keep close range
when hunting me.

522
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:16,404
What the hell!

523
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:31,229
Where have you gone?

524
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:59,382
Do we have to do all this
to save bastards like them?

525
01:49:00,825 --> 01:49:05,180
Seeing scum like them
makes me sorry to be human.

526
01:49:05,246 --> 01:49:07,682
Call me when they wake up.

527
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:17,525
What is it this time?

528
01:49:17,592 --> 01:49:20,320
Yeah. What is it?

529
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,324
What?

530
01:49:25,683 --> 01:49:27,994
Are you sure?

531
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:31,831
Okay.

532
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:35,460
Hey.

533
01:49:35,527 --> 01:49:37,378
Jang Kyung-chul is
turning himself in.

534
01:49:37,445 --> 01:49:39,756
You made a damn mistake fool!

535
01:50:34,043 --> 01:50:35,853
Wake up.

536
01:50:46,389 --> 01:50:49,033
I have a question.

537
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:51,995
Where might our friend be?

538
01:51:03,948 --> 01:51:09,804
You ticked off the wrong guy.

539
01:51:10,747 --> 01:51:15,810
He always gets even.

540
01:51:15,877 --> 01:51:17,770
Know what that means?

541
01:51:22,842 --> 01:51:27,447
First your girl, then her family.

542
01:51:31,851 --> 01:51:36,706
Then he'll give himself up
to the cops.

543
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:41,878
But...

544
01:51:43,446 --> 01:51:46,549
your woman didn't have it
all that bad.

545
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:55,016
Unlike me, Jang likes to give
pleasure before pain.

546
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:01,689
He gives pleasure first.
Get it?

547
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:08,112
Funny?

548
01:52:09,013 --> 01:52:12,075
That's funny?

549
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:15,536
You think it's funny?

550
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:27,715
I'll give you
a permanent smiley face!

551
01:52:35,957 --> 01:52:38,309
<i>I traced Jang's call.</i>

552
01:52:38,376 --> 01:52:42,188
<i>I was tapping the cops
investigating Jang.</i>

553
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:45,983
<i>Jang just called them.
Said he'll turn himself in today.</i>

554
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:51,948
<i>He says he's doing something first.
What if he fucks up again?</i>

555
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:53,616
Where's he located?

556
01:52:53,683 --> 01:52:54,826
<i>Yeon-hee-dong.</i>

557
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:21,394
Parcel delivery!

558
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:44,584
Is this Captain Oh?

559
01:53:45,985 --> 01:53:47,545
I'm Kim Soo-hyun.

560
01:53:47,612 --> 01:53:50,047
What?

561
01:53:50,114 --> 01:53:54,135
What the hell have you done?

562
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:58,890
If something happens to him,
I'll kill you!

563
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:01,559
Got that, you bastard?

564
01:54:06,255 --> 01:54:09,317
Send the closest men
to the Chief's house now!

565
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:12,570
Turn the car around!

566
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:16,068
Not much resemblance.

567
01:56:16,135 --> 01:56:19,405
Ju-yeon must've taken after
her mom.

568
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:22,700
Good thing
she doesn't look like you.

569
01:56:28,105 --> 01:56:31,375
Why'd you come at me like that?
Old bastard!

570
01:56:31,442 --> 01:56:34,462
You crazy? Huh?

571
01:56:36,656 --> 01:56:40,885
Wait a minute.
Where did I put it?

572
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:48,434
What should I do
to make that bastard flip?

573
01:56:48,501 --> 01:56:51,312
Will this do the trick?
Like this?

574
01:56:52,213 --> 01:56:55,983
And this! And this!

575
01:56:57,343 --> 01:57:00,404
Like this? Fuck.

576
01:57:57,820 --> 01:58:00,089
Dad?

577
01:58:01,490 --> 01:58:03,759
I'm home.

578
01:58:55,252 --> 01:58:56,771
- What's going on?
- Stay back.

579
01:58:56,837 --> 01:58:58,439
Back away, please!

580
01:58:58,506 --> 01:59:00,733
- Stay back.
- What happened?

581
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,194
You can't come in, sir.

582
01:59:09,558 --> 01:59:11,160
Who the hell?

583
01:59:13,562 --> 01:59:17,500
What is it? Step aside.

584
01:59:19,026 --> 01:59:21,629
You're Kim Soo-hyun?

585
01:59:26,659 --> 01:59:29,178
You stupid son of a bitch!

586
01:59:29,245 --> 01:59:34,767
You know what you did?
How dare you come here!

587
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:37,353
Damn piece of shit.

588
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:40,648
Back off. Let go!

589
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:47,321
Damn son of a bitch.

590
01:59:51,392 --> 01:59:54,912
Step aside. Move!

591
02:01:30,241 --> 02:01:31,383
Hello?

592
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:33,677
Jang Kyung-chul here.

593
02:01:34,662 --> 02:01:36,847
You bastard!

594
02:01:38,916 --> 02:01:41,852
Where the hell are you?

595
02:01:41,919 --> 02:01:45,272
You didn't hurt Se-yeon
did you?

596
02:01:45,339 --> 02:01:48,525
<i>You'll find out later.</i>

597
02:01:53,013 --> 02:01:55,491
What?

598
02:02:02,606 --> 02:02:04,708
Take this.

599
02:02:20,291 --> 02:02:22,476
Hello?

600
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,612
So?
How does it feel?

601
02:02:34,513 --> 02:02:39,618
You shouldn't have fucked with me!
You piece of shit!

602
02:02:40,519 --> 02:02:43,414
Who do you think won?

603
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:46,041
You think you won?
Or me?

604
02:04:13,737 --> 02:04:16,340
Jang Kyung-chul!

605
02:04:16,407 --> 02:04:18,634
Sir! It's Jang!

606
02:04:18,701 --> 02:04:20,844
Wait! Not now!

607
02:05:23,724 --> 02:05:25,200
Search the car!

608
02:05:29,813 --> 02:05:31,748
What's that car?

609
02:05:34,318 --> 02:05:35,669
What the hell!

610
02:05:35,736 --> 02:05:37,504
Stop that car!

611
02:05:41,575 --> 02:05:42,801
Stop it now!

612
02:05:52,878 --> 02:05:54,605
Get him!

613
02:05:58,759 --> 02:06:00,444
Catch him!

614
02:06:00,511 --> 02:06:01,987
Get him!

615
02:07:08,829 --> 02:07:11,265
Okay, you're right.

616
02:07:13,709 --> 02:07:16,019
I made a mistake.

617
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:25,654
I underestimated you.

618
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:42,921
I'll treat you right
from now on.

619
02:07:49,161 --> 02:07:51,305
You son of a bitch!

620
02:07:51,371 --> 02:07:54,599
What the hell are you doing?

621
02:07:56,501 --> 02:08:00,063
Come on.
I'm just getting started.

622
02:08:03,884 --> 02:08:08,572
Kill me!
You son of a bitch!

623
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:10,532
Kill me, now!

624
02:08:10,599 --> 02:08:12,743
You son of a bitch!

625
02:08:12,809 --> 02:08:18,707
Hurry up and kill me!
You bastard!

626
02:08:18,774 --> 02:08:20,917
Kill me now!

627
02:08:28,992 --> 02:08:32,763
Not yet.
It won't be long.

628
02:08:36,416 --> 02:08:40,604
If it was that easy,
I would've killed you already.

629
02:08:43,382 --> 02:08:47,110
I'll kill you at your most
painful moment.

630
02:08:48,595 --> 02:08:54,284
When you most tremble
in pain and fear,

631
02:08:54,351 --> 02:08:56,119
I'll kill you then!

632
02:08:59,982 --> 02:09:04,544
Because only that
will be real revenge.

633
02:09:06,071 --> 02:09:08,590
True revenge.

634
02:09:19,084 --> 02:09:23,355
Let me live. Please?

635
02:09:23,422 --> 02:09:26,149
Don't kill me.

636
02:09:26,216 --> 02:09:29,194
Please...

637
02:09:34,558 --> 02:09:39,454
Heard that many times, haven't you?
People begging for their lives.

638
02:09:44,318 --> 02:09:46,711
You enjoyed that, huh?

639
02:09:47,738 --> 02:09:52,175
Don't kill me, please.

640
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:04,062
I'll pay for my sins.

641
02:10:07,632 --> 02:10:09,693
So...

642
02:10:11,595 --> 02:10:18,118
Let me go, please.

643
02:10:20,145 --> 02:10:25,125
Haven't you done enough?

644
02:10:26,026 --> 02:10:28,587
Please, don't kill me.

645
02:10:47,839 --> 02:10:50,650
I'm so sorry.

646
02:11:02,813 --> 02:11:06,166
I beg you.

647
02:11:19,204 --> 02:11:21,473
Are you scared?

648
02:11:26,253 --> 02:11:29,940
Say it.
You're scared?

649
02:11:35,303 --> 02:11:40,700
Do you realize now
what you've done?

650
02:12:03,832 --> 02:12:08,520
Stop fucking around with me!

651
02:12:08,587 --> 02:12:12,023
You son of a bitch!

652
02:12:17,095 --> 02:12:19,489
Hey.

653
02:12:19,556 --> 02:12:23,326
Cut the bullshit.

654
02:12:25,604 --> 02:12:28,498
You already lost.

655
02:12:31,193 --> 02:12:34,921
You think you got to me?

656
02:12:34,988 --> 02:12:37,257
Huh?

657
02:12:37,324 --> 02:12:41,511
Fuck you.

658
02:12:43,788 --> 02:12:48,643
I don't know what pain is.

659
02:12:49,586 --> 02:12:54,274
Fear?
Don't know that, either.

660
02:12:56,843 --> 02:13:02,532
There's nothing
you can get from me.

661
02:13:09,898 --> 02:13:12,292
So...

662
02:13:13,235 --> 02:13:15,795
You already lost.

663
02:13:18,907 --> 02:13:21,176
Got that?

664
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:52,749
I hope...

665
02:13:54,276 --> 02:13:57,796
that you suffer even after you die.

666
02:15:44,844 --> 02:15:50,700
Son of a bitch!
You hear me?

667
02:15:50,767 --> 02:15:58,750
You shit! It ain't over.
I'll live no matter what!

668
02:15:58,817 --> 02:16:02,462
You hear me, shithead?

669
02:16:02,529 --> 02:16:05,924
I'm not scared!

670
02:16:09,285 --> 02:16:13,097
You think you can fuck with me?

671
02:16:20,547 --> 02:16:23,024
<i>Dad?</i>

672
02:16:24,008 --> 02:16:26,277
<i>Dad?</i>

673
02:16:28,930 --> 02:16:30,698
Hey!

674
02:16:30,765 --> 02:16:34,118
Don't open the door!

675
02:16:34,185 --> 02:16:36,538
Dad?

676
02:16:41,818 --> 02:16:44,546
Don't open the door!

677
02:16:44,612 --> 02:16:46,130
Sang-won!

678
02:16:46,197 --> 02:16:47,674
Don't come in!

679
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:50,343
What the hell is he saying?

680
02:16:52,704 --> 02:16:54,973
Don't open it!

681
02:16:57,083 --> 02:16:59,018
It's stuck.

682
02:16:59,085 --> 02:17:02,564
No! Why the hell
are the old folks here?

683
02:17:02,630 --> 02:17:05,108
- Kyung-chul!
- Mom!

684
02:17:05,175 --> 02:17:06,609
- Are you in there?
- No, Mom!

685
02:17:06,676 --> 02:17:13,992
Don't open the door!
Shit! Get away!

686
02:17:44,839 --> 02:17:47,317
Kyung-chul!
