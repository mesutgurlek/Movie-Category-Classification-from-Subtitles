1
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:27,025
Only a few days left.

2
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:30,113
Tickets are running out
for the big New Year's dance...

3
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:58,020
Hey, how can I help you?

4
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:03,817
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

5
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:05,820
How can I help you?

6
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:35,020
And this one goes... where?

7
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,731
Very well.

8
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:41,026
Now it has a face.
Well, you go next.

9
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:22,365
You still have this one.

10
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:25,327
Sort it out.
By size and...

11
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:40,928
If you anger them it's worse...
it's worse, Aurora.

12
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,986
Are you looking
for anything in particular?

13
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,095
it's not my money.

14
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:56,189
I'll wrap it up for you.

15
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,604
Do you want any?

16
00:15:31,604 --> 00:15:32,814
Yes?

17
00:15:32,814 --> 00:15:34,315
No?

18
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:35,692
Yes.

19
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,413
- Sure.
- Yours too.

20
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:04,933
- How about this one?
- No.

21
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:14,403
- Which one?
- That one.

22
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:17,406
You too? Yes?

23
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:33,007
A little gift,
thank you.

24
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:35,427
Thank you both.

25
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,137
Good luck.

26
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:43,728
No, honey,
it's not chocolate.

27
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:49,526
Something like this
just happens once in a lifetime.

28
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:53,322
Once in a lifetime.

29
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,814
Well...

30
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,816
nothing happens.

31
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:31,615
Look, how curious.

32
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,120
What do you think it could be?

33
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,539
A toy?

34
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:01,149
Don't get close to it.

35
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:13,747
Don't get scared.

36
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:16,834
Bring me a box.

37
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:31,017
Now, watch carefully,
this is seven by four.

38
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:33,353
We'll start with this leg,
Manuelito.

39
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:44,531
One, two, three, four.

40
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:46,534
- Don't push, Manuelito.
- Sorry, ma'am.

41
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:47,744
And...

42
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:53,542
Now comes the finale.

43
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,524
Good evening.

44
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:20,447
Where did you say you fell?

45
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,034
Over some broken glass.

46
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:26,746
You won't need any stitches.

47
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:28,624
Blood is so messy.

48
00:19:28,624 --> 00:19:31,252
Remember when
Aunt Marge died?

49
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:34,839
Everyone was soaked in blood
and she was spotless.

50
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,426
But really dead.

51
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,635
There's something here.

52
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,762
It's going to hurt.

53
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,141
Good thing you warned me.

54
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,559
Almost.

55
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,355
It was buried deep.

56
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,066
What is it?

57
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,445
I don't know,
some sort of metal shaving.

58
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:57,657
No, it's more like a sting...

59
00:19:57,657 --> 00:20:00,160
from a bee, I don't know.

60
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:24,767
Please, please, please.

61
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:27,688
Be very careful
with my soul, please.

62
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:45,166
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

63
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,462
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

64
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:50,464
Give us this day our daily bread...

65
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:25,196
I'm fine, honey.

66
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:28,784
I'm all right.

67
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:38,211
I'm all right.

68
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:18,715
- I'm reading.
- There's too much light.

69
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:22,720
It's amazing, look.

70
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,517
Nena Vizcalna
died at 92.

71
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:33,023
Do you like it?

72
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,822
- No.
- You look...

73
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:42,410
different, much younger.

74
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,788
Exactly, that's why I did it.
That's how I feel.

75
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,794
Where's Aurora?

76
00:26:50,794 --> 00:26:54,423
- You don't eat breakfast?
- I'm not hungry.

77
00:26:54,423 --> 00:26:57,510
Hey, do you like it or not?

78
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,595
- Yes, I do like it.
- Well...

79
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:01,806
that's really nice.

80
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,747
Hello, Mr. Gris...

81
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:51,041
How are you?

82
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,544
You...
destroyed my store.

83
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:16,444
You don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

84
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:29,835
Almost 40 years ago...

85
00:30:29,835 --> 00:30:32,255
I found this manuscript.

86
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:34,424
40 years ago.

87
00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:38,636
They are the notes,
the hermetic annotations

88
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,849
of a 16th century alchemist.

89
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,354
It's a fascinating book

90
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:49,732
written backwards in Latin.

91
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:54,655
It talks about
a peculiar mechanism,

92
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:59,243
an invention that extends
its user's life.

93
00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:02,330
But it has rules,
precise rules,

94
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,834
very strict,
on how to use it.

95
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:14,260
An insect?

96
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,138
That's the master stroke.

97
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:19,767
The insect is trapped
inside the invention.

98
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:23,730
Like a sort of...
living filter.

99
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,358
You believe it?
I mean, after so many years.

100
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,743
Who says insects aren't

101
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:38,872
God's favorite creatures?

102
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:41,249
Christ walked on water,

103
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:43,251
just like a mosquito.

104
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:46,255
The resurrection concept

105
00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:48,841
is not foreign to ants,

106
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,635
or to spiders.

107
00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:55,057
They could survive inside a rock
for hundreds of years...

108
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:57,559
until someone comes along
and sets them free.

109
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,437
Sure.

110
00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:03,441
It's very educational, but I don't
see why you're telling me this.

111
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:17,374
I'm dying, Mr. Gris.

112
00:32:19,877 --> 00:32:22,463
I'm going to show you something.

113
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:25,967
The scalpel has been
eating me alive,

114
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:27,970
little by little.

115
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,975
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
psychotherapy...

116
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:36,479
Look closely,
my friend,

117
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:40,442
half of my body is here,
inside this display case.

118
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,654
And the other half...

119
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:47,450
it's already in the menu.

120
00:32:48,577 --> 00:32:52,956
Or it's being chewed
as we speak.

121
00:32:52,956 --> 00:32:55,375
No. It's mine.

122
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,462
You used it?

123
00:32:57,462 --> 00:32:59,881
You used it?

124
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,883
Just by accident.

125
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:04,178
What an imbecile.

126
00:33:40,677 --> 00:33:43,889
We both lose something.

127
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,079
This can't be possible.

128
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,085
It can't be possible, damn it.

129
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:55,095
Aurora, my God.

130
00:35:26,088 --> 00:35:28,383
I know you've got it.

131
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:16,104
Are you scared?

132
00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:21,986
You think something
will happen to me?

133
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:27,909
Are you comfortable back there?

134
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,501
It already happened to me once,
with your dad.

135
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:43,177
You remember him,
at least a little?

136
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:44,887
Yes...

137
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:47,891
I believe you do.

138
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:49,809
When he was your age,

139
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:52,312
he heard something or someone
speak about those

140
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:54,398
who die of lung cancer.

141
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:00,488
So, when I came back
from work,

142
00:37:00,488 --> 00:37:03,783
I found out that my cigarettes
had disappeared.

143
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:07,412
After searching all day,
I get in the bathroom

144
00:37:07,412 --> 00:37:10,917
and I find a bunch
of little bits of tobacco,

145
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:12,919
floating in the toilet.

146
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:14,921
Just bits.

147
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:19,092
I think he understood
that breaking my cigars

148
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:22,012
didn't help the matter at all.

149
00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:26,184
But at least it made it clear to me
that he was worried.

150
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:30,397
And it made it clear to him
that it made it clear to me.

151
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:38,198
You know...

152
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:46,290
I don't know
what's happening to me.

153
00:37:49,418 --> 00:37:52,422
But I think it's better
if we stay together.

154
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:02,001
- I need you to help me.
- Just a minute.

155
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:06,215
Hurry, honey,
we'll be late.

156
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:21,607
Who are you, little one?

157
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:23,609
A god?

158
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,331
You're so good to me.

159
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:43,841
Woman: I don't understand why
I can't zip up this dress,

160
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:46,718
it's the same one I wore
at last year's dance.

161
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,805
I'm almost done.

162
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:52,308
How could I change so much
in such a short time?

163
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:49,749
Remember this?

164
00:40:52,044 --> 00:40:54,338
If I remember?

165
00:40:54,338 --> 00:40:59,552
No, I can't accept it's all over

166
00:40:59,552 --> 00:41:02,347
That life set us apart...

167
00:41:02,347 --> 00:41:04,641
If I remember?

168
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:07,353
I always think about
the first time I saw you,

169
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:09,855
how I thought you would never
pay attention to me.

170
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:12,024
I felt like
such a nobody that...

171
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,941
Man: That's what architects
call "vectors."

172
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:54,239
It's the little things that support
the big things.

173
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,161
- How are they supported?
- The fact is that the pillars...

174
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:00,955
- Teacher, can you see...?
- In a minute, Manuel.

175
00:42:00,955 --> 00:42:02,832
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

176
00:42:02,832 --> 00:42:04,543
- Cheers.
- Money and love.

177
00:42:04,543 --> 00:42:05,836
Cheers.

178
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:29,446
- What's wrong?
- Eh?

179
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,657
- Is something wrong?
- No, I'll be right back.

180
00:42:32,657 --> 00:42:35,453
- Where are you going?
- I'll get something to drink.

181
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,669
It's the heat.

182
00:43:18,669 --> 00:43:21,255
It happens to me all the time.

183
00:43:21,255 --> 00:43:24,259
- Is it better?
- Yeah.

184
00:43:50,872 --> 00:43:53,250
Every time I drink,
I have to pee.

185
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:57,379
...since I was a kid.

186
00:43:57,379 --> 00:44:00,466
What a decadent party, damn it.

187
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:04,345
Let's see, let's see...
fuck this.

188
00:44:04,345 --> 00:44:06,849
Look at what they've done here.

189
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:09,059
It must have been
an Argentinean gate crasher

190
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:11,061
or some Peruvian on the loose.

191
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:12,479
Motherfucker.

192
00:44:12,479 --> 00:44:17,152
I'm working my ass off
all year for a party...

193
00:44:17,152 --> 00:44:19,279
Let's go.

194
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:41,066
- How beautiful...
- We're dead...

195
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:09,974
He never told you?

196
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:30,372
He thinks that will help him
to extend his life.

197
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:51,396
Do whatever you have to do,
but leave me alone.

198
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,311
How quiet.

199
00:50:19,898 --> 00:50:22,818
All this blood, my God.

200
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:26,322
All this blood is mine.

201
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:30,702
I'm dying.

202
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,705
How weird.

203
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,418
Everything is upside down

204
00:50:37,418 --> 00:50:40,213
and I'm dying...

205
00:50:41,214 --> 00:50:43,132
alone.

206
00:50:44,134 --> 00:50:45,928
Alone.

207
00:50:45,928 --> 00:50:48,639
Don't let me die today.

208
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:51,518
Oh, it hurts so bad.

209
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:55,438
I can resist a lot longer...

210
00:50:55,438 --> 00:50:57,107
a lot longer.

211
00:51:01,112 --> 00:51:03,823
Oh, Aurora.

212
00:52:23,455 --> 00:52:26,125
Great, Tito.

213
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:27,835
Great.

214
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:31,840
The forehead is coming out perfect.

215
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,052
Like nothing ever happened.

216
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,141
- It's your best work.
- You bet.

217
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:42,227
It has its secrets.

218
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:44,437
Here I'm giving form...

219
00:52:44,437 --> 00:52:46,440
texture...

220
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,734
I'm giving it color...

221
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,659
They think I'm a fucking artist.

222
00:52:56,743 --> 00:52:58,829
Yeah...

223
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:02,458
but don't work on it too hard,
we're going to cremate him.

224
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:05,044
What?

225
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:07,840
Motherfucker,
what do you mean "cremate him"?

226
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:12,553
You should have told me. I wouldn't
have dolled him up, fucker.

227
00:53:12,553 --> 00:53:14,555
God, rest in peace.

228
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,725
It seems no one
respects my work here.

229
00:53:16,725 --> 00:53:20,061
Why don't they tell me?
You, why didn't you tell me?

230
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:23,232
- Huh?
- The widow changed her mind.

231
00:53:25,234 --> 00:53:27,737
It seems the guy didn't have
anything prepared.

232
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:30,866
No tomb, no grave, nothing.

233
00:53:30,866 --> 00:53:32,326
They're all the same.

234
00:53:32,326 --> 00:53:34,745
Eternal, the fuckers.

235
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,753
Look at you...

236
00:56:46,255 --> 00:56:49,383
Was the wake fun?

237
00:56:52,387 --> 00:56:54,764
You're not going
to heaven like that, right?

238
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:57,684
Naked...
kisses everywhere,

239
00:56:57,684 --> 00:57:00,396
they'll know you were out
fucking around.

240
00:58:42,387 --> 00:58:44,097
Come on, compadre.

241
00:59:03,995 --> 00:59:06,205
...15 minutes ago.

242
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:08,082
Come in, this is your house.

243
00:59:11,003 --> 00:59:14,381
Tito,
Mr. De la Guardia is...

244
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:17,010
was a friend of the deceased.

245
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:19,387
He wants to see the body...

246
00:59:19,387 --> 00:59:21,514
one last time.

247
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,314
Sure,

248
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:31,109
medium or well done?

249
00:59:51,006 --> 00:59:52,801
- Ohh...

250
01:02:04,117 --> 01:02:06,536
Yeah?

251
01:04:06,756 --> 01:04:08,758
That's for me?

252
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:14,958
Dear Mercedes...

253
01:05:17,629 --> 01:05:21,132
I write this lines
with great difficulty.

254
01:05:23,344 --> 01:05:26,055
I want you to know that...

255
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,557
somehow,

256
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,936
someway,

257
01:05:30,936 --> 01:05:33,855
I'm still alive.

258
01:05:33,855 --> 01:05:36,358
And it hurts me to be alive.

259
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:40,446
The thirst is burning me,

260
01:05:40,446 --> 01:05:43,366
and I feel indifferent
about everything...

261
01:05:43,366 --> 01:05:46,537
the day...

262
01:05:46,537 --> 01:05:48,664
this house...

263
01:05:50,249 --> 01:05:52,252
and you.

264
01:05:54,754 --> 01:05:57,257
Aurora is staying with you,

265
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:59,050
she...

266
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,470
will leave you this letter.

267
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:05,266
By the time you read it...

268
01:06:05,266 --> 01:06:08,437
I would have been gone to settle
some kind of date,

269
01:06:08,437 --> 01:06:11,273
an unfinished business.

270
01:06:12,858 --> 01:06:17,071
Since I lost everything,
at least I want to understand why.

271
01:06:17,071 --> 01:06:19,157
Just today

272
01:06:19,157 --> 01:06:22,578
I realize how much I miss you.

273
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:24,872
I hope to see you
when I come back,

274
01:06:24,872 --> 01:06:27,458
and that you want to see me

275
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:30,378
no matter in what
kind of shape I am.

276
01:06:30,378 --> 01:06:32,255
Loves you...

277
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:34,466
Jesus.

278
01:07:42,585 --> 01:07:45,463
My God,
what are you doing here?

279
01:07:45,463 --> 01:07:48,759
I told you not to come.

280
01:07:48,759 --> 01:07:50,886
Put that away.

281
01:07:50,886 --> 01:07:53,681
Don't you see
they could kill us?

282
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:56,476
Don't you see we're in danger?

283
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:05,206
It works?

284
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,502
I knew you would return.

285
01:10:09,502 --> 01:10:13,007
If you're looking
for the missing pages,

286
01:10:13,007 --> 01:10:16,510
you're wasting your time.
I ate them.

287
01:10:19,097 --> 01:10:22,601
You talk about eternity,
look at me, look at my skin.

288
01:10:22,601 --> 01:10:24,978
It's decomposing,
it's falling off piece by piece.

289
01:10:28,608 --> 01:10:30,485
What are you talking about?

290
01:10:39,286 --> 01:10:41,414
Look.

291
01:11:13,909 --> 01:11:16,412
What's happening to me?

292
01:11:16,412 --> 01:11:18,623
You've been reborn.

293
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:38,396
You talk about insects,

294
01:11:38,396 --> 01:11:41,524
alchemists, artifacts.

295
01:11:41,524 --> 01:11:44,402
But what is it that I need?

296
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:49,324
Blood.

297
01:11:53,913 --> 01:11:55,915
Human?

298
01:12:07,512 --> 01:12:09,890
I can destroy the artifact,

299
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,725
pulverize it.

300
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,531
What do I care about eternity?

301
01:12:24,531 --> 01:12:27,409
I don't want to be eternal,
I just want to get out of this.

302
01:12:39,298 --> 01:12:41,926
I don't trust you.

303
01:12:51,312 --> 01:12:55,024
I don't see you have a choice.

304
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:03,117
Give me that, darling.
Come on, I know what I'm doing.

305
01:13:16,924 --> 01:13:18,801
You first.

306
01:13:18,801 --> 01:13:21,304
My way out.

307
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:13,113
My God, Aurora.

308
01:14:39,936 --> 01:14:42,814
Let's go now... let's go.

309
01:14:44,524 --> 01:14:46,652
Please.

310
01:18:58,187 --> 01:19:00,274
Go.

311
01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:01,984
Go...

312
01:20:09,894 --> 01:20:11,396
Come here.

313
01:20:15,275 --> 01:20:18,988
What the fuck
does it take to kill you?

314
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:21,366
You'll lose more than I will.

315
01:20:21,366 --> 01:20:24,369
Mine is only pain.

316
01:23:41,928 --> 01:23:44,013
Grandpa.

317
01:24:47,419 --> 01:24:50,422
I'm Jesus...

318
01:24:54,343 --> 01:24:56,304
Gris.

319
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:37,416

JOSEFINA CAMBEROS
