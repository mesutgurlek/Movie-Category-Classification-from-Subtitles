1
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:01,316
How beautifully dramatic.

2
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:06,083
The crudest, savage, exhibition
of nature at her worst, without,

3
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,001
and we three, we elegant three, within.

4
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,882
l should like to think that an irate Jehovah

5
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,118
was pointing those arrows
of lightning directly at my head.

6
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:21,565
The unbowed head of George Gordon,
Lord Byron, England's greatest sinner.

7
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,559
But l cannot flatter myself to that extent.

8
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:27,115
Possibly those thunders
are for our dear Shelley.

9
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,801
Heaven's applause
for England's greatest poet.

10
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:33,643
- What of my Mary?
- She is an angel.

11
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:36,799
- You think so?
- <i>(thunder)</i>

12
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:39,643
You hear?

13
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,161
Come, Mary. Come and watch the storm.

14
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,636
You know how lightning alarms me.

15
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:48,676
Shelley, darling, will you please
light these candles for me?

16
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,678
Mary, darling.

17
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,917
Astonishing creature.

18
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:57,205
- l, Lord Byron?
- Frightened of thunder, fearful of the dark.

19
00:02:57,287 --> 00:03:01,166
And yet you have written a tale
that sent my blood into icy creeps.

20
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:06,716
Look at her, Shelley. Can you believe that
lovely brow conceived of Frankenstein?

21
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:10,766
A monster created from
cadavers out of rifled graves.

22
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:14,556
- lsn't it astonishing?
- l don't know why you should think so.

23
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,399
What do you expect?

24
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:20,321
Such an audience needs something
stronger than a pretty little love story.

25
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,557
So why shouldn't l write of monsters?

26
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:26,595
No wonder Murray's refused to publish
the book. His public would be shocked.

27
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:28,837
lt will be published, l think.

28
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:31,885
Then, darling, you will have
much to answer for.

29
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:36,882
The publishers did not see that
my purpose was to write a moral lesson

30
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:42,121
of the punishment that befell
a mortal man who dared to emulate God.

31
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:46,962
Whatever your purpose was, l take great
relish in savouring each separate horror.

32
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:49,038
l roll them over on my tongue.

33
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:52,119
Don't, Lord Byron.
Don't remind me of it tonight.

34
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:55,279
What a setting in that
churchyard to begin with!

35
00:03:55,367 --> 00:04:01,761
<i>The sobbing women, the first clod of earth</i>
o<i>n the coffin. That was a pretty chill.</i>

36
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:05,840
<i>Frankenstein and the dwarf stealing</i>
<i>the body out of its new-made grave.</i>

37
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:10,564
<i>Cutting the hanged man down from</i>
<i>the gallows, where he swung in the wind.</i>

38
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:13,560
<i>The cunning of Frankenstein</i>
<i>in his mountain laboratory,</i>

39
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:17,959
<i>picking dead men apart and</i>
<i>building up a human monster</i>

40
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,484
<i>so fearful and so horrible that only</i>
<i>a half-crazed brain could have devised.</i>

41
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,524
<i>And then the murders,</i>
<i>the little child who <i>drowned.</i>

42
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:31,157
<i>Henry Frankenstein himself</i>
<i>thrown from the top of the burning mill</i>

43
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,556
<i>by the very monster he had created.</i>

44
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:38,960
And it was these fragile white fingers
that penned the nightmare.

45
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:42,005
Ah! You've made me prick myself, Byron.

46
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,963
lt's bleeding.

47
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:50,405
There, there. l do think it a shame, Mary,
to end your story quite so suddenly.

48
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:55,117
That wasn't the end at all. Would you
like to hear what happened after that?

49
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:57,357
l feel like telling it.

50
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,280
lt's a perfect night for mystery and horror.

51
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,677
The air itself is filled with monsters.

52
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:09,524
l'm all ears. While heaven blasts the night
without, open up your pits of hell.

53
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:14,444
Well, then, imagine yourselves
standing by the wreckage of the mill.

54
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:17,041
The fire is dying down.

55
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:21,006
<i>Soon the bare skeleton</i>
o<i>f the building rolls over,</i>

56
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,521
<i>the gaunt rafters against the sky.</i>

57
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,838
<i>(yelling)</i>

58
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:45,961
Well, l must say, that's the best fire
l ever saw in all me life.

59
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:51,165
- What are you cryin' for?
- lt's terrible.

60
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:55,923
l know. But after all them murders and
poor Mr Henry being brought home to die,

61
00:05:56,007 --> 00:06:00,523
l'm glad to see the monster
roasted to death before my very eyes.

62
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,757
lt's too good for him.

63
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:08,160
lt's all the devil's work, and you'd better
cross yourself quick before he gets you.

64
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:12,880
Come along, come along. lt's all over.

65
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,442
Get back to your homes and go to sleep.

66
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:20,325
There it goes again.
lt ain't burnt out at all.

67
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:23,683
- There's more yet.
- lsn't the monster dead yet?

68
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:27,077
lt's high time every decent
man and wife was in bed.

69
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,403
That's his insides caught at last.

70
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:33,240
lnsides is always the last to be consumed.

71
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,761
Move on. You've had enough
excitement for one night.

72
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:39,237
This strange man
you call a monster is dead.

73
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,557
Monster, indeed!

74
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:46,960
You may thank your lucky stars they sent
for me to safeguard life and property.

75
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:49,959
Why didn't you safeguard
those drownded and murdered?

76
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:53,756
Come, now. We want no rallying, no riots.

77
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,077
- Who's riotin'?
- Move on, move on.

78
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,761
Good night all, and pleasant dreams.

79
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:01,156
Ah, pleasant dreams yourself.

80
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:05,925
Thinks he's everybody just because
he's a burgomaster. Huh!

81
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:16,116
Poor Mr Henry. He was to have been
married today to that lovely girl Elizabeth.

82
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:20,519
Cover him up. Someone must
break the news to the poor girl.

83
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,916
Ride as fast as you can to the castle,

84
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:26,636
and tell the old Baron Frankenstein
we are bringing his son home.

85
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,481
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, shut up.

86
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:35,718
Come home, Hans.
The monster is dead now.

87
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:40,085
Nothing could be left alive in that furnace.
Why do you stay here?

88
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:43,443
l want to see with my own eyes.

89
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:45,757
Oh, Hans, he must be dead.

90
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:49,999
And, dead or alive, nothing can
bring our little Maria back to us.

91
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:54,877
lf l can see his blackened bones,
l can sleep at night.

92
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:58,958
Come back, Hans!
You will be burned yourself!

93
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:03,006
Maria drowned to death and
you burned up! What should l do then?

94
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:05,078
No!

95
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,478
<i>(growls)</i>

96
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,841
Hans. Hans!

97
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:49,715
Where are you? Hans!
Are you all right?

98
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:55,644
l hear you. Here,
give me your hand, Hans.

99
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,398
Here.

100
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,639
<i>(screams)</i>

101
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,398
<i>(growls)</i>

102
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:18,601
<i>(screams)</i>

103
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,358
<i>(bangs on door)</i>

104
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,806
Oh, heaven, what is this?

105
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:09,556
Henry? Tell me.

106
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:13,242
Oh, milady, how can we tell you?

107
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:21,126
Bring him in.

108
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:35,247
- Albert.
- What do you want?

109
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:38,524
lt's alive. The monster, it's alive!

110
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:42,846
- Ah, shut up, you old fool.
- l saw it.

111
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:45,839
lt ain't turned to no skeleton at all.

112
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:48,043
lt lived right through the fire.

113
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:51,324
Ah, go bite your tongue off.
We don't believe in ghosts.

114
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:53,318
Nobody'll believe me.

115
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,796
All right, l'll wash my hands of it.

116
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:59,357
Let 'em all be murdered in their beds.

117
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:32,842
- Speak to me, Henry.
- Oh, milady, he'll never speak again.

118
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,677
l was foretold of this.

119
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:38,520
l was told beware my wedding night.

120
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:50,127
Oh, look, milady! He's alive!

121
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:54,283
Henry, darling.

122
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,158
Elizabeth.

123
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:02,599
Oh, what a terrible wedding night.

124
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,398
You can go to bed now, Mary.

125
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,520
- You'll soon be better.
- l feel almost myself again.

126
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:35,600
When you're strong enough, we'll go
away and forget this horrible experience.

127
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:38,997
Forget? lf only l could forget.

128
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,282
But it's never out of my mind.

129
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:44,837
l've been cursed for delving
into the mysteries of life.

130
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,715
Perhaps death is sacred,
and l've profaned it.

131
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:51,879
For what a wonderful vision it was.

132
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:58,361
l dreamed of being the first to give to the
world the secret that God is so jealous of.

133
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:01,120
The formula for life.

134
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:04,643
Think of the power to create a man.

135
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:08,200
And l did. l did it. l created a man.

136
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,484
And who knows? ln time l could
have trained him to do my will.

137
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:15,726
l could have bred a race. l might even
have found the secret of eternal life.

138
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:20,323
Henry, don't say those things. Don't
think them. lt's blasphemous and wicked.

139
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:22,204
We are not meant to know those things.

140
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:25,438
lt may be that l'm intended
to know the secret of life.

141
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:28,715
lt may be part of the divine plan.

142
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,197
No, no. lt's the devil that prompts you.

143
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,836
lt's death, not life, that is in it all
and at the end of it all.

144
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:40,921
Listen, while you've been lying here,
tossing in your delirium, l couldn't sleep.

145
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,316
And when you rave of your insane desire

146
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,160
to create living men
from the dust of the dead,

147
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,557
a strange apparition has
seemed to appear in the room.

148
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:55,596
lt comes, a figure like Death. And
each time it comes more clearly, nearer.

149
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:59,282
lt seems to be reaching out for you,
as if it would take you away from me!

150
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,676
There it is. Look.

151
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:05,916
- There.
- l see nothing, Elizabeth. Where?

152
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:08,043
There's nothing there.

153
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,880
There! There! lt's coming for you!

154
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:14,926
Nearer! Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry!

155
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:16,998
<i>(laughs hysterically)</i> Henry!

156
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,121
<i>(banging on door)</i>

157
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:30,435
Albert! Drat the man.
He's never here when he's wanted.

158
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:34,198
- What's the good of footmen anyway?
- <i>(bell rings)</i>

159
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,755
All right. All right!

160
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:40,362
Don't knock the castle over!
We're not all dead yet.

161
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:53,279
- There's nobody at home.
- Let me in, my good woman.

162
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:56,279
l know the young
Baron Frankenstein is at home.

163
00:14:56,367 --> 00:15:00,679
He's sick. He's in his bed, where all
decent folk should be at this time of night.

164
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:06,000
Tell him that Dr Pretorius is here
on a secret matter of grave importance,

165
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,920
and must see him alone, tonight.

166
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:13,597
Dr Pretorius?

167
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,518
Pretorius?

168
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:23,078
- What was it? What was the name?
- Dr Pretorius.

169
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:26,802
There ain't no such name.

170
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,678
Now, you stay there.

171
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,479
- Who's there?
- lt's Minnie, milady.

172
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,558
<i>(Henry)</i> Oh, come in.

173
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:51,437
lt's Dr Pretorius.

174
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:55,361
He says he wants to see
the master. Most insistent.

175
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:56,926
Pretorius?

176
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:59,441
He's a very queer-looking
old gentleman, sir.

177
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:03,440
And must see you, on a secret,
grave matter, he said.

178
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,404
Tonight. Alone.

179
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:08,797
- Bring him in.
- Henry, who is this man?

180
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:10,764
Dr Pretorius.

181
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,920
Baron Frankenstein now, l believe?

182
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,316
Won't you come in, Doctor?

183
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:23,243
l trust you will pardon
this intrusion at so late an hour.

184
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,877
l would not have ventured to come,
had l not a communication to make

185
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,562
which l suspect may be
of the utmost importance to yourself.

186
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:35,478
This is Professor Pretorius. He used to be
Doctor of Philosophy at the university.

187
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:38,161
- But, uh...
- But was booted out.

188
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,807
Booted, my dear Baron, is the word.

189
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,764
For knowing too much.

190
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,044
Henry's been very ill, Professor.
He shouldn't be disturbed.

191
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:48,357
l am also a doctor, Baroness.

192
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:50,483
Why have you come here tonight?

193
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:53,479
My business with you, Baron, is private.

194
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,558
Elizabeth, please.

195
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,638
l do hope he won't upset Henry.

196
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:09,596
- What do you want?
- We must work together.

197
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:12,838
Never. This is outrageous.

198
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:17,523
l'm through with it.
l'll have no more of this hell-spawn.

199
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:21,441
As soon as l'm well,
l'm to be married, and l'm going away.

200
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:23,597
l must beg you to reconsider.

201
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,361
You know, do you not,
that it is you, really,

202
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:29,484
who are responsible
for all those murders?

203
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:33,999
There are penalties
to pay for killing people.

204
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:37,204
And with your creature
still at large in the countryside...

205
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,357
Are you threatening me?

206
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:41,483
Don't put it so crudely.

207
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:46,243
l had ventured to hope that you and l
together, no longer as master and pupil,

208
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:50,764
but as fellow scientists, might probe
the mysteries of life and death...

209
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,485
Never. No further.

210
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,479
..and reach a goal
undreamed of by science.

211
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:59,321
l can't make any further experiments.
l've had a terrible lesson.

212
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:01,523
That is sad, very sad.

213
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,607
But you and l have gone too far to stop.

214
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:07,565
Nor can it be stopped so easily.

215
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:10,445
l also have continued
with my experiments.

216
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,916
That is why l am here tonight.

217
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:15,396
You must see <i>my</i> creation.

218
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:19,480
Have you also succeeded
in bringing life to the dead?

219
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,877
lf you, Herr Baron, will do me the honour
of visiting my humble abode,

220
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:26,198
l think you will be interested
in what l have to show you.

221
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:31,315
After 20 years of secret scientific
research, and countless failures,

222
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:37,198
l also have created life,
as we say, in God's own image.

223
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:40,518
l must know. When can l see it?

224
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,962
l thought you might change your mind.

225
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:45,845
Why not tonight? lt is not very late.

226
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,597
- ls it far?
- No, but you will need a coat.

227
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,956
l think your coachman
had better wait here.

228
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,483
Won't you sit down, Herr Baron?

229
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:32,882
Before l show you the results
of my trifling experiments,

230
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,481
l would like to drink to our partnership.

231
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:39,684
Do you like gin? lt is my only weakness.

232
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,601
To a new world of gods and monsters.

233
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:53,726
Creation of life is enthralling,

234
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:56,401
distinctly enthralling, is it not?

235
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,275
l cannot account precisely
for all that l am going to show you.

236
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,246
But perhaps now that
you are my partner, you can.

237
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:46,517
My experiments did not turn out
quite like yours, Henry.

238
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:53,523
But science, like love, has her
little surprises, as you shall see.

239
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,565
Good heavens, Doctor. What are these?

240
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:59,525
There is a pleasing variety
about my exhibits.

241
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:03,317
My first experiment was so lovely

242
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:05,557
that we made her a queen.

243
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:13,438
Charming, don't you think?

244
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:17,126
Then, of course, we had to have a king.

245
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:22,840
Now he's so madly in love with her
that we have to segregate them.

246
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:28,126
Now now. l have to be
very careful with the king.

247
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:33,363
Now, behave.

248
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:37,201
My next production looked
so disapprovingly at the other two

249
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,837
that they made him an archbishop.

250
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:42,282
He seems to be asleep.
l must wake him up.

251
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:49,077
The next one is the very devil.

252
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,443
Very bizarre, this little chap.

253
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:55,839
There's a certain resemblance to me,
don't you think? Or do l flatter myself?

254
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:58,316
l took a great deal of pains with him.

255
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:02,123
Sometimes l have wondered whether
life wouldn't be much more amusing

256
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:04,323
if we were all devils,

257
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:08,116
and no nonsense about
angels and being good.

258
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,843
Oh, there's the king out again.

259
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:15,802
Even royal amours are a nuisance.

260
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:18,196
<i>(squeaking)</i>

261
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:19,800
<i>(blows whistle)</i>

262
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:29,485
Poor Archbishop. He has his hands full.

263
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:32,436
There. That'll keep you quiet.

264
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:36,837
My little ballerina is charming,
but such a bore.

265
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:39,646
She'll only dance to
Mendelssohn's ''Spring Song'',

266
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,718
and it gets so monotonous.

267
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:44,642
My next is very conventional, l'm afraid.

268
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:47,605
But you can never tell
how these things will turn out.

269
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:50,565
lt was an experiment with seaweed.

270
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:53,081
Normal size has been my difficulty.

271
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:55,317
You did achieve size.

272
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,557
l need to work that out with you.

273
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:07,201
But this isn't science.

274
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:09,243
lt's more like black magic.

275
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:12,445
You think l'm mad. Perhaps l am.

276
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:14,358
But listen, Henry Frankenstein,

277
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:18,406
while you were digging in your graves
piecing together dead tissues,

278
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:22,480
l, my dear pupil, went for my material
to the source of life.

279
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:29,246
l grew my creatures, like cultures.
Grew them as nature does, from seed.

280
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:34,196
But, still, you did achieve
results that l have missed. Now, think.

281
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,802
What a world-astounding
collaboration we should be,

282
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,118
you and l, together.

283
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:43,845
No. No, no, no.

284
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:47,237
Leave the charnel house
and follow the lead of nature,

285
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:50,319
or of God, if you like your Bible stories.

286
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:54,605
Male and female, created He them.

287
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:58,167
Be fruitful and multiply.

288
00:23:58,247 --> 00:24:04,083
Create a race, a man-made race
upon the face of the earth. Why not?

289
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:06,920
l daren't. l daren't even think
of such a thing.

290
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:09,919
Our mad dream is only half realised.

291
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:12,680
Alone you have created a man.

292
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:17,158
Now together we will create his mate.

293
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:19,965
You mean...?

294
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:23,557
Yes, a woman.

295
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:26,559
That should be really interesting.

296
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,482
<i>(cries out)</i>

297
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:48,845
Please don't touch me!

298
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:56,640
- There she is! Quick!
- <i>(screams)</i>

299
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:59,558
There he is. Shoot.

300
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:11,917
Run to the village, quick.
lt's the monster. Tell the burgomaster.

301
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,561
- What is it now?
- The monster! He's in the woods.

302
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:32,117
Get the bloodhounds. Raise all the
men you can, lock the women indoors

303
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:34,198
and wait for me.

304
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:41,076
Now then! Monster, indeed!
l'll show him. Follow me.

305
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,600
<i>(growls)</i>

306
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:41,963
Where is he?

307
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:49,796
Bind him securely.
l don't want anything slipshod.

308
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:53,482
Tie his feet first. His feet first!

309
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,604

310

Have you got him? That's what
l want to know. Have you got him?

311
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:01,563
Of course we've got him,
my good woman.

312
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:04,639
A good job too.
Mind he don't get loose again.

313
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:07,560
He might do some damage
and hurt somebody.

314
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:12,004
- Bring him down when you've bound him.
- You want any help there? l'll bind him!

315
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:07,563
Now take him down to the old dungeon
and put him in chains.

316
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,965
There you are.
Find some rope and tie him up.

317

Come on, then. Get back to your work.

318

Keep still.

doors. We can't take all day over this.

He's a nightmare in the daylight, he is.

Get away, there! Clear that window!

Hah! You mind your own business and
see he doesn't get out. He's dangerous.

00:45:17,807 --> 00:45:20,560
- What are you waiting for?
- Mercy on us.

471
00:45:20,647 --> 00:45:24,401
- You want me to send you to the gallows?
- Could be no worse than this.

472
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:27,081
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes.

473
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,158
Here goes.

474
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:50,443
Pretty little thing, in her way, wasn't she?

475
00:45:50,527 --> 00:45:52,245
l hope her bones are firm.

476
00:45:53,807 --> 00:45:56,560
- lt seems lighter now.
- Yes.

477
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:00,922
Well, Doctor, l guess that's all for tonight.

478
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:04,158
- Can we go home now?
- Yes. l shall wait here for a bit.

479
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:06,317
l rather like this place.

480
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:08,875
- Be careful nobody sees you leave.
- We know.

481
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:12,755
- And leave me that lantern down there.
- All right, all right.

482
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,922
lf there's more like this,
what do you say, pal?

483
00:46:26,007 --> 00:46:28,202
We give ourselves up
and let 'em hang us?

484
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:32,166
- That goes for me too.
- This is no life for murderers.

485
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:35,318
<i>(laughs)</i>

486
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,123
l give you the monster.

487
00:46:47,327 --> 00:46:49,318
<i>(laughs)</i>

488
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:08,683
Oh.

489
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:12,885
l thought l was alone. Good evening.

490
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:14,958
Smoke.

491
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:20,323
- Friend.
- Yes, l hope so.

492
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:23,956
Have a cigar. They are my only weakness.

493
00:47:26,687 --> 00:47:28,359
Good, good.

494
00:47:39,087 --> 00:47:41,362
Drink. Good.

495
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:43,438
Good.

496
00:47:57,087 --> 00:48:01,524
You make man like me?

497
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:03,996
No. Woman.

498
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:08,596
- Friend for you.
- Woman?

499
00:48:08,687 --> 00:48:11,326
Friend. Yes.

500
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:16,001
l want friend. Like me.

501
00:48:16,087 --> 00:48:18,362
l think you can be very useful.

502
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:22,804
And you will add a little force
to the argument, if necessary.

503
00:48:22,887 --> 00:48:27,324
Do you know who Henry Frankenstein is?
And who you are?

504
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,477
Yes. l know.

505
00:48:30,647 --> 00:48:33,207
Made me from dead.

506
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:36,598
l love dead.

507
00:48:37,847 --> 00:48:39,917
Hate living.

508
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:42,567
You're wise in your generation.

509
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:47,516
We must have a long talk, and then
l have an important call to make.

510
00:48:51,447 --> 00:48:55,440
Woman. Friend.

511
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,322
Wife.

512
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:05,722
That Dr Pretorius is here again, sir.

513
00:49:05,807 --> 00:49:07,877
There, l knew it.

514
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:11,482
- Send him away. l won't see him.
- l certainly will.

515
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:16,598
Good evening, Henry.

516
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:20,755
Baroness, l've not yet had the opportunity

517
00:49:20,847 --> 00:49:24,157
of offering you
my congratulations on your marriage.

518
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:27,796
- Pray accept them now.
- Dr Pretorius.

519
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:30,765
l don't know what your business is
but, whatever it may be,

520
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:33,759
l tell you frankly
that l am not frightened of it or of you.

521
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:37,999
Henry's been very ill. He's in no state
to be alarmed or annoyed.

522
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:40,362
Your visit now is most unwelcome.

523
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:46,801
Henry, l heard the carriage drive up.
l'll see that the baggage is put in.

524
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:49,521
Then we're leaving.

525
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:57,481
l think you know why l am here, Henry.

526
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:03,678
All the necessary preparations are made.
My part in the experiments is complete.

527
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:09,478
l have created, by my method, a perfect
human brain - already living, but dormant.

528
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:13,242
Everything is now ready for you and me
to begin our supreme collaboration.

529
00:50:13,327 --> 00:50:17,206
No, no. Don't tell me of it.
l don't want to hear.

530
00:50:17,287 --> 00:50:21,485
l've changed my mind. l won't do it.

531
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,239
l expected this.

532
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:27,076
l thought we might need
another assistant.

533
00:50:28,247 --> 00:50:30,238
Perhaps <i>he</i> can persuade you.

534
00:50:30,847 --> 00:50:33,884
- Nothing can persuade me.
- We shall see.

535
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:40,716
- No! Not that!
- Oh, he's harmless, except when crossed.

536
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:49,079
Frankenstein.

537
00:50:50,287 --> 00:50:53,597
Yes, there have been developments
since he came to me.

538
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:05,037
Sit down.

539
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:11,437
- What do you want?
- You know.

540
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,836
- This is your work.
- Yes.

541
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:15,997
l'll have no hand
in such a monstrous thing.

542
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:19,363
- Yes. Must.
- Get him out.

543
00:51:19,447 --> 00:51:21,358
l won't even discuss it until he's gone.

544
00:51:21,807 --> 00:51:23,798
Go now.

545
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:27,362
<i>(low growl)</i>

546
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,438
Go.

547
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:44,756
- Must do it.
- Nothing can make me go on with it.

548
00:51:45,047 --> 00:51:46,924
<i>(growls)</i>

549
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:52,157
Now.

550
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:12,165
Put the bags in the carriage
and l'll be out in a moment.

551
00:52:12,247 --> 00:52:16,081
Go and tell the master to hurry,
Minnie, or we shall lose the train.

552
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,760
Excuse me for being so nervous, milady,

553
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,315
but l don't like leaving you alone.

554
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:28,559
- Oh, nonsense, Minnie, l shall be all right.
- l hope so, milady.

555
00:52:34,327 --> 00:52:36,318
ls that you, Henry?

556
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:53,478
<i>(screams)</i>

557
00:52:54,647 --> 00:52:56,558

<i>(screams)</i> Henry!

<i>(screaming)</i>

00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:06,926
- Elizabeth.
- <i>(Minnie screams)</i>

562
00:53:10,207 --> 00:53:12,163
What is it? What's the matter?

563
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:14,442
Oh, sir, she's gone!

564
00:53:14,687 --> 00:53:17,121
The monster, he's got her!

565
00:53:17,207 --> 00:53:20,165
l saw it. The baroness is gone!

566
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:25,442
This is Pretorius' doing. Quick, search
parties. There's not a moment to lose.

567
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:27,518
<i>(crash)</i>

568
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,205
l charge you,
as you value your mistress' life,

569
00:53:31,287 --> 00:53:34,438
to do nothing
and say nothing of this episode.

570
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:37,564
l assure you that the baroness
will be safely returned,

571
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,036
if you will leave everything to me.

572
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,721
Nothing, that is, except what he demands.

573
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:09,358
l can find no trace of Elizabeth.

574
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:13,520
Oh, l admit l'm beaten.

575
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:17,080
But if you can bring her back,

576
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:19,317
l'll do anything that you want.

577
00:54:19,407 --> 00:54:22,797
Are you ready to complete with me
this final experiment?

578
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:25,401
- What about Elizabeth?
- She is well,

579
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:29,162
and will be safely returned
if you will proceed.

580
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:31,882
- l'm ready.
- Ah.

581
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:48,360
Mind the steps.
They're a bit slimy, l expect.

582
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:50,438
l think it's a charming house.

583
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,839
lt is interesting to think
that once upon a time

584
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:10,886
we should have been burnt at the stake
as wizards for this experiment.

585
00:55:10,967 --> 00:55:13,879
Doctor, l think the heart is beating.

586
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:20,720
Look. lt's beating.

587
00:55:20,807 --> 00:55:24,925
- But the rhythm of the beat is uneven.
- lncrease the saline solution.

588
00:55:28,527 --> 00:55:32,839
- ls there any life yet?
- No, not life itself yet.

589
00:55:32,927 --> 00:55:35,487
This is only the simulacrum of life.

590
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:39,037
This action only responds
when the current is applied.

591
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:43,678
We must be patient. The heart is more
complex than any other part of the body.

592
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:47,241
Look. The beat is increasing.

593
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:49,636
Yes...

594
00:55:50,207 --> 00:55:53,040
- lt's stopped.
- Shall l increase the current?

595
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:58,281
This heart is useless.

596
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:03,600
l must have another.
And it must be sound and young.

597
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:07,718
Karl.

598
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:11,844
You must go to your friend
at the accident hospital.

599
00:56:11,927 --> 00:56:16,239
What we need is a female victim
of sudden death. Can you do it?

600
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:18,841
lf you promise me a thousand crowns.

601
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:22,203
lt will be well worth it,
and the baron will pay.

602
00:56:22,287 --> 00:56:25,723
- Yes, yes. Go and get it.
- l'll try.

603
00:56:33,847 --> 00:56:36,839
There are always
accidental deaths occurring.

604
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,122
Always.

605
00:56:39,207 --> 00:56:41,277
l'll get your heart.

606
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:44,598
l'll go into that room, l'll go into that room
and l'll take my knife out.

607
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:47,326
l'll get her. l'll hold her down
and there she'll be.

608
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:49,716
Where, l ask you? Where will she be?

609
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,158
A thousand crowns.

610
00:57:05,447 --> 00:57:08,837
lt's beating perfectly. Just as in life.

611
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:12,397
- Oh, if only l can keep it going until...
- lt was a very fresh one.

<i>(crash)</i>

Where did you get it?

614

l gave the gendarme 50 crowns.

615

- What gendarme?
- lt was a...

- police case.
- Yes, very sad.

617
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:31,477
Only, we can't bother about that now.
Can l do anything?

618
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:35,879
No, no, no! l can work better alone.

Elizabeth is alive and she is well.

Yes, yes, this is Henry.

Yes, it's been beating for nine hours.

Not yet, but soon...
