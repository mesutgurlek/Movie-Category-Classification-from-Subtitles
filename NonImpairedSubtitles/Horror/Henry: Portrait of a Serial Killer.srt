that he was trash
and he'd always be trash

00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:08,616
and you was going to catch it
and you did didn't you?

l don't really want
to talk about him right now.

49

O.K. by me, we don't have
to talk about it now.

50
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,794
We don't have
to talk about it ever.

00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:15,590
How long are you
going to be up here?

00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,327
lt's hard to say.

53
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:18,598
What about Lurleen?

54
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:19,962
How long can you

l don't know.

56
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:23,440
l'm going to get a job,

57
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:25,232
Maybe bring her up here,

58
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,107
Where did you

00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:46,528

70
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,574
What else can you do
besides dance naked?

71
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:08,980
Don't start

00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:18,421
After seeing you l might
just try brain surgery.

76
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:22,294
You're a card.

77

00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:16,813
Becky: l don't know...
l'm just curious.

172
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:20,275
Van Dalia.

173
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,282
Van Dalia?

174
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:24,316
Sure, Van Dalia.

175
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,920
Oh, what was he in for?

176
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:29,653
Otis:
You don't want to know.

177
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,994
What did he do?
Kill his mama?

178
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,288
Uh, huh.

179
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,927
Becky: Come on...
what was he in for?

180
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:36,859
You don't want to know.

181
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,301
What did he do?
Rob a bank or something?

182
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:40,596
Otis: You were right
the first time.

183
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:42,503
Huh?

184
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:43,762
You were right the first time.

185
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,365
He killed his mama.

186
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,206
Otis: Don't you ever
tell him l told you.

187
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:50,873
You're kidding me?

188
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:51,609
Otis: No, l ain't.

189
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:52,508
Yes you are.

190
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,974
Alright, l'm kidding you.

191
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:55,883
Just don't ever
tell him l told you.

192
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:57,852
He killed his mama?

193
00:18:58,088 --> 00:19:01,956
With a baseball bat...
her and one of her boyfriends.

194
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:04,121
l swear if you
ever tell him l told you

195
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:05,256
l'll beat your ass right off.

196
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:06,620
How do you know all this?

197
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,198
Otis: He told me,
that's how l know.

198
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:09,492
How else would l know?

199
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:10,834
Were you
cellmates or something?

200
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,128
No, we were friends.

201
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:14,663
When did he get out?

202
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,831
Otis: A couple
of years before me.

203
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:26,346
Hi.

204
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,347
upbeat music

205
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,751
l got some business
l got to take care of.

206
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:06,589
You going out?

207
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:09,318
For a while, l got to run
an errand for a fellow.

208
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:11,019
You want to come along Henry?

209
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:14,964
No, you go ahead.

210
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,731
See you later.

211
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,836
Want to play cards?

212
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,380
Sure.

213
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,485
Becky: What was
your daddy like?

214
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,427
My daddy?

215
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,236
He used to drive a truck before
he got his legs cut off.

216
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,003
l remember one time...

217
00:20:57,374 --> 00:20:59,968
he brought me and
my little brother home bicycles.

218
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,876
He had delivered some that day
and he had a couple left over.

219
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:07,350
But, mine was way too big for me

220
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:10,018
and my brother
he couldn't ride his anyway.

221
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,552
Daddy, he said l'd grow into it,
but, l never did.

222
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:15,988
Becky: Why not?

223
00:21:16,293 --> 00:21:20,093
l never got the chance,
they sold it.

224
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:22,098
They sold them both.

225
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:26,191
Becky: So you have
a brother?

226
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,563
My brother, he had
a bone disorder.

227
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:33,035
He was
a little deformed.

228
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:35,612
What happened to him?

229
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:38,906
Henry: He died.

230
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:47,347
l can't ever remember
really liking my daddy.

231
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:49,921
l wanted to, l really did.

232
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,195
One time he bought me,
when l was about five,

233
00:21:55,766 --> 00:22:00,066
he bought me an ice cream cone
and l dropped it.

234
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:04,072
And he slapped me and
made me pick it up and eat it.

235
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:08,070
l never liked my daddy.

236
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:16,050
One time, when my momma was
at work, and l was about 13,

237
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:20,982
he come into my room and he
told me to take my shirt off

238
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,352
'cause he wanted to see
how l was developed.

239
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:28,157
And when l wouldn't
he got real mad and he hit me.

240
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:30,732
And he told me he had a right

241
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:33,195
because he was my daddy
and l was his daughter

242
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:36,501
and he fed me
and let me live in his house

243
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:38,908
and he could
do whatever he wanted.

244
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:42,307
And he did.

245
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:47,445
Then he started coming
into my room a lot, after that.

246
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:51,948
l didn't fight him because
when l did he just hit me.

247
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:56,091
l was afraid
l was going to have a baby

248
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,451
and that my baby
would be deformed

249
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:02,064
but, l never got pregnant.

250
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:05,891
l tried to tell mama,

251
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:09,696
but she didn't
want to hear about it.

252
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:13,867
She pretended not to believe me
but l knew she did.

253
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:19,743
lt sure is good to talk...

254
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,742
to talk to you Henry

255
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:25,154
because l know
you're not judgmental

256
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:26,754
or anything like that.

257
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:32,156
l never would have married Leroy
in the first place

258
00:23:32,596 --> 00:23:34,257
if l hadn't wanted to get away
from daddy so bad.

259
00:23:34,698 --> 00:23:37,565
Didn't get along
with your daddy, huh?

260
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:46,936
Did you really kill your mama?

261
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,072
What?

262
00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:51,745
Did you really
kill your mama?

263
00:23:51,948 --> 00:23:54,542
l guess l did.

264
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,812
How did it happen?

265
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:01,813
l stabbed her.

266
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:05,418
Otis said you hit her
with a baseball bat.

267
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:07,587
Otis said that?

268
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,328
Yeah.

269
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:12,431
Well, he's mistaken.

270
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:18,001
Well, don't tell him l told you,
he made me promise.

271
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:22,273
She must have treated
you real bad.

272
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,542
She was a whore.

273
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:33,712
My mama was a whore.

274
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:37,549
But l don't fault her for that.

275
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:40,524
lt ain't what she done
it's how she done it.

276
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:47,731
As long as l can remember she'd
be bringing men up to the house.

277
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:50,767
My daddy was there too

278
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:53,241
but it didn't matter
nothing to her.

279
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,002
She make me watch it.

280
00:24:59,316 --> 00:25:00,578
That's creepy.

281
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:03,547
She beat me too, a lot.

282
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:07,490
She beat me
when l wouldn't watch it.

283
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:09,723
And sometime she'd beat me

284
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:13,154
make me wear a dress

285
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:16,129
and watch her doing it.

286
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:19,435
and then they'd laugh at me.

287
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:21,398
She made you wear a dress?

288
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:23,670
You think l'm lying?

289
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:29,670
l feel like l know you

290
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:32,681
like l've known you
for a long time.

291
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:36,511
l feel like l've known you
for ever and ever.

292
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:50,225
Yeah...l killed my mama...

293
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:53,994
one night.

294
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:56,034
lt was my 1 4th birthday

295
00:25:56,406 --> 00:26:01,844
and she was drunk
and we had an argument.

296
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:05,644
And she hit me
with a whiskey bottle

297
00:26:06,183 --> 00:26:11,985
l shot her...
l shot her dead.

298
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:14,990
l thought you said
you stabbed her?

299
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,124
Oh yeah.

300
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:25,827
That's right...

301
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:29,633
l stabbed her.

302
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,944
(door opens)

303
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,141
Hey.

304
00:26:46,556 --> 00:26:48,547
Anything good on TV?

305
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:54,455
upbeat music

306
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,710
Becky: l got a job today.

307
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:53,446
Otis: Oh yeah?
Doing what?

308
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:54,455
Becky: At a beauty parlor.

309
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:56,057
Otis: A beauty parlor?

310
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:57,090
Becky: l'm a shampoo girl.

311
00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:58,386
Otis: What's that?

312
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,190
Becky: What's it sound like,
you dummy?

313
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:01,521
Otis: How the hell
should l know?

314
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:02,895
You ever seen me
in a beauty parlor?

315
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,793
Becky: l give shampoos...

316
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:07,200
a woman gets her hair shampooed
before she gets it cut

317
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:08,471
and l do it.

318
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:10,632
Otis: They pay you for that?

319
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:12,305
Becky: Of course they do.

320
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,840
Besides l used to do it some
back home after l met Leroy.

321
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,439
Do you like it better
than dancing naked?

322
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:19,505
Don't start with me Otis.

323
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,278
You used to dance naked?

324
00:28:22,886 --> 00:28:24,217
Sure, all the time
around the house.

325
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:24,919
Otis.

326
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:26,955
Best little naked
dancer you ever saw.

327
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:29,384
You never.

328
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:31,154
Were you really a dancer?

329
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,553
l danced some, in a club

330
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,164
and l wasn't naked.

331
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,297
l wore a costume

332
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:42,001
but l guess
it wasn't very much.

333
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:42,894
Huh.

334
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,270
When you gonna
dance for us?

335
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,372
When the pope pees
in his hat, Otis.

336
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:51,073
Ain't she got
a mouth on her?

337
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,104
l better have something
on me to defend me

338
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:54,307
from a pig like you.

339
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:55,510
(pig snorting sound)

340
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:58,352
Otis...

341
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,646
Them's pretty earrings
you got on Becky.

342
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,849
Thank you Henry.

343
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,961
At least there's
one gentleman at this table.

344
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:09,563
l'm sorry honey.
don't get mad.

345
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:12,298
l'm just having a little fun
with you that's all.

346
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,796
Oh, wait,
l got something to show you.

347
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:16,200
Wait.

348
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,972
ta-da!

349
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:23,643
Nice.

350
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,037
Real nice.

351
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:26,342
Put it on.

352
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:27,910
Right now?

353
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:28,578
Uh-huh.

354
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:32,184
OK, but turn around first...

355
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:33,713
turn around!

356
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:36,724
(background music)

357
00:29:57,647 --> 00:29:59,046
O.K., you can look.

358
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:02,715
What does it say on there?

359
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,610
l love Chicago.

360
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:08,190
Looks good, don't it Otis?

361
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:08,786
Uh-huh.

362
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:12,756
(sighs)

363
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:13,920
Oh, hey honey,

364
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:16,865
Why don't you bring me a beer,
this one is empty.

365
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,260
l ain't your maid,
get it yourself.

366
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:21,700
Oh, now come on honey,

367
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:24,472
l ain't asking you to wash
the windows or nothing...

368
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,140
l just want a beer.

369
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:29,038
Come on, bring your poor old
brother a beer, will ya?

370
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,883
Don't do that Otis.
She's your sister!

371
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:39,755
O.K., l was only
kidding around, Henry.

372
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,185
Tell her you're sorry.

373
00:30:41,524 --> 00:30:42,616
O.K., l'm sorry.

374
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:45,423
Now, tell her
you won't do it again.

375
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:48,195
l won't, l swear Becky
l swear, l won't.

376
00:30:48,465 --> 00:30:50,365
Ouch!

377
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,559
Shit, Henry!

378
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:55,996
Serves you right.

379
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:58,166
Thank you, Henry.

380
00:30:58,708 --> 00:30:59,174
That's alright.

381
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,437
Becky: Listen,
l'll do the dishes.

382
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:04,903
l don't mind, l don't.

383
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:20,993
Listen, why don't you boys
go out and get a beer.

384
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:24,696
l'll do these,
l don't mind, honest.

385
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:35,033
Well, what do you say Otis?

386
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:40,111
You want to go grab a beer?

387
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,483
Sure, l don't mind.

388
00:31:57,267 --> 00:31:58,962
l'll just go spruce up.

389
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,999
That was a real nice
supper, Becky.

390
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,175
Thanks.

391
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:12,808
Have fun.

392
00:32:15,552 --> 00:32:16,484
Yea.

393
00:32:37,674 --> 00:32:40,074
upbeat music

394
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,546
dramatic music

395
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,224
(moans of pleasure)

396
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:44,066
woman: Oh, come on, slow down!

397
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,665
Easy tiger, easy!

398
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:46,937
(sound of clothes ripping)

399
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:50,639
Now, wait a minute!

400
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:52,740
Hey come on, l'm not kidding!

401
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,044
(sound of neck cracking)

402
00:33:58,154 --> 00:34:00,145
(screaming) Suzie!!

403
00:34:00,323 --> 00:34:02,621
(screaming)

404
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,993
(dog barking)

405
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:40,926
Otis, come here...

406
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:42,455
l'll drive.

407
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:45,466
(dog barking)

408
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:05,479
Otis: What's gonna happen
when they find those bodies?

409
00:35:06,122 --> 00:35:06,349
Nothing.

410
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:07,213
What do you
mean nothing?

411
00:35:07,724 --> 00:35:09,282
Just what l said Otis,
nothing.

412
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:11,951
Nothing's gonna happen
cause nothing happened.

413
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:14,495
And l don't know nothing
about it whatever it is.

414
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:17,265
Do you?

415
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,469
Hey, l don't know nothing.

416
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:22,964
Good.

417
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,100
Otis: Oh, fuck.

418
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:40,717
Feeling better?

419
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,490
Yes.

420
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,460
Do you want some fries?

421
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:57,471
(sound of rain falling)

422
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:29,836
You telling me you never
killed anybody before?

423
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:31,706
l ain't saying that.

424
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:34,507
Then you've killed
before, right?

425
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:37,044
Well, maybe l didn't
have no choice.

426
00:36:37,213 --> 00:36:40,011
You didn't have
no choice here neither.

427
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:42,207
Did you?

428
00:36:42,385 --> 00:36:46,253
Huh?

429
00:36:46,722 --> 00:36:46,949
Did you?

430
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:52,353
l don't know,
it ain't the same.

431
00:36:52,695 --> 00:36:55,721
lt's always the same...

432
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:58,526
and it's always different.

433
00:36:59,135 --> 00:36:59,999
What do you mean?

434
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:04,333
lt's either you or them
one way or the other.

435
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,340
Ain't that right?

436
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:12,310
Open your eyes, Otis.

437
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:14,508
Look at the world.

438
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:17,417
lt's either you or them.

439
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:20,717
You know what l mean.

440
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,357
Yea.

441
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:32,126
Good.

442
00:37:32,735 --> 00:37:33,793
You want a beer?

443
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,894
O.K.

444
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:01,789
There was only one left.

445
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,106
...nothing about this

446
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:16,278
but you can bet a dollar to a
doughnut that when he finds out,

447
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:17,842
and he will find out
'cause l'll tell him

448
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,511
there'll be hell to pay.

449
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:20,247
Becky: Really.

450
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,282
l'll never go back there again
l can tell you that...

451
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:24,418
not when he's not there anyway.

452
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:27,679
First of all there ain't two
of them that speaks English.

453
00:38:27,924 --> 00:38:29,551
lt's gone down so badly

454
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:32,083
the way it's changed
it breaks my heart.

455
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:33,956
lt's like that all over.

456
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,556
People spit at you.

457
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:37,464
l wish l was lying.

458
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,225
You can't have a regular
good time in the city no more.

459
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,201
Ah, shit!

460
00:39:22,578 --> 00:39:24,341
What did you do that for?

461
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:28,979
l guess l got carried away.

462
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:32,986
Well, l guess you did, Otis.

463
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:36,190
Shit...l got to have a TV.

464
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:43,121
Well, let's go shopping.

465
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:46,128
(dramatic music)

466
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:32,212
So what can l do
for you gentlemen?

467
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:34,072
lt's hot in here, isn't it?

468
00:40:34,717 --> 00:40:35,342
l'm kind of cold.

469
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:36,843
We want a TV.

470
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,513
How much you got to spend?

471
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:41,214
What do you got?

472
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,679
$50 bucks.

473
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:46,420
l can let you have the set
over there for 50 bucks.

474
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:49,196
Well, turn it on
we want to see if it works.

475
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:50,556
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?

476
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:51,127
No.

477
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:55,736
Here plug it in
down here.

478
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:57,436
Here?

479
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,073
Yeah, down there, real good.
l see you've had some college.

480
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,276
Like you can see
it works real good...

481
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:06,678
Just takes a while to warm up.

482
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:08,007
lt's black and white!

483
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:09,347
Of course it's black and white.

484
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:11,644
What do you expect for 50 bucks?

485
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:13,145
Fuckin' 3-D for christ sake.

486
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:14,920
Well, how much is color?

487
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:15,990
We want color.

488
00:41:16,092 --> 00:41:18,754
You can't get color
for 50 dollars.

489
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:20,919
That's O.K.
let's see what you got.

490
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:22,158
What have l got?

491
00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:23,897
You want cable ready?

492
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,259
You want remote control?

493
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:26,432
You want UHF?

494
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:27,991
You want 13''?

495
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:28,966
You want 19''?

496
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:31,300
l bet you'd like to have a 19''.

497
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,264
(chuckling)

498
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:34,238
You want Sony?

499
00:41:34,443 --> 00:41:34,807
You want Zenith?

500
00:41:34,977 --> 00:41:35,602
You want a Gold Star?

501
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:38,706
What can we get for a $150?

502
00:41:39,315 --> 00:41:40,839
l can let you have
this set for $150.

503
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:42,076
lt's worth $300.

504
00:41:42,518 --> 00:41:43,883
But here,
take a look at this.

505
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:45,017
For an extra $75...

506
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:48,520
you can take this $600 set.

507
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:51,959
What's this?

508
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:53,058
lt's a camcorder.

509
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:54,023
What?

510
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:56,864
lt's a videotape recorder
and camera rolled into one.

511
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:59,557
You just pop in a cassette
and you're ready to go.

512
00:41:59,735 --> 00:42:00,895
You can make
your own movies with that?

513
00:42:01,337 --> 00:42:02,304
What else
would you do with it?

514
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:03,962
How much you want for it?

515
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,336
lt's worth a grand...
l'd take half.

516
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:07,867
500 bucks?

517
00:42:08,344 --> 00:42:10,505
Yeah...half of a grand is $500.

518
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:12,377
That's a little more
than we were planning to spend

519
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:14,745
l think we should
just take the TV.

520
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,677
O.K., which one do you want?

521
00:42:20,523 --> 00:42:21,182
The $50 one.

522
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:22,455
The $50 one...

523
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:23,882
You guys come in here

524
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,984
l show this
l show you that

525
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,961
and you creeps got
a lousy $50 to spend?

526
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:30,923
You should have
stopped me a long time ago.

527
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:34,129
Take the $50 set and get
the hell out, l'm a busy man.

528
00:42:34,737 --> 00:42:36,398
Well, we were
really counting on a color set.

529
00:42:36,906 --> 00:42:39,568
What's the matter?
You got shit in your ears?

530
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:42,637
The black and white is $50,
take it or leave it.

531
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:45,338
Sorry we wasted your time,
come on, Otis.

532
00:42:45,948 --> 00:42:47,108
Don't give me sorry,
you dumb ass!

533
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,346
Did l stutter?!

534
00:42:49,718 --> 00:42:51,151
Gimme the $50 and get out!

535
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,344
l'll give you 50...

536
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:55,356
(struggling and screaming)

537
00:43:22,484 --> 00:43:25,419
Otis...plug it in.

538
00:43:33,095 --> 00:43:35,928
lively music

539
00:43:55,317 --> 00:43:56,443
Becky: Henry come dance with me.

540
00:43:56,952 --> 00:44:00,683
Henry: Who me? No, no...

541
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,589
Otis: Come on Henry,
do it Henry.

542
00:44:05,027 --> 00:44:07,689
That's it...

543
00:44:09,365 --> 00:44:10,923
Get down.

544
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,933
(laughter with upbeat music)

545
00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:28,712
Otis: More, more,
come on, go for it...

546
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:30,751
come on Henry, that's it,
that's it...

547
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,317
Work them hands, Henry.

548
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:46,263
(shouting) Come on,
more, more!

549
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:49,704
More, more damnit!

550
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,174
(laughing)

551
00:44:55,377 --> 00:44:56,435
Turn it off!

552
00:44:57,012 --> 00:44:59,446
music

553
00:45:04,586 --> 00:45:05,712
Turn it off!

554
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,456
Otis: Come on Henry, say hi.

555
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:16,453
No.

556
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:17,395
Say hi, Henry.

557
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,531
No more, Otis.

558
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:19,497
Say hi, Henry.

559
00:45:19,768 --> 00:45:21,292
(angrily ) No more, Otis!!

560
00:45:21,403 --> 00:45:21,801
He doesn't want to.

561
00:45:21,937 --> 00:45:22,767
Say hi...

562
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:23,869
He said hi.

563
00:45:29,244 --> 00:45:31,542
(phone rings)

564
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:35,109
Yea, uh, huh.

565
00:45:35,718 --> 00:45:38,619
Look l'll do the best l can,
but l don't promise...

566
00:45:38,921 --> 00:45:40,445
Fuck him.

567
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:44,617
Yea, yea good-bye. crazy guy!

568
00:45:44,893 --> 00:45:45,291
What?

569
00:45:45,427 --> 00:45:48,055
Some jerk off hasn't been out
of jail six months,

570
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:50,359
gets drunk
gets busted up in a fight

571
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:51,822
so he goes home and gets a gun

572
00:45:52,468 --> 00:45:53,332
and comes back later
and shoots the guy.

573
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,003
They find the gun on him.
He claims he was framed.

574
00:45:56,238 --> 00:45:57,728
What are you going to do?

575
00:45:57,873 --> 00:46:00,933
So uh ...
everything going O.K.?

576
00:46:01,143 --> 00:46:01,700
Yeah.

577
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,941
Still working at Bobs Gas?

578
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:06,072
Yes sir.

579
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:07,345
Good, you working everyday?

580
00:46:07,616 --> 00:46:11,143
Two, three days a week.
lt's a little slow now.

581
00:46:11,387 --> 00:46:13,048
Well, if it's less than
two days a week let me know.

582
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:14,583
We'll see
what we can do for you.

583
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,653
You still living at
1801 West North?

584
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:17,356
Yes sir.

585
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:18,652
Good.

586
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:20,526
l got to cut it
short today, uh Otis.

587
00:46:20,796 --> 00:46:22,093
My kid's scheduled
for oral surgery.

588
00:46:22,398 --> 00:46:23,160
l promised to take him over.

589
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:23,794
Sure.

590
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,591
Good. l'll see you next month.

591
00:46:26,168 --> 00:46:27,567
Take it easy.

592
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,931
Bye.

593
00:46:34,176 --> 00:46:36,872
(distant whistle blowing)

594
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:51,791
You got it?

595
00:46:52,027 --> 00:46:52,755
Got what?

596
00:46:53,095 --> 00:46:54,460
You know what.

597
00:46:54,663 --> 00:46:56,631
(chuckling)

598
00:46:57,266 --> 00:46:59,200
Here you go.

599
00:46:59,435 --> 00:47:02,404
Wanna try it?

600
00:47:13,816 --> 00:47:19,345
Damn you, son of a bitch!
Fuckin'...!

601
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:28,288
Let me see that.

602
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:31,891
That little
fuckin' bastard.

603
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:32,897
l ought to kill him.

604
00:47:33,168 --> 00:47:34,100
l ought to cut his
fuckin' head off.

605
00:47:34,236 --> 00:47:35,362
That'd be a mistake.

606
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:37,031
Look who's talking.

607
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:39,599
Watch your mouth Otis.

608
00:47:40,209 --> 00:47:43,110
l'm sorry, Henry.

609
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,470
You kill that
high school boy

610
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:47,878
they're going to slap
your ass right back in jail.

611
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:49,282
Otis that's a promise.

612
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:51,613
People have seen you together.

613
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,951
l'd still like
to kill him though.

614
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,052
l bet you would.

615
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:57,720
l'd like to kill somebody.

616
00:47:58,093 --> 00:47:59,685
Say that again.

617
00:48:00,262 --> 00:48:02,696
l'd like to kill somebody.

618
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:05,331
Let's me and you
go for a ride Otis.

619
00:48:19,548 --> 00:48:22,312
dramatic music

620
00:49:35,824 --> 00:49:38,190
Here, l want
to show you something.

621
00:49:38,527 --> 00:49:41,462
Where did you get this?

622
00:49:41,763 --> 00:49:43,526
Careful Otis...
it's loaded.

623
00:49:43,932 --> 00:49:45,797
Where did you get it?

624
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:47,399
Guns are easy to get.

625
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:50,003
l can make a phone call
and get a gun.

626
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:52,063
Anybody can get a gun Otis.

627
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,371
What do you got in mind Henry?

628
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:55,103
What do you think?

629
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,646
l don't know.

630
00:50:01,116 --> 00:50:01,980
Put up the hood.

631
00:50:02,618 --> 00:50:03,812
Why?

632
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:06,016
Just put up the hood, Otis.

633
00:50:50,532 --> 00:50:52,159
You guys need any help?

634
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:57,104
Otis, do you need some help
or can you do it yourself?

635
00:51:10,385 --> 00:51:11,113
Feel better?

636
00:51:11,453 --> 00:51:11,748
Yeah.

637
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,511
Alright.

638
00:51:27,602 --> 00:51:29,968
lf you shoot somebody
in the head with a 45

639
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:31,327
everytime you kill somebody

640
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,340
it becomes like
your fingerprint see.

641
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:36,940
But if you strangle one
and stab another...

642
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:39,404
one you cut up
one you don't

643
00:51:39,548 --> 00:51:41,413
then the police
don't know what to do.

644
00:51:41,717 --> 00:51:43,617
They think you're
four different people.

645
00:51:43,885 --> 00:51:45,944
What they really like...

646
00:51:46,588 --> 00:51:48,886
what makes their job
so much easier...

647
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:49,757
a pattern.

648
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,792
What they call
a modus operandi.

649
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:55,188
That's Latin...

650
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:57,732
bet you didn't know
any Latin, did ya?

651
00:51:57,933 --> 00:51:58,695
Big fuckin' deal.

652
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:01,628
What?

653
00:52:04,973 --> 00:52:06,941
lt's like a trail
of shit, Otis.

654
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:10,134
lt's like a blood droppings
from a deer you've shot

655
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,938
and all they gotta do
is follow those droppings

656
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:16,073
and pretty soon they're going
to find that deer.

657
00:52:26,094 --> 00:52:27,994
Why do we use a gun?

658
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:32,024
You can use a gun.

659
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:34,501
l'm not saying you can't
use a gun...

660
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:37,136
just don't use
the same gun twice.

661
00:52:39,608 --> 00:52:42,008
The most important thing
is to keep moving...

662
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:45,370
that way they might
never catch up to you.

663
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:49,039
l'm gonna have to pack up and
be on the move too, pretty soon.

664
00:52:49,317 --> 00:52:50,306
Where are you going?

665
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:52,385
Nowhere.

666
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,077
Do you wanna come?

667
00:52:54,222 --> 00:52:57,316
We could be back this way
in about a month.

668
00:52:57,926 --> 00:53:01,589
l'm not supposed to leave
the state without telling them.

669
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:02,594
So who's gonna know?

670
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:04,856
As long as you show up
when you're supposed to?

671
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,366
What if they
check up on me at work?

672
00:53:07,702 --> 00:53:12,071
Well, no plan is perfect.

673
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:19,310
dramatic music

674
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,031
Henry: Bring her in.
Bring her in Otis.

675
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,426
(screaming)

676
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:21,501
Henry: Get her blouse off.
Take it off.

677
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:27,947
Skirt, skirt, skirt.

678
00:54:28,149 --> 00:54:33,052
Henry: Do it Otis,
you're a star.

679
00:54:33,555 --> 00:54:37,958
(screaming)

680
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,051
Henry: Shut up! Shut up!

681
00:54:46,568 --> 00:54:47,899
woman: Leave me alone!

682
00:54:54,175 --> 00:54:54,834
Henry: You got it.

683
00:54:55,243 --> 00:54:57,336
Go for it boy.

684
00:55:04,452 --> 00:55:05,612
Otis: Get the fuckin' kid!

685
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:29,934
(sound of neck breaking)

686
00:55:30,478 --> 00:55:33,879
Otis: (laughing) Henry, look!

687
00:55:34,282 --> 00:55:34,714
(sound of neck breaking)

688
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:03,934
Otis: Hey Henry? Henry?

689
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:07,407
Henry: What?

690
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:09,747
Otis: Hi! Bye!

691
00:56:10,085 --> 00:56:11,780
Say hello, honey!

692
00:56:20,362 --> 00:56:22,023
Henry: Otis!

693
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:22,791
No Otis!

694
00:56:23,098 --> 00:56:26,067
Otis...no!!

695
00:56:26,334 --> 00:56:28,097
Let's go!

696
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:45,948
What are you doing?

697
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:48,186
l want to see it again.

698
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:05,505
(dramatic music & screaming)

699
00:57:27,462 --> 00:57:29,453
ln jail? Are you sure?

700
00:57:33,635 --> 00:57:34,602
ls Luleen there?

701
00:57:34,736 --> 00:57:36,363
Does she know?

702
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:41,037
ln the what...in the army?

703
00:57:41,576 --> 00:57:44,875
Go get her, will you?

704
00:57:50,085 --> 00:57:53,953
Ha...hi...hi...hi...

705
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:57,251
Do you miss me?

706
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:00,651
l miss you.

707
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:06,392
You did?

708
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:09,028
That's wonderful.

709
00:58:09,604 --> 00:58:11,629
Are you being a good girl?

710
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:21,413
l don't think so honey...
l know l promised, but, huh...

711
00:58:21,983 --> 00:58:24,713
a couple of things

712
00:58:27,956 --> 00:58:30,390

715
00:58:42,537 --> 00:58:46,439
Yea...huh...put your
grandma back on, O.K.?

716
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:50,672
Hi...

717
00:58:55,383 --> 00:59:00,377

00:59:04,058 --> 00:59:05,787

721
00:59:10,565 --> 00:59:14,501
O.K., bye.

722
00:59:20,842 --> 00:59:23,572
Great, great, oh...

723
00:59:24,078 --> 00:59:25,409
Oh!!

724
00:59:25,713 --> 00:59:27,613
l got one here, look...

725
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:33,047
Oh look...look, look, look...

726
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:34,619
Oh no, l like this one better.

727
00:59:34,889 --> 00:59:35,981
Look Henry. Henry look.

728
00:59:36,524 --> 00:59:38,890
l love it, l love her.

729
00:59:40,862 --> 00:59:43,626
Ah god, look at that dress...
look at the way it moves.

730
00:59:44,098 --> 00:59:45,292
Oh yea!

731
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,668
Pull up next to her, please...

732
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:48,859
(crashing sound)

733
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:51,404
Look what you did!!

734
00:59:51,573 --> 00:59:55,873
Oh God! Oh Jesus!

735
00:59:56,477 --> 00:59:59,378
Look at it... it's ruined.

736
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:01,546
Damn Henry you ought to look
where you're driving.

737
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:04,478
Who the hell told you to stick
your head out the window anyway?

738
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:05,986
You could of killed me!

739
01:00:06,087 --> 01:00:08,078
That's right... blame it on me!

740
01:00:08,223 --> 01:00:13,217
Oh, this fucking camera!

741
01:00:13,595 --> 01:00:14,527
What did you do that for?

742
01:00:14,629 --> 01:00:17,689
lt wasn't any good anymore.

743
01:00:17,899 --> 01:00:18,593
Could have fixed it.

744
01:00:18,933 --> 01:00:21,163
Shit, the lens
was busted right off!

745
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:22,399
Could have fixed it!

746
01:00:22,704 --> 01:00:24,365
How do you know?
You a camera repair man?!

747
01:00:24,806 --> 01:00:27,400
You should have said something.

748
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:28,531
You didn't give
me a chance Otis.

749
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,873
You threw the fucker
right out the window.

750
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:32,143
lt ain't my fault it broke.

751
01:00:32,347 --> 01:00:33,439
Oh right.

752
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,549
Go back and get it if you want.

753
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:39,344
Yeah.

754
01:00:46,928 --> 01:00:48,225
Want to get a beer?

755
01:00:48,529 --> 01:00:49,587
Not particularly.

756
01:00:50,164 --> 01:00:51,426
l want a beer.

757
01:00:54,435 --> 01:00:58,633
lf you want a beer so bad, Otis
go ahead and get one.

758
01:00:58,773 --> 01:01:00,900
All right, l will.

759
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,247
See you later.

760
01:01:06,347 --> 01:01:07,336
Yeah.

761
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:15,821
l talked to Lurleen.

762
01:01:16,157 --> 01:01:17,784
Yea?

763
01:01:18,293 --> 01:01:19,692
You'd like her...

764
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:22,796
God, l miss her.

765
01:01:23,331 --> 01:01:24,923
l'm thinking...

766
01:01:25,366 --> 01:01:28,028
l might be heading
on back home.

767
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:30,798
l quit.

768
01:01:31,172 --> 01:01:32,104
You quit what?

769
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:35,568
My job.

770
01:01:35,877 --> 01:01:37,708
What happened?

771
01:01:38,813 --> 01:01:41,145
l just figured
it was time to go home.

772
01:01:44,419 --> 01:01:45,852
You want to come with me?

773
01:01:45,987 --> 01:01:49,946
l thought you wanted
to make some money?

774
01:01:50,158 --> 01:01:51,989
Yeah...but...

775
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,756
l'm thinking l don't want to
bring Lurleen up here after all.

776
01:01:57,031 --> 01:01:58,362
You know that was my intention.

777
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:03,228
There's just too much
going on up here.

778
01:02:03,538 --> 01:02:05,802
She'd get lost.

779
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:11,378
We're better off
living with mama.

780
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:15,479
l can work back home,

781
01:02:16,017 --> 01:02:17,314
l won't make as much money,
l'm sure.

782
01:02:17,618 --> 01:02:19,882
But we won't need
as much either.

783
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:22,587
l can live with mama.

784
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:26,524
You can stay there, too.

785
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,628
You figure it's safe
to go back?

786
01:02:31,866 --> 01:02:32,730
l hope so.

787
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:38,203
Leroy's in jail for murder and
his bond's a million dollars.

788
01:02:38,773 --> 01:02:41,071
So, unless he wins the lottery

789
01:02:41,476 --> 01:02:44,104
Leroy won't be going anywhere
for quite a while.

790
01:02:44,712 --> 01:02:47,112
Where's Otis?

791
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:50,840
He had a dinner date
l think he said.

792
01:02:51,152 --> 01:02:53,143
Really?

793
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:58,416
Come with me?

794
01:02:58,993 --> 01:03:00,756
When are you leaving?

795
01:03:01,129 --> 01:03:02,892
Tomorrow.

796
01:03:03,498 --> 01:03:05,329
Huh.

797
01:03:08,336 --> 01:03:09,963
Better think fast Henry.

798
01:03:12,974 --> 01:03:14,271
You got your ticket?

799
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:18,170
Not yet, but my mind's made up.

800
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:21,007
Might as well just do it.

801
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:26,081
Might as well.

802
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,187
l'd rather ride with you.

803
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:33,850
Let me think about it.

804
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:39,263
l'll tell you what...

805
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:41,502
let's me and you
go get us a steak dinner,

806
01:03:41,669 --> 01:03:43,261
l'm buying, huh?

807
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:45,602
l got a new Visa card
l want to try out.

808
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:48,101
You got a Visa card?

809
01:03:48,443 --> 01:03:51,276
Yea, who you think you're
associating with anyway?

810
01:03:51,612 --> 01:03:53,705
Great, lets go.

811
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:54,805
Alright.

812
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:55,747
Where we going?

813
01:03:55,883 --> 01:03:58,249
We'll find a place.

814
01:03:59,687 --> 01:04:01,245
Grab your jacket and let's go.

815
01:04:17,905 --> 01:04:19,600
Becky: l gotta go
to the bathroom.

816
01:04:42,597 --> 01:04:44,792
He's passed out.

817
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:12,184
music

818
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:42,479
l ain't interrupting
nothing, am l?

819
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:50,325
You guys want a beer?

820
01:05:50,765 --> 01:05:54,292
You got any cigarettes?

821
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:57,231
Not since Superman died.

822
01:05:59,907 --> 01:06:02,467
l gotta go out and get some
cigarettes...

823
01:06:03,077 --> 01:06:04,237
get some air.

824
01:06:05,179 --> 01:06:05,975
l'll be right back l promise...

825
01:06:06,247 --> 01:06:07,236
l just need some air.

826
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:10,145
Do you want anything?

827
01:06:13,688 --> 01:06:14,450
Otis?

828
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:16,848
No.

829
01:06:25,032 --> 01:06:28,195
How about getting
your poor ol' brother a beer?

Two sixty.

836
01:07:38,673 --> 01:07:40,038
Hey, how about
those Bears?

837
01:07:40,274 --> 01:07:42,401
Fuck the Bears.

838
01:07:42,943 --> 01:07:45,537
O.K.

839
01:08:00,561 --> 01:08:01,118

Hi.

841
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:04,721
That's a nice looking dog

842
01:08:05,132 --> 01:08:05,359
Thank you.

843
01:08:05,566 --> 01:08:06,828

57 varieties.

847
01:08:12,473 --> 01:08:13,337
What?

848
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:16,738
lt's a mutt...
half Yorkshire, half Shitzu.

849
01:08:17,278 --> 01:08:19,371
Oh, Shitzu, huh?

850
01:08:19,914 --> 01:08:21,245
What's his name?

851
01:08:21,382 --> 01:08:22,212
Delores.

852
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:23,644
What?

853
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:25,518
Her name is Delores.

854
01:08:26,053 --> 01:08:27,884
That's a nice name.

855
01:08:28,222 --> 01:08:32,181
Did you hear that Delores?
say thank you.

856
01:08:32,393 --> 01:08:37,558
We gotta go, bye now.

Adios, mother fucker!

(screaming & dramatic music)

861
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:34,967
Relax, take it easy...

862
01:11:38,746 --> 01:11:39,770
Why don't you
call the police?

863
01:11:40,381 --> 01:11:41,075
No, no, no...

864
01:11:41,482 --> 01:11:41,880
What about Otis?

865
01:11:42,016 --> 01:11:43,210
lt's not a good idea.

866
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:45,676
What are we going to do?

867
01:11:45,819 --> 01:11:47,252
Let me think!
Shut up! Let me think!

868
01:11:47,421 --> 01:11:48,513
(screaming)
Shut up!

869
01:11:49,056 --> 01:11:51,490
Let me think!

01:15:05,018 --> 01:15:07,213
You want to listen
to the radio?

874
01:15:09,356 --> 01:15:12,052
Henry...

875
01:15:12,593 --> 01:15:14,185
that was so awful.

876
01:15:17,464 --> 01:15:19,295
l'm scared.

877
01:15:22,903 --> 01:15:24,996
What do we do now?

878
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:28,871
We just got to keep moving
that's for sure.

879
01:15:31,044 --> 01:15:35,003
My sister owns a ranch
outside of San Bernadino.

880
01:15:35,382 --> 01:15:37,976
She raises horses there.

881
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:40,883
She's got about
1/2 dozen of them.

882
01:15:41,321 --> 01:15:43,186
Arabians...
they're beautiful.

883
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:47,426
We can stay there
as long as we want to.

884
01:15:47,828 --> 01:15:51,025
What about Lurleen?

885
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:55,329
We'll send for her
as soon as we get there.

886
01:15:58,672 --> 01:15:59,934
You promise?

887
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:02,935
l promise.

888
01:16:11,151 --> 01:16:13,085
l love you Henry.

889
01:16:16,023 --> 01:16:18,685
l guess, l love you too.

890
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:28,893
Where are we
going to go now?

891
01:16:29,036 --> 01:16:31,834
We'll find a place.

892
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:41,507
You want to listen
to the radio?

893
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,886
O.K.

(radio playing)

895
01:18:15,008 --> 01:18:17,340
This is a nice guitar...

896
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:21,240
used to play a little...

897
01:18:21,615 --> 01:18:23,845
but, l'm out of practice.

898
01:18:28,822 --> 01:18:30,551
We better go to bed now.
