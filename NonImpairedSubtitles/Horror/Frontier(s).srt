00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:40,497
That son of a bitch
ratted on us.

164
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:42,257
I can't leave you.

165
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:44,018
No! No!

166
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,954
Yes. Go away.

167
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:52,050
Miss?

168
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:56,721
We have a few questions
to ask you.

169
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:58,673
No!

170
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:01,297
Miss, stop! Stop!

171
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,450
Shit!

172
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:08,113
Hit the gas!

173
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,649
What did you do,
God damn it?

174
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,217
He's dead!

175
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:15,697
Damn it!

176
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,353
Great, now your brother's
gonna rat on us.

177
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:26,289
He won't rat on us.
He's dead!

178
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,769
Please, I want
to go back home!

179
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:38,705
I'm done.

180
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:43,024
Please, I'll say nothing,
I swear.

181
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,721
We're gonna go
right to the end.

182
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,129
Things
are different now.

183
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,337
<i># Ooh #</i>

184
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:56,113
<i># When you talk to me,</i>
<i>I'm liking it #</i>

185
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:57,265
Okay,
that's my last joint.

186
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:59,537
Liar.

187
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,121
Okay, my second to last.
Third to last, maximum.

188
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,009
We're still in France here?

189
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,153
We're in the Middle Ages.

190
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:20,817
Seriously, we're better
in our high rises.

191
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,954
Have you ever been
out of the slum?

192
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:30,737
Yeah.

193
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:33,105
For my parents'
funerals in Blida.

194
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:37,777
But since then,
I kept to myself.

195
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,257
But I told myself,

196
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,593
next time I leave the slum,
that'll be it.

197
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:48,625
No one's waiting for me.

198
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,321
Not even a small slut?

199
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:53,297
You idiot.

200
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:55,537
Not even a small slut.

201
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:00,176
Why are you stopping?

202
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:01,233
Get out!

203
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,225
What?

204
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:03,153
Get out.

205
00:15:04,722 --> 00:15:05,617
Why?

206
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,881
Get out!

207
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:13,457
Sorry, man, but I keep
the cash. Get out!

208
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,642
What?

209
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:19,280
Why are you
doing this to me?

210
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:21,201
I said get out.

211
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:25,457
I told you to get out,
okay? Get out!

212
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,377
You want me
to fuck you or what?

213
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:30,640
Damn it, you're hurting me.
I never betrayed you.

214
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:32,657
What did I say?
I told you to get out!

215
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:34,736
Last time I'm saying it
or I'll fuck you! Okay?

216
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:37,393
Okay, I'm getting out.
Leave me alone.

217
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,025
Hey, dude, I'm kidding.

218
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:40,977
Stop being such a wimp.

219
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:42,641
You bastard.

220
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,489
Man,
you really got scared?

221
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,057
Hey, you're a man.

222
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:48,242
[phone rings]

223
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:49,392
I pushed you a little,

224
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:50,929
and you're
acting like a wimp.

225
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,825
Hello.

226
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,288
<i>Tom, it's me.</i>

227
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,161
We're on the road.

228
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:04,369
No, no, it's okay. They said
he's gonna be all right.

229
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,353
You're together there?

230
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:08,241
We'll be
there in three hours.

231
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,416
See you then.

232
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:14,353
Why didn't you tell them?

233
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:16,880
It's going to be messy.

234
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,161
You're
not alone in this fuss.

235
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,048
We're all concerned,
so please make an effort.

236
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,713
Come on, load the joint well.
Make me a heavy one.

237
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:26,961
Don't worry, you bugger.

238
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:28,752
After that, I quit.

239
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,385
You quit?

240
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:32,432
Yeah, to please my mom.

241
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:34,705
It's time for me
to become a man.

242
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:40,528
I'm starting
to get tired.

243
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,321
Yeah, me, too.

244
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:43,377
What does the sign say?

245
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,816
There you go.

246
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:46,706
Great! There's always rooms
here. That's perfect.

247
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:36,721
[yawn]

248
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,321
You take the cash?

249
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:39,281
Hello?

250
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:40,401
Huh?

251
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:41,968
Hey, cool, man.
You're not in Paris here.

252
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,985
Okay, but take the cash.
Don't leave it here.

253
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:44,977
[laughing]

254
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:53,328
We're gonna do fine here.

255
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:03,057
Good evening, ladies.
Can we get a room?

256
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,313
Everything
is possible here.

257
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:15,089
All the rooms
are available.

258
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,561
Well,
it's our lucky day.

259
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:20,337
I don't know.
You have a lucky number?

260
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:23,248
2. We can do so many
things in twos.

261
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:27,505
You two?

262
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:29,681
Us three.

263
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:30,928
Huh?

264
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:35,505
I'll have to ask
for permission.

265
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,841
Goetz, we've got customers.

266
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:38,608
Are you insane?

267
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:39,504
She's hot, she's hot.

268
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:43,281
Goetz! Are you asleep
or what?

269
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:47,537
Goetz!

270
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:06,544
What's going on?

271
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,465
Do you know
if 2 is ready?

272
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:12,017
For how long?

273
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,520
For one night.

274
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:22,481
Go get a seat. Come on,
girls, take care of them.

275
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,808
Thanks.

276
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,249
Can I
offer you a drink?

277
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,177
With pleasure.

278
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:33,809
In all honesty, ladies,

279
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,144
I didn't know
that in coming here,

280
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:38,384
we would come upon
beauties like you.

281
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,456
You are really superb.

282
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:44,881
That's nice. Isn't it?
What do you think?

283
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:47,345
Drop it, Tom.
They're prick teases.

284
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:48,752
It's true.
It's a change.

285
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:51,057
Guys like you,
it's not every day.

286
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:55,889
Well, yeah, don't you
want a guy like me?

287
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,265
A real man.

288
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,664
You probably don't
see many in here.

289
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,905
Usually we have
truck drivers here.

290
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:04,241
You, you look sensitive.

291
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:06,257
He bangs anything
that moves.

292
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,216
Hey Farid, you're crazy.

293
00:20:07,217 --> 00:20:10,544
Don't make me
look bad like that.

294
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:15,120
No, you're right, Gilberte.
I'm a sensitive guy.

295
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:18,960
Look, my sensitivity
is right here.

296
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:20,305
And it's there, too.

297
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,712
You look embarrassed.
Are you shy?

298
00:20:33,713 --> 00:20:36,369
No, no,
I've got a girlfriend.

299
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,800
Hey, don't stop!
Go till the end.

300
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:45,840
Tom, take it easy because
tomorrow we have a long

301
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,337
Hey, virgin,
leave the adult working.

302
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:56,369
Well, well, well you're not
doing badly for yourselves!

303
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:59,792
At least you're not gay.

304
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:04,240
Gilberte, show them the room.

305
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,025
You'll be more comfortable.

306
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:09,584
Are you coming?
- Me?

307
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,729
You asked me to go
till the end, right?

308
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,849
Claudia,
take care of him.

309
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:16,656
You're not
going to stay alone?

310
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:18,993
No, no, I'm finishing
my drink peacefully,

311
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,369
then I'm gonna
call my girlfriend

312
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,489
because
she's probably worried.

313
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,489
You don't know
what you're missing.

314
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:07,440
Shit!

315
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:23,697
Small boobs. That's good.

316
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:26,640
I think I'm going to like it.

317
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:39,792
Come here, come here.
I'll take care of you.

318
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:41,648
Stop that. I've got
a girlfriend, damn it.

319
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:50,257
Hey, stop that.
I'm tired of that.

320
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:51,856
Hey, Tom, I'm gonna punch her.

321
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,080
You have a problem
or what?

322
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:17,393
Something wrong?

323
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:19,856
Let's say that I didn't think
we'd eat like a family,

324
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,128
but I'm all right.
- It's more cozy.

325
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,872
Give me your plates.

326
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:40,785
You'll tell me how it is.
It's going to perk you up!

327
00:23:58,673 --> 00:24:01,264
That's good.
What is it exactly?

328
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:03,377
It's cooked in pork fat.

329
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:06,800
You won't be cold tonight!

330
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,305
It'll make you feel good.

331
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:09,552
You're a skinny guy, huh?

332
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:10,928
Yeah, but I don't eat pork.

333
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,208
It's not allowed
in my religion.

334
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,848
What do you mean?
Are you Jewish?

335
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,288
No, no, I'm Muslim,

336
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,336
but it's just that I don't
like pork, that's all.

337
00:24:20,337 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, girls, give me a hand.

338
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:27,793
Open her mouth.

339
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:31,888
Make an effort!

340
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,520
Come on, Mom,
make an effort!

341
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:34,609
Come on!

342
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,449
Come on,
open your mouth!

343
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,265
Doing it on purpose or what?

344
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:47,856
Open your mouth!
I'm not doing it for you.

345
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:52,497
Oh come on!

346
00:24:52,498 --> 00:24:55,888
Chew it! Bitch! Are you
doing it on purpose or what?

347
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:58,992
He's not hungry
anymore?

348
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:00,848
Neither of us is.
What the hell is that?

349
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,169
Come on Gil, let's go.
That's over the top.

350
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:06,960
Forget it. I have to
take care of Mom.

351
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:09,329
Plus, I'm not
in the mood anymore.

352
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,704
All right! Fine.

353
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:13,904
What's wrong?
You're not happy?

354
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:15,377
Family dinners
aren't my thing anyway.

355
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:17,009
But thanks, though,
and enjoy your meal.

356
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:22,000
Tom, don't go.

357
00:25:22,001 --> 00:25:23,600
What's going on?

358
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:25,008
You were right, Farid.
They are whores.

359
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:30,288
No, no, sorry.
This is not what he meant.

360
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,888
He was kidding.

361
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:34,256
Damn it, are you nuts or what?
See how you talk?

362
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,080
What a bitch, damn it.

363
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,648
Especially after
how I banged her,

364
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:43,952
and then she's not
in the mood anymore.

365
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:46,448
I told you
they were whores.

366
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,944
It was too good
to be true.

367
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:51,473
I'm pissed off.
I'm so pissed off.

368
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:53,264
[phone rings]

369
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:55,921
Damn it, it's Yas.
She's going to kill me.

370
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:56,912
Answer, please,
because I can't.

371
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:01,360
Yeah!

372
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,281
<i>Tom? Damn it,</i>
<i>what were you doing?</i>

373
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:05,360
<i>We've been trying to</i>
<i>find you for two hours.</i>

374
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:08,624
Don't get mad.
What's up with you guys?

375
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,640
<i>Tom, it's a mess.</i>

376
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,752
<i>It didn't go well</i>
<i>at the hospital.</i>

377
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:16,496
Okay, okay.

378
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:18,033
<i>Where are you guys?</i>

379
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:23,408
We're in a hostel as planned.
I'll text you the address.

380
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:26,673
<i>Don't say a word</i>
<i>to Farid, okay?</i>

381
00:26:26,674 --> 00:26:28,945
Okay, don't worry.
Hurry. Bye.

382
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:35,632
Dude, you look awful.
Is it because of that bitch?

383
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:38,224
No, I don't give a shit
about that whore.

384
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:42,001
I don't care, plus her pussy
doesn't smell good.

385
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:01,137
It's them.

386
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:05,104
What's wrong?

387
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:06,160
Nothing.

388
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:12,753
<i>Hello to all.</i>
<i>The interior minister</i>

389
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:15,664
<i>and future candidate</i>
<i>in the presidential election</i>

390
00:27:15,665 --> 00:27:17,488
<i>spoke about the rioting</i>

391
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:19,824
<i>and decided to use security</i>

392
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:21,552

<i>of his campaign.</i>

393
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:25,200
<i>Meanwhile, the police stepped in</i>
<i>to contain the riots.</i>

394
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,057
Look at this faggot.

395
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:28,624
What a piece of shit.

396
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,480
If I had him
in front of me,

397
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,240
I'd kill him
with my bare hands.

398
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:33,488
He's a murderer.

399
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:34,672
Fascist country.

400
00:27:34,673 --> 00:27:36,976
I told you that France was
10 years behind the USA.

401
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:38,160
[knock on door]

402
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:39,376
Finally now we have
our George Bush.

403
00:27:41,713 --> 00:27:43,759
You came to apologize?

404
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,673
No, someone wants
to see you.

405
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:52,112
Hi, good evening.

406
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:53,808
Good evening.

407
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:56,047
Good evening.

408
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:01,168
I think you know
why I'm here.

409
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:02,481
No, not at all.

410
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:05,009
Where do you come from?

411
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,607
From the Paris suburbs.

412
00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:11,280
Gangsters? Car burners?

413
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:17,712
What are you doing here?
Integrating yourselves?

414
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:19,024
We're going to Holland

415
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:21,136
I'm not talking
to you, rag head.

416
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,432
So?

417
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:25,585
Well, he's telling the truth.

418
00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:26,704
We're going to Amsterdam

419
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,368
to visit some friends,
that's it.

420
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:29,839
Right.

421
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,593
Getting stoned,
banging some whores.

422
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:37,360
And you started it here.

423
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:40,240
Maybe it looks like a brothel.

424
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:43,024
Hold on, sir.

425
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:49,008
First, they hit on us.
Second, we're human--

426
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:50,800
You're saying that
my sisters are whores?

427
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,240
No, no.

428
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:54,768
Did you enjoy it,
at least?

429
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:55,824
What?

430
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:58,928
I asked you if you enjoyed it.
- Ohh!

431
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:00,304
It's not complicated,
damn it.

432
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,328
Did you enjoy it?

433
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:06,864
Yeah, yeah.

434
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:14,416
Hands on your head!
Come on!

435
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:17,776
What did we do?

436
00:29:17,777 --> 00:29:20,304
Gil told me you have
a bag full of cash.

437
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:21,584
That's bullshit.

438
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:22,833
Yeah, bullshit.

439
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:23,888
Yes, it's here.

440
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:25,264
Gilberte, what are you
talking about?

441
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,417
It's just
some dirty laundry.

442
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:28,207
You can check it yourself.

443
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:30,416
Goetz! Goetz! Goetz!

444
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:32,240
Go away! Hurry!

445
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,361
Don't move or I'll kill you!

446
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:47,055
Stop it! Stop it, damn it!

447
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,168
Stop it!
- Aah!

448
00:29:57,073 --> 00:29:58,544
I'm getting ready!

449
00:29:58,545 --> 00:29:59,824
Hurry up!

450
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,777
Tom, my brother.

451
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:07,312
Don't move, I said!

452
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:10,351
Tom.

453
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:12,689
Goetz! You didn't kill him.

454
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:28,561
Go catch them! Hurry!

455
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:30,992
Raah!

456
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:36,528
Hurry! Move, damn it!

457
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:41,008
Start it!
Start it, damn it!

458
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:56,368
Bastard!

459
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:12,528
Faster, damn it! Faster!

460
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:18,129
Damn it! Hit the gas!

461
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:26,959
Go straight!

462
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,976
I'll get you little faggots!

463
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:30,224
Come on!

464
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:41,488
We're going to die!
We're going to die, damn it!

465
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:53,648
No!

466
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:13,743
[Alex]
Which road?

467
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:15,632
[Yasmine]
Turn left.

468
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,440
So?

469
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:38,832
They fell in the pit
of the old mine.

470
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,320
Take this. I found that.

471
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:47,216
Klaudia!

472
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:08,880
Farid, help me.

473
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:12,688
Farid, come help me.

474
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:18,704
Farid, please, I'm in pain.

475
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:33,359
Come on. Come on.

476
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:45,168
Come on. Careful.

477
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:55,760
Where are we?

478
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:21,136
You're all right?

479
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,471
Good evening.
- Good evening.

480
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:33,359
We're here to see
some friends who came here.

481
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,104
You are the friends
of Tom and Farid.

482
00:34:37,105 --> 00:34:38,192
You know them?

483
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,311
Yeah, they're very nice.

484
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:42,192
They went to the cottage
not too far from here.

485
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:44,015
Why didn't they
stay here?

486
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:45,488
The hostel is full.

487
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:48,432
Can you tell us
which road to take?

488
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:51,728
I can take you.
I was going to go there.

489
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:53,647
Klaudia, you come with us.
We need you.

490
00:34:58,256 --> 00:34:59,856
Come this way.

491
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:01,872
Did you see
how she talks to me?

492
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:03,312
I can't take her
anymore.

493
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:04,880
Klaudia,
do what Gilberte says.

494
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,255
I'm not her dog!

495
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:07,663
Well, make an effort!

496
00:35:07,664 --> 00:35:09,679
You're going to
replace her soon.

497
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,176
<i>Karl? Karl! Damn it!</i>

498
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:22,096
Goetz.

499
00:35:22,097 --> 00:35:23,248
<i>Yeah.</i>

500
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:24,816
I'm closing the road.
Come back quickly.

501
00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:26,672
Father doesn't like to wait.

502
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:43,823
Damn! It smells like death.
Did you shit on yourself?

503
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:46,384
It's here. That smell
is coming from here.

504
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,527
You know what to do.
We have to get out of here.

505
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:01,808
What the hell is that?

506
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:04,880
You think we can fit?

507
00:36:04,881 --> 00:36:06,512
You go first.
I'll push you, okay?

508
00:36:06,513 --> 00:36:07,471
Let's go.

509
00:36:11,312 --> 00:36:14,511
1, 2, 3! Come on.

510
00:36:15,568 --> 00:36:16,687
Is it okay?

511
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:21,616
Damn it!

512
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:29,616
What's in there?

513
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:31,408
I see some light.

514
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:34,896
Be careful, I'm coming.

515
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:39,311
Do you hear me?

516
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:45,296
Come on! Come on!

517
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,591
Come on! Push!

00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:57,871
Come on! Let's go.

519
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:07,504
Go on, push.

520
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:08,719
I can't breathe.

521
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,384
Me, neither.
I can't breathe, but keep going.

522
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:14,096
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

523
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:20,943
Tom! Come on!

524
00:37:31,472 --> 00:37:33,168
Tom, come on! Keep moving.

525
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,648
Come on, dude.

526
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:53,296
I'm blocked!

527
00:37:53,297 --> 00:37:54,575
Come on,
you're almost there.

528
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:56,175
I'm blocked!
I can't do it anymore.

529
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:58,287
Me, neither, but come on,
God damn it, move!

530
00:37:58,288 --> 00:38:01,488
I'm blocked, I said!

531
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,791
I'm blocked, damn it!

[sobbing]

533
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:07,343
Asshole.

534
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:09,360
Come on!

535
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:11,279
We're dead.

536
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:15,952
I'm going to die, Mama. Mama.

537
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,007
Come on, Tom, dude,
you're almost there.

538
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,255
Push!

539
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:23,215
No!

540

[sobbing]

541
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:25,583
I can't!

542
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:27,343
Come on, you're a man,
damn it!

543
00:38:27,344 --> 00:38:29,296
But I'm blocked, damn it!

544
00:38:29,297 --> 00:38:30,575
You're a faggot!
Come on, move it!

545
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:31,920
Shut up!

546
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:33,775
Move!
- Shut the fuck up!

547
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:34,768
Move, you damn bastard!

548
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:36,719
Shut the fuck up, damn it!

549
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,743
Come on!

Move, move, move, come on!

Move your ass!
Come on, come on!

Come on, Tom!

553
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:50,575
Turn right. It's
at the end of the road.

554
00:39:50,576 --> 00:39:52,464
Where are we?

555
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:53,711
We're on an old mine site,

556
00:39:53,712 --> 00:39:55,088
closed since the beginning
of the century.

557
00:40:33,616 --> 00:40:35,088
Take your time.

558
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:36,687
I'm going to warn them
you're here.

559
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:48,592
Stop it!

560
00:42:02,065 --> 00:42:03,855
Be careful,
she's very shy.

561
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:05,679
Good evening.

562
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:08,751
Good evening.

563
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,151
Have a seat.

564
00:42:13,456 --> 00:42:14,960
Thank you very much.

565
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,599
Klaudia, go boil
some water, please.

566
00:42:32,337 --> 00:42:35,951
It's for hunting. There's
a lot of game around here.

567
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:37,904
Where are you going?

568
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:39,407
We're going to Holland.

569
00:42:39,408 --> 00:42:41,936
Some business
to take care of there.

570
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:44,687
Excuse me, can I go
the bathroom, please?

571
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:46,511
Well, sure.

572
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:52,015
Follow me.

573
00:42:59,408 --> 00:43:00,784
Are you guys married?

574
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:02,255
No, we're not together
anymore.

575
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:05,327
It's the small door
right there.

576
00:43:54,736 --> 00:43:56,816
Are you hungry?
Want something?

577
00:43:56,817 --> 00:43:58,575
No, thank you, I'm fine.

578
00:44:19,664 --> 00:44:22,895
Shut your mouth!

579
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,463
He's coming.
Klaudia, come with me.

580
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,216
Who's coming?

581
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:37,200
Father.

582
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:39,087
Sit up straight. He doesn't
like when we're slumped.

583
00:44:58,288 --> 00:45:02,704
Welcome to our place,
young lady.

584
00:45:26,064 --> 00:45:27,727
What's your name?

585
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,215
Yasmine.

586
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:38,319
Your hand.

587
00:46:04,976 --> 00:46:06,575
Leave.

588
00:46:11,088 --> 00:46:12,143
Tom.

589
00:46:16,304 --> 00:46:18,543
Alex, get out of here.

590
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,655
Go away.

591
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,095
Get out of here.

592
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,135
Something's wrong?
- We're getting out of here.

593
00:47:21,136 --> 00:47:23,087
What?
- Get up! We're getting out of here!

594
00:47:23,088 --> 00:47:24,847
Stop it!
- Get up. We're leaving.

595
00:47:24,848 --> 00:47:26,575
What's going on?

596
00:47:26,576 --> 00:47:27,567
Everything's okay.

597
00:47:27,568 --> 00:47:28,879
Stop lying to us!

598
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,319
Our friend is dying!

[Yasmine]
Stop it!

600
00:47:31,376 --> 00:47:33,840
Stop it!
- Come!

602
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:57,487
Hang them up!
And skim the fat off of them!

603
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:09,646
Listen to me.

604
00:48:12,304 --> 00:48:16,336
We need to renew
the family's blood.

605
00:48:20,143 --> 00:48:24,494
But I'm hesitating.

606
00:48:24,495 --> 00:48:26,959
They're young.

607
00:48:28,943 --> 00:48:30,511
Look at her skin...

608
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:33,327
[Yasmine wailing]

609
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:34,735
Her hair...

610
00:48:34,736 --> 00:48:36,207
Aah!

611
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:37,871
her eyes.

612
00:48:39,344 --> 00:48:41,711
She's not pure...

613
00:48:43,824 --> 00:48:47,663
but we don't have
any choice.

614
00:48:47,664 --> 00:48:51,759
You need a wife
to take over for me.

615
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,736
She'll be yours.

616
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:03,662
Remember, faithfulness.

617

Gut him.
I'll come carve him later.

618
00:52:23,055 --> 00:52:24,847
I'm going to see
what's going on.

619
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:25,839
It's the children.

620
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:36,206
The children
are in the storeroom.

621
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,495
They probably
smelled the meat.

622
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:42,447
We already asked you
to take care of that.

623
00:53:47,215 --> 00:53:49,071
I'm coming with you.
Klaudia, it's all right.

Go. Go!

Get out of here! Go away!

You can go. Hurry up!

01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:09,934
Get lost! Get lost! Damn it!

655
01:00:22,222 --> 01:00:23,534
Where is she?

656
01:00:23,535 --> 01:00:26,350
In your ass,
you dirty Nazi!

657
01:00:28,943 --> 01:00:33,230
The tongs!
Go get me the tongs!

658
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:40,175
No! What are going to do?

659
01:00:40,176 --> 01:00:47,054
Small precaution to be sure
you won't run away.

660
01:00:47,055 --> 01:00:47,758
[groaning]

661
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:56,047
No, no!
- Hold him.

662
01:01:02,864 --> 01:01:03,983
In Africa--

663
01:01:03,984 --> 01:01:05,454
Aah!

664
01:01:05,455 --> 01:01:08,558
...the owners of diamond mines
use this method

665
01:01:08,558 --> 01:01:13,134
to keep the workers
from running away.

666
01:01:15,536 --> 01:01:18,671
Aah!

667
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:23,534
Ha ha!

668
01:01:23,535 --> 01:01:27,501
They cut their Achilles tendon

669
01:01:27,502 --> 01:01:29,935
just like that.

670
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,142
Just like that.

671
01:01:32,143 --> 01:01:33,102
Aah!

672
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:35,789
Like that.

673
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,390
[wailing]

674
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:39,214
Like that.

675
01:01:39,215 --> 01:01:44,590
Then the slaves could
keep working in peace.

676
01:01:44,591 --> 01:01:46,414
The workers!

677
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:17,678
Stop, Stop!

678
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:25,711
Please,
help me get the police.

679
01:03:26,831 --> 01:03:28,814
Get in. I'll help you.

680
01:03:58,895 --> 01:04:00,302
You're making a U-Turn?

681
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:04,622
No. I'm taking you
back home.

682
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:09,006
No! No! No!

683
01:04:09,007 --> 01:04:10,894
Quiet!

684
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:12,877
Aah! Aah!

685
01:04:12,878 --> 01:04:16,175
Are you going
to shut the fuck up?

686
01:04:16,175 --> 01:04:18,030
Aah!

687
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:20,494
Shut the fuck up!

688
01:04:25,647 --> 01:04:27,438
No.

689
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:17,070
One last wish?

690
01:05:17,071 --> 01:05:20,142
Just one.

691
01:05:20,143 --> 01:05:21,549
Kill me!

692
01:05:35,055 --> 01:05:37,806
You son of a bitch!

693
01:05:47,055 --> 01:05:48,399
Garbage can.

694
01:05:52,206 --> 01:05:54,542
Spirit is a bone.

695
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,166
Come on! Hans,
to the preserving room.

696
01:07:03,214 --> 01:07:04,622
Uncuff her!

697
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:27,342
She's pregnant.

698
01:07:29,775 --> 01:07:31,918
That's wonderful.

699
01:08:31,151 --> 01:08:32,878
Just few days to wait.

700
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:37,359
Soon you'll be family.

701
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:50,893
You'll
sleep in my bedroom

702
01:08:50,894 --> 01:08:52,846
while we're
preparing one for you.

703
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:54,446
Okay?

704
01:08:57,294 --> 01:09:01,293
You're so cold. Hold on.

705
01:09:01,294 --> 01:09:03,118
I have a little secret
to warm you up.

706
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,653
We are the same,
you and I.

707
01:09:14,959 --> 01:09:17,454
Father is really happy
since I told him

708
01:09:20,846 --> 01:09:22,254
Drink.

709
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:26,702
It'll make you
feel better.

710
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:29,710
Drink.

711
01:09:31,215 --> 01:09:32,814
It helps me
to make babies.

712
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:41,806
One more.

713
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:43,117
It's strong,
isn't it?

714
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:47,725
Here.

715
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,374
One more, quickly.

716
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:58,381
No. In your condition,
it's not good.

717
01:10:31,055 --> 01:10:32,622
It's beautiful.

718
01:10:37,006 --> 01:10:39,054
I'm gonna
have to cut it.

719
01:10:42,895 --> 01:10:45,037
Father doesn't like
black hair.

720
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:56,685
Father says we belong
to the perfect race.

721
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,493
He came to live here
after the big war.

722
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:07,149
Me? They took me from my
parents when I was a child.

723
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:10,478
They raised me here,
telling me that one day

724
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:12,142
my parents would
come looking for me

725
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,310
if I was smart
and did what they said.

726
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,550
Father wanted to me
to grow up quick

727
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:19,085
so I could give him an heir.

728
01:11:21,614 --> 01:11:23,758
Then came providence,

729
01:11:25,999 --> 01:11:27,629
but our children
were born with problems.

730
01:11:29,775 --> 01:11:32,302
They're not normal.

731
01:11:32,303 --> 01:11:33,678
I'm expecting my fourth.

732
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:35,886
Father says it's because
of the blood.

733
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:38,862
Why are you staying here?

734
01:11:40,687 --> 01:11:43,918
Because I'm waiting for my
parents to come get me.

735
01:11:49,135 --> 01:11:52,654
They promised. I know one day
they will come to get me.

736
01:11:52,655 --> 01:11:54,797
We can't abandon
our children like that.

737
01:11:54,798 --> 01:11:56,589
I know what I'm talking about.

738
01:11:57,902 --> 01:11:59,246
I love mine.

739
01:12:05,391 --> 01:12:06,669
When they were born,

740
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,781
Father wanted
to get rid of them.

741
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:13,774
So Hans and I, we hide them.
Now they live in the mine.

742
01:12:13,775 --> 01:12:19,086
When I have time,
I try to go see them.

743
01:12:21,263 --> 01:12:23,086
Without them, I think
I'd be dead in here.

744
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:25,901
Here's our guest.

745
01:13:36,334 --> 01:13:38,637
Please, have a seat.

746
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,797
Sit down!

747
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:05,581
In tribute
to the new mother

748
01:14:05,582 --> 01:14:07,821
of our beloved
and beautiful family,

749
01:14:09,295 --> 01:14:13,709
and to the coming
of future events:

750
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:16,301
A birth.

751
01:14:16,302 --> 01:14:20,173
If it's a girl,
we'll call her Lili.

752
01:14:20,174 --> 01:14:24,813
If it's a boy, we'll call
him Karl, like his father.

753
01:14:24,814 --> 01:14:28,942
We'll unite and bind him

754
01:14:28,943 --> 01:14:33,998
to our dear and beautiful
guest, Yasmina...

755
01:14:36,174 --> 01:14:41,101
so that this year will be
bountiful and propitious

756
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:44,141
of great new developments.

757
01:14:44,142 --> 01:14:48,558
We can already hear
the wind of victory.

758
01:14:52,815 --> 01:14:55,982
Also, I want to tell you

759
01:14:55,983 --> 01:14:58,029
that I have decided

760
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,301
to turn over the leadership
of the family...

761
01:15:00,302 --> 01:15:04,333
to the only son I'm proud of:

762
01:15:04,334 --> 01:15:07,662
Karl Von Geisler.

763
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,917
Stand up, please.

764
01:15:11,918 --> 01:15:14,733
Thank you, Father.
You honor me.

765
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:21,357
From now on,

766
01:15:21,358 --> 01:15:24,685
you'll have to obey,
in word and deed,

767
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:29,389
the sole authority
of your brother.

768
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:32,941
My son, Karl,

769
01:15:32,942 --> 01:15:37,645
with the support of
my beloved daughter...

770
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:43,182
Gilberte.

771
01:15:44,782 --> 01:15:49,037
That goes for you too,

772
01:15:49,038 --> 01:15:51,022
Hans Vonflaak.

773
01:16:29,263 --> 01:16:32,461
I think you knew
each other, didn't you?

774
01:16:37,582 --> 01:16:39,150
You're insane.

775
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:43,406
Maybe,
but probably you as well.

776
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,645
Gilberte,
my beloved daughter,

777
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:59,757
should have
explained to you

778
01:16:59,758 --> 01:17:03,085
what am I expecting
from you, right?

779
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:08,013
When they told me

780
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:12,941
you were
expecting a baby,

781
01:17:12,942 --> 01:17:16,428
I took it as an omen.

782
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:24,461
So he will
be the missing link

783
01:17:24,462 --> 01:17:27,437
of a pure race.

784
01:17:33,902 --> 01:17:35,213
He'll be nothing.

785
01:17:35,214 --> 01:17:36,493
What?

786
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:38,893
You've got to be more
respectful.

787
01:17:38,894 --> 01:17:40,813
You've got to be
obedient to Father.

788
01:17:40,814 --> 01:17:42,956
I'm not obedient!
I never will be!

789
01:17:44,014 --> 01:17:46,222
Well, he has
a lot of authority,

790
01:17:46,223 --> 01:17:47,949
our new little boss.

791
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:49,134
Goetz!

792
01:18:00,014 --> 01:18:02,412
Karl!

793
01:18:02,413 --> 01:18:05,678
Make her stand next to you.

794
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:08,429
Stand up!

795
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,421
Stand up!

796
01:18:13,614 --> 01:18:15,181
Now,

797
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:28,589
Kiss each other to seal your
union to our new family...

798
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:33,933
and put an end
to useless quarrels.

799
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:17,229
To pure blood!

800
01:19:19,469 --> 01:19:20,717
To pure blood!

801
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:40,013
Get off me!

802
01:19:42,318 --> 01:19:43,372
Let him go!

803
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:47,213
Get off me!
- Let him go!

804
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:49,453
If someone moves,
I'll cut his throat!

805
01:19:49,454 --> 01:19:53,165
You! Open the door!
Hurry! Drop it!

806
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:55,661
Let him go! I won't hesitate
to kill you, little sister!

807
01:19:55,662 --> 01:19:59,021
Come over here and I'll
bleed him like a pig!

808
01:19:59,022 --> 01:20:02,125
Hans! Drop your gun!
Listen to me!

809
01:20:02,126 --> 01:20:03,629
What are you doing, Hans?

810
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:05,292
Hans! Move your ass!

811
01:20:05,293 --> 01:20:09,613
Hans! You bastard!
Drop your gun!

812
01:20:09,614 --> 01:20:11,726
Drop it! I swear
I'm going to kill him!

813
01:20:11,727 --> 01:20:13,068
Hans!
Listen to them for once!

814
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:16,493
That's an order!

815
01:20:16,494 --> 01:20:18,798
I won't miss the bitch,
or you, either!

816
01:20:18,798 --> 01:20:20,333
Stop, Hans!

817
01:20:33,006 --> 01:20:34,989
Hans!

818
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:39,053
Hans, no, no, no!

819
01:20:46,062 --> 01:20:47,085
Kill her!

820
01:20:52,878 --> 01:20:54,029
Karl! Follow me!

821

No! Hans, no, no!

822

Hey. Get out of here.

825
01:24:05,838 --> 01:24:07,597
I said get lost!

826
01:24:09,582 --> 01:24:11,693
You belong to me, little slut.

827
01:24:23,214 --> 01:24:25,421
You belong to me,
little bitch.

828
01:24:34,157 --> 01:24:36,557
Little bitch,
you deserve this.

829
01:24:50,926 --> 01:24:53,421
You want to punch me?
You want to kick my ass?

830
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:56,141
Come here!

831
01:24:56,142 --> 01:24:57,900
Why do you want to hit me?

832
01:24:57,901 --> 01:25:00,077
Is it because you're afraid
of the little boss, huh?

833
01:25:00,078 --> 01:25:01,484
Is that why? You decide now?

834
01:25:03,118 --> 01:25:05,292
Here's your little boss.

835
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:12,236
Are you in pain?

836
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:13,612
That hurts, huh?

837
01:25:13,613 --> 01:25:14,733
No!

838
01:25:19,022 --> 01:25:21,549
You like that, huh?
Want more?

839
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:24,045
Look at your little face.

840
01:25:24,046 --> 01:25:26,829
Your little slutty face.

841
01:25:55,534 --> 01:25:56,845
Where are you going?

842
01:26:13,614 --> 01:26:15,212
People listen to me
when I speak!

843
01:26:15,213 --> 01:26:16,429
What's Father thinking?

844
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,468
What's he gonna do, huh?
What's he gonna do?

845
01:26:19,469 --> 01:26:22,989
I'm the one in charge!
I'm the boss!

846
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:25,708
I'm the one in charge here!
Do you understand?

847
01:26:25,709 --> 01:26:30,636
What's Father thinking?
He's the one who decides?

848
01:26:30,637 --> 01:26:34,125
He's the one who decides?
My ass! I'm the boss!

849
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:37,005
I'm the boss! People have
to explain themselves to me!

850
01:26:37,005 --> 01:26:39,501
Look at me when I'm talking
to you, you little slut!

851
01:26:39,502 --> 01:26:42,348
Look at me!

852
01:26:42,349 --> 01:26:43,789
Dirty slut!

853
01:29:30,285 --> 01:29:31,949
Drop that! Do you understand?

854
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:32,877
I said drop it!

855
01:30:01,933 --> 01:30:03,052
Farewell!

856
01:30:32,909 --> 01:30:34,668
I came to help you!

857
01:30:36,526 --> 01:30:37,708
Come with me.

858
01:30:37,709 --> 01:30:41,517
No, I can't abandon
my children.

859
01:30:41,518 --> 01:30:43,756
Come on! Hurry up!
They're looking for you

860
01:30:43,757 --> 01:30:45,773
I'll tell them
I didn't see you. Go!

861

It's over?

866

Is it over?

867
01:35:08,237 --> 01:35:09,260
Don't move!

868
01:35:09,261 --> 01:35:10,923
Gil! I'm begging you,
stop it!

869
