Oh, no!

00:03:20,204 --> 00:03:23,204
-Quiet honey.
-Sure you will be fine, you'll see.

17
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:30,005
Wait, wait,
only nurse!

18
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:32,706
Only the nurse, sorry
but will have to wait here.

19
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:34,007
- Are you the mother?
-Si.

20
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:35,808
He'll be fine.
No, no, wait, we go with him.

He'll be fine.

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,310
- Mom?

23
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:39,611
Mom!

24
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,012
- What?
-Estate calm, calm down.

25
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:02,013
- What you got there?
-Look...

26
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:05,014
- Oh my God!
-Could dive right there.

27
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:09,815
'It's a huge house.
-'s Beautiful.

28
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,016
'Yes, and very expensive.

29
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:13,717
-Romantic...

30
00:04:17,618 --> 00:04:18,818
-yet is so expensive...

31
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,819
-I know, I am the worst.

32
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,220
Remember, Jacob and Amber
come to dinner tomorrow.

33
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,721
Yes, I had not forgotten.

34
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:39,422
- Do you really want to tell?

35
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:42,423
'Yes.

36
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:46,824
This time looks seriously
and I'm sick to hide it.

37
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:50,925
's My best friend.

38
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,126
- Is that okay?

39
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:58,927
-You dedices.

40
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,328
Good morning .

41
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,729
- Did you cut your hair?
Yes, my wife, as always.

42
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,730

UNIT RETURNED

44

-Hey, how's it going?

45
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:26,933
'Hello Doctor.
-Hi.

46
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,734
- How are you?

47
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:32,735
Watch Me.

48
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:36,136
- So, is everything okay?
Yes, all right.

49
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:44,137
Hello, sir, you better see this morning.

50
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,138
'Yes, I slept well.

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,339
-Hey, how are you Paul?
-I'm fine.

52
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,340
'Well, I think he's going down, I think
is over fifty.

53
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:54,341
'Very well.

54
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:02,342
Good morning.

55
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:05,943
-I have a secret for you.
- What?

56
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:09,044
'I leave here.

57
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,345
- Really?

58
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,546
-'ve Come to get you.

59
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:13,747
- Yes!
- Are you happy?

60
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:15,748
I'm sad....

61
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,149
I'll miss you.

62
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,050
And you to me?
-Sure.

63
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:23,651
'Okay, is good.
Yes.

64
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:28,152
-Just have to be careful with blood,

65
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:33,153
if you are injured or damaged in some way, be sure to wear gloves
.

66
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:36,154
- Do we need to take any other precautions
special?

67
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:39,155
-
Same as with any other child his age.

68
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:40,556
- The same?

69
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:45,257
Ha injected with it every day of his life,
and if it does you can...

70
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:46,258
-must.

71
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,459
When they brought here last week,

72
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,860
would have been relieved with this result.

73
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:56,261
-Being a "Returned" is a privilege, not a curse
.

74
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:58,162
-Do not patronize me.

75
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:01,463
-I just try to help.

76
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:01,764
-Well, you can not help,

77
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:05,665
Okay?, Because you have no fucking idea what is
love someone with this.

78
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:14,666
- Is it true what they say doctor?

79
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,667
What almost no protein reserves
and can not make more?

80
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:20,368
'That's a ridiculous rumor.

81
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:23,469
His son was saved,

82
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,070
go home and enjoy it,
do not worry about this.

83
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:33,071
Thank you.

84
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:51,872
'Very well.

85
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:55,873
-Mark.

86
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:57,074
Come

87
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:59,675
-No, it's too hard for me, sir.

88
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:02,276
Is very complicated.
-I can do it, have faith, come here.

89
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:03,277
- No, seriously,

90
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:09,078
Look like one of the returnees,
every time I try my hands tremble

91
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:13,179
'Okay, well then over here, come.

92
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,580
-No, I just wanted...
- Out!

93
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:17,581
'Okay.

94
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:27,882
'Well, well, remember your pentatonic and
...

95
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:30,883
... good night to all,
pummeling.

"DEATH TO RETURNING"

97
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:52,985
Good night.

98
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,486
'Hello Kate.
-Hi.

99
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:19,387
-You know, I will not give you an increase by
you leave late Friday.

100
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:20,488
-Oh, I know.

101
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:26,488
-Johan says the boy's parents are very concerned
.

102
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:29,089
-Ya, is evident.

103
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,090
- You tell them not to worry?

104
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,991
- What else can I say?
-Ya.

105
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:40,992
'Well, take care Kate.

106
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,993
When did you eat something  last?

107
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:47,994
See us.
-Good weekend.

108
00:10:55,395 --> 00:10:58,395
- How's it going out there?
-Another day, same shit.

109
00:10:58,996 --> 00:10:59,996
Jesus...

110
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:08,997
-Forgiveness.

111
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:26,198
Thank you.

112
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:55,099
'Hello.

113
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Thank you.

114
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,301
'Here .

115
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:31,602
Thanks, good weekend.
-Also, take care.

116
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:38,003
-The situation is complicated by the minute.

117
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,704
Previously demonstrations against returnees

118
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:42,705
be used in rehabilitation centers

119
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:45,306
now are being
direct attacks throughout the city.

120
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,807
The last one occurred in the
Castle Prank,

121
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,608
where the full light of day, a
returned was assaulted by two masked men.

122
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:55,609
No
is the first time that such incidents happen but...

123
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,110
-Oh my God, here
smells wonderful!

124
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,611
-I hope he's just as good.

125
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:15,712
-I have five more.
-Well.

126
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,113
-You smell good.

127
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,614
Can you guardarmelos?
They'll be here soon.

128
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:26,215
- What time come?

129
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:29,816
-In about ten minutes or so.

130
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:44,817
My God, it's great, I mean,
are just a couple of reviews so...

131
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:49,218
'Okay, okay, and we say,
're here all weekend.

132
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,319
'Okay, take care.

133
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,220
- What was that?
-Oh, my God.

134
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,321
- What have won the Pulitzer or what?

135
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:02,722
-This woman goes
national book tour.

136
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:07,423
Is what he said, was what we talked...
and have been out a couple of reviews,

137
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:09,224
- So? Are they good? Nena...-


138
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:11,625
My God.
-Well, come on toast.

139
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:15,626
-
Can not do this to us without telling us that's the book.

140
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:20,927
At least you tell us how many times
get the word "lust" in this,

141
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,428
Because we have done  bets.
-Yeah, very funny.

142
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,229
-Have bet money, come on.

143
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,730
'Actually, it's the story of a guy who finds
inconceivable death.

144
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:36,331
-'s Crazy, can not believe
that will happen,

145
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:39,332
and is sure that there must be some kind of exception
for him.

146
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:40,933
-Do not die.

147
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:44,934
-If, and when the time comes somehow escape
,

148
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:47,835
something happen and save.

149
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:51,736
-That is wishful thinking.
-I know.

150
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:54,237
Until one day, a routine checkup
,

151
00:14:54,638 --> 00:14:56,438
you discover a tumor.

152
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,639
No doctor gives you more
than four months.

153
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
- Shit!

154
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:06,341
The guy is taking it personally, as if fate
insulted him.

155
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:08,842
So decide which will be making noise,

156
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:11,343
Murdering one person every day.

157
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:16,344
- It's amazing, right?
-It's sadistic.

158
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:18,645
'Okay, but why, why...
?

159
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:21,846
-Think contacting
indirectly with death deliberately

160
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:24,047
then be able to understand.

161
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,448
- And get get somewhere?

162
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,249
'Of course not, just like all buried.

163
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,150
Without actually understand.

164
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:33,151
'That's why I love my wife, I used to write romance novels
,

00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:35,852
but it is actually the most dramatic
person on the face of the earth.

166
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,653
Congratulations darling, I love you.
-And I love you.

167
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:43,654
-'s An interesting story,
a little sadistic for my taste.

168
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:50,955
But somehow fits the
why I invited them for dinner tonight.

169
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,256
- Is there something wrong?

170
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:57,057
-Quiet  not I have a tumor.

171
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,758
'Well, thank God.

172
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,259
That his story becomes reality is the nightmare of any author.

173
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,860
Well, that depends on the story right?

174
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:10,761
- What is it?

175
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:16,262
-Walking down the street one day,

176
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,763
and that's when I saw her.

177
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:25,164
I never thought I would find that guitar, but it was there.

178
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:28,465
Was totamente sure it was my lucky day.

179
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:39,766
- Hello?

180
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,567
No one was behind the counter,
guess I should leave.

181
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:47,768
But I did not.

182
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:53,269
- Hello?

183
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,770
I saw the man.

184
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:08,971
Shit!

185
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:11,572
Hey, hey!
Dude, come on!

186
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:15,273
I thought I was under attack,
so I went down to try to help,

187
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:20,274
Grabbed my wallet and put it in your mouth for
not bitten tongue and...

188
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,575
I just brushed your teeth.

189
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,376
Just a scratch,

190
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:33,377
but sometimes the little things can grow
.

191
00:17:36,378 --> 00:17:38,478
-Emergency, how I can help?

192
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:42,479
... Yes .. I do not know,
I think I could have it.

193
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,780
- What are the symptoms sir?

194
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:48,781
-Cold sweat, palpitations, shortness of breath
.

195
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:50,782
- Please, can I have your name, sir?

196
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:52,783
-Alex Green.

197
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,784
The military took me to one of these mobile hospitals
.

198
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:06,885
I saw bodies in the halls.

199
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:10,386
A few of them had been shot,

200
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:13,787
a blank in the head.

201
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:17,188
I guess I opened my eyes too soon.

202
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:22,089
few hours spent strapped to that gurney,

203
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,590
not know if you ever come out of that hole
.

204
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,691
- He said he woke up on the way here?

205
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,592
Forget what you have seen.

206
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:36,193
This tumbaría an elephant tranquilizer,
cause hallucinations in patients.

207
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:41,194
We have the results,
this shit is not going to kill him.

208
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:47,195
Do you know? every time
the first dose does not work, it kills me.

209
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:50,696
So congratulations son,
almost do not tell.

210
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:55,697
Then I transferred to a civilian hospital.

211
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,498
And that's where I met Kate.

212
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:00,799
So...

213
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,500
... six years ago,

214
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:06,801
I returned.

215
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:13,002
I want you to know because it might be true this time
stocks are completed.

216
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:16,503
I thought, should know.

217
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,804
Thank you.
-See you next month.

218
00:20:57,505 --> 00:20:59,705
Let's get out of here!

219
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:07,406
Back here!

220
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:13,407
- Please do not hurt me!
I want to be normal!

221
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,608
Do not hurt me.

222
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:35,509
-If a returned no
is injected into a 36-hour period,

223
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,010
the spread of virus in the body becomes irreversible.

224
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:45,011
These statistics are irrefutable,
not a single case to prove the contrary.

225
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,612
And we all know the consequences that entails.

226
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:55,513
Well, do not have official figures
compared to the first outbreak.

227
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:01,014
But most of us have experienced at least one case
firsthand.

228
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:07,615
However, we believe that there were more
hundred million deaths worldwide.

229
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:14,516
The outbreak can not be compared with any other tragedy
known in modern history

230
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:19,017
Trauma  That is what pushed us
to start looking for a solution.

231
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:22,018
And ten years later, protein return
,

232
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,019
was the big prize which
humanity was rewarded.

233
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,020
And so, after the inevitable
second outbreak

234
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:32,521
we were able to save so many people.

235
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:40,722
A returnee is someone who has had the great misfortune
contracting the virus,

236
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:45,923
yet the vast fortune
has been treated in the early hours.

237
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,324
As everyone knows, the virus persists
.

238
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:52,625
We can not cure it.

239
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:53,626
Yet.

240
00:22:53,627 --> 00:22:58,627
But now at least we can control if we arrived on time.

241
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:04,628
Return protein is like a barrier,
as a retaining wall.

242
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:10,829
Incuvado  The virus is still there, but the daily dose
keeps it at a safe distance.

243
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,230
The problem of lack of natural protein
,

244
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:17,231
end with the creation of a synthetic alternative.

245
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:22,232
This will
infected guaranteed lifelong treatment.

246
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:27,933
A cut in funding private
be a disaster, believe me.

247
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:32,834
For returnees, of course, but for what
society as a whole.

248
00:23:32,835 --> 00:23:35,335
'Yes, but there are two things that omitted mention
.

249
00:23:37,336 --> 00:23:41,536
'Please ilústrenos,
here everyone is free to express.

250
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:42,837
-Very friendly.

251
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:47,138
's People,
are time bombs.

252
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:50,539
Until we find the synthetic protein,
are a threat.

253
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,040
If a dose is skipped, one!,
No turning back.

254
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,441

-Precisely why we need to continue investigating.

255
00:23:57,442 --> 00:24:02,642
And this is a very expensive treatment,
who keep all their lives.

256
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:07,843
'Yes, do not deny it, but
face another epidemic like 20 years ago...

257
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:11,244
-There are alternatives.
-... Would be much more expensive for everyone.

258
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:13,445
-There are alternatives.

259
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:16,846
'Please share them with us.

260
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:20,147
He could make them live in special camps
,

261
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:22,448
outside cities,
away from children.

262
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:25,449
-O can remove them.
-I never said that.

263
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,950
'But you think.

264
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:31,251
For that matter, because
rid of smokers, diabetics,

265
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:33,652
and obese as we are.

266
00:24:33,653 --> 00:24:38,453
I mean  besides
cost us a lot of money, it is also unpleasant view.

267
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:48,054
Well, that was... different.

268
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:50,155
- Too rude?

269
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:53,456
-No, no, no, you've just called
fat idiot.

270
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:56,257
-Was an idiot, which turned out to be fat,

271
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:58,758
and now seem to have
prejudice against fat people.

272
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,459
'Yes, among other things.

273
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,260
- Think you bring money?

274
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:04,861
- Who? Is the fat idiot? No.

275
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:09,362
Fuck you, everyone else bring something
because you were sensational, okay?.

276
00:25:10,363 --> 00:25:13,863
-Correct me if I'm wrong but the
natural protein can be extracted only

277
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:17,564
spinal fluid of infected
those who have died.

278
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:19,765
Fortunately there are fewer returnees

279
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:24,166
But that also means there is less
sources from which to extract the protein.

280
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,867
Exactly,
-This is a vicious circle,

281
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:29,768
so unless returned reserves equals less protein.

282
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:33,569
This has led to restrictions enforced
in access to treatment,

283
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,670
the consequences of these restrictions,
is what worries the authorities,

284
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:40,271
especially after the tension of recent weeks.

285
00:25:44,372 --> 00:25:47,372
Sixty-Put me please.
My father is in, it charges you.

286
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:05,373
-Sixty.
Yes, it is.

287
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:07,174
RETURNED

288
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,175
Thank you.

289
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,676
'All right, nice people, nice music
.

290
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:46,177
I have night shift, there
dinner in the oven. I love you.

291
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:02,078
-Damn, just spent half the night,
I am not able to get used to the shift.

292
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:06,279
'I is not much, are the three,
your turn is almost over.

293
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,580
Then I see.

294
00:28:31,781 --> 00:28:33,581
-Are perfect.

295
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:37,882
I mean, I think Tristan and Josh
can go home early.

296

'I hope, Josh has been here a long time.

297

You! there. Come on, come on!

298
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:58,585
-Quiet and calladitas,
this has nothing to do with you.

'Here, take it.

zombies is not it?

301
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:21,488
What should then
tears and shaking?

302
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:23,489
-There are zombies,
have been returned.

303
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,690
- What did you say?

304
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:30,091
Listen here bitch,
because it seems to speak my language.

305
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,992
Are zombies.
Is that clear?

306
00:29:36,493 --> 00:29:37,693
-'re Not.

307
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,194
- Hell, what if they are!
Repeat!

308
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,495
-I'm telling you,
are not zombies.

309
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:48,496
And I am telling you they are.

310
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:59,197
Repeat bitch.
Come on, say it.

311
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:04,498
Okay, I'll get you
a bullet in the head bitch. I say it.

312
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:09,499
-'re Not.

313
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,300
- Forget them!
We have to get out of here!

314
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:15,201
-It's your lucky day.

315
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:21,102
Do not move a fucking muscle is that clear?
- Come out of here!

316
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:57,903
- Who's in charge?

317
00:30:58,104 --> 00:30:59,004
-I.

318
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:02,205
God... we...

319
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:04,406
I've never seen anything like it.

320
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:10,206
-There's a first time for everything.

321
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:11,807
Unfortunately.

322
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:21,808
Let's see who are in the recordings.

323
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:24,509
-I already said, wearing balaclavas.

324
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,910
-Soon will come the vultures of the press.

325
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:42,111
There is nothing they like better than a good
piece of fresh meat.

326
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:49,112
Go home.

327
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:51,013
'Yes, thank you.

328
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,914
- What is it?

329
00:32:48,915 --> 00:32:53,915
Baby, baby, okay, okay
honey, okay.

330
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:08,816
-Is multiplatform,
that's what we already know, and they lack leadership

331
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:13,717
however, many people would want them to be more emphatic
condemning these acts.

332
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:16,918
-Platform "non-return"
condemns the criminal acts like last night,

333
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,119
we have always done.

334
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,620
'Yes, but never before have we seen
an act of such magnitude.

335
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:23,221
What you think is the cause of increased
these attacks?

336
00:33:23,222 --> 00:33:26,222
-Fear.
- And fear justifies such barbarism?

337
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:27,823
-Do not put words in my mouth.

338
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:31,724
True, the Health Service
controls most of the returnees,

339
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:33,725
but we also know that there are cracks in the system.

340
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:37,026
There are a fringe group outside the control
physician as homeless people for example.

341
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:39,527
-Y protein intolerant.
Yes, like that, exactly.

342
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:45,128
Do you remember what happened when that returned
stopped taking their daily dose without warning?

343
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:49,329
In less than 24 hours without treatment that
man attacked five people.

344
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,930
We had to kill them all.

345
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:53,131
-Psycho, psycho fucking suicidal.

346
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,332
- Do you think a person in a thousand justified...

347
00:33:57,633 --> 00:33:58,433
-Jesus...

348
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:03,634
'All right, quiet.

349
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:11,735
'Well, how long a break?

350
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:14,036
-One month.
- A month?

351
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:18,037
Kate , I need you,
damn, you're my best doctor.

352
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:23,538
Please at least tell me you will not let
fundraising conferences okay?

353
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,539
Please.

354
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
'No, that will not quit.

355
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:31,341
Thank God.

356
00:34:40,242 --> 00:34:42,442
- Are they kidding?

357
00:34:51,643 --> 00:34:54,843
The girl clinic
wants to go to her home.

358
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:57,644
Says that there is safer.

359
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:01,945
But he lives miles away.

360
00:35:02,446 --> 00:35:04,446
- Do you want to go with you?

361
00:35:04,947 --> 00:35:07,547
-No, I think I better go alone.

362
00:35:08,748 --> 00:35:12,548
-I do not want people to know about you,
and even less now.

363
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:20,049
'Hello, do you know where I can find the building manager
?

364
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,050
'Yes, climb the stairs apartment No. 4,
says "Administrator" on the door.

365
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:58,151
- Have you seen anyone enter?
-No.

366
00:36:59,152 --> 00:37:01,952
I mean ,
do not know, I have not fixed.

367
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,953
'Well, please look
next time, just in case.

368
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:05,954
Okay?

369
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:11,055
After the attack the other day,
things have gotten much in the hospital.

370
00:37:11,056 --> 00:37:12,456
So I no longer think it's a good site

371
00:37:12,457 --> 00:37:15,457
for two classy women,
like us, do business.

372
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,458
- Is there nothing more?

373
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:21,259
I mean
money is no problem.

374
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,460
Lame-Ya but realize too
to take inventory.

375
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:26,961
Only I can catch a few at a time.

376
00:37:33,562 --> 00:37:36,062
We have not received
heading lab this week.

377
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:37,263
- What?

378
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:41,064
-
Other hospitals also have received so ..

379
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:46,165
- How much is you booking?

380
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,866
'As for a month.

381
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:58,367
- Can you bring me next week
please?

382
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,168
I'll pay whatever.

383
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:02,469
Please.

384
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,470
'Okay, I can not guarantee it but I'll try
.

385
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:09,871
Will cost four times more this time.

386
00:38:09,972 --> 00:38:11,772
-I told you money is not a problem.

387
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:14,173
'Okay, give me a few days.

388
00:38:15,874 --> 00:38:16,974
Thank you.

389
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:30,775
- Is it for you?

390
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,676
Are you one of the returnees?

391
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:09,577
The fucking bastards not only killed,
also took records.

392
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,678
- With all patient records?

393
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,679
-Also took hard drives,
in them had addresses, phone numbers.

394
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,480
All you need to fuck them good.

395
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:22,281
So if you're one of them,
please be careful.

396
00:39:23,582 --> 00:39:24,582
Thank you.

397
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,783
- Hey, buddy!

398
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:47,784
- What are you doing here?
-Hawkers.

399
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,285
- A coming glasses?
- You like?

400
00:39:50,486 --> 00:39:51,986
'Yes, very sophisticated.

401
00:39:52,187 --> 00:39:55,187
-Go does not want people to think I'm sophisticated
.

402
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:56,888
Anyway  false.

403
00:39:57,089 --> 00:39:59,389
-Kidding me, have you
you become one of those guys?

404
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,790
'I am one of those.

405
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:03,091
Want a drink?

406
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:05,991
Always.
-Let's go to Spendler.

407
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:07,392
- Al Spendler, whatever?.

408
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:13,093
- How is Kate?
-More or less.

409
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:16,794
It has taken some time off work in
after what happened the other day

410
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:18,495
It's too hard.

411
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:23,196
But it
is stronger than it looks.

412
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:28,097
I am a lucky man.

413
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:34,098
-We both are.

414
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,099
'True, but you're a rich man
lucky.

415
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,700
What is this?

416
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:49,001
- What is that?
Do not know, you know,

417
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:50,602
you know  25 years

418
00:40:50,603 --> 00:40:53,103
and told me that the other day
and did not give you a hug, so...

419
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:59,104
-Was not a shit
I have been able to tell before.

420
00:41:02,205 --> 00:41:04,205
'Okay, I just want you to know...

421
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:07,606
... for me still the same.

422
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:08,607
Okay?

423
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:14,408
Still the same shit that got me
a pellet in the leg, makes a lot of years

424
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:16,909
-You deserved it.
-I know, but who cares.

425
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,510
Anyway, what I mean is that I do not care
,

426
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:25,611
I do not care what happened to you,
I do not care what this is,

427
00:41:26,512 --> 00:41:28,412
always be there.

428
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:30,813
Thank you friend.

429
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:34,114
- Oh my God!

430
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:36,515
- Oh God, look!

431
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,516
Said, he must prove not why.

432
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:52,517
Are you okay?

433
00:42:53,218 --> 00:42:54,618
Do not worry, you're done.

434
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:10,819
-Get rid of it.

435

'We should call the police.

436
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:22,121
We can not, are we okay,
will ask questions, they will pull the thread?.

437
00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:45,022
-Being a returnee is not a fucking crime.
-Yeah, but can now be a problem.

438
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,323
Quit and kicks.

439
00:43:53,824 --> 00:43:54,724

and ensure that all affected
receive the attention they deserve.

449
00:44:44,334 --> 00:44:46,534
The announcement has shaken the people,

450
00:44:46,835 --> 00:44:50,435
afraid that this situation will lead to a new
uncontrolled outbreak

what the Government has seriously
focus.

Thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest
in all major cities.

The looting and burning of several centers

have caused the collapse of several

00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:24,965
Attacked two places at once
around two in the morning.

481
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:27,966
-Awesome.

482
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:31,767
What did the police say?

483
00:48:31,968 --> 00:48:32,968
-The shit.

484
00:48:33,169 --> 00:48:36,969
That can not ensure that groups have been
backstop, but not good.

485
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,570
And that's not the worst of it.

486
00:48:47,571 --> 00:48:50,371
They say it's only until the synthetic protein function
.

487
00:48:50,372 --> 00:48:52,372
-No
let you go to one of those sites.

488
00:48:52,473 --> 00:48:54,473
-Han given three days to spare.

489
00:48:55,074 --> 00:48:56,774
-Plan to publish lists, Kate.

490
00:48:57,575 --> 00:49:01,075
Any returned not delivered to a monitoring center will be arrested.

491
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:03,076
- Observation center?

492
00:49:03,077 --> 00:49:04,877
So you're kidding Jacob?

493
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:06,878
Sound like them.

494
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:08,579
Look at that!

495
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,280
-Try to convince Alex.
Come to the house with us.

496
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:19,681
Is a safe place,
go talk to him, let him come.

497
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:23,382
Go talk to him, pick up his stuff and let's get out of here
once.

498
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,483
'm Your agent!
'm Your fucking agent!

499
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:24,684
Okay, you know what?
Now you're talking, talking, blah blah blah

500
00:50:24,785 --> 00:50:26,685
not understand a word
what you're saying.

501
00:50:26,986 --> 00:50:28,086
-Need more conflict.

502
00:50:28,087 --> 00:50:30,387
-Okay, more conflict, more conflict
Here, okay?

503
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:33,288
Should not feel that way now, but
is forced feelings,

504
00:50:33,389 --> 00:50:36,189
and I am forced to do this,
you get up the ass!

505
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,590
'Brother, I love when you are angry.

506
00:50:41,591 --> 00:50:43,091
- Oh yeah?
-Si.

507
00:51:12,092 --> 00:51:14,292
Alex is lucky to have you.

508
00:51:15,293 --> 00:51:16,293
- Why do you say that?

509
00:51:17,394 --> 00:51:19,894
-'m A writer,
I notice things in people.

510
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:22,895
- What do you notice?

511
00:51:23,996 --> 00:51:26,196
-Do not leave to pity himself.

512
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:29,597
Do not treat me like a sick or an invalid.

513
00:51:32,198 --> 00:51:33,398
'Because it is not.

514
00:51:55,999 --> 00:51:57,499
-This is a little creepy.

515
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,100
- Have you inectado today?

516
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:06,201
-I want to eat your brains.

517
00:52:06,602 --> 00:52:08,702
'Okay, start with your wife.

518
00:52:09,203 --> 00:52:13,203
I do not want to eat hers.
-It's too brain.

519
00:53:09,104 --> 00:53:10,604
"Military use force on citizens
"

520
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:13,405
Van-home people.
'I have done before.

521
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:14,706
'No, not this way.

522
00:53:15,207 --> 00:53:18,707
-No taking people by force and against her will
as the gestapo bitch.

523
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:21,708
Therefore  I love Kate.

524
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:24,009
So I want to have her.

525
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,010
-You can not even shoot.

526
00:53:28,011 --> 00:53:31,011
'Any idiot can fire a gun,
aim and pull the trigger.

527
00:53:31,412 --> 00:53:33,212
-Let's not exaggerate.

528
00:53:33,613 --> 00:53:36,413
Here we are safe.
No, we're not.

529
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,414
Are very close to the city.

530
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:39,415
And...

531
00:53:40,816 --> 00:53:42,716
... is too risky for Jacob and Amber.

532
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:45,717
'But we are not gunmen,
for the love of God.

533
00:53:46,118 --> 00:53:49,018
-Before we were not,
but I have no idea what we are now.

534
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,219
Everything has changed.

535
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,120
Got a better idea?
What to do?

536
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:03,521
- I do not know, whatever,
not want a gun in the house!

537
00:54:33,522 --> 00:54:36,022
-Come on, we'll call the elevator, hurry.

538
00:54:46,823 --> 00:54:48,023
Jesus!

539
00:54:48,624 --> 00:54:51,624
-'m Detective Call,
this is Detective Anderson.

540
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:54,125
We're here to see Alex Green.

541
00:54:54,826 --> 00:54:56,426
-Solo will be five minutes.

542
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,227
'Well, is not.

543
00:55:07,828 --> 00:55:10,628
What the hell is this,
presented here unannounced,

544
00:55:12,029 --> 00:55:15,029
With a warrant, and I teach my floor
. I'm late.

545
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,530
-Only orders we fulfill lady.

546
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:20,031
-This home is listed, the sooner we start before
ended.

547
00:55:21,632 --> 00:55:23,632
'I went three weeks ago.

548
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:26,133
- It was three weeks ago?

549
00:55:27,134 --> 00:55:30,134
-Or four.
The eleventh day.

550
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:32,735
- For some reason in particular?

551
00:55:36,936 --> 00:55:38,536
'Not that I know of.

552
00:55:38,537 --> 00:55:40,537
'You are men,
certainly know better than me

553
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:43,538
what goes through the head of a man
before leaving a woman.

554
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:48,539
-Need to see the rest of the apartment.

555
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,740
- This is really annoying!

556
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,341
The sound studio.

557
00:56:11,442 --> 00:56:12,942
The -room.

558
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:48,743
- Do you have any idea where
have gone?

559
00:57:01,744 --> 00:57:03,544
- I shot him in the head!

560
00:57:05,045 --> 00:57:07,245
I shot him in the fucking head!

561
00:57:08,246 --> 00:57:09,246
Oh my God!

562
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:13,447
He finished dosages.

563
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:16,648
- Why not take him
Observation Center?

564
00:57:17,949 --> 00:57:19,649
I did not want to go.

565
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,650
- Why did not compel him?

566
00:57:22,951 --> 00:57:25,951

-Because actually was right in not wanting to.

567
00:57:27,452 --> 00:57:29,452
She had been monitored and controlled.

568
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:33,153
My God,
would let him die.

569
00:57:33,454 --> 00:57:35,554
You know that those sites are.

570
00:57:36,355 --> 00:57:38,855
Would have died surrounded by strangers.

571
00:57:48,356 --> 00:57:50,356
Have I gotten into a mess, is not it?

572
00:57:52,257 --> 00:57:53,657
Well, in theory yes.

573
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:57,358
- And in practice?

574
00:57:58,459 --> 00:58:00,459
Our job is 
-mark X on a list.

575
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,660
If what you are saying is true,

576
00:58:02,661 --> 00:58:05,661
our work is done and we will remove
frankly a load off.

577
00:58:07,662 --> 00:58:09,462
Need to see the body.

578
00:58:23,163 --> 00:58:24,063
-Okay, but,

579
00:58:24,864 --> 00:58:28,064
After it's over?
Will not there be questions?

580
00:58:32,165 --> 00:58:33,265
-No questions asked.

581
00:58:36,566 --> 00:58:37,366
-Right.

582
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:47,067
- Hello!

583
01:00:01,968 --> 01:00:02,868
Hello?

584
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,969
'Okay.

585
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:21,870
Well, this thing very quickly decomposes
bodies.

586
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,071
What I can say is:
What is a male,

587
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:27,972
thirtysomething,

588
01:02:30,173 --> 01:02:31,973
with a single shot to the head.

589
01:02:35,574 --> 01:02:38,574
'All right, do not need to pick it out, call the
Rescue Unit.

590
01:02:39,575 --> 01:02:40,975
We have enough on our own.

591
01:02:41,976 --> 01:02:43,576
My companion take home.

592
01:03:02,977 --> 01:03:03,677
Thank you.

593
01:03:03,678 --> 01:03:06,078
-If it makes you feel better, I think
did the right thing.

594
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:10,279
In a few hours they will announce that no synthetic protein
when thought.

595
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,380
Not seem to work the way
when they said it would.

596
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:15,281
Things are complicated.

597
01:03:19,382 --> 01:03:20,282
Thank you.

598
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:47,283
- You all right?
Yes, I'm fine.

599
01:03:49,184 --> 01:03:51,084
-Kate spoke to Eve.

600
01:03:51,085 --> 01:03:54,085
She is the woman who has been helping with
protein supply.

601
01:03:55,086 --> 01:03:58,086
We have got sixty doses so...

602
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:00,187
- How?

603
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:03,788
'So we'll go
the morning to pick them up.

604
01:04:04,089 --> 01:04:06,589
And then we'll go far away from here as possible.

605
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,190
- Sixty dose?

606
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:11,191
Well, that gives them some time.
-Si.

607
01:04:11,692 --> 01:04:14,192
-If they do
by us is not necessary.

608
01:04:14,593 --> 01:04:15,693
Did you know  true?

609
01:04:16,594 --> 01:04:17,494
-Know.

610
01:04:18,695 --> 01:04:21,095
They say that will fix
Alex within days.

611
01:04:21,096 --> 01:04:25,296
O well, you know,
weeks at most, you will make that work.

612
01:04:26,297 --> 01:04:29,297
'd Better get going.

613
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:31,798
's Too dangerous.

614
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:35,799
-
But thanks for all you've done.

615
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:41,800
The negative results of recent tests
made us delay our expectations

616
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:45,401
The synthetic protein has not been synthesized yet.

617
01:04:46,502 --> 01:04:52,502
However
government laboratories continue to struggle to find a solution

618
01:04:53,103 --> 01:04:58,603
Our hopes are still intact, since
everything can change in the coming weeks.

619
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:04,104
All sectors of the population should remain calm and
can be sure

620
01:05:04,105 --> 01:05:07,905
we have
control and we will address this.

621
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:11,006
Thanks , there will be questions.

622
01:05:31,707 --> 01:05:32,707
Good morning.

623
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:35,108
'Hello.

624
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:37,309
- Would you like a coffee?
-No thanks.

625
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,210
- Looking for this?

626
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:46,311
-Si, where was I?
-On the couch.

627
01:05:47,412 --> 01:05:48,912
-You're up early.

628
01:05:48,913 --> 01:05:53,713
'Yes, Amber,
got up early to go to visit his mother and woke me up.

629
01:05:54,314 --> 01:05:56,814
'Well, do not wake Alex.
- It will not go with you?

630
01:05:56,815 --> 01:05:59,415
-No, he thinks so, but it turned out the
alarm.

631
01:06:00,316 --> 01:06:03,816
It is easier if you go alone, you know?
-He will be angry.

632
01:06:05,217 --> 01:06:06,617
-Have a good...

633
01:06:06,618 --> 01:06:07,818
- Kate Guess what?

634
01:06:09,019 --> 01:06:11,819
I think it's admirable how calm you are.

635
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:16,820
-Y too.

636
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:18,221
-Bye.

637
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:13,322
-'m Eve, you know I do.

638
01:07:30,723 --> 01:07:31,923
Hello?

639
01:07:34,424 --> 01:07:35,424
? Eve?

640
01:07:44,525 --> 01:07:45,525
? Eve?

641
01:07:52,226 --> 01:07:53,126
Hello?

642
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:03,527
'Hello, baby, tell me.

643
01:10:03,828 --> 01:10:06,628
- Are Jacob and Amber at home?
- Why? What happens?

644
01:10:06,629 --> 01:10:09,029
'Go to your room and check
injectables.

645
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,130
-No, I think they've gone.

646
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:11,931
- Go check injectables!

647
01:10:11,932 --> 01:10:14,332
'Darling what is going on? Is something wrong?
- Go away dammit!

648
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:15,533
-Okay, okay, I'm coming.

649
01:10:41,734 --> 01:10:42,734
SORRY

650
01:10:43,235 --> 01:10:44,235
Oh my God.

651
01:12:00,735 --> 01:12:04,935
-You know, what they have done is not unlike
what we have being doing us.

652
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:11,836
That nurse basically we sold doses
belonging to others.

653
01:12:13,137 --> 01:12:15,537
-I have not killed anyone
to get them.

654
01:12:17,538 --> 01:12:19,238
-Directly no.

655
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:30,239
I'm sorry, it was stupid, silly
I said, I did not say that.

656
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,240
Nena.

657
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:50,341
I wish -
corriese time and already out of date.

658
01:12:52,342 --> 01:12:54,542
- Are you sure that you can see?

659
01:12:55,543 --> 01:12:57,343
-I expected at nine.

660
01:12:57,944 --> 01:12:59,544
I said it was important.

661
01:13:00,145 --> 01:13:01,345
Be there.

662
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:07,346
- Are you going to tell?

663
01:13:09,947 --> 01:13:11,647
'Yes, you may have the solution.

664
01:13:13,148 --> 01:13:15,848
But to find out I'll have to tell the truth.

665
01:13:17,949 --> 01:13:18,849
Okay?

666
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:22,750
'Okay.

667
01:13:45,051 --> 01:13:46,051
Jacob!

668
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:48,752
Jacob! Thanks, thanks, thanks!

669
01:13:49,853 --> 01:13:51,653
What the hell is going on?

670
01:13:51,654 --> 01:13:53,554
-
Not have much time so let me talk okay?.

671
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:56,355
- You do not have much time?
Where the fuck are you?

672
01:13:56,356 --> 01:13:58,156
-You know I can not tell Alex.

673
01:13:58,157 --> 01:14:01,357
- Do not you? Where the fuck are you?
Have my fucking dose.

674
01:14:01,758 --> 01:14:04,058
Alex  stop talking or I'll hang up, do you understand me
?

675
01:14:04,059 --> 01:14:05,859
- Where are you?
- TALKING TO!

676
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,560
'Okay, okay, talking, TALKING!

677
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,461
-Amber is not in the room.

678
01:14:11,562 --> 01:14:14,562
She did not want him to call.
And I promised I would not.

679
01:14:15,063 --> 01:14:16,563
But I had to talk to you.

680
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:21,764
Had been for me,
never have done this.

681
01:14:21,965 --> 01:14:22,765
But it has been for her.

682
01:14:23,966 --> 01:14:26,466
I know it's a bitch.
- Bitch? Will I be kidding?

683
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:29,067
I get less than 24 hours,
you know what that means?

684
01:14:29,568 --> 01:14:34,068
-Alex had not choice, it's the greatest shit
I could have done, I know, but I had no choice.

685
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:38,069
-You had no choice, had it,
Wait! Hear, hear!

686
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:39,270
I'm sorry, listen.

687
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:41,571
Give me  only six or seven doses okay?

688
01:14:41,572 --> 01:14:44,872
Do not have to see us,
can leave them somewhere and I gather.

689
01:14:44,873 --> 01:14:46,173
- How I can do that Alex?

690
01:14:46,174 --> 01:14:48,174
Why your life is more valuable than
it, eh?

691
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:50,475
What makes you so special?
-Jacob, man...

692
01:14:50,876 --> 01:14:51,476
- What?

693
01:14:51,477 --> 01:14:53,777
-I do not even have to see me,
-I can not do it.

694
01:14:53,778 --> 01:14:56,578
-It would pick them up right?
-I can not do it.

695
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:59,179
Six or seven doses,
that are six or seven doses of your life.

696
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,180
-Jacob, please man.

697
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:03,181
- What choice do I have? Tell me.

698
01:15:03,182 --> 01:15:05,182
Dame just a few.
Not yet, not yet...

699
01:15:05,883 --> 01:15:08,483
I have not yet fired from Kate,
I'm not ready, give me some,

700
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:10,284
is all I need, just a few
.

701
01:15:10,285 --> 01:15:11,385
I can not.

702
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:13,386
-Jacob  please.

703
01:15:14,187 --> 01:15:16,387
Please, I just need some.

704
01:15:16,988 --> 01:15:19,388
Alex, sorry Alex.

705
01:15:20,589 --> 01:15:21,089
Goodbye.

706
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:19,190
-I have been dismantled, and
have taken all the military hospitals.

707
01:16:19,591 --> 01:16:21,991
And we have sent to each of us
to a different site.

708
01:16:21,992 --> 01:16:25,092
I am on dialysis, Lucy in the ER,
and Mary is upstairs with the kids.

709
01:16:25,393 --> 01:16:26,193
Is a disaster.

710
01:16:26,994 --> 01:16:28,294
No you will convert.

711
01:16:29,195 --> 01:16:34,395
David says you might want to change the appointment,
because it will take, surgery was complicated

712
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:46,796
-I'll be back in a minute.

713
01:17:04,497 --> 01:17:07,097
- Will they get that work?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

714
01:17:07,798 --> 01:17:12,298
The last few days have been working on the new antigens
trying to implant them in,

715
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:14,299
-David, do not tell me rolls, when?

716
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,000
-You should have told Kate.

717
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:20,101
- What fell in love with a returnee?

718
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,502
-No, you're so involved in all this
.

719
01:17:23,903 --> 01:17:25,603
- I expedientasen Why?

720
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:29,804
For all cleaning including
bitch could gossip about me?.

721
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:32,905
What for?
-In order to save this disaster.

722
01:17:33,806 --> 01:17:35,506
Now I can not help Kate.

723
01:17:35,807 --> 01:17:38,607
'Well, I'll have to go to one of those military hospitals
.

724
01:17:39,008 --> 01:17:40,108
-You arrested.

725
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:43,109
-I need injections.

726
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:44,110
-There are none.

727
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:46,311
And so will catch him.

728
01:17:46,512 --> 01:17:50,512
- So what do you suggest I do?
Make it stop me seeing him die?

729
01:17:55,113 --> 01:17:56,113
I'm sorry.

730
01:17:56,914 --> 01:17:58,314
What you suggest I do?

731
01:17:59,815 --> 01:18:00,715
Tell me.

732
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:08,216
'Come with me.

733
01:20:00,517 --> 01:20:02,217
-Mother,
Fuck!

734
01:20:02,818 --> 01:20:06,818
-There for fifty days
hope that this already long before this all figured out.

735
01:20:06,819 --> 01:20:08,619
'I had no idea.

736
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:12,620
-
Each hospital decides where teachers save reagents,

737
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:17,421
most prefer that the government has, prevents them problems.

738
01:20:17,822 --> 01:20:20,422
I have always preferred to stay out of it.

739
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:23,623
-Cameras have seen us enter.

740
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:25,324
-Yeah, I know.

741
01:20:27,425 --> 01:20:29,225
I'll think of something.

742
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:31,726
Anyway I...

743
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:35,727
... I've been wanting to retire.

744
01:20:38,128 --> 01:20:39,128
Thank you.

745
01:20:58,029 --> 01:21:00,229
- I have them!
- Thank God!

746
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:02,530
-Fifty.

747
01:21:04,831 --> 01:21:06,631
'Wait, wait, how many?

748
01:21:06,732 --> 01:21:08,232
- I'm fifty dose!

749
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:13,233
'm Coming home, I will give the
you there in half an hour.

750
01:21:13,434 --> 01:21:15,934
I love you.
-I love you.

751
01:21:17,635 --> 01:21:19,435
Then see you, bye.

752
01:21:52,336 --> 01:21:53,436
- Drop it!

753
01:22:46,237 --> 01:22:47,437
- Oh my god!

754
01:22:57,438 --> 01:22:58,938
Oh no, shit!

755
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:06,438
Oh God no.

756
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:50,439
Fuck...

757
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,640
I do not want you to look elsewhere
okay?

758
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:49,141
... I want you to go.

759
01:25:50,642 --> 01:25:51,442
No, Kate.

760
01:25:51,643 --> 01:25:54,143
-I have to try.
No time to talk.

761
01:25:58,244 --> 01:26:00,244
I can hardly breathe.

762
01:26:00,745 --> 01:26:03,245
-That still does not mean anything right?

763
01:26:05,946 --> 01:26:07,246
-Kate, look at me...

764
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:11,647
can say goodbye now, because
do not have to go through this Kate.

765
01:26:11,648 --> 01:26:13,648
'I will not leave you alone right?

766
01:26:13,749 --> 01:26:14,649
I'm here.

767
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:21,450
'Then promise me one thing.

768
01:26:24,151 --> 01:26:27,751
Before things get out of control and accelerate
, you will.

769
01:27:20,552 --> 01:27:22,552
No mom, please!

770
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:26,253
I can not, please!

771
01:27:27,554 --> 01:27:28,254
No!

772
01:27:30,255 --> 01:27:31,755
I love Mum.

773
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:33,256
- KATE!

774
01:28:58,957 --> 01:28:59,857
-Kate.

775
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:02,558
Okay.

776
01:29:05,559 --> 01:29:08,559
-No, no, no...
-Okay, okay, calm.

777
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:15,560
-I love you so much...

778
01:29:16,361 --> 01:29:17,561
-know.

779
01:29:22,562 --> 01:29:24,762
No, no, no.

780
01:31:05,763 --> 01:31:06,763
Kate!

781
01:31:08,164 --> 01:31:08,964
Kate!

782
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:10,965
Kate!

783
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:12,566
- Thank God!

784
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:16,567
Not afraid to reach you all night,
what the hell's wrong with your phone?

785
01:31:17,568 --> 01:31:21,068
-I lost it.
- Shit, I thought you had something happen.

786
01:31:24,569 --> 01:31:27,369
- What is it?
- Do not you hear?

787
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:30,770
- Heard what?

788
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:31,971
- Are you serious?

789
01:31:32,472 --> 01:31:35,772
With all the fireworks and the ruckus
mounted half the city?

790
01:31:36,173 --> 01:31:37,373
And yet you have not heard?

791
01:31:38,374 --> 01:31:39,874
-No, what about David?

792
01:31:40,775 --> 01:31:42,575
-Kate works. -No...

793
01:31:42,676 --> 01:31:44,676
-The synthetic protein functions.

794
01:31:45,977 --> 01:31:46,677
- What?

795
01:31:47,078 --> 01:31:48,778
'Yes, it works.

796
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:50,779
For hours have announced.

797
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,380
Indeed
and are distributed outside the centers.

798
01:31:53,881 --> 01:31:56,381
We got  Kate,
go, look at those fireworks.

799
01:31:56,882 --> 01:31:58,082
People are going crazy.

800
01:31:59,983 --> 01:32:00,583
Kate?

801
01:32:04,284 --> 01:32:05,184
Kate?

802
01:32:08,285 --> 01:32:09,485
