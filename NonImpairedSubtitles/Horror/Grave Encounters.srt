1
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:23,484
My name is Jerry Hartfeld.

2
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:27,378
I run a video production company,
here in Anaheim, California.

3
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,827
We focus mainly on
reality television shows.

4
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:36,562
If you ever seen the show,
"Tornado Trackers", it's one of ours.

5
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:39,360
A tape arrived in the mail.

6
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,300
It was a pilot episode of a new reality
series called "Grave Encounters".

7
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,978
And it was by a young
producer named Lance Preston.

8
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:52,602
The idea was that him and his
group of paranormal investigators,

9
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:57,507
would investigate ghost sightings and
hauntings and things of this nature.

10
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:59,119
And this was, you know, years before

11
00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:01,955
all the other ghost haunting
shows that are out there now.

12
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,497
I mean, I really felt
he was ahead of his time.

13
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,967
My name is Lance Preston.

14
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,461
When I was a boy my
family moved into a house

15
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:12,192
that I soon discovered was haunted.

16
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:15,427
The things I encountered,
have stayed with me forever.

17
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:18,979
Ever since then, I have been
obsessed with trying to capture proof

18
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:20,878
that these things were real.

19
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:24,625
Come along with me and my team
of skilled paranormal investigators

20
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:28,806
as we dare to venture into some of the
most haunted locations known to man.

21
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:32,244
Spending the night, and
capturing everything on camera.

22
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:35,364
If you're ready, it's
time to have some

23
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,161
GRAVE ENCOUNTERS

24
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:40,882
And everything was... you
know, going really smoothly.

25
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:45,582
I mean, the edits that were coming back
were great.  We were very excited.

26
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:47,628
We really had some thing, you know.

27
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,784
And then of course, they
got the Episode 6.

28
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,391
<i>Uh, do you have anything
else you want to say?</i>

29
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,595
Yeah!  I want to be
very clear about this.

30
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,535
What you're about to
see is not a movie.

31
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,419
Okay?

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,269
This is been assembled from some 76 plus
hours of raw mini DVD source footage

33
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:09,803
that was shot for Lance's show.

34
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:14,571
Not a frame of this had been doctored,
hasn't been manipulated in any way.

35
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,105
This is just raw footage,
it's been edited strictly for time.

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,189
Cut!

37
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:35,777
Hello! Hello!
Testing! Testing.

38
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:37,382
Lance Preston!

39
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,704
Keep a good portion of this
in the back the whole time.

40
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,277
I'm gonna move a little bit, but...

41
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:44,084
- Are you ready then?
- I'm ready.

42
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,305
You're still in the shot.
I can... I want to get you clean.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,734
- One step back.
- Well, good?

44
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:52,188
Good evening!

45
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,883
And welcome to another
episode of Grave Encounters.

46
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,704
I'm your host,
Lance Preston, as always.

47
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,257
And tonight I am very
excited to take you inside

48
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:02,504
one of the most terrifying
locations I have ever seen.

49
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,802
Behind me sits the
Collingwood Psychiatric hospital.

50
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:08,840
It's one of six buildings
spread over 80 acres of land,

51
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:09,940
just outside ...

52
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:15,504
We are gonna pick it up from there.
I'm not gonna do from beginning part again.

53
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:21,851
And between the years 1895 and 1960,
it played home to more than 80,000

54
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:25,873
of Maryland's most mentally ill
and disturbed individuals.

55
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:31,147
After its closure in 1963,
reports of ghostly apparitions,

56
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:34,935
objects moving on their own.
And sometimes even the lunatic

57
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:38,322
laughter of the patients
condemned to roam these halls.

58
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:44,700
Tonight, my crew and I will be
performing an 8 hour lock down.

59
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:48,613
Trapped inside, during the
peak hours of dead time.

60
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:51,647
Using the most sophisticated
in ghost hunting equipment

61
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:54,905
we will be in search of
what's become known as

62
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:59,024
the ghost of the
Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital.

63
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:01,535
- Cut.
- Nice!

64
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,460
Yeah?

65
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:03,848
- Morgan!
- Hi

66
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,173
- Morgan Turner! How are you?
- Yeah.  Hi.

67
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,176
- Oop! Perfect.
- Thanks for coming up man.

68
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:08,889
Especially to make
you drive all the way.

69
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:10,530
That's okay.
I'm really happy to do it.

70
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:13,616
- Is um... is this going to be on TV?
- Yeah, that's what we hope.

71
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:15,001
Hey, not this part.
I'm just shooting this.

72
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:16,581
Oh, don't worry about it,
she shoots everything.

73
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:19,577
I'm here with Morgan Turner,
local town historian.

74
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:23,936
Morgan is here today to shed some
light on the institute's dark past.

75
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:27,364
Morgan?  Can you tell us when
the institute was first built?

76
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:32,752
Well! The history of Collingwood is fairly
typical of similar hospitals of the era.

77
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:38,303
It was built in 1893... to
address the sort of growing

78
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:41,616
over crowding problem at the
state hospital in Denver's County.

79
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:45,059
Mental illness, of course at that time
was not very well understood and

80
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,930
treatments were
still in their infancy.

81
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:50,903
Psychiatric hospitals like this were
seen as sort of a dumping ground

82
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:53,200
for embarrassing family
members rather then

83
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:55,320
a place that they could
go to actually get help.

84
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:56,050
Right.

85
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,960
The conditions were pretty abysmal.

86
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:05,100
People have to sleep on the floor, some
times, without blankets or even clothes.

87
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:08,003
It was really not a
fun place to be stuck in.

88
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:10,729
Could you tell us about
Arthur Friedkin?

89
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,066
His story is probably the most
infamous about this hospital.

90
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:17,034
Sure..!  I figured that
you're gonna ask me that.

91
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:19,782
Friedkin was a
Harvard trained neurologist

92
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:23,448
who was head physician
here from 1937 to 1948.

93
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:27,003
He had gain some notoriety
because of his work in

94
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:29,238
experimental brain surgery.

95
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:32,670
He was a major
advocate of the lobotomy,

96
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:36,921
under Friedkin supervision
there were about 140 lobotomies.

97
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:40,487
On August 15, 1948,

98
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,049
six patients broke out of their rooms

99
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:46,300
and stabbed Friedkin
in his office.

100
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,058
His body was found the
next morning by a nurse.

101
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,880
Unfortunately, this event
was completely overshadowed

102
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:56,525
by the death of David Bruce,
the famous baseball player.

103
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,363
It's a crazy story!

104
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:03,395
So Morgan, in your honest opinion.
Do you believe in ghosts?

105
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:05,962
I don't know.

106
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:10,931
But if they do exist, well, this would be
a good place to go looking for them.

107
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:13,199
The traffic was busy today, so...

108
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,764
Didn't take us too long, it was
about hour drive, something like that.

109
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:18,431
- Oh God!
- "Death awaits."

110
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:22,188
- I guess we'll find out.
- That is so lame!

111
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:24,697
Ah, this will taking a bit, this

112
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:27,813
old ancient lock here.
I don't even think we should use this.

113
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:30,350
- You know, it's really cheesy dude.
- Yeah! I don't like that.

114
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:33,632
Slow motion, music behind it.
Everything's creepy.

115
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:37,857
- Okay.. come on.
- Good. Here we go.

116
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:39,437
Okay, come on in.

117
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,625
Oh my God!

118
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:47,394
So this is the main entrance
to the building here.

119
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:49,176
Nice!
Yes!

120
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:50,677
Oh, ho ho, man!

121
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:54,836
And if you were family member, you have
to check-in at the reception over there.

122
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,542
- This is creepy as shit!
- This is so insane.

123
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:58,860
Are you getting all this?
Get everything!

124
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:01,176
I want to do camera
shots of all of this.

125
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,472
Hey you down there.
No smoking, uh.

126
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:07,801
Can you take that outside?  Don't
even bother inside, please.  Fire exit.

127
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,697
I'm here with Kenny Sandavol.
Resident caretaker, for the past 8 years.

128
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:16,494
Kenny!  Would you say
that this place is haunted?

129
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:22,034
Well, I've never done this before.
So, should I talk to you or to the camera?

130
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,404
Yeah..  Don't.
This isn't...

131
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,855
Well, I don't know if I believe in
ghost or spirits or anything like that.

132
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,828
But in my time here I've
seen some pretty weird stuff.

133
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:33,897
You know, especially working
late night you hear all these

134
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:37,546
old pipes and the building
sort of make noises and...

135
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:40,860
Well, it's really hard to
put your finger on it.  But...

136
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,557
I get the sense
that, I'm not alone.

137
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:46,762
Lets go check it out!

138
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:49,873
Aha.
Okay.

139
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,571
Uh, like this hallways
go on forever.

140
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:53,342
Yup!

141
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:56,810
It's hard to believe this place used to
house thousands of insane people.

142
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:57,530
There were thousands.

143
00:07:57,535 --> 00:08:00,503
Seem to have darkness
and it's still day time.

144
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:02,971
- So where is the power socket?
- You scared?

145
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,702
Ah, there's a few newer
lines you can plug into.

146
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,032
I'll will show you where those are.

147
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:12,030
Hey guys!  If you think it's
dark now, wait till tonight.

148
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,304
Cause none of these lights work,
it'll get very dark.

149
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,975
- So you guys see this window here?
- Yeah!

150
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:21,261
I lock it up real good in night

151
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:24,610
come back in morning, some
times this thing's wide open.

152
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:25,876
What!

153
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:27,477
Yeah, I can't figure it out.

154
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,971
Its like a... something is
trying to get out or something.

155
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:34,379
Its a definite paranormal hotspot.

156
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,165
- How is it?
- Perfect.

157
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:52,394
How is this supposed to help people
if their stuffed in these tiny rooms.

158
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:58,103
- Oh my God!
- This is officially fucked!

159
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,114
- Is this real?
- Yup, this is totally real.

160
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:04,836
The guy who lived here was
in here for quite a few years

161
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,885
and this is what he did.

162
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,080
He spent his time
writing on the walls.

163
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,165
So this is the actual
patiented room here?

164
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,634
An actual patient was in here.

165
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,820
Really?

166
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:17,683
I don't know whether he was right to
the end, but he was here for a long time.

167
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:19,152
Very creepy.

168
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,043
- What the fuck!?  Kenny!
- This is great!

169
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,098
Oh man, the acoustics
are shit in here.

170
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:32,159
Supposedly a patient, a young
girl, killed herself in here.

171
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:34,353
- What?
- Right here?

172
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:38,715
- A patient killed herself, right here?
- Yes, slit her wrists in this tub.

173
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,475
Oh God, that's so sad.

174
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:44,300
People say they've heard the sound of
rustling water coming out of this room,

175
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,649
but I've never heard
any thing like that.

176
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,060
Where are we going next then?

177
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:49,868
Ah, we gonna go down
to the service tunnels.

178
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:52,748
Can't wait to see all this.

179
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:56,364
You on it?

180
00:09:56,956 --> 00:10:00,397
- Oh Kenny!
- This is exactly what I was looking for!

181
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,650
These service tunnels
connect all the buildings.

182
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,765
There's about a quarter mile of them.

183
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:10,953
It's like a maze down here.
You could easily get lost.

184
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:15,171
One day, I was down here
walking over to the East wing,

185
00:10:16,472 --> 00:10:19,181
and the air got real cold.

186
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:24,029
It was so still.  I felt like
someone was watching me.

187
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,641
Very eerie feeling.

188
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:33,615
- What?  What?
- It's just my shadow. Sorry.

189
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:38,289
This is Garry Crawford.
Crawford Contracting.

190
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:41,100
He was hired here, quite some
time ago, to do some work?

191
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:42,290
Is that right?

192
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:47,113
Back in 93, yeah.  The state was
gonna try and do some renovation here

193
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:50,898
but eventually they shit-can the idea.
Oh shit, I'm sorry!

194
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:52,860
- You want me not to swear?
- Yeah, that would be better.

195
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:55,364
Anyway, me and my guys

196
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,753
came in here for about two weeks.

197
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,663
And you experienced some
supernatural phenomenon?

198
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,725
Well, we were off to start,

199
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:07,699
some of the guys were hearing what
they thought were weird noises and...

200
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,859
And there were some tools
disappearing over night,

201
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:14,983
I thought it was looters, but
I never saw anybody, so...

202
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:17,730
- There was an accident?
- Yeah...

203
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:22,179
One of my guys on a ladder, in fact, he
was pulling some old wood just over there.

204
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,908
And he swears that something
pushed him off the ladder.

205
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:27,103
He took a hard fall.

206
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:30,496
Banged up his knee, and he quit!

207
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:33,133
Well! that doesn't sound
like a residual haunting.

208
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,675
Its sounds like an
intelligent haunting.

209
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,231
A residual haunting is thought
to be like an echo from the past,

210
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,904
continuing to loop
over and over again.

211
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,120
An intelligent haunting
is actually a spirit

212
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:48,377
that interacts and has intention.

213
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:50,857
There are many reports
of people having

214
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:53,425
been pushed, scratched
and even thrown.

215
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:56,169
It's rare but it does happen.

216
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,039
So, you both have spent
a lot of time out here?

217
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,775
Yeah, all in high school with bunch of
kids used to come down here and just...

218
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:05,321
you know, for hang out.

219
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,475
And you saw something here?

220
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,065
Yes.

221
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,394
We were actually right here.

222
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,614
Here.  Making out or whatever... and

223
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:18,662
I looked up and I swear to God.

224
00:12:18,663 --> 00:12:23,642
I swear to God that I saw someone
right at the end of the hall there.

225
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:28,969
- He was wearing a... like a white...
- Like a hospital gown?

226
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,328
Yeah, like a white hospital gown.
And he had shaved head. Yeah.

227
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:38,732
Full spectral apparition.

228
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:41,272
Why don't we... why don't we grab
an interview with gardener look like?

229
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:43,572
<i>As long as the lights doesn't...</i>

230
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:47,162
Excuse me! Excuse me sir!
Excuse me.

231
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,921
I'm shooting a TV show here.

232
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:51,230
Just wondering if you want to
do a quick interview with us.

233
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,579
I am standing here with the
resident gardener, Javier Ortega.

234
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,364
Javier, have you ever noticed
anything strange around the building?

235
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:02,556
No.  Not really.
What do you mean?

236
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,732
Well, have you heard any weird
noises or seen any ghostly activity?

237
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:08,489
I just start to working here.

238
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,647
Just started working.
That's great.

239
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:13,017
TC can you... ?
Just cut for a sec?

240
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:14,708
Okay, how about you make
something up for the camera?

241
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:16,984
Pretend you saw something?
Just...

242
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:19,369
- I got to get go on to work!
- Okay. Okay.

243
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,396
Wait! Wait, wait... No, no just wait.
Do you have any of the  petty cash or...?

244
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,161
Hey Javier, how does 20 bucks sound?

245
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,438
I am standing here with the
resident gardener, Javier Ortega.

246
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:35,641
Javier, have you ever seen
anything strange in the past

247
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:37,240
10 years of working here?

248
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:40,951
Yeah, I saw a ghost.
Over here.

249
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,533
It was really scary.

250
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:48,266
A ghost on the exterior of
the building.  Unbelievable.

251
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,383
This is really a paranormal hotspot

252
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:53,434
unlike anything, we've
ever shot at before.

253
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,929
On three, two, one ...

254
00:13:58,183 --> 00:14:04,084
Because of this location's massive size
and scope, I've called in psychic medium

255
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,064
Houston Grey to assist
in the investigation.

256
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:12,111
Houston!
Are you sensing anything?

257
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:18,082
Oh wow!  Wow!  Oh, there's
such an incredible energy here!

258
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:21,582
It's like hundreds of
voices all talking at once.

259
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:23,145
The sound is deafening!

260
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,396
There is something else.

261
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:35,288
I..I... There's something else here.

262
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,083
It's... like a dark spirit.

263
00:14:38,564 --> 00:14:40,370
It might even possibly be a demon.

264
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:43,378
Now we have got to be
extremely cautious tonight, Lance.

265
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:47,744
We do not want to be messing
with something like this, at all.

266
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,023
This is it!

267
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:55,345
Houston, are you feeling anything?

268
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,626
Yeah.

269
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,638
I'm sensing deep
well of sadness in here.

270
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,613
A profound sadness.

271
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:11,224
I see a patient.
A female patient.

272
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:18,668
A girl. There is water,
red... red water.

273
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:30,089
Blood. Blood.  She died right in here.
She slit her wrists in the bathtub.

274
00:15:30,424 --> 00:15:33,927
The caretaker said a girl
killed herself right here.

275
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,462
Houston!
That's incredible.

276
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:40,361
The spirit is still with us.

277
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,374
Cut it.

278
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:46,598
Yeah!

279
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,020
- Okay!  Was that too much?
- No.

280
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:51,430
Come on.
How was it guys?

281
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:53,627
No, no, no. That was great.
That sounded very real.

282
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:58,851
Hey Lance!
How do you feel about Show 6?

283
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,777
Feeling good.
It's a good location.

284
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,859
Do you think we're actually going
to see some ghosts this time?

285
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:06,534
Oh yeah! Hundreds of them.
I'm sure.

286
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:09,555
Wow!  Maybe you try to
sound a little less skeptical.

287
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,938
I mean, it would be great.
But if we don't, then... you know

288
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,329
whatever, we just want to make sure
we can get some good scares. That's all.

289
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:19,065
Oh!  Oh, oh hey, TC!

290
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:22,072
Uh, you want to get
a nice crime lab shot?

291
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,710
Dude, the ground's slippery.

292
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:14,632
Okay, this is creepy as shit.
I am getting out of here.

293
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:29,556
Alright, we are about to check in with our
resident Grave Encounters tech wizard, Matt.

294
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,175
Matt!  Why don't you walk us through
some of what are you're doing here?

295
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:34,643
I've set up ten static cameras

296
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,927
around the hotspots of ghost activity.

297
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:38,651
So they record constantly the tape.

298
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:40,809
They are also recording
to a backup hard drive.

299
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:44,029
And everything gets wirelessly
transmitted back to my computer.

300
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,867
So I'll know what's
happening all the time.

301
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:46,714
Real quick Matt!

302
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:49,674
Why don't you walk to us through
what some of the equipment is for?

303
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:52,353
This is an EMF meter.
And what this does is

304
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:55,737
it records electrostatic and
electromagnetic fields in the air.

305
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:57,254
So the basic idea is that

306
00:18:57,255 --> 00:19:00,251
man-made or human EMF
fields will remain stable.

307
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:01,906
While fields caused by

308
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,482
paranormal activity will
produce spikes in the reading.

309
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:06,306
Infrared thermometer.

310
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:10,810
Okay, it's the same idea as the EMF, only
it's used to detect drops in air temperature.

311
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:14,354
Ghosts are believed to cause
dramatic drop offs in air temperature,

312
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:16,584
known in the paranormal
community as cold spots.

313
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:19,145
Testing one, two, three ...

314
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,582
- This is a simple analog audio recorder.
- All right.

315
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:25,919
- It's used to capture EVPs.
- Oh, now real quick ...

316
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:29,205
For the audience at home,
explain, what an EVP is...

317
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,191
EVP is Electronic Voice Phenomena

318
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,853
This thing will actually pick up sounds
that the human ear cannot detect.

319
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:37,759
So when we play it back,
if we hear something,

320
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,164
we'll know that something out there
is trying to communicate with us.

321
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,982
Okay. This is my favorite.
This is a Geiger counter.

322
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,315
You just turn the sound right here,
and you're good to go.

323
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,326
I mean, look at this!
This is freaking bad ass!

324
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:49,468
<i>That's bad ass.</i>

325
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:52,242
Listen!, I can guarantee you,
that if there is anything paranormal,

326
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:55,564
anything freaky happening in
this joint, we gonna catch it.

327
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:58,921
Alright folks, we're about
to initiate lock down.

328
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:01,277
My friend Kenny here, the
building's care taker

329
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:04,039
will be doing us the honor
of sealing us inside.

330
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:07,862
Kenny, thanks very much, man!
See you at 6 am.

331
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:10,240
Okay, 6 am sharp.
Good luck!

332
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:17,133
I am a demon.
A demon child.

333
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:19,318
I can't wait to see you
there in the morning.

334
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:25,177
Yeah, you see, we got to spend the
night with these two freaks.

335
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:28,518
What are you doing?
I'm on with Kenny.

336
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:30,053
Dude, did you lock the door?

337
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:32,440
What do you mean?  It's great for
the show, man.  Don't worry about it.

338
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,208
What if I have to get
more equipment after that?

339
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:37,326
All right!
This is the real deal folks!

340
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:41,968
This is the by far the biggest
location we have ever investigated

341
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,950
and the most dangerous.

342
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:46,520
Now, I want to put
emphasis on fact that

343
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:49,420
this facility was built
very much like a prison.

344
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:52,014
All the windows are barred.
We literally

345
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:54,519
could not get out of
here if we wanted to.

346
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:58,607
We are trapped inside,
until Kenny the caretaker

347
00:20:58,642 --> 00:21:00,422
comes to get us in the morning.

348
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:02,661
We will be working
in pitch dark.

349
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:06,580
Capturing everything on three
night vision capable cameras.

350
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:09,771
Along with the static cams
that Matt set up for us

351
00:21:09,806 --> 00:21:11,031
on our hotspots.

352
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:16,250
All right everyone! If  you are
ready, it's time to have some

353
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:18,487
Grave Encounters!

354
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,754
Okay, we're
now roaming the

355
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,866
vast darkness of the
hallways of the institute.

356
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:30,281
Hallways that have been
abandoned for more than 50 years.

357
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:34,917
We are in search of spirits
that are unsettled in life

358
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:38,467
and possibly unsettled
in the afterlife.

359
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:43,588
- I sense down here is cold
- Cold is right.

360
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:46,270
This is the hallway
where the apparition

361
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:47,845
of the patient
with the shaved head,

362
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:51,412
was seen floating down
at the end of the hallway.

363
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:54,161
Sasha, Let's do that EVP.

364
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:57,748
Is there somebody with us?

365
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:02,437
Are you a patient here?

366
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,852
- Did you use to live in the hospital?
- Play back.

367
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,456
<i>"Is there somebody with us?"</i>

368
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:14,806
<i>"Are you a patient here?"</i>

369
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,013
<i>"Did you use to live in the hospital?"</i>

370
00:22:23,563 --> 00:22:24,819
There's nothing.

371
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:27,700
- All right.  One sec...
- I feel like it just sort of a ...

372
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:30,479
Spirit, you have
nothing to fear from us.

373
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:34,084
If you are here, show yourself!

374
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,775
I think it's getting colder as we
go on.  It's drawing us this way.

375
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:39,392
It wants us to go this way.

376
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:45,408
If there's a spirit here with us,
we want you to give us a sign.

377
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,385
Open the window!

378
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:50,989
Even just a nudge.

379
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,565
I'm going to use, this still camera to
try to capture paranormal anomalies.

380
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:07,654
They're not usually
seen by the human eye.

381
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:10,677
It's better known
as spirit photography.

382
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:18,278
One more.

383
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:21,774
We gonna have to wait for
the pictures to be developed.

384
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:26,007
If there is a ghost behind
me, we won't know until later.

385
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:33,898
Are you the one, who
wrote on these walls?

386
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,478
Or are you trying to communicate?

387
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:45,694
Why don't you try and
communicate with me now?

388
00:23:52,606 --> 00:24:02,558
If the patient who killed herself in this
room, in this very tub, is here now,

389
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,930
make yourself known.

390
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,388
I'm really creeped out in here.

391
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:19,365
Alright, camera 2 and 4 have...
Temperature readings are nominal.

392
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,807
Guys, why do I have to be the
one that sits here by myself?

393
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,054
Houston, do you feel anything?

394
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:36,308
I'm feeling a very, very
negative dark energy here.

395
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:42,731
And not just a single energy, a
lot of energy.  Many, many spirits.

396
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:48,665
If there are any spirits down
here, please show yourselves!

397
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:53,888
Make a noise for us.

398
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:59,753
As we said before, it seems like
these tunnels just go on forever.

399
00:25:01,998 --> 00:25:03,859
It stinks in here too.

400
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:07,621
- Oh, did you hear that?
- I heard that too.

401
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:16,900
- Okay, we just heard something.
- What the fuck was that?

402
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:20,114
I don't know, come here.
Over this way. You guys, follow me.

403
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:23,569
<i>- How is it? Where is it coming from?
- I think this door.</i>

404
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:26,684
Just down over here.
You want to open this?

405
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:28,704
You can swing your
camera around and get in?

406
00:25:28,873 --> 00:25:33,156
Yeah, not really, but...
God damn it!

407
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:39,026
<i>Oh!
Whoa... yucks!</i>

408
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,647
<i>- Rats!
- Are you frigging crazy?</i>

409
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:43,933
- No way, man!
- Really?

410
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:46,153
<i>It's not that big of a deal.</i>

411
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:47,563
Awesome!

412
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,387
<i>- You're such a dork!
- You see, its not funny!</i>

413
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:54,064
This place is as haunted as a ...

414
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:56,730
<i>It really is scary.
I honestly scared, okay so...</i>

415
00:25:56,731 --> 00:26:00,867
<i>Sitting in a graveyard, an
inflamed guy is murdering his wife...</i>

416
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:54,782
Could this be residual
ectoplasmic material

417
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:58,339
discovered first by the
Grave Encounters team?

418
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:02,714
Okay, I think we should just do
one more walk-through upstairs.

419
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,944
Give me some V camera
shots down the hallways,

420
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:07,101
get some of that...
floaty hallway stuff.

421
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:10,103
Like we did at Plain View Mansion.

422
00:27:10,104 --> 00:27:12,863
Yeah exactly, exactly...
Stuff we can cut into.

423
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,343
Lance you are going to love me.

424
00:27:56,378 --> 00:27:58,454
Mmm...
Shit!

425
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:06,743
How do you like this?
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

426
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:13,610
Yes, my dear?

427
00:28:13,615 --> 00:28:16,525
Come on.  Why was
she crying on the phone?

428
00:28:18,045 --> 00:28:19,544
Hi pumpkin!

429
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:22,270
What's this mummy tells me,
you're afraid of

430
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:24,070
monsters under the bed?

431
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:26,443
Didn't we have this conversation?

432
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,297
Monsters aren't real, baby.
They aren't real.

433
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:34,618
Even they were real, they
wouldn't want to come to our house.

434
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:37,998
Because you know Daddy will
take care of them for you.

435
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,714
Tell mummy I gave you permission
to lay in bed with her tonight.

436
00:28:42,715 --> 00:28:44,641
Your Daddy won't be
home until morning.

437
00:28:44,676 --> 00:28:48,157
We'll go out for pizza tomorrow, ok?
Dad will be home soon.

438
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:50,342
Bye bye.

439
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:10,573
God damn! Its cold in here.

440
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:14,248
What the fuck was that!

441
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:18,302
Guys, cut this shit!
I'm not fucking playing!

442
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:22,539
Ain't the fucking
time to do this shit!

443
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:25,395
What the fuck!

444
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:30,451
Hey!
Where are you guys?

445
00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:31,708
Maybe it was the wind or something.

446
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:36,210
That's solid, alright.  Nothing short
of a tornado is gonna move that.

447
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:37,235
How much do you think that weighs?

448
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,421
Hey TC, how did it move?
Was it like...?

449
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,478
Whatever it was, it scared
the crap out of me, right.

450
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,709
I have to change my shorts
and I'm getting out of here.

451
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:43,910
<i>Can you explain it?
I...</i>

452
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:47,484
I just told you, man.  I was
taping, I turned around like this.

453
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,678
The thing just closed.
And I...

454
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:51,128
- I thought it was you guys, at first, right?
- You were taping it?

455
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:52,229
<i>You taped?</i>

456
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:54,824
I told you that in the first place.
If you guys weren't so busy like...

457
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,773
<i>- Is it you frigging have it on the tape?
- You got it on tape?</i>

458
00:29:56,774 --> 00:29:57,772
Check that out!

459
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,528
- Boy!
- Oh my God!

460
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:04,697
<i>Okay, that's freaky.
Yeah.</i>

461
00:30:05,232 --> 00:30:08,299
I accept your apology,
I accept your apology.

462
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,076
I cannot believe that you saw that!

463
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:14,338
Incredible footage you saw just
moments ago, was captured by

464
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:15,350
cameramen TC.

465
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:19,948
This door directly behind
me slammed on its own.

466
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:22,453
Now there's no drafts in room,

467
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,364
there's no windows that could
have caused it to slam on its own.

468
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:30,872
We are now going to
attempt to make contact.

469
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:40,326
Is there someone here with us?
Please make a noise.

470
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:43,601
Tap on something.

471
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:48,930
Feel free
to slam the door

472
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:52,300
like you did on TC
just moments ago.

473
00:30:52,905 --> 00:30:55,204
Feel free to slam it
as hard as you like.

474
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,093
So go ahead.

475
00:30:57,828 --> 00:30:59,142
Slam it!

476
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,027
Right wow, please!
Give us a sign!

477
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:12,814
Spirit, I invoke you to make
an appearance.  Take out...

478
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:20,201
With... If there is anyone here,
give us a sign...  Fuck!

479
00:31:20,202 --> 00:31:24,396
Fuck!  I thought we were actually
going to have something here.

480
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:27,271
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

481
00:31:27,272 --> 00:31:29,130
<i>Jesus Christ!
It was here...</i>

482
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:30,444
That was really fucking scary guys.

483
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:32,851
That came from right... right here!

484
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:38,905
Shit, I can't see anything.

485
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,090
Do you hear that?

486
00:31:43,993 --> 00:31:45,073
<i>What's that?</i>

487
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:48,356
<i>- What?
- Oh shit...</i>

488
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,718
<i>Holy shit!</i>

489
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:57,326
<i>Hello!</i>

490
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:04,130
- What's if...?
- This is really fucked up guys.

491
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:07,588
- I'm going to...
- What the fuck is that guys?

492
00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:08,823
- What the fuck is that?
- What's up there?

493
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:12,587
Matt.  Hey Matt, is there
anybody up on Four?

494
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:15,755
Anybody up on any floor above us?

495
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:17,897
No.
What the hell is going on?

496
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:21,014
Obviously, somebody is fucking around
if they know we're shooting here.

497
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:22,543
Why are we going up here last?

498
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:26,191
Because this is where the
sound came from.  Jesus Christ.

499
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,158
Hello!

500
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:29,977
Is there anybody up here?

501
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:32,167
<i>If someone's here, why
are they fucking with us?</i>

502
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,698
Listen! If there's anybody here
trying to fuck with us, its not funny!

503
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:41,731
Alright, we'll call the police!
We have a right to be here!

504
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:43,567
We have a permit, and you don't!

505
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:45,881
- Hey, can you lower your fucking voice.
- I'm just trying to talk!

506
00:32:45,906 --> 00:32:49,283
- You guys, you guys quiet.
Well, this is something real.

507
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:55,042
I gonna do EVP.

508
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:59,153
What's your name?

509
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:01,727
What do you want?

510
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:05,890
Are you in the room with us?

511
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:08,166
Where are you?

512
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,742
Come on, Sasha.
Play back

513
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:12,442
"What's your name?"

514
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:14,672
"What do you want?"

515
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,936
"Are you in the room with us?"

516
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:21,441
"Where are you?"

517
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:24,565
What's that sound?
No, no, no.  What is that?

518
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,163
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?

519
00:33:32,264 --> 00:33:34,032
- Did you get that?
- Did you see that?

520
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:37,194
- No way!
- I got it on tape

521
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:38,744
Sasha!

522
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:43,342
Please, please, can't even
find you there ... at the lobby!

523
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,316
I need to get out of here.
I need to get out of here right now.

524
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:51,837
I can't even view.
What are you thinking?

525
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:54,344
- Just wait a second.
- Wait for what?

526
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,596
We've been shooting this show
for what?  Five episodes?

527
00:33:57,628 --> 00:34:00,250
We've never seen
anything like that before.

528
00:34:00,253 --> 00:34:03,702
I don’t even care!  And I just
need to get the fuck out of here!

529
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,142
Fine!  Houston, you take her down
there and you come right back, okay?

530
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:09,119
- I think I'll stay down there as well.
No, no.

531
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:11,095
I need another face on camera.

532
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:13,411
Lance, I'm really thinking,
I don't think I can do this. I...

533
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:16,895
Be a fucking professional will you?
Alright.  Stay in the character.

534
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,250
We are on to something here.
Alright!

535
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:20,476
Don't do this to me

536
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:24,077
Alright, I'll come back.
Come on sweetheart.

537
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:27,527
No no no!  TC you're
with me, man. Come on.

538
00:34:27,762 --> 00:34:30,496
Are you kidding me?
Did you see that shit?

539
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:34,665
We don't get that kind of thing again
man!  You're fucking making millions!

540
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:39,067
Just moments ago
in this very hallway

541
00:34:39,102 --> 00:34:42,517
we captured undeniable
proof of the paranormal.

542
00:34:42,552 --> 00:34:48,943
Sasha was terrified to the bone because
a ghost actually manipulated her hair.

543
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:53,509
We're going to try to
attempt to make contact now.

544
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,229
To the Spirit, who
dwells in the hallway

545
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:03,555
we implore you to show us a sign.

546
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,292
Manifest yourself!

547
00:35:06,627 --> 00:35:07,753
Please!

548
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:15,106
If you're still with us...
give us a sign.

549
00:35:15,302 --> 00:35:18,975
Make a noise or...
manipulate my hair.

550
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,831
Do you see anything?

551
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:28,425
No.  Wait.  Give me the
light... no, nothing.

552
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:32,436
- Don't even think of asking ...
- We are a team.

553
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:33,729
I think its gone.

554
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,997
You what I think, honestly.
I think it had its fun...

555
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:39,824
It played this little prank and it
took off.  Maybe that's all they do...

556
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:41,616
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know.

557
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:45,238
Come on, you some fucking
in here, do something.

558
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:48,729
You did it before, do it again.

559
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,070
Are you fucking scared?

560
00:35:56,058 --> 00:35:59,145
Jesus Christ.
Fuck, forget it.

561
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:02,094
Lance!  Its gone ...
Its left us ...

562
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,983
I'm sensing that it's toying with us.

563
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:07,223
-  Couldn't have said more...
- Shit.  Give it a rest.

564
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:08,824
Could we go home now?

565
00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:14,065
Lance, there are people who chase Bigfoot,
look for Loch Ness their whole lives.

566
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,546
All right.

567
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:18,007
<i>TC, what time is it?</i>

568
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,283
<i>It's 4:40.</i>

569
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:22,742
<i>So let's go home, man.
When did that guy say he's coming again?</i>

570
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:24,797
Hey you guys, I think
we have enough footage.

571
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:27,924
Why don't we just pack up
everything and we get out of here.

572
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:30,898
<i>- Okay! So we are...
- Yay... We're going home.</i>

573
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:35,357
I think it's just right up ahead.

574
00:36:37,802 --> 00:36:39,332
Are you sure?

575
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,488
Yeah, this is it.
This is it.

576
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:43,903
<i>I don't think so.</i>

577
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:50,930
<i>- This is this the way, right?
- Oh for the look! Fuck, it's a dead end.</i>

578
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:52,124
<i>Guys.</i>

579
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,560
<i>You see, that's not...
that's not the way. Wait...</i>

580
00:36:56,565 --> 00:36:58,391
Come on, come on!

581
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:01,437
<i>- TC roll on this, man.
- Roll on what?</i>

582
00:37:01,483 --> 00:37:03,611
<i>- After we're lost?
- We're not lost.</i>

583
00:37:04,406 --> 00:37:06,465
We're not lost,
we came this way ...

584
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:12,756
And Matt?  Hey Matt, you are...
Are you at the station?

585
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,586
Matt! We're lost in here, man.

586
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:18,234
We need...
We need some info.

587
00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:21,744
Why the fuck isn't he answering?

588
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,957
- I'm not going that way TC!
- Why not?

589
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,142
Because I'm going back over here.

590
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:33,001
Yeah.  We... if we stay in one direction,
then we're gonna get there okay?

591
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:34,900
It's what?
North?

592
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:37,100
In there and around
the corner, is where

593
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:39,344
the bathtub was, you know
where the girl killed herself.

594
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:43,216
Hey, we've been this way before,
we've been this way before TC.

595
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:46,729
I'm not trying to fight with you.  Just
explain to me when we saw this tub again.

596
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,682
Because this is not the same
fucking tub.  I know it's not.

597
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:51,780
- TC, come on get up, man.
- You said 6 o'clock?

598
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,336
- Are you gonna sleep there?
- Is Kenny coming at 6 o'clock?

599
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:56,170
- I'm not waiting.
- Yeah, he's coming at 6 o'clock.

600
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:59,288
<i>I'm not waiting for you man.
I'm not waiting.</i>

601
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:20,698
Where the hell were you guys?  You
all hear me calling you on the walkie?

602
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:21,447
<i>Yeah, you know what?</i>

603
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:24,499
<i>Two tin cans with a fucking
string on it would have been better.</i>

604
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:26,707
- We got lost.
- Something wrong with your walkie-talkies?

605
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:28,305
No!  I was calling you guys!

606
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:30,687
You didn't hear me on radio?

607
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,405
No, I didn't hear shit.
You didn't hear me?

608
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:33,506
<i>No!</i>

609
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,230
<i>Because this is why you don't
lock the door, Lance, by the way.</i>

610
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:37,385
<i>Lance!</i>

611
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:40,077
<i>Case and point why you
don't lock the fucking door?</i>

612
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:42,725
<i>Holy shit!</i>

613
00:38:42,728 --> 00:38:44,764
<i>What did you see?
Which one is it?</i>

614
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:47,529
<i>- That... fuck the hair.
- Oh yeah it is.</i>

615
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,568
<i>That is fuck!</i>

616
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:52,480
<i>Alright, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna
dump this quick on the computer.</i>

617
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:54,208
<i>No no no, Matt, we don't
have time for that.</i>

618
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:56,946
<i>Grab all the static cams.
Get it all together. You know...</i>

619
00:38:56,947 --> 00:39:00,210
<i>Guys, let's all get up and
start packing this stuff up.</i>

620
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:01,735
<i>Get it ready for
when Kenny comes.</i>

621
00:39:01,736 --> 00:39:04,335
<i>- Can somebody help me, please?
- No no no no.</i>

622
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:06,794
<i>I need everybody down
here, Matt. I'm sorry man.</i>

623
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:08,319
<i>It's gonna cut it's side, I know.</i>

624
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,194
<i>- You got your radio?
- Yeah, I got it right here.</i>

625
00:39:11,238 --> 00:39:14,160
<i>- Sure it works?
- Hope so.</i>

626
00:39:14,195 --> 00:39:17,302
<i> - Did you hear that?
- Yeah, we got it.</i>

627
00:39:17,384 --> 00:39:19,751
<i> - Okay, I'll Be right back, okay?
- Alright man.</i>

628
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:22,399
<i> Don't fucking leave without me.</i>

629
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:35,034
Okay, it's time to get
the fuck out of here.

630
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,820
Hey Lance, are you there, man?

631
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:18,146
Hey guys, I got something up here.

632
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:21,337
Hello!

633
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:26,215
Hey Lance!

634
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:28,790
Hello!

635
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:32,511
Guys, quit fucking around!

636
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:53,272
<i>It is now approaching morning.</i>

637
00:40:53,307 --> 00:40:55,998
<i>We haven't seen any
activity in well over an hour.</i>

638
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:59,547
For Grave Encounters,
I'm Lance Preston.

639
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:01,900
- One more time...?
- No, we don't have...

640
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:03,022
One more time.

641
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:07,811
For Grave Encounters,
I'm Lance Preston.

642
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:11,470
That's all I got.
Fucking, I why I hate this anyhow...

643
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:13,411
It doesn't really matter, guys.
You know why?

644
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:17,013
We can always pick this up tomorrow,
there'll be sunlight, we'd be better too.

645
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:18,293
- Fine.
- You know what I mean?

646
00:41:18,328 --> 00:41:19,871
That’s good idea.
Where is Matt, anyway?

647
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:21,587
What the fuck is taking him so long?

648
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:22,711
Matt?

649
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:27,421
Matt?
Are you there?

650
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:30,982
<i>- Lance! Lance!
- Matt?</i>

651
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:33,008
<i>Radio's not working before.</i>

652
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:42,694
<i>Guys, I know this
sounds really stupid but...</i>

653
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:45,900
<i>I'm the last person who wants to go
walking through these halls again.</i>

654
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:50,031
<i>But it's pitch black, and Matt could
have fallen and hurt himself for real.</i>

655
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:52,303
<i>She's right, he could be hurt.</i>

656
00:41:54,937 --> 00:41:57,807
<i>- Guys, we have to go look for him.
- Okay...</i>

657
00:41:57,842 --> 00:42:02,400
<i>Alright, this is ridiculous, alright.
Let's go fucking look for him</i>

658
00:42:02,435 --> 00:42:05,102
<i>TC grab the camera.
Sasha grab the camera.</i>

659
00:42:05,103 --> 00:42:05,914
<i>For what?</i>

660
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:09,739
<i>Listen!  If we gonna go and do this,
then we might as well film everything.</i>

661
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,004
<i> - Thanks for your help, man.
- Hey!</i>

662
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:16,441
It's no fun hanging around
here I can tell you...!

663
00:42:16,878 --> 00:42:20,768
By myself..!
Jesus Christ.

664
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:22,882
Matt!

665
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:26,881
- Matt!
- Matt!

666
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:29,541
Matt...!

667
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,479
- Matt!
- Matt!

668
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:35,717
- Matt, where are you, man?
- Where the fuck are you?

669
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:37,941
Matt!

670
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:43,262
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

671
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,902
Matt!
Hey Matt!

672
00:42:47,037 --> 00:42:49,408
Why is this shit
everywhere?

673
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,719
Matt!

674
00:42:51,395 --> 00:42:52,108
Matt!

675
00:42:52,407 --> 00:42:53,356
Matt!

676
00:42:53,357 --> 00:42:55,752
- Matt!
- Matt!

677
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,690
Alright, alright, alright.

678
00:42:59,725 --> 00:43:00,941
He wouldn't just leave
equipment like this?

679
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:01,825
No, he wouldn't

680
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:03,676
It looks like he was just
packing it up anyway.

681
00:43:03,677 --> 00:43:05,786
He's got to be... He's got to be
down one of this ways.

682
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:08,676
TC, you go that way,
Sasha and I'll go this way

683
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:11,008
Why will we do this?
That is a terrible idea.

684
00:43:11,146 --> 00:43:12,912
He's got to be here,
he wouldn't just leave

685
00:43:12,913 --> 00:43:14,067
- his stuff here alright...
- Why don't we split up as a ...?

686
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:17,340
Sasha comes with me.
TC just check that way, okay?

687
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:23,167
This looks like the living room
after a fight with my girl!

688
00:43:23,222 --> 00:43:27,263
Matt, where are you man?
I want to go home, this is enough!

689
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:29,451
Freaking us out! Man.

690
00:43:29,852 --> 00:43:32,079
Look for the cigarette butts...!

691
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,364
Come on, Matt!

692
00:43:36,928 --> 00:43:38,941
This is stupid.. Dude!

693
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't understand this guy.

694
00:43:57,786 --> 00:43:59,479
Matt!
Come on, dude!

695
00:43:59,815 --> 00:44:01,920
You're gonna get me
a shit with my girl!

696
00:44:02,255 --> 00:44:06,332
It's late!
Fuck man.

697
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:08,589
You better be dead or dying, bro.

698
00:44:09,193 --> 00:44:15,264
Matt!  I ain't playing with you
right now!  Where the fuck you at?

699
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:17,612
What the?!

700
00:44:18,378 --> 00:44:19,542
Matt?

701
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:37,830
Lance!  Sasha!

702
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:39,815
- Shit!
- What happened, what happened?

703
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:42,862
- Don't, don't
- What, what?

704
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:46,558
Are you serious man?
Are you okay?

705
00:44:46,593 --> 00:44:48,058
- What?
- Just lift me

706
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,582
Lift me.

707
00:44:53,996 --> 00:44:55,801
- I swear to God, someone ...
- What?

708
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:58,067
- I got pushed..
- What?

709
00:44:58,068 --> 00:45:00,896
Something fucking pushed me, man.
I was looking for fucking Matt.

710
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,213
I was looking downstairs,
sort of fucking

711
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:05,594
pushed me, I almost
broke my fucking neck, dude.

712
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:07,766
I looked back and
there was nothing there.

713
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:10,791
These things have been messing
with us, alright, all night.

714
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,340
We're getting fucking by them.

715
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,534
- Call him! Call Kenny! The only way...
- Okay! Okay!

716
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:18,021
- Told you. Just call him.
- Jesus, I'm calling Kenny alright?

717
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:21,011
Jesus Christ.
Fucking signal.

718
00:45:21,046 --> 00:45:22,946
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

719
00:45:24,747 --> 00:45:26,999
Fucking piece of shit.

720
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,881
Alright, I can't get a signal.

721
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,144
Oh God...!

722
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:34,404
- Let me try.
- Alright, check the phones, guys.

723
00:45:38,744 --> 00:45:41,659
Perfect.
Fucking perfect.

724
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:47,900
What the hell are you doing TC?

725
00:45:47,906 --> 00:45:50,489
What does it look like I'm doing?
Come here and fucking help me.

726
00:45:50,724 --> 00:45:53,451
- You can't break down the door, TC!
- Just watch!

727
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,758
No!  We're gonna cause
damage to the property.

728
00:45:55,759 --> 00:45:57,324
We're going to
be liable for it, alright.

729
00:45:57,325 --> 00:45:59,684
Just be patient.  Wait!
The guys fucking coming.

730
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:02,672
See hey!  Come on man!
What the fuck!

731
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:04,190
That's coming out of your rate.

732
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:06,838
Does it look like I give a fuck
about the fucking rate.

733
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,254
The fuck can...

734
00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:10,301
I'm tired of this shit.
I want to go home

735
00:46:10,302 --> 00:46:12,818
I want to go back to the fucking
hotel and get some fucking sleep.

736
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:16,068
Hey, you know what?
Your boy is a no show, okay.

737
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:17,090
What is he?
An hour late?

738
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:20,261
So just put the fucking camera...

739
00:46:20,262 --> 00:46:21,844
- Christ!
- Fine. Alright.

740
00:46:23,346 --> 00:46:25,737
- Help me.
- Alright, hang on.

741
00:46:29,422 --> 00:46:34,166
<i>- Do you want my help?
- No, Houston, we're fine with you there.</i>

742
00:46:37,205 --> 00:46:42,365
On three okay?
One, two, three...

743
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:54,305
One, two, three!

744
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,485
What the hell.

745
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,344
No, this is the fucking lobby!
This is the fucking lobby.

746
00:47:10,993 --> 00:47:13,159
- We came in this way, right?
- Hell, yeah!

747
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:15,383
Yeah, this is the...
this is the lobby, yeah.

748
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:17,426
This can't be right.

749
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:19,027
This is impossible.

750
00:47:19,062 --> 00:47:21,930
- This is the way we... this is
where we put our shit, right?
- Yeah.

751
00:47:21,934 --> 00:47:24,220
This is the way we... this is
how we brought the stuff in.

752
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:28,369
- This doesn't make sense right?
- I don't understand, shit...

753
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:32,840
This doesn't make any sense...
This is the way we came in.

754
00:47:33,128 --> 00:47:35,621
If there's another hallway,
it doesn't... I don't know ...

755
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,158
It must have got turned around here.

756
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:40,158
It must be on the other side
of the building or something.

757
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,728
Lance!

758
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:50,375
Lance!

759
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:54,857
Are those are same doors?

760
00:47:57,361 --> 00:47:59,286
I'm getting sick of this, guys.

761
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:02,516
Oh, ho ho ho, yes!

762
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:05,018
Houston, take that.
Take that, please.

763
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:09,956
Hey, hey, watch your leg, man.
Watch your leg!

764
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:12,457
Give me your fucking hand, you
sit and watch.  Isn't that fucking...

765
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:14,120
All right, all right, all right.

766
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,299
What the fuck is wrong with you?

767
00:48:16,148 --> 00:48:18,425
One, two, three!

768
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,991
What is that fucking same...?
What the fuck is going on?

769
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:39,050
Maybe it's just an exit down to...
like this way to the emergency exit.

770
00:48:39,053 --> 00:48:40,275
Houston shut the fuck up.

771
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,896
Shut the fuck up.

772
00:48:42,303 --> 00:48:43,813
This, you see?

773
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:45,603
Now we'll get out.

774
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,693
Give me a fucking second?

775
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:58,147
- Oh fuck!
- Hey, watch it. Watch yourself.

776
00:48:58,148 --> 00:49:00,659
- We're fucking trapped in here, man!
- No, we're not.

777
00:49:00,694 --> 00:49:03,328
Hey, let's get a tool.
We can try pry the bars out.

778
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:06,381
I, oh, I got a fucking tool-belt.
Oh, shit, I forgot.

779
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:09,210
- It's in the van. Outside!
- Oh, fuck!

780
00:49:09,215 --> 00:49:11,315
- You know, how we're locked out?
- We got nothing?

781
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:13,072
Fucking brilliant idea.

782
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:16,368
Alright, obviously not all the fucking
windows have bars on them.

783
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:17,091
Yeah, they do.

784
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:21,701
No, no!  The one upstairs!  That
one didn’t have any bars on it!  Right?

785
00:49:21,736 --> 00:49:22,619
We just got to find it.

786
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,826
Who knows?
The shit's off...

787
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:28,227
- Come on.
- What time is it, Sasha?

788
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,533
- 8:34
- You got to be fucking kidding.

789
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,906
- Fuck!
- I told you that fucking ...begin at 8:34.

790
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:36,252
I have an audition tomorrow!

791
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:40,710
No one cares about you and your career
inside ... the baggage studio shit!

792
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,586
- Oh! My work's not as important as yours?
- Guys, let me think for a second!

793
00:49:43,621 --> 00:49:45,260
This doesn’t make any
sense, it's fucked up!

794
00:49:45,295 --> 00:49:47,841
I checked the
sunrise times last night.

795
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,729
What's your fucking point?

796
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:54,487
Should've been bright by 7:45.

797
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:58,097
But it's still night out.

798
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,695
- The sun is still not up ...
- Didn't make any sense!

799
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,210
It's not fucking funny man..!

800
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:06,013
Shut up!

801
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:07,294
This no make no sense.

802
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:13,329
- I need to get out of this building! Please!
- Somebody help us!

803
00:50:14,288 --> 00:50:18,424
Ok ok ok ok.  Here. Listen, listen.  Well,
let's just try to be rational here, ok?

804
00:50:18,425 --> 00:50:20,406
This is an old building, right?

805
00:50:20,421 --> 00:50:23,420
It's an old building, so it has all
sorts of energy fields, things

806
00:50:23,422 --> 00:50:25,638
and stuff going on, either
could be electrical anomaly,

807
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,150
that has actually moved our clock
faster, something so that you know,

808
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:34,155
it's actually not really 8.30 but only 6.30.
That would explain why it's so dark out.

809
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,000
And why why... you know,
Kenny hasn't shown up.

810
00:50:36,002 --> 00:50:38,864
- Electric anomaly?
- It's fucking retarded!

811
00:50:38,899 --> 00:50:41,867
Why did you come to believe your fucking
come from idea comes from rational?

812
00:50:41,902 --> 00:50:44,320
This isn't one of your fucking audition
for some science fiction movie!

813
00:50:44,322 --> 00:50:46,384
Because nothing else
is rational here okay.

814
00:50:46,385 --> 00:50:48,944
It is rational as anything else.

815
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:16,039
I checked my cell phone...

816
00:51:16,646 --> 00:51:20,624
And... it says the time is 1.12.

817
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:24,902
It's 1:12 pm.

818
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:32,542
I don’t think that's right.
But I guess it cant be... right?

819
00:51:33,428 --> 00:51:37,426
I don't know.
Everyone's very tired.

820
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,982
So they are just taking a
nap and taking a break.

821
00:51:42,755 --> 00:51:45,082
And we're going to just
wait until Kenny shows up.

822
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:48,929
I don't know what
the hell is giving me this.

823
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,132
Doesn't makes any sense.

824
00:51:55,234 --> 00:51:57,422
I haven't slept for like 20 hours.

825
00:51:59,465 --> 00:52:05,846
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna set my
alarm for an hour and I'll take a nap.

826
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:41,463
Houston, what's your problem?

827
00:52:41,498 --> 00:52:44,518
- It's not my problem!
- What the hell are you doing?

828
00:52:47,382 --> 00:52:50,566
- What the hell happened?
- Oh my God!

829
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,991
Someone or something
just broke our lights.

830
00:52:56,637 --> 00:52:59,737
We are in the pitch dark.
All we have is our

831
00:52:59,738 --> 00:53:01,698
flash lights and our camera lights.

832
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:05,468
- Which you're wasting right now.
- I just checked my cell phone.

833
00:53:05,493 --> 00:53:07,139
And it says it's 8 pm.

834
00:53:07,315 --> 00:53:10,143
So, we slept for 7 hours.

835
00:53:10,178 --> 00:53:14,877
TC went to get a sandwich
and you gotta see this.

836
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:23,216
Lance!  It stinks...
Close that shit.

837
00:53:24,322 --> 00:53:27,386
What are you...?
Close the fucking thing.. man!

838
00:53:30,047 --> 00:53:34,394
All our food is like that, but
we still have lots of bottled water so...

839
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:37,156
I don't know, we should be okay.

840
00:53:39,101 --> 00:53:41,082
Why don't we try going
down through the tunnels?

841
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:44,429
Kenny said that the tunnels
connect all the buildings together,

842
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,782
then maybe we can find a way out
through one of the other buildings.

843
00:53:46,783 --> 00:53:48,505
Are you looking and see
the Great Wall of China?

844
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:52,157
I'm not going from the goddamn tunnels.
If our lights go out we're fucked.

845
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:55,332
Eh listen. Remember when you told
me to do the time lapse outside.

846
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,903
- Mm hm.
- I saw a fire escape.

847
00:53:57,904 --> 00:54:01,166
If we get on the roof, probably
climb down and get the fuck out.

848
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:03,267
Well.  What's the verdict?
Shall we stay in here or ...

849
00:54:03,302 --> 00:54:05,810
I don't care what we do.
Let's just get the fuck out of here!

850
00:54:05,812 --> 00:54:07,064
I really... I don't want
to be here anymore.

851
00:54:07,065 --> 00:54:10,540
- Ok ok.  So everybody, we're gonna
do this.  Everybody wants to do all this?

852
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:12,366
- To the roof!
- Alright, fine!

853
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:14,876
Let's pack up all
the gear and let's go.

854
00:54:17,196 --> 00:54:19,862
- Give me some of the light, guys. Come on.
- Here here here.  Sorry.

855
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:26,502
- We go there?
- Let's wait!

856
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:28,467
- Lance?
- No, no, no!

857
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:30,368
TC you knew where we
were going, you said.

858
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:32,788
I didn't say anything!
Don't put it on me.

859
00:54:32,823 --> 00:54:35,167
No, you said you know
where the ladder was.

860
00:54:35,168 --> 00:54:36,784
No, I said there was a ladder.

861
00:54:36,785 --> 00:54:38,203
- I didn't tell you where.
- Okay. But is it this end?

862
00:54:38,232 --> 00:54:39,816
It doesn't matter.
Was it here?

863
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,613
- I saw from the outside.
- Okay. Got just a ...?

864
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,242
I can't do this, guys!

865
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:50,204
- Look!
- What the fuck is that?

866
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:54,038
- Hello! Someone up here?
- We just keep on...

867
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:55,629
TC!  Is this there?

868
00:54:55,664 --> 00:54:58,270
Don't ask me questions.
Is it staircase or not?

869
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:02,857
Hey listen, just keep the
light on in front of me.

870
00:55:02,892 --> 00:55:04,201
Move, move move!

871
00:55:04,664 --> 00:55:07,497
Get the fuck out of my way!
Get the fuck out of my way!

872
00:55:08,592 --> 00:55:10,716
- Wait guys!
- Slow Down.

873
00:55:10,717 --> 00:55:11,846
What the fuck, you guys?

874
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:19,190
Yes, yes.
The fuck, yeah!

875
00:55:24,169 --> 00:55:25,756
No fucking way!

876
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:28,685
Check this, check this!
That can't be right.

877
00:55:33,627 --> 00:55:35,249
It's fucking solid.

878
00:55:35,452 --> 00:55:38,764
Does it look new?  Does it look
like it's been there for a while?

879
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:40,682
This doesn't make any sense.

880
00:55:44,114 --> 00:55:47,045
Would you get the fucking
camera out of my face!

881
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:54,966
- What do you think?
- I don't know, I don't know.

882
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:11,915
We just left the stair well that was
completely sealed off at the top!

883
00:56:11,918 --> 00:56:14,500
I going to document everything,
when we get out of this.

884
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:16,806
People are coming to see this.

885
00:56:19,945 --> 00:56:23,194
Look at this!  Okay we came up
4 floors from the stairs, right?

886
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:24,352
That puts us on the 4th floor.

887
00:56:24,387 --> 00:56:28,389
We came from this way, and
we've gotta at least be here, right?

888
00:56:29,025 --> 00:56:30,823
- Are you sure?
- I don't know ...

889
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:32,540
- TC, you said one of this floors...
- Lance! Lance! Lance!

890
00:56:32,575 --> 00:56:33,499
What, what?

891
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,203
- What are these?  You were here?
- No, we know we went up a number of stairs!

892
00:56:37,204 --> 00:56:38,404
This has not changed.
This is not opened.

893
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:39,313
This is not the change.

894
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:41,632
This says we're on the 1st floor.

895
00:56:41,653 --> 00:56:43,054
Another we keep in mind though.

896
00:56:43,055 --> 00:56:46,667
- Initially this is where we came in, right?
- I know, I know, but...

897
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:53,367
- TC, are you filming this?
- Yeah, yes, that's fucked up.

898
00:56:56,758 --> 00:56:59,995
What what what?  What the
fuck is that?  Did you hear that?

899
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,369
- Did you guys hear that?
- Oh shit!  What is that?

900
00:57:02,414 --> 00:57:05,854
- Shit! Stop.
- Matt? Matt?

901
00:57:06,438 --> 00:57:10,020
Holy shit!  Over here.
From this foot.  Over here.

902
00:57:11,921 --> 00:57:15,341
Matt! Matt! Matt!

903
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:16,440
Matt, is that you?

904
00:57:23,323 --> 00:57:26,289
He's not in here.
He's not in here!

905
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:28,749
Whoa whoa whoa!
That just fucking move?!

906
00:57:32,873 --> 00:57:35,790
Let's get out of here!

907
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:08,414
Now we wandered the building
to take a look for another stairwell.

908
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,616
And... I don't know.
We couldn't find one.

909
00:58:12,668 --> 00:58:14,462
This building is a fucking maze!

910
00:58:15,294 --> 00:58:17,694
It's like TC said it's...

911
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,682
It's likes just keeps
changing all around us.

912
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,858
We still haven't been
able to find Matt.

913
00:58:25,948 --> 00:58:27,904
I don't know if he's okay.

914
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,170
At least he's not seeing
that same shit as we are!

915
00:58:37,504 --> 00:58:42,324
We are all tired, and we are hungry.
So we gonna try to sleep again.

916
00:58:44,629 --> 00:58:46,875
We're going to
sleep in shifts this time

917
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:50,054
so somebody can always be at watch.

918
00:58:55,886 --> 00:58:57,897
- TC, you're rolling now?
- Yeah.

919
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,693
We just woke up and
you guys got to see this!

920
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:04,740
Turn the fucking camera off!

921
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:06,585
Sasha!  Come on.
We gotta to document this okay.

922
00:59:06,587 --> 00:59:07,710
- I'm sorry. People got to see this.
- No, no!

923
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:09,547
- Careful! Careful!
- I'm so sorry.

924
00:59:10,943 --> 00:59:14,428
Sasha, we got to tape this down.
This is unheard of.

925
00:59:14,463 --> 00:59:16,116
There is no way someone came in here

926
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:18,051
and did that without us noticing.

927
00:59:18,086 --> 00:59:20,705
- Dude cut it!  Cut this.
- My pleasure.

928
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:21,746
Matt!

929
00:59:24,646 --> 00:59:26,038
I swear I heard.

930
00:59:26,473 --> 00:59:27,776
Matt!

931
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:30,202
<i>Hello!</i>

932
00:59:30,558 --> 00:59:31,437
Matt?

933
00:59:31,472 --> 00:59:35,024
See?  There, there. Fucking
heard him, I told you guys.

934
00:59:35,025 --> 00:59:36,045
He's alive!

935
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:37,517
Matt! Are you okay?

936
00:59:38,215 --> 00:59:39,859
Can you hear me?

937
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,098
<i>I'm freezing!</i>

938
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:53,069
Just tell us where you are.
We'll come and get you..

939
00:59:54,868 --> 00:59:57,145
Matt!
Shit!

940
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:58,883
He's not there anymore.

941
00:59:59,408 --> 01:00:00,939
<i>We have to find him.</i>

942
01:00:01,036 --> 01:00:01,835
<i>How do we gonna find him?</i>

943
01:00:01,836 --> 01:00:03,596
<i>We can't even find
our way to the front door!</i>

944
01:00:03,762 --> 01:00:06,848
<i>Houston, he can't be far.
Those walkie-talkies are a piece of shit.</i>

945
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,174
Listen, how do we even know its him?

946
01:00:14,299 --> 01:00:18,656
Matt!
Are you in here?

947
01:00:19,445 --> 01:00:21,847
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!
- Fuck!

948
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:25,176
Matt!  We hear you buddy!
Where are you?

949
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:29,579
Sasha, try all the frequencies.

950
01:00:29,795 --> 01:00:31,678
It doesn't have that much range.

951
01:00:32,723 --> 01:00:34,405
How far is did you say
you thought it was?

952
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:35,923
I don't know how far,
the specifications...

953
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:41,399
- So what did you guess? 200-300-400?
- 200 yards to get a clear signal.

954
01:00:41,578 --> 01:00:45,030
Maybe 300... before it
starts crapping out.  Okay.

955
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:46,598
<i>Stay together, come on.</i>

956
01:00:46,954 --> 01:00:49,053
<i>That's a dead end!
Dead end.</i>

957
01:00:49,724 --> 01:00:51,628
<i>- Matt!
- Hey Matt!</i>

958
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,590
<i>- Matt.
- Matt!</i>

959
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:59,986
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

960
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:11,707
Listen guys.  This is
fucking pointless, alright?

961
01:01:11,742 --> 01:01:14,519
If we were to find it, he would...
the range of it no matter what...

962
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,986
<i>Holy shit!</i>

963
01:01:16,295 --> 01:01:18,741
<i>- What was that?
- That was Matt!</i>

964
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:22,323
<i>What are you doing, man?</i>

965
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:28,297
<I>What the fuck... ?

966
01:01:31,895 --> 01:01:34,932
Lance! Lance! Lance...

967
01:01:43,029 --> 01:01:44,731
<i>Do fucking something!</i>

968
01:01:46,256 --> 01:01:47,451
<i>Lance! Lance!</i>

969
01:01:47,852 --> 01:01:50,875
<i>Hey you.
Hey!</i>

970
01:01:51,783 --> 01:01:54,346
<i>Who are you?
How did you get in here?</i>

971
01:02:11,513 --> 01:02:14,049
Turn off the light!
Light off!

972
01:02:17,341 --> 01:02:18,613
<i>Did you see her fucking face?</i>

973
01:02:18,648 --> 01:02:19,548
<i>Shut your fucking mouth!</i>

974
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,980
<i>Did you see her fucking face?</i>

975
01:02:28,121 --> 01:02:30,762
<i>What's happening here?
What is it wrong with me?</i>

976
01:02:30,763 --> 01:02:32,063
<i>Oh my God!</i>

977
01:02:35,347 --> 01:02:37,842
<i>Oh shit! Oh shit!</i>

978
01:02:37,975 --> 01:02:42,664
<i>Shit, we lost him!
Oh shit, we fucking lost Houston!</i>

979
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,602
<i>Matt!</i>

980
01:02:53,032 --> 01:02:54,133
<i>Guys!</i>

981
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:56,358
<i>Guys!</i>

982
01:02:59,581 --> 01:03:01,072
<i>Sasha!</i>

983
01:03:11,618 --> 01:03:12,414
TC!

984
01:03:15,545 --> 01:03:16,451
Lance!

985
01:03:54,184 --> 01:03:55,893
Is there anybody here?

986
01:03:58,048 --> 01:03:59,304
TC!

987
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:10,672
Help! Help!

988
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:25,744
Help! Please!

989
01:04:55,981 --> 01:04:57,796
Houston's gone.

990
01:04:59,207 --> 01:05:03,445
then we tried Matt on
radio but he doesn't respond.

991
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,507
What the fuck is that?

992
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,844
We keep hearing crazy shit
like that all around us.

993
01:05:12,163 --> 01:05:13,128
Fuck!

994
01:05:14,592 --> 01:05:16,481
I don't think how
long it's going to last.

995
01:05:21,122 --> 01:05:22,858
We are not alone in here anymore.

996
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,247
How is the name on it?

997
01:05:31,273 --> 01:05:34,034
How the fuck is my
fucking name on it?

998
01:05:35,802 --> 01:05:40,882
First, I get scratches on
my back and now ...

999
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:43,050
What the fuck!

1000
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:45,894
When we woke up, we had this
you got to see this ...

1001
01:05:45,895 --> 01:05:51,768
Fuck you. What the fuck, what the fucking
wrong with me, you fucking asshole?

1002
01:05:51,803 --> 01:05:55,499
- I didn't fucking mean to, okay?
- You fucking...!

1003
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,472
- I didn't fucking mean to.
- You bring us up, you asshole.

1004
01:05:59,484 --> 01:06:01,773
What the fuck does this mean?
It means we're fucked.

1005
01:06:01,813 --> 01:06:03,438
Okay! That's what it fucking means

1006
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,390
This is insane.

1007
01:06:06,558 --> 01:06:07,859
Fucking insane!

1008
01:06:30,797 --> 01:06:33,804
- Don't look in it!
- Why, what wrong with looking like this?

1009
01:06:38,827 --> 01:06:41,721
What the fuck?
Enough, man!

1010
01:06:43,655 --> 01:06:46,310
There's something over there.

1011
01:06:51,896 --> 01:06:53,305
Here!  Enough is enough!

1012
01:06:53,307 --> 01:06:56,095
We keep walking in what
feels like circles and

1013
01:06:57,922 --> 01:07:02,802
we... we still can't find
Matt and Houston.

1014
01:07:02,862 --> 01:07:05,866
- Will you stop!
- Will you stop what?

1015
01:07:05,887 --> 01:07:09,213
Are you kidding me?
Fucking whole shit, we're not making 'em!

1016
01:07:09,214 --> 01:07:12,303
- Fucking TV show.
- I'm just documenting stuff, okay?

1017
01:07:12,338 --> 01:07:13,502
People will gonna want to see this!

1018
01:07:13,537 --> 01:07:18,390
Matt and Houston are gone?
We need to concentrate on

1019
01:07:18,393 --> 01:07:20,694
getting out of here and
finding them.

1020
01:07:21,118 --> 01:07:24,531
And you're just still
doing this whole shit!

1021
01:07:24,642 --> 01:07:26,170
Okay you guys, just
stay together, okay?

1022
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:27,956
- I'm just really...
- Don't worry about it.

1023
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:39,932
- Is that the fastest you have to run?
- Let's go!

1024
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,860
Jesus Christ! Come on!
Keep up!

1025
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:45,400
No, no, no, no! Get up!

1026
01:07:45,402 --> 01:07:47,229
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1027
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,069
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on!

1028
01:07:52,158 --> 01:07:54,294
- I can't, I can't!
- Yes, you can.

1029
01:07:54,382 --> 01:07:57,500
Come on, you've got to get up.
You got to get up.

1030
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:01,946
Come on.  I know!  I know!  You got
to be strong. You got to listen, ok?

1031
01:08:01,981 --> 01:08:04,512
You got to get up.
We got to keep going!

1032
01:08:06,266 --> 01:08:08,510
What, what?

1033
01:08:08,689 --> 01:08:10,001
<i>Just get over here!</i>

1034
01:08:11,016 --> 01:08:12,798
What are you waiting for?
Come in!

1035
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:14,567
Look!

1036
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,531
Oh shit!  Is it Matt?
That's him, right?

1037
01:08:19,532 --> 01:08:22,108
<i>I don't know, man.
Matt!  Hey!</i>

1038
01:08:23,294 --> 01:08:24,814
<i>Matt, get up!</i>

1039
01:08:24,815 --> 01:08:27,484
<i>Matt, Matt!</i>

1040
01:08:27,523 --> 01:08:29,073
<i>Just shut the fucking room!</i>

1041
01:08:32,022 --> 01:08:33,327
<i>Hey Matt?</i>

1042
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:41,650
- Hey hey hey. Stop fucking around!
- Matt, are you okay?

1043
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:49,243
The patient exhibits acute...
disorder linked to childhood phobia.

1044
01:08:50,732 --> 01:08:51,677
Jesus Christ!

1045
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,565
- Get him the fuck up!
- Let's go! Go!

1046
01:08:57,683 --> 01:09:01,995
Come on, get him up!  Pull him over and
let's get the fuck out of this room now.

1047
01:09:03,036 --> 01:09:06,812
<i>Get him in here.
Come on.</i>

1048
01:09:07,871 --> 01:09:11,090
<i>Put him down on bed,
put him down there.</i>

1049
01:09:11,412 --> 01:09:13,518
<i>- You see anything?
- No, its good.</i>

1050
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:19,348
Hey! Where you been?
Where did you get those clothes?

1051
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:23,640
- Well, for God's sake, talk to us!
- You guys, look at his wrist.

1052
01:09:24,997 --> 01:09:26,297
Matt? Matt?

1053
01:09:29,925 --> 01:09:32,703
Where did you get this?
Where did you get all this shit?

1054
01:09:32,827 --> 01:09:38,721
Matt!  What did they do to you?
What did you see?

1055
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,612
Nothing is bullshit!
Look, where have you been?

1056
01:09:42,613 --> 01:09:45,500
You probably know a way out of here.
You got to know a way out of here.

1057
01:09:46,605 --> 01:09:50,518
Of course there's a way out.
We can all leave,

1058
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:52,569
as soon as we're better.

1059
01:09:52,704 --> 01:09:54,842
What?  What do you mean
"when we're better"?

1060
01:09:55,343 --> 01:09:56,980
What the fuck does that mean?

1061
01:09:56,982 --> 01:09:59,516
Well, I wasn't ready yet.

1062
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:05,050
Progress is slow.  But the patient
is responding to treatment.

1063
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:07,860
This guy is out of his mind.  He is
like high or something. He talks of...

1064
01:10:07,865 --> 01:10:11,461
- TC!   Shut up!
- You don't need to tell me fucking, fuck!

1065
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:17,872
Don't be sad
Everything is gonna be okay.

1066
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,063
He'll help you too.

1067
01:10:32,249 --> 01:10:33,275
<i>Oh my God!</i>

1068
01:10:33,276 --> 01:10:36,684
- Okay TC!  Go check that door!
- I already did.

1069
01:10:37,026 --> 01:10:39,508
Check it!  Not...
if something gets in here man.

1070
01:10:39,509 --> 01:10:41,411
Just make sure
there's nothing in here!

1071
01:10:51,057 --> 01:10:52,431
We found Matt.

1072
01:10:54,582 --> 01:10:56,020
He's all fucked up.

1073
01:11:09,402 --> 01:11:10,800
<i>There's somebody I think is here.</i>

1074
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:12,708
What?

1075
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:16,346
- It's okay.
- What are you doing?

1076
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:31,574
I don't feel good.

1077
01:11:34,219 --> 01:11:36,396
I think there's
something wrong with me.

1078
01:11:43,252 --> 01:11:47,898
Yeah, you feel really warm.
I think you got fever.

1079
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,680
- Here.  Have a sip.
- Thank you.

1080
01:11:53,687 --> 01:11:56,509
- Get some sleep.
- I can't sleep.

1081
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:02,815
Thank God.
We'll be able to sleep again.

1082
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,845
- Come on!
- Come on.

1083
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:23,141
Come on...!

1084
01:12:27,398 --> 01:12:30,056
Run!
Run!

1085
01:12:31,372 --> 01:12:33,346
Come on, get in!
Come on now!

1086
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:07,334
<i>- Did you see anything?
- What is that?</i>

1087
01:13:07,637 --> 01:13:10,517
There's blood in the tub!
There's blood in the tub!

1088
01:13:10,565 --> 01:13:12,310
- What?
- Come on!

1089
01:13:12,311 --> 01:13:16,329
...going far away.
Fuck!

1090
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:24,826
Matt.  Matt!

1091
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:27,026
- What he is doing?
- TC!  Get him away from the tub.

1092
01:13:27,095 --> 01:13:29,255
Come on Matt!

1093
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:31,434
TC!  What the hell is he doing?

1094
01:13:31,447 --> 01:13:32,795
I don't fucking know!

1095
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,497
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

1096
01:13:41,139 --> 01:13:42,536
Help me!
Help me!

1097
01:13:42,683 --> 01:13:43,786
Flip the tub!

1098
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:56,028
- He is gone!
- He is gone?

1099
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:59,078
He's fucking gone!

1100
01:13:59,113 --> 01:14:01,135
He just disappeared!

1101
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:15,812
Oh fuck!
No, no!

1102
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,143
It is an elevator!

1103
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,477
Open it!
Open it!

1104
01:15:26,308 --> 01:15:28,245
Open it!
Open it!

1105
01:15:33,497 --> 01:15:34,901
It's an elevator shaft.

1106
01:15:35,727 --> 01:15:36,975
If we can get down to the tunnels,

1107
01:15:36,976 --> 01:15:38,969
we could use them to get
one of the other buildings.

1108
01:15:46,354 --> 01:15:49,445
Go!
Fuck, fuck!

1109
01:15:50,007 --> 01:15:53,645
Listen! Listen to me.
I believe it's safer in there, okay.

1110
01:15:53,646 --> 01:15:57,996
I'm going to get some... and then
we're getting out of here. Okay?

1111
01:15:58,138 --> 01:16:00,137
Stay here with him, man. Okay?

1112
01:16:39,075 --> 01:16:40,291
What the hell is that?

1113
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:45,350
Jesus!
Is that a tongue?

1114
01:17:05,438 --> 01:17:07,250
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

1115
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,251
Bring the light, bring it here.

1116
01:17:19,683 --> 01:17:23,578
There is a ladder. We can use it.
We can use the ladder to head down.

1117
01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:24,980
How are we going to get Matt?

1118
01:17:25,048 --> 01:17:27,708
I'm going to reach across, and
then you help me with Matt, okay?

1119
01:17:31,675 --> 01:17:33,786
Get back there!
Stay back.

1120
01:17:34,548 --> 01:17:36,173
Lance! Lance!

1121
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:46,741
<i>Where the hell is
the night vision button?</i>

1122
01:17:48,354 --> 01:17:49,233
There it is!

1123
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:39,500
He's gone?

1124
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:42,253
I don't know, he just disappeared.

1125
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:46,496
<i>Go on. Go on.
He may come back. Go on.</i>

1126
01:18:49,782 --> 01:18:51,347
- Where the hell is he?
- Matt!

1127
01:18:53,652 --> 01:18:58,110
Jesus!  He jumped!
He jumped!

1128
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:29,322
Come on!

1129
01:19:29,323 --> 01:19:31,231
Easy.
I got you.

1130
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:34,827
You're okay.
Go on.

1131
01:19:37,003 --> 01:19:37,905
It's okay.

1132
01:19:53,785 --> 01:19:54,752
It's the tunnels!

1133
01:19:56,809 --> 01:19:59,064
We made it to the tunnels.
Come on.

1134
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:01,695
I can't.
I can't leave him.

1135
01:20:01,866 --> 01:20:03,489
Come on, Sasha!
Get out of there.

1136
01:20:03,493 --> 01:20:06,582
Remember what Kenny said.
They connect the buildings, right!

1137
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,547
You need to do this with me.

1138
01:20:09,548 --> 01:20:12,401
- I can't do this alone! Okay?
- Okay.

1139
01:20:16,876 --> 01:20:20,137
Stay close to me.
Let's go this way.

1140
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:23,864
It can't be too far.

1141
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:32,840
Okay, we can.
Come on...

1142
01:20:38,372 --> 01:20:43,499
No! We should hit a...
We should hit a junction by now.

1143
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:47,721
It should have been right around here!
What the fuck!

1144
01:20:52,596 --> 01:20:53,700
I can't...

1145
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,299
Wait a second!

1146
01:21:04,014 --> 01:21:05,251
Sash, you okay?

1147
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,027
Oh Jesus!

1148
01:21:22,105 --> 01:21:24,809
I want my mom!

1149
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:44,958
It's a...
It's day.

1150
01:21:45,374 --> 01:21:47,079
What day is today?

1151
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:52,277
I don't even know what day it is.

1152
01:21:54,732 --> 01:21:57,204
We spent all day
walking in one direction and...

1153
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:59,033
we didn't get anywhere.

1154
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,096
I figured counting me in the wrong...

1155
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:05,637
Sasha not going to make it.

1156
01:22:12,422 --> 01:22:13,507
Who's there?

1157
01:22:15,248 --> 01:22:16,373
Who is that?

1158
01:23:17,825 --> 01:23:19,627
Sasha?

1159
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,488
Sasha, where are you?

1160
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:33,001
Where are you?

1161
01:23:34,699 --> 01:23:35,786
Sash!

1162
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:44,961
Sasha!

1163
01:23:55,492 --> 01:23:56,595
Shit!

1164
01:23:58,168 --> 01:23:59,112
Damn it!

1165
01:24:07,664 --> 01:24:09,010
What do you want from me?

1166
01:24:15,474 --> 01:24:16,832
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1167
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,438
I'm running low on battery power.

1168
01:24:45,592 --> 01:24:47,919
Now, I only turn on light
only when I need to, now.

1169
01:24:50,097 --> 01:24:52,248
But I don't really
need the light anymore!

1170
01:24:55,029 --> 01:24:56,632
I just keep walking straight.

1171
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,656
I could walk in the dark for hours.

1172
01:25:03,745 --> 01:25:05,881
It's kind of like a game.

1173
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,824
How long can you go?

1174
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:19,216
Anybody watching ...

1175
01:25:20,643 --> 01:25:21,500
Fuck you!

1176
01:25:25,474 --> 01:25:26,941
Fuck you!

1177
01:25:27,701 --> 01:25:29,549
Fuck you, guys!

1178
01:25:31,138 --> 01:25:32,622
This is for you.

1179
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:34,450
Don't you hear in these walls?
Don't you hear?

1180
01:26:34,483 --> 01:26:38,692
Don't you hear anything?

1181
01:26:42,302 --> 01:26:44,149
Come and get me!

1182
01:26:50,056 --> 01:26:52,173
Just woke up and...

1183
01:26:53,889 --> 01:26:55,881
I don't know how long
I was sleeping but...

1184
01:26:56,121 --> 01:26:57,776
There is a door!

1185
01:26:58,848 --> 01:27:00,394
You have to see it!

1186
01:27:50,478 --> 01:27:51,673
This isn't happening.

1187
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:54,530
This isn't happening.

1188
01:27:57,515 --> 01:27:59,013
Oh God!

1189
01:29:03,117 --> 01:29:06,428
Jesus! Jesus!
Its...

1190
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,654
It's impossible!

1191
01:29:36,278 --> 01:29:38,328
Shit! Shit!

1192
01:29:49,459 --> 01:29:52,165
No! No!
I'm not crazy!

1193
01:29:52,191 --> 01:29:57,098
I'm not crazy!
No! No! No!

1194
01:30:07,743 --> 01:30:10,183
I'm so much better now!

1195
01:30:12,813 --> 01:30:15,017
I can finally go home!

1196
01:30:18,912 --> 01:30:25,254
For Grave Encounters.
I'm Lance Preston.

1197
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:28,894
Signing off!
