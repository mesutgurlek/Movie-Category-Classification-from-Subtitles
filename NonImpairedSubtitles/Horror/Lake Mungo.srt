1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,284
It feels as if something awful will happen to me.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,962
As if something bad happened.

3
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:17,676
It has not reached me yet,
but it's way.

4
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:31,861
I do not know the value,
but it helps people

5
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:37,633
order to deal with their loss,
by tales of ghosts and so to think.

6
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:50,422
Alice had secrets.

7
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:55,161
She kept the secret,
that she had secrets.

8
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,032
It is difficult for some to understand,

9
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,349
but you should find yourself in debt,
what else you need.

10
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,339
In December 2005
began with a tragic accident...

11
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:26,996
a series of extraordinary events
a grieving family...

12
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:28,843
and the Victorian town of Arafat,

13
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,494
in the center
of the media attention brought.

14
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:34,965
This film is a report
of those events.

15
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,229
JUNE's emergency.

16
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:22,262
The normally tranquil image
Arafat's reservoir was disrupted yesterday,

17
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:24,870
by the disappearance
of the 16 year old Alice Palmer...

18
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,777
during a picnic with her family.

19
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:30,864
We received the call around six hours
about a missing girl,

20
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:35,157
and the nature of reporting,
We have deployed rescue divers.

21
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:38,295
Police divers went to ten hours to water,
together with volunteers,

22
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:39,938
who helped in a fruitless search...

23
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:43,229
Mat Ali and swam to the middle
of the reservoir.

24
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:47,841
I could see,
from where I sat on the picnic area.

25
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:49,990
I think I had 15 minutes in the water,

26
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,744
when I said I went out,
because I was cold.

27
00:02:54,944 --> 00:03:00,128
And I swam back, they did not count,
So I thought that she still wanted to stay.

28
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:03,582
I remember that Mati is released,

29
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:10,079
and a few minutes later
I heard him ask where Alice was.

30
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:17,959
I stood up and looked over the lake

31
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,304
and the water was completely calm.

32
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:24,326
So I started calling.

33
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:30,021
I looked over the water,
if I could see her,

34
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:39,824
and two boys
had checked the bushes.

35
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:43,537
Alice I could see her towel,
she had left.

36
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:50,396
So she was not the water come
because then she grabbed her towel.

37
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:56,885
That was the last time,
I have seen her.

38
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:20,057
Police fear the worst
for the 16 year old Alice Palmer,

39
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:22,446
who disappeared during a picnic
with her family.

40
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:26,152
Police divers...
- They said we had to go home.

41
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,139
And when the divers would find something,
they would let us know immediately.

42
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:49,482
It felt very strange way in the car,
because there was one empty seat.

43
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:52,976
One minute she was there
and then...

44
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:55,926
way.

45
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,696
We stayed that night at the Palmers,

46
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:04,292
and there have
mainly waiting on news.

47
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,220
In bad news.
That was expected.

48
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:15,454
Russell called our mobile,
nine hours at night.

49
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:19,799
He said that an accident had happened
in the reservoir

50
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,029
and Alice was missing.

51
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,743
So we thought it best
for going there.

52
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,974
I remember
June that there was some strange,

53
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:35,344
to see Iris.
There was something strange between them.

54
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:39,432
It felt strange,
to have my mother there.

55
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:43,283
Mom and I there for Alice.

56
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,254
It did not feel right.

57
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:52,061
It was a terrible night.

58
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:54,323
The worst night of our lives.

59
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:01,379
I am later that night,
Alice entered the room.

60
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:08,164
Her phone rang a few times,
but I have not included.

61
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,283
I remember
that the bed was made.

62
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:20,759
I remember I thought,
that there are so neat looking.

63
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:37,242
I got a phone call
Alice's mother, June,

64
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:42,900
Alice said that she lost
and probably drowned,

65
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,590
and I believed her,
but...

66
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:51,580
I do not know,
it was hard to accept, so...

67
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:54,713
Alice, I called her mobile number.

68
00:06:54,713 --> 00:07:02,524
I wanted to know whether it was a joke.

69
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:05,314
It was a shock.

70
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,877
It felt unreal.

71
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:16,047
Everything was as always,
but they said that Alice was drowned.

72
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:20,244
What of that night for you,
the most important memories.

73
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:24,781
I know that we are wearing the light outside,

74
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:28,031
that we still
just in case.

75
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:31,411
Why?

76
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:41,738
In case she comes home
I think.

77
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:13,622
The divers found her body Alice
at 21:25.

78
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,151
They used sonar,
to locate her.

79
00:08:16,151 --> 00:08:22,325
She had drifted and ended
on a protrusion of the dam.

80
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:25,735
I immediately informed the family.

81
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:29,564
Once we were told,
that they had found the body,

82
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:32,929
June and I have gone to the lake.
Georgie is Matt remained.

83
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:39,345
It was all very official and formal,
I had to sign a statement identifying,

84
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,911
June remained in the car.

85
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:48,138
And in hindsight was a mistake,
so because she could not close.

86
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:54,361
I could not bring,
Alice to identify.

87
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:58,044
She had all that time underwater,

88
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:05,073
and so I wanted her...
so I wanted to remember her.

89
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:11,552
I thought it was my responsibility,
as Ali's father, you know ..

90
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:15,793
That is what a man does.

91
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:36,652
The car hit off
on the back of the reservoir.

92
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:40,267
The only gear that worked,
was the reverse.

93
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:44,231
So we drove in reverse
back to town.

94
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:49,029
It was that or walk
and given the events,

95
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,730
that was the only option.

96
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:06,072
The autopsy took place on Monday the 27th.

97
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:14,321
The coroner gave the body Tuesday
the 28th Fri

98
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:21,477
It was very strange for the Day
with the family to spend,

99
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,892
Alice alone in the morgue.

100
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:37,516
I do not know, it was like,
if I had not seen her for a week.

101
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,957
It felt unreal.

102
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:48,224
Death takes everything, eventually.

103
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:52,850
Death is the meanest was there,
and it makes him not care.

104
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:57,798
It makes no sense,
to know more about it.

105
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:03,843
It was a sad day for the family
and the friends of Alice Palmer,

106
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:08,326
The latest evidence came to honor,
a young woman who died too soon.

107
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:12,917
She was a wonderful person,
popular, smart, nice,

108
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,971
I... yes...

109
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:17,573
Alice is remembered
as a happy, cheerful girl,

110
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:20,836
with great vitality,
described as always...

111
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:23,753
The Palmers were difficult,
that period.

112
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:27,704
To think how bad it was then,

113
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,980
you can hardly imagine
how bad it still would be.

114
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,792
Ten days after the funeral of Ali,
January 15,

115
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,056
strange things happened in the house.

116
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:58,671
Sounds on the roof
and sounds came through the window...

117
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:02,908
and other movements,
from Ali's old room seemed to come.

118
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:08,750
We have the door again depended,
of Ali's room

119
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,159
and had an opponent come vermin,
to check for termites.

120
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:15,001
And it did nothing,

121
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,917
the door remained open and close
and we heard noises from her room.

122
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:23,864
There was just something strange about that house,

123
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:30,383
I had a strange feeling
and I can not explain exactly what it was,

124
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:36,241
but if you go in there,
you get a bad feeling inside.

125
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,993
I began to have nightmares,

126
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:50,974
which caused so much grief

127
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:55,885
I sometimes open my eyes wanted.

128
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,184
I was awake,
but I did not open my eyes.

129
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,305
There was one in particular,
very lifelike, and he repeated himself.

130
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:09,974
Alice came into the hall,
still nadruppend of the reservoir

131
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:14,686
and stood at the foot of the bed
and stared at us.

132
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:20,738
It was so frightening,
I dared not open my eyes to do.

133
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,690
By early February
My nightmares were so bad,

134
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:33,190
I night walks
began to make. Sometimes three hours long,

135
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:38,625
to not having to sleep at night
with my eyes closed.

136
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,061
Sometimes I
to the homes of other people.

137
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:48,191
It did not feel as if I did something wrong,

138
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:54,807
I think I wanted to share a part while
someone else's life.

139
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:07,850
Georgie, you remember,
how that period was Russell?

140
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:15,633
Russell was working a lot,
I think that has helped with his grief.

141
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:22,782
Russell and I met
Gibsland, Louisiana during the CASMAN project in '89.

142
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:25,036
We have worked together since.

143
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:28,359
So you know each other a few years.
- Yes, a number of years.

144
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,710
Remember how he was
after the death of Alice, was there anything changed?

145
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,946
The work went on and...

146
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:43,262
and that was difficult,
I did not know what to say to him.

147
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:47,992
You did not talk about.
- Not really, everyone mourns in their own way,

148
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:53,323
and it was not my case
to tell him how he must feel.

149
00:14:53,752 --> 00:14:56,975
But I was worried.

150
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:01,669
I was really grateful that I had my work,

151
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,760
and since then I felt really guilty,

152
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:08,356
but I wanted more.

153
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:19,262
One night I came home late February
of work and I sat in the kitchen,

154
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,826
and I heard a noise from Ali's room.

155
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:28,656
So I went Ali's room
and I do not know exactly why,

156
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:33,702
but I sat in the chair
for the sideboard,

157
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,915
and tried to think what I did there,

158
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:42,871
Ali and then went inside to her office
and they began to sharpen a pencil,

159
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:48,771
and when she seemed to view an SMS
on her phone,

160
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,485
and I had not.

161
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:57,754
She was totally unconscious
of my presence.

162
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:02,761
And what happened then I do not know,
I should have moved the bed,

163
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:08,378
or sound made with my shoes,
or something and she shivered,

164
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:13,228
and then I knew,
they knew I was there.

165
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:17,590
She turned and looked at me,

166
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:21,976
what felt like forever,

167
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:27,759
and when she came to me and said go away.

168
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,949
and I got up and went away
as fast as I could.

169
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:38,046
I heard Russell crying, he was in the kitchen,
Mathew and I found him here.

170
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:42,634
He sniffed it out,
He was totally inconsolable.

171
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,922
Do you Russell,
when he says he saw a ghost?

172
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:50,066
Yes, I think he said what he saw,

173
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:55,027
And he would not...
He is not the man who invents something.

174
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:56,886
So I think he has seen something.

175
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,752
Whether it's a real ghost or not,
I do not know.

176
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,270
But I am sure,
he has seen something.

177
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:26,444
I know I tried,
with members of the church to speak,

178
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:30,032
June and on how to help the Palmers.

179
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:35,101
But we seemed to do nothing.

180
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:40,174
Part of the problem,
they were not church goers.

181
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:43,161
They did not,
how she had to offer them comfort.

182
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,691
I do not even believe where June.

183
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,945
I was most worried about Mathew.

184
00:17:53,312 --> 00:17:56,001
I think, because they were so close.

185
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:59,265
I made me worried,
about how he would deal with it.

186
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,566
I remember that he was more often alone,

187
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:13,207
I worried for him.

188
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,197
Mathew came here
in unusual places on his body.

189
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:24,720
They were unusually
terms of distribution and depth.

190
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:34,001
We thought an earlier traumas,
but that was not there.

191
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:39,750
We examined him on inflammation
and poisoning.

192
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:43,102
We could not conclude,

193
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:48,818
and a few weeks later
places that disappeared spontaneously.

194
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:52,797
And we never have a cause
ascertained.

195
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:58,537
I'm Steve Wilkie,
the best friend of Mathew.

196
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:02,683
I'm about two to three times a week
Mathew at home.

197
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:11,567
We are a band together.
We play music at home.

198
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:16,626
Mathew seemed quieter,
but he was always rather quiet,

199
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:21,251
so there is no alarm bells went off or something.

200
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:25,162
I had heard about,
people's homes that went into June.

201
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:30,149
Mathew seemed not to want to talk
and I have not asked him.

202
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:38,006
I knew,
he was interested in photography,

203
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:44,183
and in that period
he more attention.

204
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:52,303
Mathew came to me
and wanted to know everything about photography,

205
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:56,882
and I wanted very much to help him,
that's what I do.

206
00:19:56,882 --> 00:20:00,003
He asked me the shirt off my body,

207
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:04,068
about equipment, techniques, exposure.

208
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:07,476
He was a great help
and I even hired him.

209
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:37,791
Mathew, what can you say about the pictures,
of the garden you've taken.

210
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:42,533
Yes, it comes down,
I was the same picture,

211
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:46,940
same composition for the three months
photographed before, during four years.

212
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,628
It's just a picture of the garden
and in the distance you see the hills.

213
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:57,154
It is a little project I started,
From the moment we arrived.

214
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,525
And what was different about the photo of April 28?

215
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:06,792
The picture was the same,

216
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:14,097
but it seems,
like Alice in the fence.

217
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:24,677
Remember how the reaction was home?

218
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,282
I can not say,
the mood was good,

219
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:30,146
but better than before.

220
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,190
I think that all this gave us something
to focus on.

221
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:46,110
The photos were taken April 3
and developed on the fourth,

222
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,962
and I looked at them, I think, on the fifth.

223
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:53,208
And I looked at the dams
and the water and I was pretty happy,

224
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:57,457
but the next day
I was pointed out by my wife,

225
00:21:57,457 --> 00:22:01,364
that there was something in the background,
there was someone.

226
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,203
When I first looked at the picture,
I did not know what it was.

227
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:24,598
The figure made me quite upset,
because it certainly looked at Alice.

228
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,313
It was quite a disturbing image.

229
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:37,205
And I became convinced,
Alice was still alive.

230
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:48,388
I had no rational explanation,
who was in the photographs.

231
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:52,753
But I knew something of Alice,
June did not know what.

232
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:55,518
I have seen the body of Alice.

233
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:58,664
I did not think she was alive.

234
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:01,636
I knew it was not.

235
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:05,713
I became convinced
that Russell had made a mistake.

236
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:10,253
He himself has said,
they seemed to anybody.

237
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:16,430
June was so convinced of my error,
I began to doubt himself.

238
00:23:17,052 --> 00:23:25,426
Perhaps I had already decided
Alice that was before I looked.

239
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:29,394
And the circumstances were so compelling,

240
00:23:29,394 --> 00:23:33,587
I decided that it was.

241
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:39,520
More than three months after the funeral
of Arafat's teenager, Alice Palmer,

242
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:43,052
asked the grieving parents,
to exhume her body exhumed

243
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:44,661
the general cemetery.

244
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:50,504
The Palmer's doubts
to identify the body.

245
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:54,679
June and Russell Palmer
asked for a DNA test.

246
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:58,470
They were not sure whether the body
that they identified was actually Alice.

247
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,434
Alice's body was exhumed,
where the funeral,

248
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:07,030
dr Slaghter and a representative
of the coroner were present.

249
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:09,724
Her body was transported
Arafat to the hospital,

250
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:12,139
where they decreased the DNA samples

251
00:24:12,422 --> 00:24:15,493
and they remained there,
until results were available.

252
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,967
A few days later we received
The preliminary report of the pathologist,

253
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:31,330
and the identity of Alice was determined
on the basis of comparison.

254
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:37,133
Only after confirmation
that the body of Alice was

255
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:42,441
I realized how much energy I had put,
the idea that it might not.

256
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:49,257
I wanted so badly,
it was a terrible mistake,

257
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:51,789
if it was mine.

258
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:56,222
I wanted so badly,
that another child was in that reservoir,

259
00:24:56,222 --> 00:24:58,472
a runaway, a victim of murder,

260
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:02,583
Just a child of someone else,
long as it is not my child.

261
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,463
While it was not Alice.

262
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:49,708
Alice was reburied on June 7.

263
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:57,892
But the question remained,
who or what stood in the photographs.

264
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,219
I kept hearing things and...
- What did you?

265
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:27,121
I kept hearing noises,
pitiful sounds, noises in the hall.

266
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:34,396
I thought I put a camera down,
to see if there is something to see.

267
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:03,910
I watched the video of the first night
and there were images of a figure,

268
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:09,115
who moved from the bathroom...

269
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:11,174
the hall to the door.

270
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:25,105
You listen to Boyd's FM,
it is two minutes to eight.

271
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:29,755
I am Helen Bath
and we will continue with...

272
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:31,693
The following line is Margie,
Ray?

273
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,043
Hi Margie, how are you,
what can I do for you.

274
00:27:37,826 --> 00:27:42,626
By that time I decided to ask for advice
to Ray Kemeny.

275
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:46,473
I had Ray for years followed on the radio,

276
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:50,904
and the opinions were divided,
some believed in him,

277
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:52,942
others were not as convinced.

278
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:56,303
The following line is Annie.
- Hello Annie, how are you.

279
00:27:56,908 --> 00:28:01,221
It is good to me Ray, thank you that you took.
- No problem, what can I do for you?

280
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:04,674
I would like a normal reading.

281
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:08,395
Just, not medical?

282
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:12,516
I am of Hungarian origin,
My parents came here when I was young.

283
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:16,902
I have a 15 year old daughter,
with her mother who lives in South Australia.

284
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:21,282
My first name is actually Zsolt,
but I changed to Ray.

285
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,163
This is a more trusted name
for a medium.

286
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:29,407
The most popular medium of Australia.

287
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:39,760
Usually my work is about sick,
or dying, or about one third part,

288
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,398
them to experience,
that death is not the bitter end,

289
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:51,031
that this does not stop everything.
That is one consolation that I would give,

290
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,481
because life after death
is still elusive.

291
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:59,850
There is someone you really come near,
someone you have not seen.

292
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:06,528
Someone who comes back into your life,
someone who will give you comfort.

293
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:12,691
Does anybody on this description?
- Yes, I can propose to someone.

294
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:15,349
I see you have many problems,

295
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:22,599
but returnee,
will make much difference and bring comfort.

296
00:29:23,757 --> 00:29:25,720
Thank you Ray.

297
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,261
Bye, Annie.

298
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:50,866
Where I come from, they cover the mirrors,
to avoid a dead return.

299
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:54,000
Things like that make the difference.

300
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,078
Hi Annie, I'm Ray.

301
00:30:31,507 --> 00:30:34,553
I liked Ray from the beginning,
He was not what I expected,

302
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:36,781
I do not know what I expected,

303
00:30:36,782 --> 00:30:41,377
but there was nothing ghostly,
or counterfeiting to him.

304
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,485
Are you ready?

305
00:30:58,183 --> 00:31:00,350
I usually make a video of my sessions,

306
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,440
so they can be judged
by customers.

307
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,384
In particular, if a trance
whether hypnosis is used.

308
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,924
I love a copy
and they get a copy.

309
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:13,110
I prefer the safe side.

310
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,655
Okay, so you stand for your home,
tell me what you see.

311
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:30,725
My house, it's a white house,
I walk to the door.

312
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:35,861
I want you to go inside the house,
walking slowly through the house.

313
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:39,004
I want you to describe what you see.

314
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:43,541
And tell where you are,
give me a tour.

315
00:31:54,711 --> 00:32:00,619
Okay, I walk through the hall,
towards Alice's room.

316
00:32:05,244 --> 00:32:10,559
What do you see?
- I see the shoes are Alice.

317
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:15,653
And what does that tell you, June?

318
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:23,122
She always had her sneakers
outside her room.

319
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:28,249
Will you go in her room?

320
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:31,589
Open the door and just go inside.

321
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:36,304
You feel safe enough,
to Alice's room to enter.

322
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,700
Open the door.

323
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,427
I go into her room.

324
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,533
You see something, huh?

325
00:33:03,438 --> 00:33:05,505
Tell me what you see June.

326
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:15,561
Alice sits on the chair,
at the end of her bed.

327
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,890
She looks sad.

328
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:36,338
I met Ray when June asked
to continue eating after the first consultation.

329
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:41,043
I have no prejudices
in terms of mediums.

330
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,534
I had asked him not to eat,
June but I wanted not to upset.

331
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:54,594
He was a nice guy, nothing ghostly
and I behaved at my best.

332
00:33:55,216 --> 00:34:01,391
A couple of days, maybe one weeks later,
I asked the family to hold a seance.

333
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:06,450
June should like, but I remember,
that Russell refused.

334
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:09,202
I think Mathew has his father turned talk.

335
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:12,896
Mathew, how was it you,
that a séance was held in your home.

336
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:18,544
I was interested,

337
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:23,945
and curious,
Dad was not so happy,

338
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:28,721
but I thought it would be interesting.

339
00:34:29,306 --> 00:34:31,362
And I suggested, for the filming,

340
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:36,259
and I took it with the PT 9, a video camera.

341
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:44,873
I feel a strong presence of her
in this house.

342
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,937
I think that we found valuable seance,

343
00:34:50,937 --> 00:34:56,353
Ray brought nothing to light,
no signs, or whatever.

344
00:34:56,353 --> 00:34:59,849
So after one hours or so
We stopped.

345
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:07,020
And the next day,
Mathew then watched the video,

346
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,376
we saw a picture of Alice.

347
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:36,552
This video was very different
than the previous images.

348
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:41,810
It was first detailed
and less blurred,

349
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:45,280
and it was not explained as,

350
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:51,262
an accidental shadow play,
or digital noise, or...

351
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:58,840
There was something inexplicable in our house.
Without doubt.

352
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,912
I was worried.

353
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:07,734
This was uncharted territory for me,

354
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:10,592
and I sat in the middle.

355
00:36:27,582 --> 00:36:32,958
Ray asked him to help Mathew,
installing three cameras,

356
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:37,244
together 24 hours a day filming.

357
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:44,861
There was much speculation about Ray
and what he did.

358
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:50,638
If people do not know,
true that to gossip and speculation.

359
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:54,113
I've heard rumors throughout July
on video recordings,

360
00:36:54,113 --> 00:36:57,551
belonging to an "operation"
in the house.

361
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:01,776
But I had my doubts
about legitimacy.

362
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:06,812
And your picture of Ray?
- Also very skeptical.

363
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:11,725
They thought I was a sort of Rasputin,
hypnotized by the Palmers and stole their money,

364
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:14,561
reflecting the benefits at the expense of Alice.

365
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:20,503
Mathew seemed hard to have.

366
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:29,923
I thought I could help
by my presence.

367
00:37:32,768 --> 00:37:35,887
But my main motivation
was professional.

368
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:39,874
Something happened in that house
and I wanted to find out what it was.

369
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:35,696
How you reacted to these images?

370
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:40,087
We were stunned.

371
00:38:41,245 --> 00:38:45,935
But before we realized what this meant,
Withers, the 'video.

372
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:49,517
Is it what?
- Yes, great.

373
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:51,417
Can I look?

374
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:56,904
Cathy and Doug Withers were on April 3
in the reservoir,

375
00:38:56,904 --> 00:39:00,088
Same Day
Bob Smeets which the picture was taken.

376
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:21,166
A few months later, in late July,
when we viewed the film of the reservoir,

377
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:24,004
when we encounter...

378
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:28,528
a figure in the background,
which we identify as Bob Smeets.

379
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:35,741
What was interesting, because we realized,
that that day was that he was there,

380
00:39:35,884 --> 00:39:38,759
and took that picture, everyone is talking about,

381
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:45,010
and when all our pictures we have seen,
to see if we figure had also filmed.

382
00:39:45,278 --> 00:39:48,504
Maybe our cameras saw what Bob did.

383
00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:55,881
And we have a figure found
as his picture was shown,

384
00:39:56,332 --> 00:40:00,572
and when we have better views
and Doug has zoomed in on...

385
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:09,045
I have enlarged on the computer,
from afar it looked like a female figure,

386
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:16,450
up close you could see that no woman
and Alice was not.

387
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:18,831
It was Mathew.

388
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:23,350
Do you believe in ghosts?

389
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:30,741
Here I was,
Bob Smeets when the picture was taken.

390
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:38,370
I wore the coat to Alice and I saw a man
on the hill, which turned out to be Bob Smeets.

391
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:46,618
I did not want the picture,
So I walked away through the bushes.

392
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:52,577
I torque
that filmed not seen the Withers.

393
00:40:56,646 --> 00:41:02,857
When this came out, asked my dad
whether I had done other things,

394
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:07,200
and I would not lie,
So I told everything.

395
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,808
I have my father explained,
I was responsible...

396
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,963
the statues of Alice in the hall
and the bedroom,

397
00:41:19,963 --> 00:41:25,490
and I picture the garden April 28 fabricated,
with a photo of Alice.

398
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:28,318
I told what I had done.

399
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:36,484
I took two photos, one photo of Alice
and of the garden and overlapped the photos.

400
00:41:36,484 --> 00:41:38,649
This is a picture that I took of Alice.

401
00:41:38,649 --> 00:41:42,746
Mom always spoke about the exhumation of Alice,

402
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:47,371
and she had always on,
Dad that the wrong body identified

403
00:41:47,443 --> 00:41:52,884
and I knew that with further
would not happen, so I made the picture.

404
00:41:57,212 --> 00:42:00,132
I used an old video of Alice

405
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:06,893
and I played it off the TV,
with the TV on the bookshelf,

406
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:09,422
Just a picture in the mirror.

407
00:42:09,422 --> 00:42:15,322
So the reflection of the TV appearance
and the mirror was small.

408
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:19,543
I pulled the edges of the road TV
and filmed it.

409
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:21,704
I did the same with the kitchen
and the bedroom.

410
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:26,468
So really what you see,
Alice is on TV in the mirror.

411
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:38,619
I wanted people not cheat,

412
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:42,161
it was more like,
something is better than nothing.

413
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:46,255
Think,
The result was that heavier June?

414
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:54,955
I think...

415
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,275
Yes, so it was probably
difficult for her,

416
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:03,251
but that was not my intention.

417
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:11,056
I'm not so sure of his intentions.

418
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:13,981
I know I...

419
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:16,880
not quite...

420
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:23,447
I would not say,
I do not believe in what he says,

421
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:30,457
but I am not convinced,
he knows why he did it.

422
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:40,949
When it came out people wanted the story,
books, leaves wife,

423
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:43,490
all, length.

424
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,410
We did not
how we deal with it should go.

425
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:54,452
We had Mati protect ourselves,
the memory of Ali.

426
00:43:54,452 --> 00:44:01,188
We had no experience in dealing
with interest in something personal,

427
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:03,454
they wanted to make public.

428
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:08,405
It went not well with the Palmers,

429
00:44:08,405 --> 00:44:12,152
it went bad, they were heavy.

430
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:19,669
It was hard on us,
but especially for June.

431
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,799
She could not let go Ali.

432
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:30,297
She wanted her a little longer hold.

433
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:37,491
And I think they will not admit,
but she was devastated.

434
00:44:47,287 --> 00:44:52,822
She is an interesting girl,
they seemed not so good to be with June.

435
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:54,525
They looked much alike,

436
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,991
it was interesting that they're not as good
got along with.

437
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:06,911
She always seemed very similar
and you saw that Alice looked a lot like June,

438
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:12,691
but there are things more clear
after the death of Alice,

439
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:19,456
which give an impression of what they shared.

440
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:27,447
June was and is still much to itself,

441
00:45:27,447 --> 00:45:32,254
and it appeared that this was also true at Alice.

442
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:42,634
It is about whether or not parts
their private life, I think.

443
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:51,691
It is wonderful when children come
and that you have new experiences,

444
00:45:51,691 --> 00:46:00,176
but you always doubt whether you have enough,
or the right thing.

445
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:06,445
Maybe after that inherits from me,

446
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:09,387
or maybe my mother.

447
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:18,629
I myself never to give

448
00:46:18,629 --> 00:46:22,010
for June.

449
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:26,780
So June is also a little

450
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,079
and she could not fully provide for Alice.

451
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:41,672
I hope that Alice knew,
how much I loved her.

452
00:46:42,253 --> 00:46:45,828
I pulled some back when she was older.

453
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:52,061
That would be a pity,
if they did not.

454
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:07,937
Ray suggested, in order to take Mathew
on one of his Victorian travel

455
00:47:07,937 --> 00:47:13,809
while consultations's itinerary
and we took advantage of it.

456
00:47:33,702 --> 00:47:39,310
I think when I left, I realized,
much I missed Alice,

457
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:43,881
and I never could talk to her.

458
00:47:45,014 --> 00:47:49,624
I believe that all clients of Ray,
this must learn to deal.

459
00:47:49,624 --> 00:47:52,617
They want someone to talk
or contact

460
00:47:52,617 --> 00:47:57,293
with someone they have lost
and me.

461
00:47:57,799 --> 00:48:02,987
So I was really
one of Ray's clients.

462
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:10,020
Can you catch?
Let's see what happens.

463
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,394
I know what will happen,
you will hit me,

464
00:48:12,394 --> 00:48:15,256
and then I get angry,
that will happen, no.

465
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:18,177
Beware.

466
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:22,438
What are you doing in my room?
- No idea.

467
00:48:45,694 --> 00:48:51,555
When Ray and I went on tour,
we let the two cameras in the rented hall.

468
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,924
I was sure,
that there is something in the house.

469
00:48:56,558 --> 00:49:01,995
And since we were three days away,
we could not change tapes,

470
00:49:01,995 --> 00:49:06,888
So you get some film day and a half,

471
00:49:06,888 --> 00:49:12,780
but we let them run
and we came back August 2

472
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,165
and when we viewed the tapes.

473
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:44,004
I know that Russell and I were home,
when these images were recorded.

474
00:49:44,004 --> 00:49:46,481
There could Mathew nothing to do.

475
00:49:48,454 --> 00:49:52,958
They seemed to prove,
there a ghost in our house.

476
00:49:53,446 --> 00:49:55,221
The spirit of Alice.

477
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:04,810
Do you believe in ghosts?

478
00:50:06,149 --> 00:50:08,903
At first no, but...

479
00:50:10,732 --> 00:50:14,506
What is proof?

480
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:23,460
Yeah, I think they may exist.

481
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:29,880
Ghosts can be anywhere,
it is a frightening world.

482
00:50:30,552 --> 00:50:34,456
I do not know,
or important to people,

483
00:50:34,456 --> 00:50:38,444
and that helps,
stories come to mind.

484
00:50:43,276 --> 00:50:49,309
It was a big question mark
and I looked at all the previous video

485
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:53,179
all the videos in the house,
after the death of Alice.

486
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:03,454
It was while viewing
Mathew's June of material from the hall,

487
00:51:03,454 --> 00:51:07,288
something that struck me in the picture.

488
00:51:07,288 --> 00:51:11,355
There was half figure in the hall,
Mathew not, but someone else,

489
00:51:11,724 --> 00:51:14,465
who in the dark
Alice moved into the room.

490
00:51:15,237 --> 00:51:17,158
At first I thought it was Alice,

491
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:23,567
then I realized,
it was our neighbor, Brett Tooheys.

492
00:51:31,065 --> 00:51:35,107
What was that man in my house,
in my daughters room,

493
00:51:35,107 --> 00:51:37,578
more than six months after her death.

494
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:48,613
When I discovered the safe of Alice,
I realized why he had been.

495
00:51:52,386 --> 00:51:54,461
He looked for the band.

496
00:51:57,236 --> 00:51:59,186
That's him.

497
00:52:33,794 --> 00:52:37,459
Alice began to babysit for Thoohey's
in 2002.

498
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:40,661
And she did 2.5 years long.

499
00:52:41,005 --> 00:52:44,441
The two boys of the Tooheys's
were five and nine years old.

500
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,784
I literally could not believe my eyes.

501
00:52:55,636 --> 00:52:58,428
I felt so sad.

502
00:53:04,053 --> 00:53:07,705
For me, the Tooheys's
collusion with the death of Alice.

503
00:53:07,705 --> 00:53:10,890
I think if they had not been,
They had asked us for help,

504
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:13,255
and then she had not felt guilty.

505
00:53:13,555 --> 00:53:16,379
Then she had the burden of that secret
not to bear.

506
00:53:17,356 --> 00:53:19,346
Then she had not been isolated.

507
00:53:22,961 --> 00:53:25,156
What do you think of Brett?

508
00:53:26,188 --> 00:53:28,718
If he was at the corner,
I would probably strangle him.

509
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:36,768
He seemed a nice man,
so to say.

510
00:53:36,768 --> 00:53:39,805
He was never boring or something.

511
00:53:39,805 --> 00:53:45,448
He had a swimming pool
and we swam there in summer.

512
00:53:45,448 --> 00:53:48,366
We were so often with him,
for swimming.

513
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:55,798
I was shocked because of what had happened,
it took a while before it penetrated.

514
00:53:55,798 --> 00:54:00,604
I had no idea that Alice...
- If someone was.

515
00:54:00,942 --> 00:54:05,842
We were surprised, we did not expect,
she would do.

516
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:12,115
Why do you think
Alice had the band?

517
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:16,008
Because they do not wish they had him.

518
00:54:16,478 --> 00:54:19,781
Why?
- They no longer trust them, I think.

519
00:54:21,611 --> 00:54:24,821
They must have been desperate,
for the band to get.

520
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:28,955
From the moment they heard
the death of Alice,

521
00:54:28,955 --> 00:54:32,698
they have lived in constant fear,
fearing that it would come.

522
00:54:36,215 --> 00:54:40,533
I am glad that he could not find
I'm glad he knows that it is not over.

523
00:54:43,983 --> 00:54:52,042
I personally had a lot to do with the Palmers,
during the search for the Tooheys's.

524
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:56,925
And we were optimistic about the fact,
they would be found

525
00:54:57,064 --> 00:55:03,397
and would be sued,
but unfortunately the trail went dead.

526
00:55:03,779 --> 00:55:06,029
So the investigation went down.

527
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:10,358
The police considered,
that even if the Tooheys's been caught,

528
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:14,637
they would get a suspended sentence,
by the claim that the sex was voluntary,

529
00:55:14,986 --> 00:55:18,886
which was supported by the video evidence.

530
00:55:18,886 --> 00:55:22,136
Jason you knew anything about the relationship
between Alice and Brett?

531
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:25,826
No, no.

532
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:32,988
Of course not, if I had known
We had not gone out together, no.

533
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:38,290
I thought that something was wrong between us.

534
00:55:48,401 --> 00:55:52,100
There were so many unanswered questions,

535
00:55:52,465 --> 00:55:56,879
what they had with him,
when did that relationship?

536
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:59,516
Did she love him?

537
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,725
We do not know.

538
00:56:06,776 --> 00:56:11,065
The Tooheys's sold their house
and moved 6 months after the death of Alice.

539
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:22,359
Alice had secrets.

540
00:56:22,806 --> 00:56:26,796
She kept secret, that she had secrets.

541
00:56:28,014 --> 00:56:33,080
That changes the way
when you look at somebody,

542
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,148
if they keep things secret.

543
00:56:36,015 --> 00:56:40,671
I think I knew Alice
and her mother knew one another,

544
00:56:40,671 --> 00:56:44,467
and maybe there was one,
nobody knew, maybe.

545
00:56:58,018 --> 00:57:01,068
I found Ray's business card,
stuck in her diary...

546
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:04,838
on the page with the date July 12, 2005.

547
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:13,835
Why did you come Alice?
- Can you interpret dreams?

548
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,127
Sometimes. How do you feel,
when you wake up from such dreams.

549
00:57:23,702 --> 00:57:25,194
They make me a little scared.

550
00:57:25,194 --> 00:57:28,725
Alice was about five months before her death
see me.

551
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:33,390
She had heard me a few times on the radio
and has an appointment.

552
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:35,462
Take a deep breath and close your eyes.

553
00:57:36,014 --> 00:57:40,977
I want you to imagine, that for
your house is, say if you see it.

554
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:57,249
Now I want you to go inside the house
through the front door.

555
00:57:57,249 --> 00:57:59,556
Tell me what you see and where you are.

556
00:57:59,556 --> 00:58:02,783
Ray, why did you not tell June,
Alice had met you before?

557
00:58:04,755 --> 00:58:06,812
I wanted nothing to keep her secret,

558
00:58:06,812 --> 00:58:11,506
it had to make the request from Alice
regarding confidentiality.

559
00:58:11,506 --> 00:58:14,587
I could not move.

560
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:20,208
The living room is straight and then right

561
00:58:20,859 --> 00:58:25,205
and my room is in the rear
of the house toward the kitchen.

562
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:29,819
You see something unusual, something abnormal?

563
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:37,206
No, we felt we Ray
could no longer trust.

564
00:58:37,206 --> 00:58:43,800
He kept that information for themselves
and it felt like betrayal.

565
00:58:49,175 --> 00:58:53,037
June and I wanted to help the family
and they wanted that I helped them, I think.

566
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:56,805
I had not have done,
if they had known.

567
00:58:58,009 --> 00:59:01,944
There was anger,
Mathew would not talk to me.

568
00:59:02,294 --> 00:59:09,994
What I think they hurt the most was
I did not see the death of Alice coming.

569
00:59:10,323 --> 00:59:13,141
Looking back, it is strange,

570
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:18,065
someone was following us so,

571
00:59:20,142 --> 00:59:23,482
Perhaps he had us just as much
We like him.

572
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:38,652
Alice came to me,
because she was upset.

573
00:59:39,219 --> 00:59:42,687
She was a person with problems.

574
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:46,027
I had a dream last night.

575
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:50,863
I felt cold and wet,
I felt heavy, like I was drugged,

576
00:59:50,863 --> 00:59:54,568
and when I awoke,
did not feel that way.

577
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,955
I felt confused and not
and I began to be afraid.

578
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:04,586
I wanted to my mother,
to talk to her.

579
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:10,105
I went to their beds
and when I stood and looked at them,

580
01:00:10,105 --> 01:00:13,890
I was overwhelmed by a deep sadness.

581
01:00:14,506 --> 01:00:19,139
And then hit the sadness to fear.
I stood there paralyzed with fear

582
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:23,118
and I realized,
they could do nothing for me.

583
01:00:23,323 --> 01:00:26,017
I've never felt so alone.

584
01:00:26,671 --> 01:00:30,112
Everything felt wrong, my body,

585
01:00:31,558 --> 01:00:36,989
how everything looked when I realized,
that something was wrong with me.

586
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:42,915
I started to cry,
standing at the foot of the bed.

587
01:01:12,598 --> 01:01:16,038
Low Mungo lies in the southwest
New South Wales,

588
01:01:16,038 --> 01:01:19,739
and that was the location of the school camp
Alice was...

589
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:23,701
from August 2 to August 5 in 2005.

590
01:01:26,695 --> 01:01:29,479
When she came home,
she said it was fun.

591
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:34,335
I remember it well,
because without mobile home,

592
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:40,084
we bought her one months earlier had
and her favorite necklace and watch.

593
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:47,486
Yes, except about, she said not much.

594
01:01:57,007 --> 01:02:01,967
Kim told only one years later,
about what they had filmed on her mobile.

595
01:02:02,267 --> 01:02:04,354
June why you decided to tell it?

596
01:02:06,421 --> 01:02:11,021
If we would not tell
felt that, whether we could hold anything back.

597
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,719
I do not know why...

598
01:02:14,995 --> 01:02:17,044
I do not know why, but...

599
01:02:17,547 --> 01:02:19,248
why not.

600
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:29,428
Jason told us about the filming,
the girls were at Lake Mungo.

601
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:43,141
The girls looked so happy
and she looked so lost out.

602
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:47,927
I worried and became convinced
that something must have happened.

603
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,569
Kate's pictures with her cell phone,
were made later,

604
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:01,510
when the girls had spread.

605
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:12,936
There was a picture of Alice,
poorly identified,

606
01:03:12,936 --> 01:03:16,552
bottom of the picture, kneeling under a tree.

607
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:22,608
Only after repeated viewing of the film,
we realized what she was doing.

608
01:03:23,118 --> 01:03:25,143
She buried something.

609
01:03:28,434 --> 01:03:31,444
You know what happened that night
Alice can be done?

610
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:36,620
No, I knew,
that she had lost her mobile phone,

611
01:03:37,763 --> 01:03:40,057
and I knew she was upset.

612
01:03:40,343 --> 01:03:44,254
Because that was pretty obvious.
But I did not know why.

613
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:49,464
She did not say that they saw something,
she really said anything to me.

614
01:03:49,614 --> 01:03:53,479
I took it so seriously.

615
01:03:54,031 --> 01:04:00,481
It was the consistency, we had fun
and therefore it was probably some of region.

616
01:04:11,275 --> 01:04:16,525
It started quite innocently,
Alice had left the group

617
01:04:16,525 --> 01:04:20,407
and walked around on her own.

618
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:25,189
But it was clear that something was
so they got upset.

619
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,606
And we wanted to try to find out,
what that was.

620
01:04:45,598 --> 01:04:49,364
We saw the pictures of the phone,
something that she had buried.

621
01:04:49,642 --> 01:04:55,897
We had an idea where the tree stood,
by the video.

622
01:04:57,104 --> 01:05:05,237
We did not go during the day,
to dig where the tourists were.

623
01:05:07,339 --> 01:05:09,946
So we decided overnight to go.

624
01:05:25,862 --> 01:05:33,068
June and I started to dig.
After a while she said that she found something,

625
01:05:33,068 --> 01:05:35,181
and she pulled a plastic bag up.

626
01:05:35,482 --> 01:05:40,782
And in that plastic bag sat the chain of Ali,

627
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:43,201
her ring, her watch and her mobile phone.

628
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:50,543
Her most precious belongings,
buried at a school camp.

629
01:05:50,885 --> 01:05:53,135
And we did not
why she had done that.

630
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:58,601
We knew from the video,
that something buried, but not what it was.

631
01:06:01,713 --> 01:06:03,213
The battery is empty.

632
01:06:21,263 --> 01:06:23,313
Are you afraid to die?

633
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:27,151
Yes, of course I'm afraid to die.

634
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:29,414
Is not there anyone afraid of?

635
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:37,806
Would you tell me,
what happens in that dream?

636
01:06:40,525 --> 01:06:44,467
It feels,
if something bad will happen to me.

637
01:06:45,362 --> 01:06:47,644
It feels like something bad has happened.

638
01:06:48,598 --> 01:06:51,498
It has not reached me yet,
but it is coming.

639
01:06:54,412 --> 01:06:56,378
And it comes closer.

640
01:06:57,644 --> 01:07:03,750
And I'm not ready,
I feel that I can not really do anything.

641
01:07:15,811 --> 01:07:22,198
At a certain point
This figure came to her from the darkness.

642
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:26,011
I recognized the face immediately.

643
01:07:26,011 --> 01:07:31,188
It was the same face of the body,
I identified with the reservoir.

644
01:07:32,077 --> 01:07:35,295
It was Ali's Ali's face and body.

645
01:07:42,054 --> 01:07:47,387
There is absolutely
no rational explanation,

646
01:07:47,387 --> 01:07:52,928
for what they saw through that phone.

647
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:53,396
I am convinced,
Alice knew that she would die.

648
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:55,662
I am convinced.

649
01:08:57,487 --> 01:09:02,240
I think the figure at Lake Mungo
a bad omen for her.

650
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:08,500
The burial of her possessions
was symbolic, it was a ritual.

651
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,624
I was not convinced,
Ali believed that she would die.

652
01:09:15,912 --> 01:09:18,841
She had morbid thoughts, certainly,
Who does not?

653
01:09:19,591 --> 01:09:24,011
She had nightmares that made her upset
and they did consult Ray.

654
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,793
I do not know if anyone can be convinced
he dies.

655
01:09:35,098 --> 01:09:39,206
And the images of Lake Mungo,
Alice explained how would that have?

656
01:09:39,756 --> 01:09:42,156
How they would have explained that?

657
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:50,305
I think that Ali saw a ghost.

658
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:54,551
And they must not know,
it was her own mind.

659
01:09:55,006 --> 01:09:57,075
I think they filmed a ghost.

660
01:09:57,075 --> 01:10:01,597
I believe they filmed the future,
who came for her.

661
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:20,580
We have discovered the Tooheys's,

662
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:23,752
Ray and what happened at Lake Mungo.

663
01:10:24,642 --> 01:10:28,041
And when we returned home

664
01:10:28,854 --> 01:10:34,811
The house felt different, it was calm.

665
01:10:43,303 --> 01:10:49,203
I think Alice wanted,
that we would know more about her.

666
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:53,678
She wanted that we might know
who she really was.

667
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:59,231
Before she could go.

668
01:11:05,772 --> 01:11:11,736
In the weeks and months after Lake Mungo,
we again began a family feel.

669
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:20,719
It was hard, but it was better
and we are after all a family.

670
01:11:28,554 --> 01:11:31,541
Good to see you.
- You too, come inside.

671
01:11:31,891 --> 01:11:36,050
Ray called unexpectedly
and said that he came through the city

672
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:40,110
and asked whether it was to come.

673
01:11:40,781 --> 01:11:49,053
There were six months elapsed
and I thought it could not hurt.

674
01:11:53,314 --> 01:11:56,814
We all felt after Lake Mungo

675
01:11:57,042 --> 01:12:01,044
closing a kind of grief.

676
01:12:01,044 --> 01:12:07,218
For Ray is different,
Ray and we came to our own peace.

677
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:17,793
I found it strange,
that Ali is so abrupt withdrawal,

678
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:22,313
and we have not helped,
We have not changed.

679
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:28,720
I think we collectively took the decision,
to continue.

680
01:12:29,061 --> 01:12:36,514
And move was part of this,
the decision to move.

681
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:56,266
It will be difficult,
to leave the house.

682
01:12:57,351 --> 01:13:05,834
Sometimes I just forget,
they do not come back.

683
01:13:06,981 --> 01:13:08,681
I forget.

684
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:34,017
LAST JUNE's CONSULT WITH RAY

685
01:13:39,496 --> 01:13:41,358
Close your eyes.

686
01:13:42,255 --> 01:13:45,685
And imagine,
you back to the house.

687
01:13:47,284 --> 01:13:49,015
See?

688
01:13:52,991 --> 01:13:55,295
Enter the house.

689
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:59,460
I go through the door.

690
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,997
and...

691
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,250
walk down the hall to the room of Alice.

692
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:16,491
Someone.

693
01:14:17,311 --> 01:14:19,267
I believe that someone running down the hall.

694
01:14:19,645 --> 01:14:21,145
The door is open.

695
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:25,288
You know who it is?

696
01:14:36,426 --> 01:14:39,076
Want in?

697
01:14:53,987 --> 01:14:55,867
What do you see?

698
01:14:56,473 --> 01:14:58,483
It is my mother.

699
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,325
What she says?

700
01:15:01,858 --> 01:15:05,392
She says nothing.

701
01:15:10,925 --> 01:15:13,393
I think they do not know,
I am here.

702
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,975
Alice is not.

703
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:22,126
She is not.

704
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:25,343
What Alice?

705
01:15:26,638 --> 01:15:30,634
Talk to her, she is talking to you?
- She goes away.

706
01:15:32,483 --> 01:15:34,331
She leaves the room.

707
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:38,574
She's gone.

708
01:15:39,098 --> 01:15:41,005
Open your eyes.

709
01:16:32,194 --> 01:16:34,872
She's gone now.

710
01:16:36,557 --> 01:16:38,527
She leaves the room.

711
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,766
She's gone.

712
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:36,714
