1
00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:03,399
<i>Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...</i>

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:06,884
I'd have died. The walkie-talkie,
the one in the bag I dropped.

3
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:08,837
He's got the other one.
I'm going back.

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:09,821
I tell you what!

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,494
My husband is alive.

6
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:14,917
Do you think I'm
not happy about that?

7
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:17,812
You were the one that
told me that he died.

8
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:19,764
God!

9
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:25,085
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:33,839
Morgan,

11
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:36,041
<i>I don't know
if you're out there.</i>

12
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:38,176
I don't know
if you can hear me.

13
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:40,545
Maybe you're
listening right now.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,113
I hope so.

15
00:00:42,148 --> 00:00:44,950
I found others... my family,

16
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:46,585
if you can believe it.

17
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:50,755
My wife and son,

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,557
they're alive.

19
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:54,960
I wanted you to know that.

20
00:00:57,864 --> 00:00:59,664
<i>There's something else
you need to know.</i>

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,566
Atlanta isn't what we thought.

22
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:04,002
It's not what they promised.
The city is...

23
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:08,740
Do not enter the city.

24
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:11,309
It belongs to the dead now.

25
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:17,883
We're camped
a few miles northwest,

26
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:20,085
up by a big abandoned
rock quarry.

27
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,654
You can see it on a map.

28
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:26,491
I hope you come find us.

29
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,627
But be careful.

30
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:32,530
Last night walkers
came out of the woods.

31
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,968
We lost people.

32
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:42,374
Watch yourself, Morgan.
Take care of your boy.

33
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:44,409
I'll try you again
tomorrow at dawn.

34
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,229
Andrea.

35
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:12,203
I'm so sorry.

36
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:16,675
She's gone.

37
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,678
You got to let us take her.

38
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:28,119
We all cared about her

39
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:31,289
and I promise we'll be
as gentle as we can.

40
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:11,463
She still won't move?

41
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:13,865
She won't even talk to us.

42
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:17,535
She's been there all night.

43
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,671
<i>What do we do?</i>

44
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:22,774
Can't just leave Amy like that.

45
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:24,943
We need to deal with it

46
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:26,878
same as the others.

47
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:30,315
I'll tell her how it is.

48
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,388
Andrea.

49
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,557
I know how the safety works.

50
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:45,663
All right.
Okay.

51
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:47,832
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:52,604
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,188
Y'all can't be serious.

56
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:45,223
Let that girl hamstring us?

57
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:46,858
The dead girl's a time bomb.

58
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:49,060
What do you suggest?

59
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:52,297
Take the shot.

60
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,799
Clean, in the brain from here.

61
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:57,469
Hell, I can hit a turkey between
the eyes from this distance.

62
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:00,538
No. For God's sakes,
let her be.

63
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:16,921
Wake up, Jimbo.
We've got some work to do.

64
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,194
Thanks.

65
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,163
- Thanks.
- What are you guys doing?

66
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:28,032
This is for geeks.
Our people go over there.

67
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,968
What's the difference?
They're all infected.

68
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:33,505
Our people go
in that row over there.

69
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,174
We don't burn them!

70
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,376
We bury them.

71
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:42,013
Understand?

72
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:48,386
Our people go
in that row over there.

73
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:55,894
You reap what you sow.

74
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:58,029
You know what?
Shut up, man.

75
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,131
Y'all left my brother for dead.

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,735
You had this coming.

77
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:15,346
Are you bleeding?

78
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:18,750
I just got some on me
from the bodies.

79
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:21,085
That blood is fresh.
Were you bit?

80
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,387
No.

81
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:24,455
I got scratched
during the attack.

82
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,124
- You got bit.
- I'm fine.

83
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:27,759
Then show me.

84
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:34,499
- Don't tell, please.
- A walker got him.

85
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,601
A walker bit Jim.

86
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:42,607
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Show it to us.

87
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,510
Show it to us.

88
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:47,078
- Easy, Jim.
- Grab him.

89
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:49,480
Jim, put it down.
Put it down.

90
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:51,883
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

91
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,786
I'm okay. I'm okay.

92
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,754
I'm okay.

93
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:00,725
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

94
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,860
I'm okay.

95
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:05,163
<i>I'm okay.</i>

96
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,702
I'm okay.

97
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:19,310
I say we put
a pickaxe in his head

98
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,745
and the dead girl's
and be done with it.

99
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,780
Is that what you'd want
if it were you?

100
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:25,083
Yeah, and I'd thank you
while you did it.

101
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:27,118
I hate to say it...
I never thought I would...

102
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:28,753
but maybe Daryl's right.

103
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:31,756
Jim's not a monster, Dale,
or some rabid dog.

104
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,092
- I'm not suggesting...
- He's sick. A sick man.

105
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:36,094
We start down that road,
where do we draw the line?

106
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:39,631
The line's pretty clear.
Zero tolerance for walkers,

107
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:42,200
- or them to be.
- What if we can get him help?

108
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:44,369
I heard the C.D.C.
was working on a cure.

109
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:47,472
I heard that too. Heard a lot of
things before the world went to hell.

110
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:49,607
What if the C.D.C. is
still up and running?

111
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:51,709
- Man, that is a stretch right there.
- Why?

112
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:55,647
If there's any government
left, any structure at all,

113
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,815
they'd protect the C.D.C.
at all costs, wouldn't they?

114
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,551
I think it's our best shot.
Shelter, protection...

115
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:03,621
Okay, Rick, you want those things,
all right? I do too, okay?

116
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:06,958
Now if they exist,
they're at the army base.

117
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,160
- Fort Benning. - That's 100
miles in the opposite direction.

118
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,262
That is right.
But it's away from the hot zone.

119
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,164
Now listen to me.
If that place is operational,

120
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:16,401
it'll be heavily armed.
We'd be safe there.

121
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,670
The military were on the
front lines of this thing.

122
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:20,938
<i>They got overrun.
We've all seen that.</i>

123
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:24,042
The C.D.C. is our best choice
and Jim's only chance.

124
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,580
You go looking for aspirin,
do what you need to do.

125
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:31,482
Someone needs to have
some balls to take care

126
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:33,117
- of this damn problem!
- Hey hey hey!

127
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:35,053
We don't kill the living.

128
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:41,659
That's funny coming from a man
who just put a gun to my head.

129
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:44,162
We may disagree on some things,

130
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:46,964
not on this.
You put it down.

131
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,433
Go on.

132
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:54,772
- Come with me.
- Where are you taking me?

133
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:56,874
Somewhere safe.

134
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,985
I came to pay my respects.

135
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:28,539
Did I ever mention

136
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:31,509
how I lost my wife?

137
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:37,482
- Cancer, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

138
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:41,352
I dragged her to every doctor,

139
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,621
every test.

140
00:09:44,723 --> 00:09:48,292
And after all the surgeries
and the chemos,

141
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:51,095
she was ready.

142
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,564
She accepted it, you know?

143
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:58,403
But I never could.

144
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:02,206
<i>And I spent
the last few years</i>

145
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:04,942
<i>so angry.</i>

146
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:07,578
<i>I felt so cheated.</i>

147
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,318
Since she passed,

148
00:10:14,353 --> 00:10:18,022
you girls were
the first people...

149
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:21,793
That I cared anything for.

150
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,147
This is her birthday?

151
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,653
Her birthday was always like...

152
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:51,589
like a week long affair.

153
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:55,026
But I somehow always missed it.

154
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,128
I was away at college

155
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:59,864
or too busy for kid's parties.

156
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:03,434
She'd call all excited.

157
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:07,004
I always said
that I'd make it home

158
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,174
and I really always meant to,

159
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:14,479
but I never made it
past that phone call.

160
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,849
I know things
are hard enough for you

161
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:20,918
without adding guilt
into the mix, huh?

162
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,866
I'll do it.
He's my husband.

163
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:18,295
Amy.

164
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:26,070
Amy, I'm sorry.

165
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:34,945
I'm sorry

166
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,615
for not ever being there.

167
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:42,353
I always thought
there'd be more time.

168
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:06,711
I'm here now, Amy.

169
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:09,313
I'm here.

170
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:16,754
I love you.

171
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,876
Say it.

172
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,946
Okay.

173
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,351
I'm thinking if
you'd of stayed here,

174
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,987
if you'd have looked
after your own...

175
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,757
<i>Instead you went off.
You took half our manpower with you.</i>

176
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,760
I'm thinking maybe our losses
wouldn't have been so bad.

177
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,296
If we hadn't gone off
and brought those guns back

178
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,232
when we did, I think our losses
would have been a lot worse.

179
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,601
<i>Maybe the entire camp.</i>

180
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,852
I still think it's a mistake
not burning these bodies.

181
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,054
It's what we said
we'd do, right?

182
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:33,024
<i>Burn 'em all,
wasn't that the idea?</i>

183
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,425
At first.

184
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,160
The Chinaman gets
all emotional,

185
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,130
says it's not the thing to do,
we just follow him along?

186
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,868
These people need to know
who the hell's in charge here,

187
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,838
- what the rules are.
- There are no rules.

188
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,006
Well, that's a problem.

189
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,243
We haven't had one minute to hold
onto anything of our old selves.

190
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,681
<i>We need time to mourn
and we need to bury our dead.</i>

191
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,616
It's what people do.

192
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,354
Oh no.

193
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,723
No no no no.

194
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:08,793
No, not this, please.

195
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,941
No no no.

196
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,577
Oh, no no no.

197
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,547
<i>No no.</i>

198
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,192
I can do it.
I can do it.

199
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,861
I can do it!
I can do it.

200
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,025
Hey.

201
00:18:26,204 --> 00:18:28,372
Burying other people
is bad enough,

202
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,608
- but the thought of one of us...
- Shh.

203
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,244
Are we safe now, dad?

204
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,080
Now that we're together?

205
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,215
I won't leave again.

206
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,318
I promise you that.
Not for anything.

207
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,923
Now give me a chance

208
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,892
to discuss some things
with your mom, okay?

209
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,927
- Yeah.
- All right.

210
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,729
All right.

211
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,706
Shane blames me
for not being here.

212
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,541
Do you?

213
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,717
We got guns now.
We're stronger.

214
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,652
And we have fewer people.

215
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,188
That makes us weaker.

216
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,423
You want me to say
I think you were right?

217
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,559
I understand that.

218
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:28,599
All I can say is that neither
one of you is entirely wrong.

219
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,502
It's the best
I can do right now.

220
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,274
What about the C.D.C.?

221
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,212
- Rick...
- We're at the ragged edge here.

222
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,348
We need relief and we got
a sick man who needs help.

223
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,217
I don't know why
people can't see that.

224
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,185
Well, look at their faces.

225
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,921
Look at mine.
We're all terrified.

226
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,458
If one of us suggested,
based on a hunch,

227
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,694
that we head toward that city,

228
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,629
you'd have no part of it.

229
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,567
Tell me something
with certainty.

230
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,513
I love you.

231
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,187
That's all I got.

232
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,957
I love you too.

233
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:40,971
His fever is worse.

234
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,307
You need anything?

235
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:44,942
Uh...

236
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:48,012
Water.
Could use more water.

237
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,480
- I'll get some.
- Okay.

238
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,916
Carol, you help me?

239
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,330
You save a grave for me?

240
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,534
Nobody wants that.

241
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,237
<i>It's not about
what you want.</i>

242
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,976
That, uh...
that sound you hear,

243
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,012
that's God laughing
while you make plans.

244
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,288
What I want, Jim, if...

245
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,225
if God allows,

246
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,994
is to get you some help.

247
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,859
Watch the mangroves.

248
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,996
Their roots will gouge
the whole boat.

249
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,833
You know that, right?

250
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,937
<i>Amy is there swimming.</i>

251
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,509
You'll watch the boat, right?

252
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,645
You said you would.

253
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,049
I'll watch the boat.

254
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,251
Don't worry.

255
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,090
Okay.

256
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,904
I need you to help talk
some sense into Rick.

257
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,177
Look, this C.D.C. thing,
Lori, it's a mistake.

258
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,981
So you're backing him?

259
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,416
What else would I do?
He's my husband.

260
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,952
Look, it may be time for you
to play the dutiful wife,

261
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,753
but you can't tell me
that fixing your marriage

262
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,655
is worth putting
people's lives at risk.

263
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,459
I think folks around here can make up their
minds without bringing my marriage into it.

264
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,494
It's a habit you need to break.

265
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,497
I guess I'll just
add it to the list

266
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,299
of habits that I'm breaking

267
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,834
whether I like it or not.

268
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,305
What habits?

269
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,409
Just talking about
my need for a plan, man.

270
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,779
So what is it?
Are we leaving or not?

271
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,982
<i>Maybe y'all just
want to stay here.</i>

272
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,317
We could hang
some more tin cans.

273
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,952
We can't stay here.
We both know that.

274
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,055
I was just telling Shane I think
we should trust your gut.

275
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,400
Let's go do our sweep.

276
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,145
Tell you what, man,

277
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,514
these people, man,
they're not convinced.

278
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:12,116
You know?

279
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,351
You head to the C.D.C.,

280
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,520
you might be on your own.

281
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:19,056
You gotta really consider
whether you want

282
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,191
to put Lori and Carl
in that kind of spot.

283
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,861
I got to do
what's best for my family.

284
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,130
Best for your family?
What's that?

285
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,400
- Exposing them to all kinds of risks?
- As opposed to what?

286
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,202
Crossing 100 miles
of hostile territory?

287
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,873
If we're looking for a lifeline, I
say swim toward the closest ship,

288
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,342
not further out to sea.

289
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,277
Why can't you back me up?

290
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,013
Look, I want to.
It's just...

291
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,883
I don't see it.

292
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,285
If it was your family,
you'd feel differently.

293
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,893
What did you say to me?

294
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,364
I kept 'em safe, man.

295
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,801
I looked after them
like they were my own.

296
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,970
- That's what I did.
- I didn't mean it that way.

297
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,172
Well, how'd you mean it?

298
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,773
Go on, man.
How'd you mean it?

299
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,977
You're misinterpreting me.

300
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,745
- All right.
- You're just hearing it wrong.

301
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,181
- Yeah?
- Look, you know...

302
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:21,051
You know I can never
repay that debt, okay?

303
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,166
Jesus.

304
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,508
I know.

305
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,179
Gonna have to start wearing
reflective vests out here.

306
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,384
Seriously.

307
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,587
Come on, man.

308
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,359
Come on, man, let's go.

309
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,394
Nothing out here.

310
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:55,612
I've been, uh...

311
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,115
I've been thinking
about Rick's plan.

312
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,084
Now look, there are no...

313
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,619
There are no guarantees
either way.

314
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,456
I'll be the first one
to admit that.

315
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,724
I've known this man
a long time.

316
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,727
I trust his instincts.

317
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:17,334
I say the most important thing
here is we need to stay together.

318
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:24,441
So those of you that agree,

319
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,210
we leave first thing
in the morning.

320
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,080
<i>Okay?</i>

321
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:37,977
We're moving out,

322
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:40,613
leaving the quarry.

323
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:43,249
If you heard me yesterday,
you may be coming here.

324
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:47,120
If you are, we'll be gone
by the time you arrive.

325
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:51,725
I'm leaving a note
and map behind for you

326
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:53,593
taped to a red car

327
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:55,929
so you can follow our trail.

328
00:27:57,531 --> 00:27:59,065
We're heading
to the C.D.C.

329
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,201
If there's anything left,
it's got to be there,

330
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:03,002
don't you think?

331
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:06,439
Morgan...

332
00:28:08,075 --> 00:28:10,210
I hope you were right
about that place.

333
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:14,447
I need you to be.

334
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:27,293
Everybody listen up.

335
00:28:27,328 --> 00:28:30,263
Those of you with C.B.s,
we're gonna be on channel 40.

336
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:32,165
Let's keep
the chatter down, okay?

337
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:35,301
<i>Now you got a problem,
don't have a C.B.,</i>

338
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:37,704
<i>can't get a signal or anything at all,
you're gonna hit your horn one time.</i>

339
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:39,672
<i>That'll stop the caravan.</i>

340
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:42,709
<i>- Any questions?
- We're, uh...</i>

341
00:28:42,743 --> 00:28:45,211
We're...
we're not going.

342
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:50,216
We have family in Birmingham.

343
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,385
We want to be with our people.

344
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,587
You go on your own, you won't
have anyone to watch your back.

345
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:56,656
We'll take the chance.

346
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,092
I got to do what's best
for my family.

347
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:02,362
- You sure?
- We talked about it.

348
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:04,864
We're sure.

349
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:06,599
All right.

350
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,535
- Shane.
- Yeah, all right.

351
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,703
- .357?
- Yeah.

352
00:29:16,143 --> 00:29:17,610
The box is half full.

353
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:24,517
Thank you all...
For everything.

354
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:26,586
Come here.

355
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,388
Good luck, man.

356
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:30,490
<i>- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.</i>

357
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:33,793
Bye.

358
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:35,962
Thank you.

359
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:38,164
Bye.

360
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,368
Channel 40
if you change your minds.

361
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:44,237
- All right?
- Yeah.

362
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:46,406
I know.

363
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:52,011
What makes you think
our odds are any better?

364
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:55,381
Come on.
Let's go.

365
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:58,284
<i>Let's move out.</i>

366
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,946
I told you we'd never
get far on that hose.

367
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,715
I said I needed the one
from the cube van.

368
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:37,884
Can you jury-rig it?

369
00:31:37,918 --> 00:31:39,852
That's all it's been so far.

370
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:42,288
It's more duct tape than hose.

371
00:31:42,323 --> 00:31:44,524
And I'm out of duct tape.

372
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,727
I see something up ahead.

373
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:50,697
A gas station if we're lucky.

374
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:53,199
Y'all, Jim...

375
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:56,002
It's bad. I don't think
he can take anymore.

376
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:59,639
Hey, Rick, you want
to hold down the fort?

377
00:31:59,673 --> 00:32:01,507
I'll drive ahead,
see what I can bring back.

378
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,943
Yeah, I'll come along
too and I'll back you up.

379
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:05,612
Y'all keep your eyes open now.

380
00:32:05,646 --> 00:32:07,213
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

381
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:16,656
We'll be back on the road soon.

382
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,058
Oh no.
Christ..

383
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:21,527
My bones...

384
00:32:21,562 --> 00:32:23,129
My bones are like glass.

385
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:24,631
Every little bump...

386
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:27,667
God, this ride is killing me.

387
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:30,203
Leave me here.

388
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:34,941
<i>I'm done.</i>

389
00:32:36,977 --> 00:32:39,512
Just leave me.

390
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:42,315
I want to be with my family.

391
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:48,488
They're all dead.

392
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:52,725
I don't think you know
what you're asking.

393
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,229
The fever... You've been
delirious more often than not.

394
00:32:56,263 --> 00:32:58,164
I know.
Don't you think I know?

395
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,672
I'm clear now.

396
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:08,241
In five minutes I may not be.

397
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:11,678
Rick, I know what I'm asking.

398
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:13,446
I want this.

399
00:33:15,182 --> 00:33:17,617
Leave me here.

400
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:19,786
Now that's on me.

401
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,888
Okay?

402
00:33:21,922 --> 00:33:23,956
My decision.

403
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:26,693
Not your failure.

404
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:34,100
It's what he says he wants.

405
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:36,869
And he's lucid?

406
00:33:36,904 --> 00:33:38,805
He seems to be.

407
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:41,207
I would say yes.

408
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,711
Back in the camp when I
said Daryl might be right

409
00:33:44,745 --> 00:33:46,813
and you shut me down,

410
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:49,148
you misunderstood.

411
00:33:49,183 --> 00:33:52,418
I would never go along

412
00:33:52,453 --> 00:33:55,254
with callously killing a man.

413
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:57,657
I was just gonna suggest

414
00:33:57,691 --> 00:34:01,661
that we ask Jim what he wants.

415
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:06,032
And I think we have an answer.

416
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:09,635
We just leave him here?

417
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,804
We take off?

418
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,540
Man, I'm not sure
I could live with that.

419
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:15,975
It's not your call,

420
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:18,211
either one of you.

421
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:24,050
Yeah. That's it.

422
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:32,458
Hey, another damn tree.

423
00:34:34,294 --> 00:34:37,130
Hey, Jim...

424
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:39,499
I mean, you know
it doesn't need to be this.

425
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:41,701
No.

426
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,771
It's good.

427
00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:46,973
The breeze feels nice.

428
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:49,041
Okay.

429
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:50,409
All right.

430
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,186
Just close your eyes, sweetie.

431
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,921
Don't fight.

432
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:18,271
Jim, do you want this?

433
00:35:19,573 --> 00:35:20,973
No.

434
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:24,177
You'll need it.

435
00:35:26,547 --> 00:35:28,514
I'm okay.

436
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:32,685
I'm okay.

437
00:35:36,723 --> 00:35:38,858
<i>Oh. Hey.</i>

438
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:43,596
Thanks for, uh,

439
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,031
for fighting for us.

440
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:47,767
Okay.

441
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:02,284
Wildfire MSB3417 active
begin transmission.

442
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:05,063
Jenner here.

443
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,700
It's day 194 since
wildfire was declared

444
00:37:08,734 --> 00:37:12,103
and 63 days since the disease
abruptly went global.

445
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:14,939
There's no clinical
progress to report.

446
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:23,248
Item... I finally got the scrubbers in the
east sector shut down to save power.

447
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,683
Wish I could have
done it a month ago,

448
00:37:24,717 --> 00:37:26,217
but it took me that long
to figure it out.

449
00:37:26,252 --> 00:37:27,819
Too bad I never studied
engineering.

450
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:29,387
Could have saved a lot of amps.

451
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:32,557
Item... I'm still
not sleeping well.

452
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:35,393
Can't seem to keep
regular hours.

453
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:37,729
Living underground
doesn't help,

454
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:39,931
not knowing
if it's day or night.

455
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:44,536
I'm just feeling very
off-kilter these days.

456
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,509
Alert status.

457
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,345
<i>Air qualifiers indicate
corrosive fumes.</i>

458
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,747
<i>All personnel
must clear the room.</i>

459
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:06,284
<i>Corrosive element is deemed
poisonous if inhaled.</i>

460
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:24,502
<i>All personnel clear.</i>

461
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:26,538
<i>Full decontamination
in effect.</i>

462
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,540
No!

463
00:39:38,284 --> 00:39:41,019
<i>Full decontamination
complete.</i>

464
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,794
The TS19 samples are gone.

465
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,031
<i>The tragedy of their loss
cannot be overstat.</i>

466
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,936
They were our freshest
samples by far.

467
00:39:59,472 --> 00:40:02,207
None of the other samples
we gathered even came close.

468
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,844
Those are necrotic,

469
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:08,813
useless dead flesh.

470
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:16,254
I don't even know
why I'm talking to you.

471
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:21,326
I bet there isn't
a single son of a bitch

472
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,595
out there still listening,
is there?

473
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,434
Is there?

474
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:34,138
Fine.

475
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:36,774
Saves me the embarrassment.

476
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,550
I think tomorrow I'm gonna
blow my brains out.

477
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:50,154
I haven't decided.

478
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,726
But tonight,

479
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,995
I'm getting drunk.

480
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:07,505
Speaking of which,

481
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,974
how far do you think
I can chuck this, huh?

482
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:13,044
Pretty far I bet.

483
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:19,617
<i>- - Oh!</i>

484
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:21,786
It is out of the stadium!

485
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:59,290
All right, everybody.
Keep moving. Go on.

486
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:02,060
Stay quiet.
Let's go.

487
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:22,880
Okay, keep moving. Stay together.

488
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,717
- Keep moving. Come on.
- Shh.

489
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:30,722
- Carol.
- Shh.

490
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,457
Oh, God.

491
00:42:54,546 --> 00:42:57,315
No.

492
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:59,584
Keep it together.
Come on.

493
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,753
We're almost there, baby.

494
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,221
<i>Almost there.</i>

495
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:08,426
Nothing?

496
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,034
There's nobody here.

497
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:18,302
Then why are
these shutters down?

498
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:19,871
- Walkers!
- Baby, come on.

499
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,411
You led us into a graveyard!

500
00:43:26,445 --> 00:43:28,680
- He made a call.
- It was the wrong damn call!

501
00:43:28,714 --> 00:43:31,282
Just shut up. You hear?
Shut up. Shut up!

502
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:33,384
- Rick, this is a dead end.
- Where are we gonna go?

503
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:35,486
Do you hear me?
No blame.

504
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:37,555
She's right. We can't be here,
this close to the city after dark.

505
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:41,893
Fort Benning, Rick...
Still an option.

506
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:44,796
On what? No food, no fuel.
That's 100 miles.

507
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,531
125.
I checked the map.

508
00:43:46,565 --> 00:43:48,766
<i>Forget Fort Benning.
We need answers tonight, now.</i>

509
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:50,902
- Well, think of something.
- Come on, let's go.

510
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:54,138
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go. Please.

511
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,774
All right,
everybody back to the cars.

512
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:59,143
- Let's go. Move.
- The camera... it moved.

513
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,814
- You imagined it.
- It moved.

514
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,616
- It moved.
- Rick, it is dead, man.

515
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:08,920
It's an automated device.
It's gears, okay?

516
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:10,521
They're just winding down.
Now come on.

517
00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:13,024
<i>- No, just go away.
- Man, just listen to me.</i>

518
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:15,126
Look around this place.
It's dead, okay?

519
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,695
It's dead.
You need to let it go, Rick.

520
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,564
Rick, there's nobody here!

521
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:22,600
I know you're in there.
I know you can hear me.

522
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:25,570
<i>- Everybody get back to the cars now!
- Please, we're desperate.</i>

523
00:44:25,604 --> 00:44:27,905
Please help us.
We have women, children,

524
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,041
- no food, hardly any gas left.
- Rick.

525
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:31,709
- There's nobody here.
- We have nowhere else to go.

526
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:33,878
<i>- - Keep your eyes open.</i>

527
00:44:33,912 --> 00:44:36,748
If you don't let us in,
you're killing us!

528
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:39,684
- Please!
- Come on, buddy, let's go.

529
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,219
<i>- Let's go.
- Please help us.</i>

530
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:46,491
You're killing us!
You're killing us!

531
00:44:46,525 --> 00:44:48,659
You're killing us!

532
00:44:56,926 --> 00:45:00,150
