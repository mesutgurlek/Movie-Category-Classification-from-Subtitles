1
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,790
Cut. Thank you very much, Renee.

2
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,797
I'm sorry. He grabbed me.

3
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,269
I'm sorry. He keeps missing my arms.

4
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,271
- Frank, why don't we give this up?
- Frank. I can't see a damn thing.

5
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,755
- OK.
- Sorry, Renee.

6
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,149
Tell me the truth. You get off
on seeing me suffer, don't you?

7
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,558
- OK.
- Water everywhere.

8
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,753
Can I get a cigarette?

9
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,914
Guys, we've gotta sort this out. You
think you can hit your mark this time?

10
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,316
It's not a matter of hitting the mark.
There's not a damn thing to see.

11
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,193
OK, look, but I need...

12
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,718
Jeff.

13
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,639
I'm right here, Mom.

14
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,440
- How long have you been here?
- Couple of minutes.

15
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,759
- How was your stay with your father?
- Good.

16
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,754
He wants to come down to the set
for dinner, if it's all right.

17
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,793
I mean...

18
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,838
What I'm really tryin' to say
is he misses you.

19
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,114
Dinner would be great.

20
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,232
I just don't want you
gettin' your hopes up, OK?

21
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,318
- We're tryin' to work things out, but...
- I know, Mom.

22
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,796
OK, people, quiet.
Final touches, now's the time.

23
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,357
I think it's showtime.

24
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,318
Jeff?

25
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,195
I love you.

26
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,477
- Roll, please.
- OK, camera rolling.

27
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,754
<i>Castle of Terror,</i> scene 13, take 33.

28
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,151
OK. Action, Renee.

29
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,720
Cut. For Christ's sake, cut!

30
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,797
There's a dead short.
We've lost the neutral.

31
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,309
Cut the power.

32
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,078
Mom!

33
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,313
I know this is hard for you, but
I think you made the right decision.

34
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,317
He was a very old dog.

35
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,308
He had a good life.

36
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,797
Dr Matthews, your son is on line one.
He says it's an emergency.

37
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,710
Can you take...? Excuse me.

38
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,516
Jeff, what's goin' on?

39
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,318
I am the resurrection
and the life, sayeth the Lord.

40
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,759
She who believeth in me, though
she were dead, yet she shall live.

41
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,028
Whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.

42
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,710
I know my Redeemer liveth,

43
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,870
and that he shall stand
until the latter day upon the earth.

44
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,155
Friends, let us bow our heads
in silent prayer.

45
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,838
Friends, our service is now concluded.

46
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,431
Here we go.

47
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,598
Come on, folks, keep it back.
Show a little respect, now.

48
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,238
- Excuse me. I know it's a difficult time...
- Obviously you boys didn't hear me.

49
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,510
Show a little respect.

50
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,269
You probably don't remember me,
Chase. I'm Gus Gilbert, town sheriff.

51
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,992
I remember you.

52
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,109
I hear you're movin' in to the summer
house. Do you plan on stayin' full time?

53
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,673
Just wanted to get my son,
Jeff, outta LA.

54
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,436
Start things over.

55
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,232
- My deepest regrets.
- Thank you.

56
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,315
We got six of these wardrobe boxes.
You sure you want them all in the attic?

57
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,271
What do you say we give the clothes
to Goodwill? We'll keep the rest.

58
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,675
You're the one who wanted to move.

59
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,674
All the "Renee" boxes in the attic.

60
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,835
All right.

61
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,279
Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove,
your new housekeeper.

62
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,758
Hi.

63
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,590
Is something wrong?

64
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,714
No. You just look different than you
sounded on the phone. Please, come in.

65
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,399
I'm real excited to be working
for you, Mr. Matthews.

66
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,590
Well, we're glad to have you, Marjorie.

67
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,679
This is my son, Jeff,
and you can call me Chase. OK?

68
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,835
You know, I adored Miss Hallow.

69
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,430
- That one goes in the attic.
- Say what? Look out.

70
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,236
I'll get that.

71
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,160
This is gorgeous.

72
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,029
This is what she wore
at the Emmys, isn't it?

73
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,318
Don't touch her stuff. It made her crazy
when people touched her stuff.

74
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,870
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,956
It's OK.

76
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,110
Wait up, I'm comin' with.

77
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,198
That's great. I could sure use your help.

78
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,155
Let's go. Come on.

79
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,876
This isn't too bad.

80
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,031
It's pretty bad.

81
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,595
God, how long ago did this guy retire?

82
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,870
It's been a few years.

83
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,956
A few.

84
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,033
- Well, what's down there?
- I think the kennels are in the back.

85
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,672
- What happened? Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

86
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,553
I just got spooked
by a bunch of furballs.

87
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,593
Great. So, now I've
opened up an orphanage, too?

88
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,477
If it's OK, I'd like to take one.

89
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,195
All right, I'll tell you what.

90
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,472
You clean up these old kennels
and she's yours.

91
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,796
All right.

92
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,236
Thanks, Dad.

93
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,596
Come on, kitties.

94
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,316
No, Zowie.

95
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,236
Zowie, come back.

96
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,915
Drew, you get a handle on that dog.

97
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,635
- Sorry, he gets kinda hyper.
- That's all right.

98
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,558
Thought it was lunch.
How are you? You met my boy?

99
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,114
- No.
- Drew, where are your manners?

100
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,949
He's a cool-lookin' dog.
What's his name?

101
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,229
Zowie.

102
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,718
What happened, Zowie?

103
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,316
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my
rabbits. They ganged up on him.

104
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,398
I swear that dog is dumber
than lobster bait.

105
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,117
- Is he gonna be OK?
- I'm not really set up yet,

106
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,549
but I'll take a quick look.

107
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,638
Come on, Zowie.
It's OK, boy. Up on the table.

108
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,070
Good boy.
Let me look at you here. Let's see.

109
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,909
When I was younger, I thought cats
were the girls and dogs were boys.

110
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,114
Well, there's three more girls where
that one came from lookin' for homes.

111
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,390
Not our home.

112
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,596
Facial lacerations -
they'll heal up pretty quickly.

113
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,629
- I'll give you some antibiotic ointment.
- Drew, you listenin'? It's your dog.

114
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,919
He has corneal abrasions, scratches
on the surface of his right eye.

115
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,713
These eye drops'll help,
but it'll still take time,

116
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,673
so try to keep him away
from those rabbits.

117
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,198
Thanks.

118
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,437
Jeff, did you hear your mother
and I used to be sweethearts?

119
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,718
Really?

120
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,834
Yeah. Prom, homecomin'.

121
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,237
Whole nine yards.

122
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,514
Course, that was a lifetime ago.

123
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,716
Check it out.

124
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,679
Celebrity boy.

125
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,671
You will take your seats
and settle down, please.

126
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,879
- What's Hollywood like?
- Excuse me, at the back?

127
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,355
Would you settle down, please?

128
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,156
What's the hurry, junior?

129
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,796
Where you off to?

130
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,194
Sorry about your mom.

131
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,551
Papers said it was pretty gross,
gettin' fried like that.

132
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,636
Who you got there?

133
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,194
You're supposed to introduce friends.

134
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,595
Yeah. What's the cat's name, junior?

135
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,513
Tiger.

136
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,593
Don't you think that's
kind of a pussy name?

137
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,192
Can I hold her?

138
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,910
Promise I'll be real careful.

139
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,157
Jeff, you ever seen a kitten run before?

140
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,875
- Yeah.
- No, I mean really run.

141
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,476
Like this.

142
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,354
Shit.

143
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,996
You havin' fun yet?

144
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,879
- Gimme the cat, all right?
- I would, but there was a little accident.

145
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,315
She was trying to get away,
and her head got caught in the spokes.

146
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,352
What's left of her
is back there in the Pet Sematary.

147
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,792
- You heard about the Creed murders?
- You heard about where the dead rise?

148
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,317
Just back there, Jeff.
Just down that path.

149
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,592
Come on, Clyde,
just tell him where the cat is.

150
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,435
I told him where the cat is.
Shut up, dickwad.

151
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,833
What are you gonna do, fat ass?
You gonna sic big bad old Gus on me?

152
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,675
What do you think, Jeff? Maybe
you could go dig up your old lady,

153
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,395
bury her back there.
And maybe if you pray real hard,

154
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,913
- maybe she'll come back.
- Yeah, right.

155
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,676
You showed him.

156
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,833
Punk.

157
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,030
You showed him good.

158
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,718
Asshole.

159
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,316
This way, fat boy.

160
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,516
See ya.

161
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,116
There you go.

162
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,314
I've never seen anybody
punch Clyde before.

163
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,556
He pissed me off.

164
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,870
Sorry about your mom.
She sure was beautiful.

165
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,953
You never really think
your parents are gonna die.

166
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,755
Sometimes I wish Gus would die.

167
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,440
You shouldn't say that about your dad.

168
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,030
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.

169
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,313
So what was all that stuff
about people coming back to life?

170
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,038
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story.

171
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,518
Let's get outta here.

172
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,596
I agree.

173
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,036
There you go.

174
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,038
Dammit.

175
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,198
Thank you.

176
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,074
- How was school today?
- It sucked.

177
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,239
The first day of school
is always the hardest.

178
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,589
You're not my mother.

179
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,709
Jeff.

180
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,590
Live action resumes at the
Cumberland County Civic Center...

181
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,475
Drew, I don't remember
invitin' Zowie in for dinner.

182
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,550
- Just until he heals up?
- Don't start with me.

183
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,916
Hi, beautiful.

184
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,389
Gus...

185
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,078
Hi.

186
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,438
Gus.

187
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,276
Stop it.

188
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,235
You're breakin' the law.

189
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,316
Turn it off.

190
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,639
Your mother spent the last hour
cookin'. Show some appreciation.

191
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,115
Really, Gus, it doesn't bother me.

192
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,838
Attaboy.

193
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,556
There you go.

194
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,074
Not that much appreciation.

195
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,600
I thought we were gonna
tone down on your flabby ass.

196
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,996
Hey. I'm so sorry
I'm not the stud you are.

197
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,874
OK. Knock it off, guys.

198
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,756
You better watch your mouth, buddy.

199
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,277
I'll take that "hey" and shove it
right back down your throat.

200
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,356
You understand?

201
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,913
- Where's your boyfriend?
- I don't know.

202
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,393
Jeff.

203
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,671
- Jeff.
- What?

204
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,756
You all right?

205
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,636
Do you think Mom and you
would've gotten back together?

206
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,196
I think so.

207
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,195
I still can't believe she's dead.

208
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,158
Goddammit.

209
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,632
Goddamn dog.

210
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,036
That dog is history.

211
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,958
Goddammit.

212
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,876
You hear me, boy?

213
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,718
Goddammit.

214
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,676
- Don't shoot him.
- What, Drew? What did you say?

215
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,476
Gus. What have you done?

216
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,676
Amanda, stop lookin' at me like that.
He's had ample warnin' about that dog.

217
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,078
Zowie?

218
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,149
I was just going by your house.
Where's your bike?

219
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,756
Zowie's dead.

220
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,556
I have to bury him.

221
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,475
I don't wanna go out there alone.

222
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,476
All right.

223
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,276
I'll go get a shovel, OK?

224
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,835
So, where do you wanna bury him?

225
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,990
I'm not gonna bury him here.

226
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,951
- Then why are we here?
- There's a better place.

227
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,073
It's back there somewhere,
through the bog.

228
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,276
Come on.

229
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,791
It's supposed to be up there.

230
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,912
- What is?
- The old Indian burial ground.

231
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,555
Drew, come on, it's an old bullshit
story. You said so yourself.

232
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,076
But what if it's not bullshit?

233
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,432
If I bury Zowie there,
and it works, he'll come back.

234
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,077
- Alive.
- Drew, look.

235
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,272
I know your dog died, but get a grip.
You're freaking me out.

236
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,713
If there was one chance in a million
it'd work, wouldn't you just wanna try?

237
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,833
Look, let's just get this over with, OK?

238
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,075
If this doesn't work, you can't
ever tell anyone I did this, OK?

239
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,350
You've gotta promise.

240
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,630
Well, you need any help?

241
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,312
You have to bury your own. That's
the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule.

242
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,395
I've never had anyone die before.

243
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,155
But I guess you get over it.

244
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,316
I mean, eventually.

245
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,238
No.

246
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,990
No, you never get over it.

247
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,597
Look, maybe we should get outta here.

248
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,918
Yeah.

249
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,756
So long, Zowie.

250
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,876
Wanna get in?

251
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,318
Your mama's worried sick. Take off in
the night, you don't show up for school.

252
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,069
What are you tryin' to prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything.

253
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,395
I was burying my dog.

254
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,276
Life is full of lessons, buddy.

255
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,154
No one's above 'em. Not you, not me.
Now get in the car.

256
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,958
Zowie?

257
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,356
Drew.

258
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,795
Drew, you unlock this door right now.

259
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,388
- Unlock it, Drew.
- What did I do now?

260
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,080
Open this door, Drew Gilbert.

261
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,155
Where do you come off lyin' like that?
"I'm burying my dog. "

262
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,989
You think a lie like that's
never gonna catch up to you?

263
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,270
Zowie.

264
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,353
You say your goodbyes, mister. Zowie's
goin' outside, and you are grounded.

265
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,959
That's the new law, buddy.

266
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,037
Drew. Honey, I'm gonna call the vet.

267
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,556
Hey, Drew. Jeff,
why don't you give him a hand?

268
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,515
OK. Hey, Zowie.

269
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,315
Let's go up here, pal.
There you go. Lie down.

270
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,554
There you go, boy.

271
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,355
- How'd it happen?
- Some psycho got trigger-happy.

272
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,834
All right, I'm gonna give him a local
anaesthetic so I can clean the wound.

273
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,713
I'd like to take him home
tonight for observation.

274
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,116
Can you keep him at your place
until he gets better?

275
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,838
Yeah. Sure.

276
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,997
Come on.

277
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,155
Listen. Maybe he wasn't dead
when we buried him.

278
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,238
He was dead. You know he was.

279
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,716
Jeff.

280
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,269
Mom.

281
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,596
I'm waiting for you.

282
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,675
Mom.

283
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,356
Is he gonna be OK?

284
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,876
I don't know.

285
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,717
It's been three days. His immune
system should've responded by now.

286
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,876
It's OK.

287
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,235
I'm not gettin' a heartbeat.

288
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,639
He must be so weak
it's just not registering.

289
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,194
Jeff, let's take some blood.

290
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,196
Yeah, there you go.

291
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,793
Good boy.

292
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,278
OK.

293
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,953
Listen, why doesn't
he have a heartbeat?

294
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,430
Maybe it takes a while.

295
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,596
- Happy Halloween, Dr Matthews.
- Guys, take it easy.

296
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,071
- Evening, Gus.
- Evening, Ralph.

297
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,713
- These your girls?
- Sure are.

298
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,035
- Trick or treat.
- Behave yourself.

299
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,833
- Have a good night. Come on, girls.
- Bye.

300
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,708
All right, you go up to
the next one on your own.

301
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,115
OK, wait. No. Just hold still.

302
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,720
Just make sure you're home by ten.

303
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,115
If Gus finds out I let you go...

304
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,553
I will drink his blood.

305
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,195
Don't worry, Mom. I'll be home.

306
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,878
Where is everybody?

307
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,996
Jeff, honey, Mommy's here.

308
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,516
Look at this. Junior here
practically shit his pants.

309
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,959
- Check his shorts.
- Oh, no.

310
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,796
Mommy's here, Jeff.

311
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,920
You gonna run home to Daddy now?

312
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,756
Fuck off.

313
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,071
- What a blast.
- Did you see his face?

314
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,478
- You're home early.
- Just ran outta smokes.

315
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,156
Lucky me.

316
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,956
Where's the boy?

317
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,716
In his room.

318
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,278
Drew?

319
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,437
Goddammit, Amanda.
You want me to be father to that boy,

320
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,951
and every time I lay down the law,
you let him break it. Now, where is he?

321
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,435
- I don't know...
- Where is your son?

322
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,794
- Pet Sematary.
- What?

323
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,793
Pet Sematary.

324
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,556
Yeah. That old Louis was one
sick puppy. Diggin' up little Gage.

325
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,349
Maggots pourin' out of
the dead kid's eyes.

326
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,630
Ellie Creed was the only one that lived.

327
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,713
Then one night she freaks out.

328
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,874
Hacks up the grandparents with an axe.

329
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,796
Police found her lickin'
the brains off the blade.

330
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,115
Threw her in the psycho ward.

331
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,959
All she could say were two words.

332
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,071
Pet Sematary.

333
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,276
Here's the best part.

334
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,595
Two nights ago she escapes.

335
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,840
Man, I hope she doesn't show up here.

336
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,077
Shit, we wouldn't even recognise her.

337
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,270
Not if she was wearin' a costume.

338
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,430
She could be one of us.

339
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,309
- Oh, my God.
- What?

340
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,836
Shit. It's Drew's dad. It's Gus.

341
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,437
He's gonna kick my ass.

342
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,915
You boys better not be drinkin'.

343
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,917
Drew, get your ass out here,
front and centre.

344
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,717
Thanks for screwin' up
our Halloween, dumb shit.

345
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,111
You little shit. Get outta here, Matthews,
this is between me and my boy.

346
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,676
I warned you, buddy.

347
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,592
You broke the law,
now you have to learn the lesson.

348
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,797
Zowie.

349
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,436
No, Zowie, stop.

350
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,871
Drew, call him off.

351
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,558
No, Zowie.

352
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,999
Call your dog.

353
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,111
Drew, call him off.

354
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,956
Is he dead?

355
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,076
Oh, man, Jeff.

356
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,596
We killed him.

357
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,356
Are you sure?

358
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,878
What are we gonna do?

359
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,196
We can bring him back.

360
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,876
We can, can't we?

361
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,793
It worked on Zowie.

362
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,516
All right.

363
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,716
Oh, God.

364
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,073
Drew, do you know what time it is?

365
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,511
Did Gus ever find you?

366
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,276
God, what happened to you?

367
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,598
Nothin' happened, Mom.
We just ditched Gus, that's all.

368
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,796
You been drinkin'?

369
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,275
Drew's mom called hours ago.

370
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,869
The other kids were back by ten.
Where the hell were you boys?

371
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,956
- Just out.
- Just out?

372
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:21,234
Hold it. I've been lettin' you get away
with a lot these past few weeks,

373
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,397
but I will not stand for crap like this.

374
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,230
I don't care if it's Halloween, it's
a school night. Don't ever do this again.

375
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,391
Dad, listen...

376
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,876
I'm really tired and
I just wanna go to bed.

377
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,990
Go on.

378
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,351
We'll talk about this in the morning.

379
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,436
All right.

380
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,719
Drew.

381
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,636
Drew, buddy.

382
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,196
Lost my keys.

383
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,998
Gus?

384
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,356
Found 'em.

385
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,956
I need a shower.

386
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,030
Honey, I'm sorry about tonight.

387
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,475
Please come to bed.

388
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,191
Cold as ice. You smell bad.
What did you get yourself into?

389
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,757
Oh, my God, Gus, what happened
to the...? Gus, stop it.

390
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,471
What are you doing? Stop it. Don't.

391
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,556
Gus. Let go of me.

392
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,033
What's wrong with you, Gus? Stop it.

393
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,116
Let go of me, Gus!
