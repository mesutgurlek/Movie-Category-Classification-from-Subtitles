1
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:37,036
( music playing )

2
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,202
Man: Fear...

3
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:14,339
a little death
that consumes you.

4
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,576
From the common
to the abstract,

5
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,446
everyone is scared
of something.

6
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,381
I got a cockroach.
Somebody kill it.

7
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:23,715
Somebody kill it.

8
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,717
Somebody kill it.
Kill it. Ohh!

9
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,720
I was always taught
you had to live with it,

10
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,589
accept it.

11
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,225
I watched as others fought back.

12
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,294
Agoraphobia, nyctophobia,

13
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,563
hydrophobia, acrophobia.

14
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:41,100
There are literally thousands
of classified phobias.

15
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,935
I figured out a way

16
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,104
to give my patients a fresh
start

17
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,739
without the inhibitions
and restrictions

18
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,475
their phobias had placed
in their lives.

19
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,976
Oh, the chamber here

20
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:54,746
animates your phobias
in the form of hallucinations.

21
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,815
- ( squeals )
- No!

22
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:00,752
Total immersive exposure
therapy,

23
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,288
that's where I went...

24
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,961
pushed to the edge of science
and sensory deprivation.

25
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:12,564
We had the technology
to find a cure all along,

26
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,434
but everyone else
was blind to it.

27
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,437
Smarter men than me all failed,

28
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,405
but not me.

29
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,743
My agenda was pure,

30
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,746
and I figured out the key
hiding in plain sight,

31
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,749
which they all had overlooked,

32
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,318
the amygdala,

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,022
the portion of the brain
which feels fear.

34
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,690
( growls )

35
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,492
Everyone else
had danced around it

36
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,794
and treated it
like something sacred,

37
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:46,798
but I took a slightly
different approach.

38
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,802
The amygdala also acts
as a kind of projector

39
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,805
in which the signal
can easily be received

40
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:57,576
and, most of all, bounced back.

41
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,781
It was working.

42
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,317
Round after round,

43
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,853
I was fighting fear and winning.

44
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,222
No! ( screams )

45
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,958
Some of my colleagues
tried to debunk my theories,

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,661
calling me insane,
dangerous, outrageous,

47
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,629
but they were just jealous.

48
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,674
But something,
something went wrong.

49
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,243
( monitor
beeping steadily )

50
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,685
Dr. Andover:
Now close your eyes,

51
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,387
and just concentrate

52
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,824
on the sound of my voice.

53
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,761
( silverware clinking )

54
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,331
( overlapping chatter )

55
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,336
( no audible dialogue )

56
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:58,604
Which one do you want?
Strawberry?

57
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,738
Vanilla?
Chocolate? What?

58
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,340
- Vanilla.
- Vanilla?

59
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,444
( crowd screaming )

60
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,690
( gunfire continues )

61
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,196
Don't do this.
Please don't--

62
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,608
( gunfire resumes )

63
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,148
( muffled gunfire )

64
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,027
Dr. Andover:
Talk to me.

65
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,664
I need you to tell me

66
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,699
what you see.

67
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,136
Nothing.

68
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,805
Tell me what you see.

69
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,445
A door.

70
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,947
Good.

71
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,216
Is it the door to the diner?

72
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,353
I don't think so.

73
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,788
( distorted voice )
That's it, Paige.

74
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,792
Focus on the sound of my voice.

75
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,828
Paige, you're not listening to
me.

76
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,096
Focus!

77
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,835
Paige...

78
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,337
- ( panting )
- focus!

79
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,672
( distorted voice)
That's it, Paige.

80
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,009
- ( gasps )
- Focus on the sound of my
voice.

81
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,143
I'm scared.

82
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:48,313
( panting )

83
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,115
- Paige.
- No!

84
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,850
Paige, it's just a
hallucination.

85
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,685
All you need to do
is open your eyes.

86
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,220
Let me in.

87
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,489
Paige! Paige!

88
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,358
(distorted voice )
Open the door.

89
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,060
Andover: All you need to do
is open your eyes.

90
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,729
Open your eyes, Paige.

91
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,130
Paige, open your eyes!

92
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,232
( screams )

93
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,136
Paige.

94
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,372
Paige!

95
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,041
Paige!

96
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,647
( woman screaming )

97
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,698
( scream echoing )

98
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,933
( thunder crashing )

99
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,803
( banging on door )

100
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,476
( banging resumes )

101
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,880
( banging resumes )

102
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,752
( knocking )

103
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:34,986
Woman:
Sara.

104
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,288
Sara, are your lights out, too?

105
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,324
I'm fine.

106
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,792
Really?

107
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,427
Why, 'cause you lit
a couple candles?

108
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,896
You know what?
I think I have bedbugs.

109
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,932
Could you check my neck?
It's really itchy.

110
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,900
I feel like I can feel
them crawling on me.

111
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,068
It's just gross.

112
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,672
Right there.

113
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,841
Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax.

114
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:56,942
( groans )

115
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:57,976
Damn it.

116
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,077
Nothing.

117
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,946
- Really?
- Nothing except lice.

118
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,481
Oh, fuck you.

119
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,915
Why don't you light
some more candles?

120
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,251
Shut up.

121
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,024
So you got
your hot date over there?

122
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,660
He's warm enough, I guess.

123
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,096
Remember that friend of his
I told you about?

124
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,131
No, I don't.

125
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,700
You don't know what you're
missing.

126
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,169
No! Just let me finish grad
school

127
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,172
and worry about all
of that other stuff.

128
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,207
It's all about sacrifices.

129
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,842
Sacrifices for the greater good.

130
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,878
I know. You can spare me
the speech. Thank you.

131
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,513
Shut up.
I'll have the last laugh

132
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,449
when I'm a horribly underpaid
teaching assistant.

133
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,984
( sighs )

134
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,185
Thank God.

135
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,287
Now get out, itchy bitch.

136
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,522
I have school in the morning.

137
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,690
You could teach this kid
a thing or two.

138
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,225
- Get out.
- What?

139
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,727
Get out! Come on.

140
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,996
Oh, come on.
He's kind of hot

141
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,164
and edgy and dark.

142
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,100
I know you like 'em dark.

143
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,637
The darker, the better, bitch.

144
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,705
( thunder continues )

145
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,896
Okay.

146
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,736
( screams )

147
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,106
( panting )

148
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,210
Oh, God.

149
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,845
God.

150
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,858
( dials )

151
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,627
( line rings )

152
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,262
( rings )

153
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,366
( ringing continues )

154
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,977
( rings echoing )

155
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,658
( ringing stops )

156
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,154
( doorbell buzzes )

157
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,389
Hello?

158
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,860
Man:
It's not my fucking job!

159
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,496
I'm not a fucking magician

160
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,665
or mortician.
I am...

161
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:11,536
Osborn, are you fucking nuts?

162
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,837
For the past few days,

163
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,639
I have gone above and beyond.

164
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,474
I-- yeah.
Well, you know,

165
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,809
it's just a matter of time

166
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,811
before the checks start
fucking bouncing.

167
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,846
( cellphone rings )

168
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:26,351
( rings )

169
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,852
- Hey.
- Woman: Oh, my God.

170
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,354
Where the fuck are you?

171
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,190
I'm-- I'm at the clinic.

172
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,459
Please tell me you're
getting an abortion.

173
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,861
Look, I-I'm sure I'm fine.

174
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,663
I just-- I wanted
to talk to Andover.

175
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,165
What, you couldn't call?

176
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,666
You had to drive four hours?

177
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,302
Yeah, well, the place
looks like shit.

178
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,538
I'm not sure the fear business
is doing too well.

179
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,073
And I overheard Bauer
on the phone.

180
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,674
I think that something
happened here.

181
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,576
God, I hate that convict creep.

182
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,078
He's so rapey.

183
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,579
Listen to this shit.

184
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,148
I saw this article
about this bug from Japan.

185
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,984
It flies and shoots acid
into your eyes.

186
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,554
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
I'll be home later.

187
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,989
Great.

188
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,961
( door creaks )

189
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,501
Hello?

190
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,846
Dr. Andover?

191
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,017
( knob rattles )

192
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,358
Dr. Andover?

193
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,467
Dr. Andover:
Now, we discussed

194
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,635
how important it is

195
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,037
for you to revisit
these images, right?

196
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,776
Okay, just concentrate
on the sound of my voice,

197
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,577
- and breathe.
- ( screams )

198
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,247
- Stop!
- ( screaming continues )

199
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,649
Sara, it's not real!

200
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,453
( scream fades )

201
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,826
Dr. Andover?

202
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,395
( water dripping )

203
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,845
Dr. Andover.

204
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,613
We're closed.

205
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,689
Woman:
Come on. Come on. You're okay.

206
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,528
Come on.

207
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,163
- ( groans )
- It's okay. Come on.

208
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,298
- ( panting )
- Come on. Come on.

209
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,366
( dripping continues )

210
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,707
( car engine approaches
and stops )

211
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,180
Yo! Yo, can I get
some help over here?

212
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,882
- Excuse me?
- Yo, lady,

213
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,317
I just drove five fucking hours.

214
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,551
I just need you to come...

215
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,586
Wait.
You're Dylan Dunn, right?

216
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,620
Yeah.
Yeah, that's me.

217
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:16,821
Yeah.
( snaps fingers )

218
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,223
Yeah, you're Sara.
I remember you.

219
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,124
Caylee's outside,
and she's really sick.

220
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,726
She needs to see
the doc right away.

221
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,528
Caylee's here?
What's wrong with Caylee?

222
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,564
We gotta get her in a room.
We gotta get her to see the doc.

223
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,300
( wind whistling )

224
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,203
Hey.

225
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,339
Caylee.

226
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,641
Why aren't you eating?

227
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,110
I-- I just can't.

228
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,413
Hey, listen,
I'm gonna go get a drink.

229
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,082
Yeah. I got her.

230
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,787
Caylee, you were doing so well.

231
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,656
Tell me, why aren't
you really eating?

232
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,959
I know.

233
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,730
I know you saw it.

234
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,466
You saw him, too.

235
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,472
What?

236
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,043
Hello!
Can I get some help?

237
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,544
Caylee, are you okay?

238
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:14,879
- ( Caylee vomits )
- Here.

239
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,381
What the hell is this shit?

240
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,949
Get her prepped, please.

241
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,117
( gags )

242
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,586
We're closed.

243
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,221
- Caylee. Caylee.
- Here. I got her.

244
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,622
I got her.
Come here. come on.

245
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,858
Come on.
Get up. Get up.

246
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,961
We got you.

247
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,616
What makes you think
you had a fear aftershock?

248
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,619
I mean, but it was so...

249
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,654
real.

250
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,591
Like the mask, the gun.

251
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,261
I could smell the gunpowder.

252
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:06,931
Okay, within days of being
in the chamber, Sara, sure,

253
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,267
but you haven't
had a session in a year.

254
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,636
It's-- it's unheard of.

255
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,639
There hasn't been
one documented case

256
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,674
of fear aftershocks
reemerging

257
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,409
since he built
the chamber 20 years ago.

258
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,412
I don't understand
why I can't talk to Dr. Andover.

259
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,816
You know, what was that thing
that he was in?

260
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,985
Don't worry about that.

261
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,320
It's always been a secret part
of his process.

262
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,822
What do you mean?

263
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,658
Even though he
can't see what you see,

264
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,327
it still takes a heavy
emotional toll on him.

265
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,763
Well, then why doesn't he just
go
into the chamber himself?

266
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,765
Because it'd be
counterproductive,

267
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,001
I mean,
possibly even dangerous.

268
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,336
He's the only one
who knows how to run it.

269
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,872
He'd be the first
to tell you, Sara,

270
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,173
he has no fear to treat.

271
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,210
I don't know what's
going on here,

272
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,612
but our fears
are coming back.

273
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,514
And what is this black stuff

274
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,050
she projectile-vomited
all over me?

275
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,519
At first, I thought
it was stomach bile,

276
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,154
but it's thicker,

277
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,722
more viscous.

278
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,026
All I can tell you, Sara,

279
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,862
is we've never seen
anything like it at the clinic.

280
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,370
Is there something
you're not telling me?

281
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,241
It's Paige.

282
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,910
Paige Peterson?

283
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,647
She's dead.

284
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,085
What do you mean?
She was better. I--

285
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,386
She was better

286
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,022
for a while.

287
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,357
She came back months later

288
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,325
insisting on talking
to Andover.

289
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,327
Just like me now.

290
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,698
Did she die
in the chamber?

291
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,668
I-- Sara, I can't give you
any more details, Sara.

292
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,471
I've already said too much.

293
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,374
And I'm afraid you're
wasting your time here.

294
00:17:56,376 --> 00:18:00,078
Look, I can't go backwards.

295
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,247
I put up with those
hallucinations
in the chamber.

296
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,217
I slept with the lights on.
I did everything.

297
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,220
Caylee is clearly sick, okay?

298
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,621
I'm not leaving.

299
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,159
S-Sara.

300
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,114
Reporter:
Rewind. When did you know

301
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,816
that you could take the lead
and finish it out strong?

302
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,451
Dylan:
From the beginning.

303
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,120
I don't question it.
I don't question it.

304
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,088
You just keep riding hard.
You stay focused.

305
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,756
You keep doing it,
you're gonna win,

306
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,391
and that's what I do.
Done. Did it.

307
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,660
Another trophy
for your mantel...

308
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,063
Try to relax, okay.

309
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,632
Fans out there.
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

310
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,501
We're gonna get you something
for your pain, okay?

311
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,969
Just relax.

312
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,911
Okay, I'm afraid
Caylee is much sicker

313
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,246
than when we
initially treated her.

314
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,581
Her sitophobia and
body dysmorphic disorder

315
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,849
have reached a point
she could die

316
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,518
- if she doesn't start eating.
- I don't get it.

317
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,153
She was cured
when we were here last year.

318
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,621
Why can't you treat her
with traditional means?

319
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,189
I'd have to run
more tests to find out.

320
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,590
Why don't you just put her
in the damn chamber?

321
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,959
It's not an option,
apparently.

322
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,828
Why? That's the reason
why we came here.

323
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,429
Where the hell's the doctor?
He's supposed to be here.

324
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,931
- Why won't he see her?
- I understand.

325
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,000
Listen, between us,
I'm working on a backup plan

326
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,968
and hoping Andover
will get onboard.

327
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,303
Caylee's life may depend on it.

328
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,372
He needs to get his head
out of his ass.

329
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,673
- I'm aware.
- Listen, I'm gonna stay

330
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,375
and help with Caylee.
You don't have--

331
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,511
maybe a clean shirt
and a few vacancies?

332
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,746
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

333
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,465
Uh-huh.

334
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:09,106
I have done
as you asked, and...

335
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,811
you promised me.
You promised me.

336
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,214
Give me what I want.

337
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,984
Please. I need it.

338
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,191
Paige Peterson, addendum.

339
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:30,494
This afternoon, I just...

340
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,369
( door opens )

341
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,771
You have time
for a bubble bath,

342
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,973
but not to talk to me?

343
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,579
I'm sorry. I just...

344
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,750
I don't understand
what's going on here.

345
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,552
You and me both.

346
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:59,790
Things have been rather trying
around here lately.

347
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,826
I heard about Paige.

348
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:04,962
It was an accident.

349
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,431
- Right?
- No.

350
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,869
I was responsible for her, Sara.

351
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,638
I wanted to help her.

352
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,139
I wanted to help all of you.

353
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,074
You did help me.

354
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:20,111
You saved my life.

355
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,518
I saw the shooter.

356
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,688
The shooter?

357
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,595
No, that-- that's
never happened before.

358
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,996
Prolonged aftershock, I know.

359
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,099
Osborn schooled me.

360
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,969
I think it's time
for one more session.

361
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,506
Paige was just
one more session.

362
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,342
Everything was just fine,

363
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:55,112
and then she somehow
lost her way.

364
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,747
She lost me. I--

365
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,916
she was beyond my reach.

366
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,919
Sara, I nursed her for months.

367
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,322
She didn't require oxygen.

368
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:08,292
She didn't need life support.
How's that possible?

369
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,795
I could tell.

370
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:14,432
I could see
that she was still suffering,

371
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,867
that she was still terrified.

372
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:21,872
How did it end?

373
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:25,676
I simply closed her eyes.

374
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,013
( scoffs )

375
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,217
And she was gone.

376
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:37,154
I really appreciate
your wanting to help.

377
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:42,126
I really do, but-- ( sighs )

378
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:45,396
I just can't do this anymore.

379
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:48,199
So if you'll excuse me,

380
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,468
I have some things
I need to do.

381
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,139
Do you know that Caylee
is throwing up

382
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,575
whatever black stuff
that is in your vial?

383
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,778
You'd know that if you
came out of your office.

384
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,682
And unfortunately,
Dr. Andover,

385
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:06,851
I'm not leaving.

386
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,653
The Fear Clinic
is open for business.

387
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,559
Nobody can find out
about this,

388
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,727
or we're in deep shit.

389
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,730
Dang! Fuck!
I hate that fucking shit!

390
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,433
Well, that's Osborn's problem.

391
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,001
She can break it to the doc.

392
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,938
( groans )

393
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,507
Son of a bitch.

394
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,243
You stole millions
of dollars worth of power

395
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,844
juicing up illegal grow farms.

396
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,679
You mean to tell me
this is a challenge?

397
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,782
You know what?
Your fucking mama is a
challenge.

398
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,417
Here's what I think.

399
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,252
Why don't we just get
this son of a bitch back
upstairs,

400
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,620
and I'll piggyback
the breakout box?

401
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,088
Ah, fuck no.
Look, for one,

402
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,123
Andover destroyed the--

403
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,892
whatever power supply
was up there.

404
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,861
You need to figure
something out, and fast.

405
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,597
How much you say she was
cutting us a check for?

406
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,600
So much we'll never
have to work here again

407
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,702
or do anything that winds us
back in the joint.

408
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,237
Well, that's a good thing.

409
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,774
¶ Ooh, sexy bitches ¶

410
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,577
¶ Are my favorite kind
of bitches. ¶

411
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,446
( laughs )
You dumb-ass.

412
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,947
- I hate that song.
- ( laughs )

413
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,082
I daisy-chain a couple,
three gennies together,

414
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,951
I can have this thing
up and running by dinnertime.

415
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,120
- Boom.
- I'll be back.

416
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,156
Yes.

417
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:27,932
Hey. Baby, listen.

418
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:31,936
They're gonna keep you here
overnight for observation.

419
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,571
Well, they're gonna
make you better.

420
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,506
They're gonna fix you.

421
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,775
They're gonna do it without
that Fear Chamber.

422
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,109
No.

423
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,479
You have to get me in there,

424
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,980
no matter what it takes.

425
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,082
You want to lose me?

426
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,317
Huh?

427
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,486
Fuck no, I don't want
to lose you.

428
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,489
God, I feel like I've already
lost too much of you.

429
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:55,693
I-- all right.

430
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,394
All right, I'm gonna
get you in there.

431
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,397
I'd do anything for you.

432
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,835
( sighs )

433
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,403
I like that.

434
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,246
( screaming )

435
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:52,983
( sobs )

436
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,677
( sighs )

437
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,364
( gasps )

438
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,394
( joints crack )

439
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,664
Paige?

440
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:50,534
- W-where are we?
- ( joint cracks )

441
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,102
What happened to you?

442
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:55,105
In the chamber,
what happened?

443
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,875
( echoing ) You thought you
were building a box.

444
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:01,311
You built a door instead.

445
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,213
Door?

446
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,449
What door?

447
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:09,253
A door for me.

448
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,490
Every time you put someone
in that thing...

449
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,292
( joint cracks )

450
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,161
it made more cracks,

451
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:21,298
so I peeked through
the cracks you made...

452
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,466
( cracks )

453
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:25,202
became a little easier to turn.

454
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,275
I won't let you through again.

455
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,545
( cracking )

456
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,119
( gasps )

457
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,236
Paige Peterson, female,

458
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,271
age 26,

459
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,274
deceased.

460
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:07,911
This black substance

461
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:14,852
seems to induce hallucinations
upon contact,

462
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:19,056
which leads me to believe
that it's some kind

463
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,091
of phobic residue,

464
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,926
a fear waste, if you will.

465
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,764
Why hasn't it manifested
itself before now?

466
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,205
Man:
Caylee.

467
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,519
Caylee.

468
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,972
Caylee.

469
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:19,516
( lights buzzing )

470
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,960
Show me.

471
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,369
Where?

472
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,710
I understand.

473
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,317
If that's what you want.

474
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:45,736
( sighs )

475
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,892
Ooh. Mwah.

476
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,361
I am fucking hungry.

477
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,796
How are you feeling?
You hungry?

478
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,465
Caylee:
You know my mom's doing

479
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,267
that whole dinner thing
tonight, right?

480
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,102
Yeah. I gotta eat something
before then, though.

481
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,438
Maybe we could just go grab
something somewhere close.

482
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,539
- What's up, buddy?
- Hey, hey. What's up, dude?

483
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,007
I just saw you on the video.

484
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,643
Oh, yeah?
How'd my hair look?

485
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,046
I don't know. You were wearing
a helmet, stupid.

486
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,280
- ( laughs )
- Oh, you're so...

487
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,824
- ( laughs )
- It was so cool, though.

488
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:43,026
And when are you going to teach
me
those awesome flips?

489
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,128
No way. Your sister would fuck--

490
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,798
freaking kill me.
Can't do that.

491
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,802
Hey, brat, you want
a milkshake over at Eli's?

492
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,303
Are you kidding?
It's freezing.

493
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,638
Hey, come on.
Don't be a wuss.

494
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,672
It's warm in there.

495
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,707
Come on.
What do you say?

496
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,775
- Uh...
- Milkshake?

497
00:32:58,777 --> 00:32:59,810
- Fine.
- Fine.

498
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,178
- Done deal.
- Done deal.

499
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,647
- Ooh. Come on.
- Let's go.

500
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:26,103
( bird caws )

501
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,710
( gunshot )

502
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,780
Ah, shit, honey.

503
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,582
Sorry about this.

504
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,818
Hate these damn things.

505
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,320
Always chewing up my wires.

506
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,788
( grunts )

507
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,057
Hey.

508
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,460
Know how you catch
a unique squirrel?

509
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,033
Unique up on him.

510
00:33:56,035 --> 00:34:00,103
( laughs )

511
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:24,327
( sighs )

512
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,803
( sighs )

513
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:36,039
( tone chimes )

514
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,008
Bauer: Osborn, please come
to the reception area

515
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,409
for patient intake.

516
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,278
Osborn.

517
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,191
Osborn:
Mrs. Patton.

518
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,127
I'm Osborn,

519
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,728
the head therapist here,

520
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,030
specializing in PTSD.

521
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:01,431
So happy you could make it out.

522
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,133
Mrs. Patton:
Of course.

523
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,172
Hi.

524
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:13,343
I'm Sara.

525
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:20,484
He hasn't spoken
since the shooting, I'm afraid.

526
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,152
Osborn:
Blake.

527
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,670
Why don't we get you
in an exam room

528
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,639
and get you
all settled in, hmm?

529
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,707
Bauer.

530
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:51,014
Till then, you want
to have a seat?

531
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,487
I have to admit,
this is not what I expected.

532
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,260
Wasn't always like this.

533
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,930
You've been here before?

534
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:11,968
I came here after
the incident myself.

535
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,670
Dr. Andover really helped me.

536
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,672
He cured me of my scotophobia.

537
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,275
I'm sorry.

538
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:20,043
It's fear of the dark.

539
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:26,049
So why did you
bring Blake here now?

540
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:28,552
Well, at night...

541
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:32,055
just for a few minutes,
not every night,

542
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,124
it's like he sees something

543
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:36,526
and it really scares him.

544
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,230
He sees something
relating to the incident?

545
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,365
I don't know.

546
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,335
I know nothing can
bring him back now,

547
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,337
not the way he was.

548
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,372
But I can't stand the thought

549
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,209
of him being terrorized
by something

550
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,077
and then not
knowing what it is.

551
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:59,115
I think he's in the right place.

552
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,936
( sighs )

553
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,873
Do you know that that kid
can barely move,

554
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,876
but hurts himself every night,
he's so scared?

555
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:30,046
Yes, I promise you
we are gonna help Blake.

556
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:32,048
How?

557
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,117
By giving him fucking fluids

558
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,386
- and a lollipop like Caylee?
- Keep your voice down.

559
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,121
No! This is bullshit,
and you know it.

560
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,257
That kid is suffering.

561
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,758
Caylee is on the brink of death,

562
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,960
and he's too chickenshit
to use the chamber?

563
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,028
Sara.

564
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:49,032
He said he'd never
fail us, right?

565
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:52,102
Well, he's failing us
right fucking now.

566
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,446
( sighs )

567
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:38,682
Before you get angry...

568
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,320
this is your life's work.

569
00:38:45,257 --> 00:38:47,290
I had it repaired for good
reason,

570
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,592
and two of them
are in the waiting room.

571
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,431
What you and
this box have done

572
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,099
for me and
my claustrophobia,

573
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:58,468
for all the people
you've helped,

574
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,037
it is not over,
and you know that.

575
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,040
( sighs )
In over 20 years,

576
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,443
I've never had reason to doubt

577
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,945
that this was anything but a
cure,

578
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,047
a magic bullet.

579
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,717
( chuckles ) I thought
I did everything right.

580
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:14,951
And you did.

581
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,153
It was a terrible accident.

582
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,356
Paige was a tragedy, and it's--

583
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,857
it's not gonna happen again.

584
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,094
I don't want
anyone else hurt.

585
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,165
We can save this boy,

586
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:32,168
another victim
of that shooting,

587
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,903
one that was hurt so badly,

588
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,573
he flew under our radar
all this time.

589
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,575
Can't we give his mother
some peace

590
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,577
and let her know
what's tormenting him?

591
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:42,879
I don't know if I can. I--

592
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:45,582
I don't know.

593
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:48,918
You can.

594
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,390
You can.

595
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,328
You can,
and then you'll see

596
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,063
there's nothing
to be afraid of.

597
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:04,968
Don't worry, Doctor.

598
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,608
Have a little faith.

599
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,257
I don't understand.

600
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,326
- Why are we taking the stairs?
- Elevator's out.

601
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,766
And why is it
in the basement?

602
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,668
Elevator's out.

603
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,479
All ready to leave you
to it, Doctor.

604
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:52,449
No, please, you stay this time.

605
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,451
Given the-- given
the patient's condition,

606
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,786
this is new territory
for both of us.

607
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,121
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

608
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,323
Right this way.

609
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:01,724
The chamber is a very private

610
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,393
experience for our patients.

611
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,595
It's imperative for Dr.
Andover's
concentration

612
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,230
that he has no distractions
during the session.

613
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,065
Well, aren't you going
to put him to sleep?

614
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:10,333
We don't deal in dreams here.

615
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:13,002
At no time are our patients
ever asleep.

616
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,988
Now close your eyes,

617
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,157
and just listen

618
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,627
to the sound of my voice.

619
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:40,163
I need you to relax

620
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,198
and listen

621
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,168
to the sound of my voice.

622
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:49,772
We're going back,

623
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:52,008
back to the restaurant

624
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,711
on the day of the shooting.

625
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:56,846
The restaurant

626
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,849
is full of people
eating dinner.

627
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,521
Blake, what do you see?

628
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:11,594
Blake,
are you there yet?

629
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,467
- Blake, focus.
- Paige: Don't do this.

630
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:19,636
Please don't-- ( screams )

631
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:20,670
( gasping )

632
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:21,738
Focus, Blake.

633
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,541
Blake, you're not focusing.

634
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:27,176
His heart rate is elevated.
Do you want to stop, Doctor?

635
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:28,978
No. Blake.

636
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,014
- Blake!
- ( plastic thumping )

637
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:32,248
Mrs. Patton:
What's happening?

638
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:35,852
Bauer, would you
come get her, please?

639
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,353
- Is he okay?
- It's okay.

640
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:39,088
Ma'am, I need you
to come with me.

641
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:45,995
Penlight.

642
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,403
Osborn:
It's okay, Blake.

643
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,572
We're gonna get you out of here
in just a second.

644
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:56,639
Bauer, his chair.

645
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:58,241
( gasping )

646
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:05,748
Osborn:
We got you. We got you.

647
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,078
Hey, you've reached Megan.

648
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,880
Leave a message,
and I might call you back.

649
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:40,883
Megan, will you please
call me back, please?

650
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:42,552
I'm really starting
to get worried.

651
00:43:42,554 --> 00:43:44,854
- Fuck.
- Girlfriend trouble?

652
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:51,461
Listen, I need access to a car.

653
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:54,130
Well, I could probably do that.

654
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,466
But it'll cost you.

655
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,568
Fuck off.

656
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,570
Is there a problem here?

657
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:03,439
Oh, no, sir. We're just--

658
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,575
- we're just kidding around.
- I can't find Megan.

659
00:44:05,577 --> 00:44:07,610
It's been, like, six hours.
She's not answering her phone.

660
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,679
Mr. Bauer,

661
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:11,381
you will go get the young lady.

662
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:13,916
Now.

663
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,918
Yeah, okay, sir.

664
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,453
All right.

665
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:19,155
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

666
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,523
Sorry.

667
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,694
Thank you.

668
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,770
I don't fucking get you guys
with this chamber thing.

669
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:34,971
You guys are all
freaking obsessed.

670
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:37,340
You don't get it.

671
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:42,311
Everything fades
once you're in there.

672
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:46,883
You don't have to be afraid
of anything anymore.

673
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:51,020
Dylan:
It's bullshit.

674
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,722
Caylee:
What do you mean?

675
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:55,024
All right, fear is
a primal thing, right?

676
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,193
Hey, babies were born with it.

677
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,695
It's part of our
damn genetic code.

678
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:01,831
We've evolved
and we have survived

679
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,166
because of it.

680
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:05,001
I know all about fear,

681
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:06,869
and it's got no place
in my world.

682
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,338
And now you've got some fucking
guy
who builds this box,

683
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,573
and he wants to play God,

684
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,041
and he wants to start
digging around

685
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,643
in our heads and shit.
No way.

686
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:17,046
No. I'm pure instinct.

687
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,347
I don't need no fucking box.

688
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,717
Yeah, well, you're
not getting in mine.

689
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,252
- You were a patient, right?
- No, I wasn't a patient here.

690
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,421
I was in that thing once.
I was only here one time.

691
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:27,156
It's just she used
to show us videos

692
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:28,991
of all that crazy shit
you did with bikes.

693
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:31,394
Oh, yeah? Well, what's he got to
say
about his first ride?

694
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,563
Now, that wasn't very nice,
now, was it?

695
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:37,066
Hey, don't be an asshole.

696
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,903
Ah, yeah, we're gonna go
back and eat inside.

697
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,876
All it takes is one
trigger-happy fuck,
and next thing you know,

698
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:49,679
you got nobody to push the
buttons
on the control panel.

699
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:09,766
Caylee:
Have a little respect.

700
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:12,235
Just a little.

701
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,703
Guess he wasn't as lucky
as the rest of us that night.

702
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:39,662
( fluttering )

703
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:43,800
( chitter )

704
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:45,902
( gasps )

705
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:48,104
- ( buzzer )
- Help. Hello.

706
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:50,006
Somebody, hello.

707
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:52,074
Bauer: Megan, your old room's
waiting for you.

708
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:57,980
There you go.

709
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,415
Super!

710
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,083
( chuckles )

711
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:02,652
I missed you, Megan.

712
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:04,921
You're like a ray of fucking
sunshine in my day.

713
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:14,096
As usual, you guys corner
the market on hospitality.

714
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:16,532
( chuckles )

715
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:17,967
Hospitality.

716
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,603
I'll fucking show you
hospi-fucking-tality.

717
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:25,842
( heavy metal playing )

718
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,277
- ¶ Sexy bitches... ¶
- ¶ It's way past midnight ¶

719
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,546
¶ There's a howling wind,
oh, God what can it... ¶

720
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,651
( sighs )

721
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:37,286
Oh, thank God.

722
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:39,622
Ow.

723
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:42,124
I was so worried about you.
Are you okay?

724
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:44,660
Yeah. I don't know.

725
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:47,563
I just thought it would pass
on its own, I guess.

726
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:51,734
I've got so much to tell you.

727
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:54,303
( crickets chirping )

728
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:02,478
Hey, babe.

729
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,880
I'm gonna take a shower.

730
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:05,581
I'll see you after
your session, 'kay?

731
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,250
Come here.

732
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,886
- Come here.
- What's up?

733
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,387
You okay?

734
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,655
No.

735
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:14,223
No? What's wrong?

736
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:19,262
Come on.

737
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,445
Now just focus

738
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:39,916
on the sound of my voice.

739
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:46,289
Now you're going back.

740
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,358
You're going to return...

741
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:51,794
to the restaurant.

742
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,533
Are you there?

743
00:48:57,535 --> 00:49:00,536
Are you in the restaurant?

744
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,271
You see your boyfriend.

745
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,673
You see Dylan.

746
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,611
I'm safe.

747
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:11,213
Caylee:
I see them.

748
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:13,849
Andover:
Caylee, I need you to tell me

749
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:16,919
exactly where you are.

750
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:20,823
- ( Caylee sighs )
- ( bird cawing )

751
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:24,560
I'm safe.

752
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:25,628
Good.

753
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:30,666
So now it's just
a few moments

754
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:32,735
before the incident.

755
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,406
Do you see anyone
approaching the door?

756
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:40,409
Caylee:
I can see him.

757
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,080
- Can you see your brother?
- ( gunshot )

758
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:45,948
( woman sobbing )

759
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,417
Do you see little Kevin
sitting opposite you?

760
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,020
( sighs )

761
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:54,190
I-I can see him.

762
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:57,193
What's he wearing?

763
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:02,031
Picture it, Caylee.

764
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:04,100
What are you eating?

765
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:05,634
Picture everything.

766
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,269
Caylee: I don't want
to remember everything.

767
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:10,006
I can't. That's not
what I'm supposed to do.

768
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:12,641
Yes, that's precisely
what you're supposed to do.

769
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,543
Now trust me.

770
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,316
Now look to your brother.

771
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:22,718
- ( gunfire )
- Caylee: No!

772
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:25,621
I can't.

773
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:26,989
Caylee, look at Kevin.

774
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:28,357
Get me out of here!

775
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:32,628
I want you
to picture everything.

776
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,063
( gunfire )

777
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:38,334
Caylee:
Get me out of here!

778
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:40,369
Get me out of here!

779
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,204
( Caylee gasping )

780
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,740
Caylee. Caylee,

781
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:47,510
I know it's painful
for you to relive that day,

782
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,378
but you can't hide from it.

783
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,647
I'll have Gage help you
to your room, Caylee.

784
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:53,249
- Just relax.
- What the fuck was that?

785
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:56,018
That wasn't supposed to happen.

786
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,586
He promised me!

787
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:59,188
Come on. Come on, hon.

788
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,656
- Let me help you out.
- You fuck.

789
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:01,891
Get off of me!
Get off!

790
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:03,392
- Okay.
- I'm not a fucking cripple.

791
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,827
I'm not the one
in the wheelchair.

792
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:05,928
- Okay.
- Move!

793
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,897
Move!

794
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,271
That wasn't about food
at all, was it?

795
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:16,772
No.

796
00:51:16,774 --> 00:51:18,674
No, it certainly was not.

797
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:20,910
( thunder crashing )

798
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:24,080
( knock on door )

799
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:30,186
Hey.

800
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:32,288
You mind if I come in?

801
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:45,334
It's okay.

802
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:56,979
You want to know a secret?

803
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:02,685
I was always
afraid of the dark...

804
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,056
ever since I was a little kid

805
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:09,125
in my bedroom.

806
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:12,595
And then when
the shooting happened...

807
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:14,330
( screaming )

808
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:16,765
the guy followed me,

809
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,503
you know,
like me and only me

810
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:23,472
when he started
shooting out the lights.

811
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:29,078
And, you know,
at that moment,

812
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,081
I wasn't even scared of him.

813
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,452
( thunder resumes )

814
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:38,687
I was scared of the dark.

815
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:43,359
I was scared
of monsters in the dark.

816
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,996
Anyway...

817
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:52,334
Dr. Andover really helped me.

818
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,638
Until lately.

819
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,173
I'm starting to think

820
00:52:57,175 --> 00:53:00,743
maybe it's smart
to be scared of the dark.

821
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:09,618
- ( inhales )
- Huh?

822
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:17,526
S'okay.

823
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,501
S'okay, be...

824
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:27,369
- ( gasps )
- S'okay.

825
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,373
I se--

826
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,643
I see monsters...

827
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:37,513
too.

828
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:38,814
I see mons...

829
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:41,250
( laughing )
Blake.

830
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,551
( knock on door )

831
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,489
Sara, Dr. Andover would
like to speak to you.

832
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,800
Hey. I'll be right back.

833
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:01,837
( laughs )

834
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,777
Blake.

835
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:12,514
Blake, are you okay?

836
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:16,452
What's wrong, Blake?

837
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:50,286
( moaning )

838
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,828
Ow. Fuck!

839
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,563
Take it easy.

840
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:22,685
Yeah.

841
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,989
Hard. Hard.

842
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,023
Hard.

843
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,993
Hurt me.

844
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:32,861
Fucking hurt me. Fuck!

845
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,030
Harder. Oh, harder.

846
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,165
Hard--

847
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,933
Caylee, what the fuck--
fuck is--

848
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,468
fuck is wrong with you?

849
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,070
Fuck, can't we just
be normal for once?

850
00:55:41,072 --> 00:55:42,104
Get out.

851
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:44,273
Get out!

852
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:46,208
You're fucking useless.

853
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,543
This is fucking bullshit.

854
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:49,278
Get out.

855
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,697
Sara: He's moving again.
He's talking.

856
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:09,832
I know.

857
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,533
Blake moved.

858
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,403
( thunder resumes )

859
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,338
His brain activity has tripled.

860
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,574
Why can't you see
that that's amazing?

861
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:23,846
Because, Sara, what's happening
here to Blake

862
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:27,583
simply isn't possible.

863
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:30,586
The chamber wasn't designed
to work that way.

864
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,388
The chamber doesn't
cure gunshot wounds.

865
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,190
It simply opens a door

866
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,859
into a portion of the brain

867
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:38,927
that most people keep
locked away. That's it.

868
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,496
Then why did you
tell his mother

869
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:42,331
that you thought he
was going to be helped?

870
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,666
Yes, I thought
perhaps we could improve

871
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:47,669
his function a fraction
using sensory techniques.

872
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:50,038
But this? Oh, no.

873
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,707
This is impossible.
This is dangerous.

874
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:54,443
Or it's a miracle.

875
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:56,211
Or and if it's not a miracle,

876
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:58,747
it's a really fucking
great side effect.

877
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,282
I honestly
don't understand why

878
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:02,418
you're not calling
medical journals

879
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,086
and telling them
that it works again.

880
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,555
Because I invented
the goddamn thing.

881
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:08,957
I know what it's capable of.

882
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:11,527
( sighs )

883
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:13,095
Look, maybe this will make
sense.

884
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:32,281
( gasping )

885
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:35,717
Blakey?

886
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:36,985
- Blakey?
- ( yells )

887
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:38,520
Blakey! Baby, are you okay?

888
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:39,555
( yelling )

889
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:41,957
Oh, baby.
What? What?

890
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,592
What do you see? What?

891
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,227
What, honey?
What's the matter?

892
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:47,262
You're okay. You're okay.
You're with Mommy.

893
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:48,797
Mommy's here.
Mommy's here.

894
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,933
- Mommy's here.
- ( wails )

895
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:52,201
Mommy's here.
Mommy's here.

896
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:56,505
This is the amygdala.

897
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:58,407
It's the part of the brain

898
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:01,410
where the emotion
of fear is generated from.

899
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:03,512
And until today--

900
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:06,515
until today,
Blake's entire frontal lobe

901
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:09,251
was severely damaged
by that bullet--

902
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:12,654
utterly, totally unresponsive.

903
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:15,858
I think this is
about the chamber.

904
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,960
I think it's doing
something to all of you.

905
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:20,796
I think it's doing it for a
reason.

906
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,197
( chuckles )

907
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:25,200
Sara. Sara, don't look
at me like that.

908
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:27,102
Listen, I know
this sounds crazy,

909
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:30,172
especially coming from
a man of science, but...

910
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:34,843
I'm truly afraid
that there could be

911
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:38,914
a malevolent entity
at work here.

912
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,885
You can't quit.

913
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:45,287
It's not an option.

914
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:53,662
Besides, what reason would
a malevolent force have

915
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:56,365
for making Blake smarter?

916
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,208
( thunder resumes )

917
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,411
( Sara on recording )
...what reason

918
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:10,879
would a malevolent force have

919
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:13,248
for making Blake smarter?

920
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:22,624
So that he can be made
to feel fear again.

921
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:39,241
( slurping )

922
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,095
( gasps, winces )

923
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:07,869
How bad is it?

924
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,476
It's not that bad.

925
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,646
I need you to take
a deep breath.

926
01:00:17,648 --> 01:00:20,115
All right, Megan?
I'm going to have to cut this.

927
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,950
- Okay?
- Okay.

928
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,819
( moans )

929
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:28,090
Okay, just take
a deep breath, okay?

930
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,124
Just relax. Breathe.

931
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,126
- Breathe.
- ( winces, groans )

932
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,928
You're gonna feel
some pressure now.

933
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,330
All right?
I have to squeeze it.

934
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:36,398
Oh, God. Ow.

935
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,466
- It hurts.
- I know, sweetie.

936
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:38,500
Just take a deep breath.

937
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:40,435
Please stay still,
Megan, okay?

938
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:41,470
Calm down, sweetie.

939
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:44,039
( crying )

940
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,480
- It itches. It--
- I know, sweetie.

941
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,914
It's like there's
something inside.

942
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,116
I know. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

943
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,151
Stay still so I
can clean this, okay?

944
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,519
Okay, sweetie.

945
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:59,788
- Oh, Christ.
- Take a deep breath.

946
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,791
It hurts. It--
( crying )

947
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:06,361
It feels like there's something
crawling in there.

948
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:08,897
Is there something in there?

949
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:16,605
Oh, what the hell is that?

950
01:01:16,607 --> 01:01:18,407
What is that?

951
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:22,444
( crying )

952
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,173
( knock on door )

953
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:53,875
Hey.

954
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,677
You mind if I come in?

955
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:57,045
( stammers )

956
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,113
Sure.

957
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:06,755
I didn't know
you had tattoos.

958
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:09,691
( chuckles )

959
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:11,560
Did that hurt?

960
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,229
I-I don't know.

961
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:24,573
Do you remember anything?

962
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:26,341
What do you remember

963
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:28,510
about that night, Blake?

964
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:35,016
( stammers )
Sara.

965
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:39,788
I get flashes

966
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,890
in the chamber.

967
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:44,359
It's-- it's not like you guys.

968
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,461
I don't...

969
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:56,638
When does your mom
come to get you?

970
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,510
( laughs )

971
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:06,548
I don't know.

972
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:09,718
I don't care.

973
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,487
She seems
a little overprotective.

974
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:13,722
Yeah.

975
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:18,426
That's one way to put it.

976
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:19,995
She cares, though.

977
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:22,631
Can we please just
not talk about her?

978
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:31,306
S-- I'm sorry.

979
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,610
You know what would have
been really nice?

980
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:38,280
Just if we could have
known each other

981
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:41,283
before any of this...

982
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:43,985
sh-shit happened.

983
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:51,526
I would have liked that.

984
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,842
Corner lamp,

985
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:10,378
patient room 2A.

986
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,319
- Hah! ( laughs )
- Fuck!

987
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:18,353
It's me, fuck-nut.

988
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,622
Jesus Christ, Bauer.
What are you doing?

989
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:22,357
Where'd you get
that creepy-ass thing?

990
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,559
It's cool, right?
I found it in the basement.

991
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:27,495
No, it's goddamn weird.
Gives me the heebie-jeebies.

992
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,331
All right, all right.
Put your fucking vagina away.

993
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:32,400
Fuck you! You scared
the shit out of me, boy!

994
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:33,468
( laughs )

995
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,470
Goddamn jokester
motherfucker.

996
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,574
Aw, horseshit.

997
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:41,543
Don't know how to do
your job, old man?

998
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:43,745
I do my job the same way
I do your mama,

999
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,513
- eight hours a day.
- ( laughs )

1000
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:48,516
Might have to switch me up
some circuits in here.

1001
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:51,386
God damn it.

1002
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:52,888
Ah, we're gonna
need to be ready

1003
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:54,756
for emergency lighting anyway.

1004
01:04:54,758 --> 01:04:56,524
That storm's coming up strong.

1005
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:58,760
- ( woman screams )
- What the fuck?

1006
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:05,033
I'm glad you and--

1007
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:07,269
you and Sara
are getting along.

1008
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:11,806
So how are you feeling?

1009
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:16,077
Good. Thank you.

1010
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:21,383
Now, Blake, during your session
in the chamber,

1011
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:23,718
did you see anything strange?

1012
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,955
Hear a voice other than mine

1013
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:29,457
trying to speak to you? Hmm?

1014
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:35,130
May I?

1015
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:40,602
Ah. Oh.

1016
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:43,138
The mask from the diner.

1017
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,106
Is that what you saw?

1018
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,080
I understand how traumatic

1019
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:54,416
that could be for you
to remember, Blake.

1020
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:55,951
It's scary.

1021
01:05:57,721 --> 01:05:59,487
Blake.

1022
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:02,958
It's-- it's a scary mask.

1023
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,894
Blake...

1024
01:06:05,896 --> 01:06:07,629
it's just a mask.

1025
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:11,499
All of us wear masks every day.

1026
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:14,636
We hide behind social masks.

1027
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,438
We need to wear them.

1028
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,773
We couldn't survive without
them.

1029
01:06:18,775 --> 01:06:22,978
What frightens you isn't this
mask.

1030
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,849
What scares you
is what it represents.

1031
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:40,428
Blake, I need
to ask you something

1032
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:43,431
that may make you
feel uncomfortable,

1033
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:45,166
might upset you.

1034
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:50,338
Go ahead.

1035
01:06:52,943 --> 01:06:54,309
I need to know

1036
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:58,013
exactly where you were sitting

1037
01:06:58,015 --> 01:06:59,381
in that diner.

1038
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:02,784
I don't know.

1039
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,620
All right.

1040
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:08,656
What were you wearing, hmm?

1041
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:10,091
You remember that?

1042
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:14,496
Talk to me.
What did you have to eat?

1043
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:15,730
I don't know.

1044
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:16,831
French fries?

1045
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,299
How did you get there, Blake?

1046
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:19,868
Who did you come with?
All right.

1047
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,669
What was your meal that day?

1048
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:22,737
What were you wearing?

1049
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:24,839
- I don't know.
- Blake, you can do this.

1050
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:26,341
Talk to me, Blake!

1051
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:28,877
You look at me,

1052
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:32,147
and you don't know anything.

1053
01:07:32,149 --> 01:07:35,216
Doc. You gotta come with me.

1054
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:39,421
Were you even there that day?

1055
01:07:39,423 --> 01:07:40,488
Doc.

1056
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:46,995
The basement.
It's the bug chick.

1057
01:07:46,997 --> 01:07:49,064
It appears Blake's
developed necrophobia.

1058
01:07:55,005 --> 01:07:58,039
I think it's a good idea for me
to go prep her room,

1059
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,541
prepare for
a worst-case scenario.

1060
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:01,443
( chuckles )
I'm not even sure

1061
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:03,945
I know what a worst-case
scenario
is around here.

1062
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:06,047
I know, but I don't know
what else to do.

1063
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:09,050
She will claw herself apart.

1064
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,252
At least in here,

1065
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,455
we have a chance to reach her.

1066
01:08:13,457 --> 01:08:15,023
You can reach her.

1067
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:25,300
Or something else
may reach her.

1068
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:38,480
Sweetheart, I'm gonna need you
to close your eyes.

1069
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:43,118
Megan. Megan.

1070
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:46,054
Megan.

1071
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:48,723
Megan.

1072
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:51,292
( wailing )

1073
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,355
No!

1074
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:46,447
( yells )

1075
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:14,409
( thunder resumes )

1076
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:28,456
( gunfire )

1077
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,627
- ( grunting )
- ( gunfire continues )

1078
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,900
( panting )

1079
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:29,817
( gasps )

1080
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:03,685
( static buzzes )

1081
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,620
A masked gunman
has opened fire

1082
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,155
inside a popular
restaurant tonight,

1083
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:08,656
killing six people,

1084
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,191
including
a seven-year-old boy.

1085
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:12,360
Police are still looking
for the suspect,

1086
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:13,761
who is said to be wearing a mask

1087
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:15,530
and is heavily armed.

1088
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:28,109
( no television audio )

1089
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,688
Get the hell on,
you annoying son of a bitch.

1090
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,523
Hey, you know what's going on
with the lights?

1091
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,326
Obviously,
there is a power surge.

1092
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,462
Dr. O thinks my time
is better off spent

1093
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:49,464
putting beds together
for goddamn crazy people.

1094
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:51,933
By the way, your friend's
down in the chamber.

1095
01:12:51,935 --> 01:12:52,967
She freaked out.

1096
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:55,002
Who? Megan?

1097
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:56,304
That's the one.

1098
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:58,806
Can you take me to her, please?

1099
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:00,341
You know what?
I am goddamn tired

1100
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:01,509
of being a chambermaid.

1101
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:02,744
I need to reroute power

1102
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,145
to the emergency lights
anyway. Come on.

1103
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:05,179
I'll take you there.

1104
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:07,315
Sara:
Shit.

1105
01:13:07,317 --> 01:13:08,716
Megan.

1106
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,752
Megan. Megan, talk to me.

1107
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:12,553
- Open it!
- I'll see what I can do.

1108
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,689
Can't you open it?
Megan. Hey.

1109
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:16,858
Hey, Megan.
Talk to me. Look at me.

1110
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,226
Look at me.

1111
01:13:18,228 --> 01:13:19,494
Hey.

1112
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:26,601
( groans )

1113
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:30,171
Bauer, get your ass down
to the chamber now!

1114
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,143
Let's get her out of there.

1115
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:38,446
Get her head down there.

1116
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:40,448
What the hell
is wrong with her?

1117
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,417
Listen, I can't find
Andover anywhere.

1118
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:44,419
- He is fucking gone.
- Oh, Jesus.

1119
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,120
What's wrong with her eyes?

1120
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:49,023
God, she doesn't even blink.
That's trippy.

1121
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:50,224
Don't touch her.

1122
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:51,726
I saw the same thing with Paige.

1123
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:53,394
Her heart rate
and blood pressure

1124
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:54,862
are impossibly low.

1125
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:57,098
By all accounts,
she should be dead.

1126
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,200
Sweetie, come on.
It's okay.

1127
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:01,869
Don't close her eyes,

1128
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:03,738
even for a minute.

1129
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,407
You guys, she needs
real medical attention,

1130
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:07,909
more than I can give her here.

1131
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:10,244
Under normal circumstances,
I can cover RN duties,

1132
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,479
but nothing is normal here.

1133
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:13,114
We need to get her
to a hospital

1134
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:15,082
before her body
goes into shock.

1135
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:16,484
I can carry her out.

1136
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:18,252
No. Someone's got to go
to the hospital.

1137
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:20,621
That ain't gonna happen,
all right?

1138
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:23,124
All the doors and windows
are jammed tight with this tar
shit.

1139
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,759
It's impossible.

1140
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:26,994
Yeah? Well, hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

1141
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:28,763
( groans ) I still don't
have a damn signal.

1142
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:30,765
I ain't got one either upstairs.

1143
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,500
Whether it's that storm
or this shit,

1144
01:14:32,502 --> 01:14:34,135
I don't know, but here's
what I'm thinking.

1145
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:35,269
We're fucked.

1146
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:36,804
Okay, I need
more medical supplies.

1147
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,005
When this sedative wears off,

1148
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:40,441
if she even comes out of this,

1149
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:42,276
we need extra blankets to raise
her body temperature,

1150
01:14:42,278 --> 01:14:43,611
and there's not enough
down here.

1151
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:45,179
I'm gonna go get supplies,
all right?

1152
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:46,247
- No. No, no, no.
- I'll be back in a minute.

1153
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:48,282
Honey, wait a minute.
None of us know

1154
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:50,384
what the hell's going on
around here, all right?

1155
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:52,353
Everything's gone up shit creek.
I don't think you should be

1156
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:53,588
running around there
all by yourself.

1157
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,423
I'll take my chances.

1158
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:02,230
God damn, that is creepy.

1159
01:15:28,358 --> 01:15:31,292
Paige.

1160
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:33,761
( echoing )
Please, help me.

1161
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:37,532
( groans )

1162
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:39,433
( screams )

1163
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:53,314
I know who you are.

1164
01:15:54,517 --> 01:15:56,450
( joints crack )

1165
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,655
I won't let you through again.

1166
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:06,260
Paige:
The door is closed.

1167
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:12,633
You were taking
so much food off my table.

1168
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,201
I'm going back.

1169
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:51,973
( distorted )
You're home now.

1170
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,377
( groans )

1171
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:06,587
( Andover on recording )
Her body temperature

1172
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:09,290
and vitals say she--
she should have expired,

1173
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,626
but she's beyond my reach.

1174
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:14,328
It's as if something else
is holding on to her,

1175
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:15,830
not letting her die,

1176
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:18,332
keeping her in a state
worse than death,

1177
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:20,234
a kind of fear loop.

1178
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:22,937
( tape rewinds )

1179
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:25,606
( Andover on recording )
I stupidly tried to eradicate

1180
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:28,909
a fundamental and necessary
human function,

1181
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,411
the oldest human emotion.

1182
01:17:30,413 --> 01:17:32,980
And now fear itself,

1183
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:37,318
now it wants to live
and breathe on its own.

1184
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:41,255
I think--
I think an entity

1185
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,524
is coming through
into our world,

1186
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:45,760
and now fear itself,

1187
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:48,262
perhaps planning to use all of
us

1188
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:51,165
as a host, a vessel.

1189
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:00,207
( door opens )

1190
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:03,210
'Bout time you get down here.
Can you give me a hand?

1191
01:18:03,212 --> 01:18:05,546
Lazy fucker.

1192
01:18:08,618 --> 01:18:10,685
Come on. Quit looking
for your girlie magazines

1193
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,621
and get over here.
Help me out.

1194
01:18:13,623 --> 01:18:16,123
Thing ain't gonna jury-rig
itself.

1195
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:18,392
Fuck.

1196
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:24,398
What the fuck is this?

1197
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:34,809
What in the fuck?

1198
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:45,052
( racks shotgun )

1199

( gunshot )

1200
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:53,894
Look, I know the sounds
of gunshots.

1201
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,730
We need to get
the hell out of here.

1202
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:57,765
And how are you
gonna do that?

1203
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:00,768
I'm gonna find a way.

1204
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:06,974
Fuck! Fuck!

1205
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:13,013
( gasping, growling )

1206
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:21,589
( warbles )

1207
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:33,267
What's going on?

1208
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:35,136
Did you find him?

1209
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:38,139
Bauer, can you please
go find Andover for me?

1210
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:40,207
- Yeah. I mean, it wants me.
- Please?

1211
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:42,042
It needs me to--
it wants me to join.

1212
01:19:42,044 --> 01:19:43,210
- Bauer.
- I'm not in.

1213
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:45,980
- Bauer.
- I don't want--

1214
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:48,048
- Bauer.
- I don't want to be in.

1215
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,917
What is going on
with you?

1216
01:19:49,919 --> 01:19:51,318
- Bauer?
- This is the door.

1217
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,787
Bauer? Bauer!

1218
01:19:56,225 --> 01:20:01,195
You really think he's gonna let
me
leave here, don't you?

1219
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:02,496
"He"? Who the hell
are you talking about, babe?

1220
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:04,632
He's coming.

1221
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:09,503
Bauer, can you please
go get Dr. Andover for me?

1222
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:12,506
What-- what is
going on with you?

1223
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:14,308
- ( laughing )
- Bauer!

1224
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,343
( laughing )

1225
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:17,745
Bauer?

1226
01:20:17,747 --> 01:20:19,947
You still don't get it, do you?

1227
01:20:19,949 --> 01:20:21,582
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't--

1228
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:23,083
- He's coming.
- No, no.

1229
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:25,486
- That's how you leave!
- Bauer?

1230
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,789
- Hear him, baby?
- No, listen to me.

1231
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:29,824
You're talking crazy.

1232
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,025
The window.
I pushed on the--

1233
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:32,459
It pushed back!

1234
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:34,461
- Look at me.
- It's not letting me leave.

1235
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:36,831
- ( screams ) No! No!
- Bauer, it's okay.

1236
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:37,865
- No! No!
- It's okay.

1237
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:39,633
It'll all be over soon.

1238
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:41,836
No, I got an idea.
I have this.

1239
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:46,140
Caylee!

1240

( Caylee gasping )

1246
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,222
You promised me.

1247
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:04,225
You promised me
I could be with him.

1248
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:07,027
You promised me
you'd get me out of here.

1249
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,529
Go away!

1250
01:21:09,966 --> 01:21:12,533
( distorted )
I keep my promises.

1251
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:14,568
You want to see Kevin?

( Andover on recording )
Worse than death,

1253

are starving
this thing somehow.

1262
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:55,943
It's relentless and,
worst of all, patient.

1263
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:58,445
It needs to feed,

1264
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:01,081
and it won't be
denied its meals.

Have a little faith.

1268

Is that-- is that you?

1269

Have a little faith.

you were right
about one thing.

01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:12,973
Sometimes it's smart
to be scared of the dark.

No!

Blake, it's not you.

Blake, this isn't you.

1296
01:25:32,061 --> 01:25:34,061
Then tell me, Sara,

1297
01:25:34,063 --> 01:25:36,296
why does this mask
feel so familiar?

1298
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:39,133
You're not wearing a mask.

1299
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:40,634
Look.

1300
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:42,903
Feel your face.

1301
01:25:57,486 --> 01:26:00,154
Mrs. Patton:
You killed all those people!

1302
01:26:00,156 --> 01:26:02,756
You should be dead!

1303
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:09,897
I do remember you.

It was me.

1307
01:26:25,481 --> 01:26:28,215
I did it. I'm so sorry.

1310
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:40,727
Blake, we have to go.

( gasping )

1312

No. No.

Sara:
How did it end?

1314
01:27:09,191 --> 01:27:12,893
I simply closed her eyes.

1315
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:20,934
( groaning )

1316
01:27:20,936 --> 01:27:22,436
( wails )

1317
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:27,975
( gasping, gurgling )

1318
01:27:32,214 --> 01:27:33,447
Fuck!

1319
01:27:35,884 --> 01:27:37,851
( roars )

1320
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:56,436
( shell rattles )

1321
01:28:01,243 --> 01:28:02,943
( groaning )

1322
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:07,481
Andover:
Dylan.

1323
01:28:12,488 --> 01:28:15,322
Entity:
You want to see Kevin?

1324
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:42,015
( wails )

1325
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:43,417
( screams )

1326
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:46,553
( wails )

1327
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,527
No! Megan!

1328
01:28:53,529 --> 01:28:57,064
Stop! Get off me!

1329
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,902
There's nothing left to fear.

1330
01:29:05,474 --> 01:29:07,174
( screams )

1331
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:53,420
It's just us.

1332
01:29:53,422 --> 01:29:55,222
I know.

1333
01:29:56,658 --> 01:29:59,526
But it'll be back,

1334
01:29:59,528 --> 01:30:02,095
and it'll be stronger.

1335
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:04,464
Fear never dies.

1336
01:30:07,603 --> 01:30:10,437
It wanted you all along.

1337
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:11,838
Was my fault.

1338
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:16,943
I opened the door.

1339
01:30:22,284 --> 01:30:24,418
Then let's change the locks.

1340
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:29,623
Maybe it's time for one more
session, Doctor.

1341
01:30:31,627 --> 01:30:36,296
Dr. Andover:
Fear, it is relentless.

1342
01:30:36,298 --> 01:30:38,265
It needs to feed,

1343
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:41,468
and it won't be denied its
meals.

1344
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:45,472
After seeing what it did
to get to me,

1345
01:30:45,474 --> 01:30:49,476
my concern is that fear itself

1346
01:30:49,478 --> 01:30:53,480
will use me, my clinic,

1347
01:30:53,482 --> 01:30:55,615
and the chamber to feed,

1348
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:58,452
to-- to consume...

1349
01:31:00,155 --> 01:31:02,289
all of us.

1350
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:07,928
Now close your eyes.

1351
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:11,298
Concentrate on the sound
of my voice.

1352
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:27,013
( heavy metal playing )

1353
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:29,583
( distant screaming )

1354
01:31:47,202 --> 01:31:49,102
( evil laugh )

1355
01:31:49,104 --> 01:31:51,171
( screaming continues )

1356
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:58,178
( evil laugh )

1357
01:32:08,223 --> 01:32:09,956
¶ It's way past midnight ¶

1358
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:11,024
¶ There's a howling wind ¶

1359
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,493
¶ Oh, God, what can it be? ¶

1360
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:15,529
¶ Something out there evil ¶

1361
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:17,831
¶ Is coming straight for me ¶

1362
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:20,233
¶ The house is dark and very
cold ¶

1363
01:32:20,235 --> 01:32:22,335
¶ I know there's no one here ¶

1364
01:32:22,337 --> 01:32:24,504
¶ Why am I scared to death? ¶

1365
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:26,840
¶ Just petrified with fear ¶

1366
01:32:26,842 --> 01:32:28,074
¶ 'Cause I'm shaking,
and I'm thinking ¶

1367
01:32:28,076 --> 01:32:29,476
¶ Of something evil lurking ¶

1368
01:32:29,478 --> 01:32:31,378
¶ Waiting for me in the house ¶

1369
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:32,679
¶ 'Cause I'm shaking,
and I'm thinking ¶

1370
01:32:32,681 --> 01:32:33,914
¶ Of something evil lurking ¶

1371
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:36,016
¶ Waiting for me in the dark ¶

1372
01:32:36,018 --> 01:32:41,221
¶ The dark ¶

1373
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:46,092
( laughs )

1374
01:32:53,835 --> 01:32:56,436
¶ When I opened up the door
and snapped on the switch ¶

1375
01:32:56,438 --> 01:32:58,572
¶ The room was filled with light
¶

1376
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:01,074
¶ Then something black
and very fast ¶

1377
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:03,009
¶ Flit upon my sight ¶

1378
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:05,445
¶ What I feared most as a child
¶

1379
01:33:05,447 --> 01:33:07,914
¶ Was the coming of the night ¶

1380
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,849
¶ Now my horrors
have become quite real ¶

1381
01:33:09,851 --> 01:33:11,885
¶ My nightmares breathe new life
¶

1382
01:33:11,887 --> 01:33:13,520
¶ 'Cause I'm shaking,
and I'm thinking ¶

1383
01:33:13,522 --> 01:33:14,654
¶ Of something evil lurking ¶

1384
01:33:14,656 --> 01:33:16,690
¶ Waiting for me in the house ¶

1385
01:33:16,692 --> 01:33:17,991
¶ 'Cause I'm shaking,
and I'm thinking ¶

1386
01:33:17,993 --> 01:33:19,125
¶ Of something evil lurking ¶

1387
01:33:19,127 --> 01:33:21,494
¶ Waiting for me in the dark ¶

1388
01:33:22,698 --> 01:33:26,766
¶ Dark ¶

1389
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:32,305
¶ Yeah ¶

1390
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:25,759
¶ What is it in the house ¶

1391
01:34:25,761 --> 01:34:27,861
¶ That the darkness
brings to life? ¶

1392
01:34:27,863 --> 01:34:30,263
¶ I sense their eyes upon me ¶

1393
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:32,666
¶ As I grab a butcher knife ¶

1394
01:34:32,668 --> 01:34:34,934
¶ Whatever it is
that waits for me ¶

1395
01:34:34,936 --> 01:34:37,003
¶ It hides beneath my bed ¶

1396
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:39,372
¶ And if I try to sleep tonight
¶

1397
01:34:39,374 --> 01:34:41,641
¶ By morning, I'll be dead ¶

1398
01:34:41,643 --> 01:34:42,842
¶ 'Cause I'm shaking,
and I'm thinking ¶

1399
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:44,110
¶ Of something evil lurking ¶

1400
01:34:44,112 --> 01:34:45,979
¶ Waiting for me in the house ¶

1401
01:34:45,981 --> 01:34:47,180
¶ 'Cause I'm shaking,
and I'm thinking ¶

1402
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:48,515
¶ Of something evil lurking ¶

1403
01:34:48,517 --> 01:34:50,450

1404

¶ Waiting for me in the dark ¶

1410
01:35:02,631 --> 01:35:04,664
¶ Yeah ¶

1411
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:07,233
( vocalizing )

1412
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:14,340
¶ Yeah, 'cause I'm shaking,
and I'm thinking ¶

1413
01:35:14,342 --> 01:35:15,709
¶ Of something evil lurking ¶

1414
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:17,644

¶ Of something evil lurking ¶

1417
01:35:20,282 --> 01:35:22,549
¶ Waiting for me in the dark. ¶

1418
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:24,517
Dr. Andover:
Fear never dies.

1419
01:35:24,519 --> 01:35:25,985
( gasp echoes )
