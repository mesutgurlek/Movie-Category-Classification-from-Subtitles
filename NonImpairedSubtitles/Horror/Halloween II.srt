1
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,098
I want you to listen to me.
I want you to go out of the house
and down the street to the MacKenzies' house.

2
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,808
I want you to knock on their door.

3
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,061
I want you to tell them to call the police
and send'em over here.

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,437
All right?

5
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,356
Laurie. - Do as I say.
- Yeah.

6
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,401
Go.

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,757
Get help!

8
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:31,925
Come on!

9
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,385
Come on!

10
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,791
Oh, no.

11
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,802
Help!

12
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,795
It was the boogeyman.

13
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,718
As a matter of fact ...

14
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,136
it was.

15
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,569
What's going on out here?

16
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,695
Call the police!

17
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,447
Tell the sheriff I shot him!

18
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,072
Who?

19
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,659
Tell him he's still on the loose!
- Is this some kind of joke?

20
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,245
I've been trick-or-treated to death tonight!

21
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,581
You don't know what death is!

22
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,793
Trick or treat.

23
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,402
I shot him six times!

24
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,530
What?
- I shot him six times!

25
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,616
I ... I shot him in the heart and ...

26
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:14,411
He cannot get a very far, come on.
- I shot him six times!

27
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,787
This guy ...

28
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,624
he's not human!

29
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,483
Harold, you want mayonnaise on your sandwich?

30
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,823
How about mustard?

31
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:59,081
<i>Up next some more spine melting madness
"Night of the Living Dead"
- Are you asleep again?</i>

32
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,511
<i>This is a WWAR special bulletin ...</i>

33
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:18,600
<i>Police in Haddonfield have just made the grisly discovery

<i>Police are searching the entire area for a middle patient,

<i>He is now believed to be at large in Haddonfield.</i>

39
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,413
<i>This is Robert Mundy ... live.</i>

00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:49,256
<i>They're coming to get you Barbara.</i>

41
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,968
<i>You're ignorant.
- They're coming for you, Barbara.</i>

42
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,138
<i>Stop it. You're acting like a child.</i>

43

00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:58,682

45
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,642
<i>There comes one of them now.</i>

46
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,978
<i>She'll hear you.
Here he comes now.</i>

47
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,688
<i>I'm gettitng out of here.</i>

48
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,711
Mrs. Elrod?!

49
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,547
Mr. Elrod?

50
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,426
Are you ok?

51
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,607
Hi.

52
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,443
There was someone screaming next door.

53
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,071
Yeah, Mr. a Mrs. Elrod.

54
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,615
His wife's always picking on him.

55
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,952
He probably got angry and decided to start beating her.

56
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,206
Ok, deal.

57
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,749
<i>Are your folks home?</i>

58
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,793
They are gone.

59
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:12,798
My dad had to take my Aunt Ruby to Harden County
and my mother's decided to go along.

60
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,216
<i>Didn't you hear?</i>

61
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,634
Hear about what?

62
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,928
<i>Some girl got killed in Haddonfield.</i>

63
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,638
<i>It's on the radio.</i>

64
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,181
Hold on.

65
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,853
<i>... and the police have curtain off the entire area</i>

66

<i>Three teenagers have been found murdered

68
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,528
<i>The names of the teenagers have not been released ...
- I can't believe it.</i>

69
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:35,487
<i>I know.</i>

70
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,781
<i>You know we probably knew her.
- Where did it happen?</i>

71
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,408
<i>Down on Orange Grove.</i>

72
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,911
<i>That's right down the street.
- I know.</i>

73
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,499
<i>Police confirmed the girl was rescued that she ...
- Sally, I can hear the sirens coming.</i>

74
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,168
<i>They said the guy got away.</i>

75
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,211
<i>Do they know who it was?
- No.</i>

76
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,173
Oh, god.

77
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,425
<i>Alice?</i>

78
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:57,801
<i>Alice ...</i>

79
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,012
<i>Talk ...</i>

80
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,430

00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,603
<i>Alice? ... it's been set up on all ... 
- Where are you?
... the main streets in town.</i>

83
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:13,108
<i>Who is it?
Chief to the Haddonfield police department says.
He believe that suspect will be apprehended ...</i>

84
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,776
<i>within a matter of hours.</i>

85
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:20,908
<i>Neighboor say they heard scream during the early evening,
but activity a noise it's for usual haloween.</i>

86
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,016
I came out on the lawn.
I asked him what was going on.

87
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,809
He said ...
- Inside you guys.

88
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,728
He said he'd shot somebody.

89
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,593
All right folks. Give'em a room, please?

90
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,787
Laurie?

91
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,248
Can you hear me?
- Don't let them put me to sleep.

92
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:55,627
It's all right, take it easy. We're gonna go to clinic, all right?
- Don't let them put me to sleep. - It's ok.

93
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,470
Hey ...

94
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:06,305
you know this chick?

95
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,850
Yeh, her name's Laurie Strode.

96
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,768
She goes to school with my little brother Ziggy.

97
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,605
Her old man ... eh Strode Realty?
- Yeah.

98
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,814
Ook.

99
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,043
Ok, just get out easy.

100
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,336
It's gonna be ok.

101
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,421
Just walk real slow, ok?

102
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,466
Are you all right?
Are you all right, hon?

103
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,094
Oh, god.

104
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:52,017
Here. Just ... just put it up there real gently.
You ok? Let's go. Just walk real slow. Come on.

105
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:54,830
Fill out this form. Someone will be with you in a moment.
- Well, we should see the doctor right away.

106
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,583
He's with a patient. Would you please wait in room "A"?

107
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,626
Come on honey. Thank you.

108
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,463
Where's Doc. Mixter?

109
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,507
He's been at the country club. I think he's drunk.

110
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,842
Oh, great.

111
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,010
What've we got?

112
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:14,808
Stub wound, left anterior chest, possibly penetrating.
Multiple ... - It's Laurie Strode. Come on, let's go.
 ... fractured right ankle.

113
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,144
Janet, get me some more coffee.

114
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:18,770
Get that out of here.

115
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,108
Oh, Laurie.

116
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,693
Hi there.

117
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,946
Well let's see what we have here.

118
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,364
Ah yes ...

119
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,450
you lost a lot of blood.

120
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,869
We'll need to a type it.

121
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,959
When was the last time you had a tetatus shot?

122
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,711
I don't know.

123
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,093
Get me some ...

124
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,721
3.0 nylon on ...
- Cutting needle?

125
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,889
 - Yes.
- Right away.

126
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,058
We're going to have to put her out.
- No!

127
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,810
No, don't put me to sleep.
- Ok, relax.

128
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,270
Nylon's not gonna hurt you.

129
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,522
No.

130
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,609
Please don't put me to sleep.

131
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,279
Take it easy.

132
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,744
Try to relax, Laurie.

133
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,457
Doctor Mixter have you stitched up in no time.

134
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,709
Take it easy, Laurie.

135
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,880
Circle the block again.

136
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,591
How long now?

137
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,718
It's about 30 minutes. Put light down there.

138
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,470
There, by those trees.

139
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,514
There is nothing.

140
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,224
Well, keep going.

141
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,227
You know Doctor, I'm just about there.

142
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,186
What?

143
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,147
The point where I stop taking orders from you.

144
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:47,317
Alright sheriff whatever you want.

145
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,945
The primary concern is that we stop him.

146
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:51,697
You let him out.

147
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:54,449
I didn't.
- His own goddamn doctor.

148
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,451
I didn't let him out.

149
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,412
<i>Hey Brackett come in please...</i>

150
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,539
<i>Hey Brackett come in please ...</i>

151
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:01,456
Who is it?

152
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,208
<i>Geez, this is amsey.</i>

153
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,626
Say again, what is it?

154
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,794
<i>This is Ramsey.</i>

155
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,212
Where are you?

156
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:11,925
<i>I'm out by the bakery moving north on the Scottsville road.
- Get the hell back in the town.</i>

157
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,887
Go up 17th street, meet me by the bypass.

158
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,805
<i>10 - 4 Ramsey clear.</i>

159
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,308
Will you put that thing away!

160
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,604
You couldn't have shot him six times!

161
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,857
You think I'm lying, sherif.
- I think you missed him.

162
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:30,360
No man could take six shots.
- I've told you this isn't a man.

163
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:35,157
Look out! Slow down!
- Why? - Over there! Look, look, look!

164
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,161
Is that him?

165
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,496
I don't know.

166
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:43,582
Get back!

167
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,334
Run! Come on, run!

168
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,376
Loomis!

169
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,503
Get back!

170
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,380
Get back you kids!
- Loomis!

171
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,257
Stop! ... Get out!
- Loomis!

172
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:53,842
Loomis!

173
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:54,968
Stop!

174
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,388
Stop!

175
00:18:58,972 --> 00:18:59,890
Don't shoot!

176
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,601
Stop!
- Don't kill him!

177
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,073
Oh, sheriff Brackett.

178
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,409
He came out of nowhere.

179
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,911
I couldn't stop.

180
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,037
Is it him?!

181
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,877
Is it him or not!?

182
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:36,927
Leigh ...

183
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,514
We've been found three bodies.
- Where?

184
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,808
Across the street from the Doyle house.

185
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,393
Three kids ...

186
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,895
Leigh...
one of them was Annie!

187
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,063
What?

188
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,450
Does it hurt a lot?

189
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,536
What?

190
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:08,333
Oh sweetie, I can't understand you. Look, it'll be ok.
We'll play some games tonight and ...

191
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,669
<i>Repeating for those of you who just tuned in.</i>

192
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,671
<i>Three people are dead tonight ...</i>

193
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:16,008
<i>as a resolve an attack by an escaped mental patient.</i>

194
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,802
<i>I understand we're going to stay on the air now?</i>

195
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,388
<i>Repeating for those of you who just tuned in.</i>

196
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,390
<i>Three people are dead tonight ...</i>

197
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,727
<i>as a resolve an attack by an escaped mental patient.</i>

198
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,814
<i>Any further details will be report coming
as soon as we get them.</i>

199
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,858
<i>This is Robert Munday ...</i>

200
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,610
<i>reporting you live.</i>

201
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,559
Hi ...

202
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,728
Hi.

203
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:12,523
Jimmy ...

204
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,026
Oh, how are you feeling?

205
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,529
Sore.

206
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,949
What happened?

207
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,283
Cracked the bone.

208
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,202
Lucky it wasn't a break.

209
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:29,289
Doctor Mixter felt that he should wait untill tomorrow,
before he put cast on.

210
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:30,999
You have to get some rest.

211
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,086
Come on, Jimmy.

212
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,389
Can I get you something to drink or anything?

213
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,683
How about a coke?

214
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,309
Ok.

215
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,019
Thanks.

216
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,229
Ok.

217
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:52,855
Come on!

218
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,524
Jimmy, we've got to roll. Another call came in.
- Ok.

219
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,234
I'll get you that coke later.

220
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:58,986
Out.

221
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,993
Moments ago police reported that Michael Myers,
formerly of Haddonfield,

222
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:11,165
who fled the Smith's Grove Warren county Sanitarium
last night was believed to have burned to death.

223
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:15,752
Meanwhile, three bodies were discovered
in the upstairs bedroom of the house directly behind me.

224
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:19,423
Identification of the victims is being witheld.
Pending notification of their families ...

225
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,217
Forget that. forget that.
I wanna concentrate on that house.

226
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,137
Talk to some kids. See if anybody saw anything.

227
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:30,392
You need the parent's permission to use a statement.
If you can't find the parents, get a statement anyway.

228
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:33,687
Not now ...

229
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,069
Give us a minute, fellas.

230
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,060
I .. uh

231
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:19,900
have to ... go and tell my wife,
before somebody else does.

232
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,654
Go on home, Leigh.

233
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,156
Go on home, I'll take care of everything.

234
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:32,037
Damn you! - I'm sorrry. -What have you done?
- I haven't done anything. - YOU LET HIM OUT!

235
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:35,582
I didn't let him out.
I gave orders for him to be restrained.

236
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,419
Now is there anything else, that we can do for you?

237
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,590
If that wasn't Michael Myers burning up in that car ...

238
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:47,261
then lot of other kids are gonna be slaugtered tonight.
- He's dead.

239
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,513
I saw him.
- You saw man at the mask.

240
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:54,977
It was him. - I wanna believe you,
but I gotta be sure.
I can't stop, untill I'm certain it's dead.

241
00:23:55,143 --> 00:24:01,149
You talk about him like he's some kind of animal.
- He was my ... - Would you keep it back?!
He was my patient for fifteen years ...

242
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:07,114
He became an obsession with me, until I realized,
that there was nothing within.
Neither consciance nor reason that was ...

243
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,700
even remotely human.

244
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:15,164
An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him
and he just got up and walked away.

245
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:19,918
I am talking about the real possibility,
that he is STILL OUT THERE!

246
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,588
Where'd they take the body?

247
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,131
The Coroner's office.

248
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,842
Get a dentist to meet me there in half an hour.

249
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:43,358
<i>Despite the fact that the man, who rescued Laurie Strode,
claims to have shot him six times at close range.</i>

250
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,904
<i>Haddonfield police have no explanation
for the suspect's disappearance ...</i>

251
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:51,992
<i>But say they're confident, he will be captured soon.
- I cannot believe it.
Paramedics are now removing the last of the bodies.</i>

252
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:55,996
Pin the tail on the donkey and bobbing for apples.
Actually bobbing for water. No less.

253
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:02,461
Well you gotta use water to see if you don't ...
- I am never going to another halloween party
as long as I live. Especially not at Stevie Mather's house.

254
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,171
And of course now I'm gonna be late.

255
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,173
Oh, you gotta drive me home first.

256
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,967
Oh Darcy, I don't have time.
- You've got to.

257
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,137
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?

258
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,056
He's in Russelville.

259
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:19,686
It's five minutes to your house another five minutes
back to the hospital. Mrs. Alves's gonna kill me.

260
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,189
You promised me.

261
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,568
I know I did.

262
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,468
<i>One survivor ...</i>

263
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:57,015
<i>17- year  old Laurie Strode was found directly across
the street from the home, where the murders took place.</i>

264
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,479
<i>The teenager was taken across town to
Haddonfield Memorial Clinic. Paramedics on the scene ...</i>

265
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:29,316
<i>In of aftermath of the killings the streets between
Chestnut and tenth third jamed with people and ... cars.</i>

266
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:30,943
<i>Repeating ...</i>

267
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:36,156
<i>that a ... These streets a Chestnut and tenth
there are just jamed with both people ...</i>

268
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,534
Well, I sure could go for a pizza now.

269
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:42,704
Nice be with sausage, onions, peppers ...

270
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,791
But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.

271
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:51,630
<i>The names of young victims are not yet released,
but people would probably recognized,
that is neighbourhood teenagers.</i>

272
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:54,007
Looks like a goddamn homecoming.

273
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,137
<i>Now ...</i>

274
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,055
<i>back ...</i>

275
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,807
<i>to Dementia ...</i>

276
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,005
Thanks, Mr. Garret.

277
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,263
Julie saw him you know.

278
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:43,473
Who?

279
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,559
Michael Myers.

280
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:46,852
Come on.

281
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,104
I swear. Yesterday, when she was coming to work.

282
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,731
Where did she see him?

283
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,859
Near the shop and bag out by the mall.

284
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,069
Well, she stopped at the light ...

285
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:59,531
and saw him walk in that field
behind the Lost River Dive in.

286
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,369
Julie said he was so creepy.
- Julie's full of shit.

287
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,580
He didn't escape until last night.

288
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,667
Well you don't have to swear, Budd.

289
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,920
She's a goddamn moron anyway.

290
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:16,340
Every other word you say is either hell or shit or damn.

291
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:18,634
I'm sorry.

292
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,261
I guess I just fuck up all the time.

293
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,525
Hi.

294
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:38,529
Hey, you're here.

295
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:39,238
Hi.

296
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,197
You're late.

297
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,866
Yea I know, I've got to get on the ward.

298
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:44,326
Hi. Jimmy.

299
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,328
Oh, hi. Karen.

300
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,501
Come on.

301
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,670
See you later.

302
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:55,629
Great.

303
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,135
* Amazing grace ... *

304
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:05,013
* come sit on my face *

305
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,850
* Don't make me cry ... *

306
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:09,852
* I need your pie *

307
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,937
Look, why don't you just shut up, all right?

308
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:14,022
What do you all worked up about?

309
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,357
Look it could be Ziggy, you know?

310
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,860
It could've been your brother Mark,
we pulled out of there.

311
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,778
All right, so what do you want me to do?

312
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:21,446
Look Jimmy ...

313
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,366
Rule number one: never get involved with a patient.

314
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:25,909
Nurses ...

315
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,661
that's another story.

316
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,414
But patients is no good. It never works out.

317
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:33,625
Where you going college boy?

318
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,044
I'm telling you, listen to old Budd.

319
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,991
You were late again tonight.

320
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:51,829
Just fifteen minutes.

321
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:55,207
That could be the difference
between life and death for one of those kids.

322
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,003
You're right. I'm sorry Mrs. Alves.
- I don't wanna hear any excuses.

323
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,880
You're a good nurse Karen.

324
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:02,881
I'd hate to loose you.

325
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,842
But you've got to learn to be on time.

326
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:06,552
Now. Let's get over this list.

327
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:09,596
I'll be fine, really. I'm sorry. I promise.
- Ok..

328
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:12,182
Carr ...

329
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,476
Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tommorow morning.

330
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:15,644
God, they should have ...

331
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,771
They should have handled him more carefully.

332
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:19,690
Who?

333
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,693
Michael Myers.

334
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,321
Michael Myers?

335
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:28,365
Yea, he ...

336
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,825
He was that guy, that was after you.

337
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,414
You mean the Myers house?

338
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,587
That little kid who killed his sister?
- Yea.

339
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,134
But he's in a hospital somewhere.

340
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,052
He escaped last night.

341
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,429
How do you know?

342
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:52,472
It's all over the radio.

343
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,766
Television too. It's on right now.

344
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:01,982
Why me?

345
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,153
I mean, why me?

346
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,282
Times up Jimmy.

347
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:12,284
Let's go.

348
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,452
OK. ok.

349
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:19,958
No you won't!

350
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,169
Visiting hours are definitely over.

351
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,759
Men ... you can't live with'em,
you can't live without'em.

352
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,303
How's that shoulder feel?

353
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,347
A little better.

354
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:34,598
Good.

355
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,392
We've been trying to get ahold of your parents.

356
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:42,606
Dr. Mixter told me, they were at the same party he was,
but they're not there now and they're not at home.

357
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,983
Do you have any idea of where else they might be?

358
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:47,319
No.

359
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,072
I'll just keep trying.

360
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:01,917
Oh, this is just ...

361
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:04,670
Janet?

362
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,174
Yes Mrs. Alves.

363
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,552
Go tell Mr. Garrett, we're having trouble with the phones.

364
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:12,886
Right now.

365
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:15,681
He's at the other end of the hall.
- Janet.

366
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:18,267
Yes, Mrs. Alves.

367
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,771
What's wrong with the phones?

368
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:26,650
Nothing for you to worry about.

369
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,027
Just get some rest right now.

370
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,864
I'll let you know as soon as we get ahold of your parents.

371
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:02,352
I'm gonna go check the phone.

372
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,063
You wait here and I'll call you.
- I have to get back on the floor!

373
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:09,067
It'll take me five minutes.
- But I don't even know, how to use this thing!

374
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:12,918
<i>I think somebody broke into the store room.
The lock was off.</i>

375
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:18,674
Mr. Garrett?

376
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,176
I can't hear you.

377
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:26,515
One of you had better drive down
to the sherif's station right away.

378
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:34,815
Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing?

379
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,983
Janet!

380
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,387
Mr. Garrett.

381
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,031
Mr. Garrett?

382
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:12,496
Mr. Garrett ... I gotta get back on the floor.

383
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:16,917
Hello?

384
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,476
It's difficult.

385
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,895
Even the gums are charred but ...

386
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:38,230
... look here.

387
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,066
See here?

388
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:42,860
No fillings.

389
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,405
He's young. Maybe seventeen, maybe eighteen.

390
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:48,448
Michael Myers is 21.

391
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:52,077
Positive ID means we check x-rays and dental records.

392
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,620
That'll take hours!

393
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:57,082
No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.
- We haven't got hours.

394
00:40:57,207 --> 00:41:00,794
Listen to me. We've got to assume,
that Michael Myers is still alive.

395
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,009
Everybody goes back out.

396
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,302
But we just closed it up.

397
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:11,555
I want to sweep from Chestnut South to the bypass.

398
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,764
I want every street ...

399
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,141
every house ...

400
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:16,476
every backyard.

401
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,103
Ok.

402
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:19,646
You've got it.

403
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:25,402
Thank you.

404
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:41,752
All right, that's enough. That's enough!
Now come on, get out of here. You guys, go home.
Michael Myers not here.

405
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:56,183
This is Hunt in another vehicle.
The old Myers house 45 Lampkin Ln. - The tribe.

406
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:59,603
One of their number was butchered, this is a wake.

407
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:08,445
Heightens my sense of security.

408
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,710
All right. Knock it off!

409
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:27,047
Come on folks, go home.

410
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:29,550
Knock it off!!!

411
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:33,637
Empty.

412
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,723
Plus we've covered the whole east end of town.
There's nothing.

413
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:37,850
Check it again.

414
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:39,518
He just isn't here.

415
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:41,019
CHECK IT again!

416
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:43,981
You know.

417
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:47,276
Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight.

418
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:48,485
The only a ...

419
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,571
gunshot you ever heard

420
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,282
were start tracking for the local highschool.

421
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,702
Yet one night in 1963 Michael Myers ...

422
00:42:57,161 --> 00:43:00,539
did murder his sister
in that upstairs bedroom with a large ...

423
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:02,082
butcher knife.

424
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:03,834
I remember.

425
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:06,837
On halloween.
- I was sixteen years old.
