1
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:09,315
Leave me alone...
please.

2
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:13,244
Stop!

3
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:20,106
In time of mourning.

4
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,108
we find comfort

5
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:24,770
in the words
of the psalmists.

6
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:29,248
The Psalm of David.
the 23rd...

7
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:32,718
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want.

8
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,186
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures:

9
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:38,713
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

10
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:41,056
He restoreth my soul:

11
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,688
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness

12
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,664
for His Name's sake.

13
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,896
Yea. Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death.

14
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,698
I will fear no evil:

15
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,932
for Thou art with me:

16
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:57,376
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me.

17
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,378
Thou preparest
a table before me

18
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,505
in the presence
of mine enemies:

19
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,516
Thou anointest
my head with oil:

20
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,917
My cup runneth over.

21
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:10,548
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow thee all the days...

22
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:19,192
It's gonna rain.
Maybe we should just go home.

23
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:23,259
The reception is inside. I don't think
weather's gonna be a factor.

24
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:26,795
Yeah. It's just seeing
everyone after so long...

25
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,867
curious Kira...

26
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,538
I said. "Well. Something's
wrong with that guy. "

27
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,949
But you guys were friends.
They need you.

28
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:40,384
That's what matters.

29
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,140
I guess you should
go talk to her.

30
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:12,413
We should talk
to her.

31
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:14,920
Kira.

32
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:24,053
Well. Uh...

33
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:25,997
no sign of Sid...
not surprising.

34
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:27,556
Maybe something came up.

35
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,125
Yeah. Kinko's must be
really busy tonight.

36
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,139
So he doesn't have
some big law-firm job.

37
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:35,971
- He's our friend.
- Ah. Sid.

38
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:39,774
- Sid.
- Mm.

39
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,475
Hi. Sorry I missed
Dev's funeral.

40
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,380
It was crazy
at work.

41
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,544
We're just glad
you could make it.

42
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:50,283
- Thanks. Man. Miss Mitchel.
- Nice to see you. Sid.

43
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,814
How are you?

44
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,952
Hmm?

45
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:56,962
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

46
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:58,657
Where were you?

47
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,131
You know...

48
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,861
I'm gonna go.

49
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:04,131
Why?!

50
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,400
I just... I just
don't feel comfortable.

51
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,532
- Okay. Uh. Let me say goodbye and...
- No no no.

52
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:10,543
Listen. I want
you to stay.

53
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:13,774
They're your friends.
They need you. But uh...

54
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,781
- Are you sure?
- Yeah yeah...

55
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:18,477
- I'm fine.
- Okay. Won't be long.

56
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:20,645
Okay.
Love you.

57
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,247
Love you too.

58
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:30,386
- Hey.
- Hey. How have you been?

59
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,126
- Good.
- Nice to see you. Hello.

60
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,963
It's good
to see you guys.

61
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,873
You know. I really miss hanging out
together. Having a few drinks...

62
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:48,904
That's 'cause everyone
picked up your bill.

63
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:51,212
I could've claimed you
as a dependent in college.

64
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,743
I'm just saying we took care
of each other then.

65
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:57,052
And then we didn't.

66
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,820
Come on. Guys.
college doesn't last forever.

67
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,157
- You're free to get married.
- You hear that. Kira?

68
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:05,096
- We're free to get married.
- I'll keep that in mind.

69
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:07,656
Okay. Ahem.
Who's taking me home?

70
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,429
Home?
It's like 8:00.

71
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:12,632
It's 11:00. I've got work tomorrow.
Anyways. This place is closing.

72
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,867
All right. How about we go
someplace else?

73
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,376
- A bar?
- How about a cemetery?

74
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,436
Mm-hmm. Did I mention
I have work tomorrow?

75
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,040
No. Serious. Guys. I mean.
since I missed Dev's funeral.

76
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,573
I thought it would be cool
if we went back. You know... together.

77
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:27,848
- Mm-hmm.
- Kira?

78
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:30,947
I don't know.
It's cold and about to rain.

79
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,187
And a cemetery...
isn't that a little weird?

80
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:36,718
No. What's weird
is we haven't been

81
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,459
in the same room together for years
and the best we can do for Dev

82
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,694
- Is to have a few drinks.
- Sid?

83
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,395
You know what?
I didn't miss Dev's funeral

84
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,734
because of work.
I just didn't go.

85
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:48,673
You think Dev would've wanted us
sitting around. Crying over him

86
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,733
- Like this?
- What do you want us to do?

87
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:52,438
Say goodbye together.

88
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:54,207
We did that...
it's called a funeral.

89
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:55,908
I won't expect you
to understand.

90
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,816
Guess I'll see you guys
the next time one of us dies.

91
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,868
I didn't do anything.
I swear.

92
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,870
- Harris?
- Yeah.

93
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,599
- Hi. Sid.
- What are you guys doing here?

94
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,402
We're doing what you said...
saying goodbye.

95
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,909
Well. Let's celebrate.

96
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:33,913
I got strawberry.

97
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:37,007
That's what we were
afraid of... champagne.

98
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,847
All right. Let's go.

99
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,492
To Devin.

100
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:58,402
You'll always be with us. Dev.
We love you.

101
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,463
Rest in peace. Dev.

102
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:11,881
. ' A shadow sits
upon your... '

103
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:15,376
. ' Peace of mind... '

104
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,584
Whoa-whoa. Easy.

105
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:22,651
Slow down there. Man.
you're gonna feel like shit tomorrow.

106
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,599
If I don't take a walk.
I'm gonna pass out.

107
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:33,297
- Wanna come?
- Yeah.

108
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:55,985
Oh-hh. look.
someone left you a card.

109
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,997
Do you mind
if I read it?

110
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,197
Allison? No. She-she...
she's good.

111
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:09,333
She supports me.
We have goals.

112
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,242
We're even taking it
to the next step.

113
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,304
The next...

114
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,112
Jesus. Harris Mitchel's
gonna be a dad.

115
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:22,178
Well. Not yet. But we're. Uh...
we're trying.

116
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:26,055
- That's the best part. Right?
- Mm.

117
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:30,255
Uh. So...

118
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:33,288
does your wife
still hate me?

119
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:35,800
She doesn't hate you.
She's scared of you.

120
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:38,861
- She doesn't hate you.
- Scared of what?

121
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,998
Well.

122
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,009
maybe she thinks we got something
going on we don't.

123
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,806
Do we?

124
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,778
- Why aren't you stopping me?
- Why aren't you stopping me?

125
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,414
Hey. Where are
you guys?

126
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,955
Oh. Hey.
There you are.

127
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:03,484
So. Guys. Check this out.
I'm hanging out with Dev

128
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,929
and I find this card
on his tombstone. Right?

129
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,525
and I'm... and I'm reading it
and I'm like.

130
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:11,332
"Damn. This is so what
we're about tonight!"

131
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,602
You know. What we're
doing here.

132
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:21,009
Oh God. You're gonna
break your neck.

133
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:23,481
Right.
So without further ado.

134
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,541
I'd like to read
a few words for Devin

135
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:28,679
and all the other dead people out there
tonight.

136
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:33,385
"O joyful. O delighted.
O fortunate one!

137
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:36,395
Weep no more
this departed son.

138
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:40,525
Read these words
and sound thy voice.

139
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:44,696
Revel and sing!
Rejoice! Rejoice!

140
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,934
Life's for the living.
not the dead.

141
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:51,432
Forget tomorrow.
live now instead.

142
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:54,640
This night you breathe.
while they cannot.

143
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,878
So dance ye soul
on their resting spot. "

144
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:02,448
Who's sent that?

145
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:03,512
It doesn't say.

146
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:06,184
Boy. Dance on
their resting spot?

147
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:09,285
- Whoo-whoo!
- Dance on their resting spot.

148
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:12,422
Whatever. Man.
I'm saying it's about living for today.

149
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:15,059
You can't dance
on someone's grave.

150
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,365
Don't listen to him.
I think it's cool.

151
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,566
"Rejoice!
Rejoice!

00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,089
. ' I wanna take a ride. '

159
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,492
- . ' To the other side... '
- Whoo!

160
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:45,053
. ' The other side of town.
no need to slow down. '

161
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:48,362
. ' Then I wake up
and I'm all right. '

162
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:51,131
. ' I was out on her bed.
I said. '

163
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,901
- . ' Ooh. Baby. I thought I was dead... '
- Yeah!

164
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:57,432
Whoo-whoo.

165
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,712
Whoo!

166
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:27,704
Come on. Wake up!

167
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,535
Glad I didn't
wait up.

168
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:00,027
I'm sorry... started talking
about work. Life. Death.

169
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:02,040
old times.

170
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,904
Mm.

171
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:07,105
The usual topics
after too much wine.

172
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:09,671
Way too much.
You know what?

173
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,410
I think I'm gonna
skip work today.

174
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,418
You sure they'll be able
to practice law?

175
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:15,682
You haven't missed a day
since you've been there.

176
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:17,416
I'm sure they'll
do just fine.

177
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:21,685
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

178
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:40,274
Oh. Good morning.
Sammy.

179
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:42,975
You hungry?
Let's go eat.

180
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:48,948
What is it. What is it?

181
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,488
Tsk-tsk.

182
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,021
Sammy.

183
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,816
Hello?

184
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,798
Hello?

185
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,878
I submitted that
evidence two weeks ago

186
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,712
through
Judge Wayan.

187
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,379
Yes yes. Yes.

188
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:57,379
I'll be right there.

189
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,684
Did you. Uh.
call what's-his-name?

190
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:07,256
Yesterday. He said it's an old house
with old pipes.

191
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,927
- Then since it's not an emergency...
- Blah blah blah.

192
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:12,802
- Blah blah blah.
- Love you.

193
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,203
- Love you too.
- See you.

194
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,231
Bye.

195
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:53,907
- Ahem.
- Hi. This is Kira. You know what to do.

196
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,005
Kira. It's Harris
calling you back.

197
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:58,209
Everything is okay.

198
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,241
Bye.

199
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,476
Hello?

200
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,898
Harris?

201
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:59,594
Harris?

202
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:31,833
Harris?!

203
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:35,767
Harris?!

204
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:39,738
Harris?

205
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:53,421
- Did you hear her?
- Who?

206
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,156
I feel like I'm
losing my mind.

207
00:21:58,197 --> 00:21:59,755
Baby. What's wrong?

208
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:02,062
What happened
that night...

209
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,069
after I left
the funeral?

210
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,832
I told you... we sat around
and talked.

211
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:08,271
So nothing happened
between you and Kira?

212
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,605
Me and Kira?
No!

213
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:13,339
You know what? She's been calling
ever since that night.

214
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:15,677
I see her name on the caller ID
and when I answer.

215
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:17,409
- She hangs up.
- Maybe something is wrong.

216
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:20,748
Of course there's something wrong...
she's back in our life again!

217
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:22,344
Listen to me.
She's been calling me too.

218
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:24,413
I haven't seen or heard
from her since the funeral.

219
00:22:24,456 --> 00:22:27,186
You've been acting strange
since then too.

220
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:30,627
And then all this... all this stuff
around the house started happening.

221
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:34,064
- The pipes?
- No. Other things... the doors.

222
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,897
There's tapping.

223
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:40,530
And... and then
there's voices.

224
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:42,631
I just don't feel safe.

225
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,666
Oh. Baby.

226
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,014
When did you
learn Chopin. Hon?

227
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,318
Great.

228
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:59,836
- Hi. Honey.
- Hey.

229
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:01,937
Oh. How's
the alarm going?

230
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,948
It's finished.

231
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:06,610
- Looks good.
- Yeah.

232
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,779
Where are you going?

233
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,444
The cat's talking.

234
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,252
Harris?

235
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:38,997
He said he loved me.

236
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,867
He said he loved me.

237
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,444
He said...

238
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,280
he said he loved me!

239
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,651
Harris?!

240
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:05,560
- Harris. She's in our room.
- Who?

241
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:07,792
- I don't know. I don't know... come on!
- No.

242
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,633
- Please please. I'm scared.
- No.

243
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:31,786
Harris?!

244
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:58,983
Drop it!
Drop the weapon!

245
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:04,284
Maybe she got in
before we went to bed.

246
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:06,187
How? The whole
house was locked

247
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:08,488
and we were home
all night.

248
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:12,195
Where is she?
Did you find her?

249
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,857
Uh. No. Ma'am.
we didn't find anyone.

250
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:15,628
The alarm was tripped
in the living room.

251
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,464
but I didn't see any sign
of forced entry.

252
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:20,027
Well. She got in
somehow.

253
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:22,540
Has everything been all right here
tonight. Ma'am?

254
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:24,633
Thank you for your time.
Officer.

255
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,337
Good night.

256
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:31,813
- I told you... she's doing it again.
- Kira is not stalking us.

257
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,408
You don't seem
too convinced I'm wrong.

258
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:35,682
Why would she?
What she did before was different.

259
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,484
She followed you around.
She showed up at your office.

260
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:41,754
- She called us at all hours.
- It was right before our wedding.

261
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:43,624
- It was a hard time for her.
- Bullshit.

262
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:45,994
You know what?
You didn't believe me then either.

263
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:48,056
All right.
I'll call her tomorrow.

264
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,933
I refuse to live like this.
We're gonna sort this out... tonight!

265
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,513
Kira?

266
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:12,720
Whoa. What are you doing?

267
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:14,952
- You can't break in there.
- Why not?

268
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:17,518
She does it to us.

269
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:21,123
- Where are you going?
- I'm trying the back.

270
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:27,705
Kira?

271
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:32,607
God. It is cold
in here.

272
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:39,680
- Get a flashlight.
- Okay.

273
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:47,557
Harris.

274
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:21,682
What is it?

275
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:32,768
I don't know.
It's writing.

276
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:51,786
- Oh my God!
- Don't don't. Call 911!

277
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,791
Ha... Harris.

278
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,900
Kira?

279
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:56,086
Dr. Travis. You have
a visitor in the main lobby.

280
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:59,090
Dr. Travis... a visitor
in the main lobby.

281
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:00,716
Kira Hayden.

282
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:10,160
We're friends.
We found her.

283
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:13,796
- Has her family been contacted?
- Is she all right?

284
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,863
I'm waiting on the results
of a couple of tests.

285
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,875
but uh. She should be.

286
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:22,278
Those markings all over her...
what were those?

287
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:24,908
Teeth marks.

288
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:28,009
- God.
- Someone bit her?

289
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:31,318
And there's also some bleeding
indicating a possible...

290
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,347
sexual assault.

291
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:40,730
- Can I see her?
- Sorry. I'm limiting contact

292
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:42,494
pending a full
psych evaluation.

293
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:47,067
If there's any changes.
I'll let you know.

294
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,104
I'm sorry. Harris.

295
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:57,171
Oh. Well. Good news is
she's not stalking you.

296
00:33:58,316 --> 00:34:00,511
You know what?
That's not fair.

297
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:03,453
I know. Sorry.
I'm gonna give Sid a call.

298
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:20,032
- Hello.
- Uh. Hi.

299
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:24,007
- Is this Sid Vance's number?
- Yeah. Hold on.

300
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:26,374
Okay.

301
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:47,190
Oh...

302
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:50,133
hey...

303
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:52,830
oh...

304
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:03,010
- Sid.
- Hey. Man.

305
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:04,742
- Who was that?
- I can't talk right now.

306
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:07,377
but you gotta come over and check
this out. You're not gonna believe

307
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:09,410
- What's happening.
- Sid. Slow down.

308
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:22,489
Hey.

309
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:48,291
Doctor?!

310
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,027
I need a doctor!

311
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:55,032
Somebody help
this person!

312
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,069
Help me!

313
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:07,168
There was somebody there!
Oh. God!

314
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,806
There was
somebody there!

315
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:14,919
Let's go.

316
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:40,876
- Hey. You guys made it.
- What's going on?

317
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:43,210
You gotta come check this out.
but be careful when you come in...

318
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:45,512
- The thermal sensors are on.
- Thermal sensors?

319
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,251
I think I'm
being haunted.

320
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:01,163
Well. I would not go
that far. Mr. Vance.

321
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,260
Haunting requires some level
of paranormal activity.

322
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:07,328
- Yeah. Uh. Sid...
- Who are these people?

323
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:10,967
- Who are you?
- Vincent Cochet. And who are you?

324
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:12,943
These are my friends
Harris and Allison.

325
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:16,003
Thank you.
And this is my assistant...

326
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:19,949
- Colleague.
- Frances Culpepper.

327
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:23,147
- They're ghost hunters.
- Paranormal investigators.

328
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:27,453
We are from the Parapsychology
Department at Madison College.

329
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:30,791
Mr. Vance answered
my advertising

330
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:34,958
offering a reward to anyone
experiencing a paranormal phenomena...

331
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:36,762
which we have yet
to see.

332
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,395
- I got your phenomena.
- Hey!

333
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:41,632
What makes you think
you're being haunted?

334
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:43,732
Some weird shit's
been happening to me. Man.

335
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:47,142
I hear noises and footsteps
and there's these little fires.

336
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:49,237
Listen. We have
been here 10 hours

337
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,976
and the scariest thing
we've seen is your bathroom.

338
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:54,382
Well. Maybe that's because
you don't know what you're doing.

339
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:57,013
Or maybe we are investigating
the claims of someone

340
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:00,388
whose biggest decision of the day is
whether to get drunk or stoned.

341
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:02,518
Hey. Why don't you read
between the lines?

342
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,323
Okay okay okay.

343
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:07,798
can we please maintain some level
of scientific environment here?

344
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:10,767
- These two have been at it all day.
- That's long enough.

345
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:13,930
- We are gone.
- I think it's happening to us too.

346
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:18,375
I mean.

347
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:20,468
I think
we're being haunted.

348
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:31,881
I'm Vincent Cochet.
paranormal investigator.

349
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:34,255
Hello.

350
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:36,419
Do you remember

351
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:39,555
when you first noticed
the activities?

352
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:42,566
Maybe three weeks ago.

353
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,227
Go on.

354
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:46,327
It started
with noises...

355
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:49,272
thumping. Scratching.

356
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:50,740
I thought it was
the pipes.

357
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:54,211
But then tonight a woman
broke into our house.

358
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:57,043
I thought it was Kira.
but when I saw her tonight.

359
00:38:57,081 --> 00:39:00,778
I knew it wasn't her.
But there was a woman in the room.

360
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:03,048
I'm not sure
if you are aware.

361
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,282
but your time frame
coincides with Mr. Vance's

362
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:07,757
first claim
of activities. Huh?

363
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:12,187
- Did you see each other at the time?
- Yeah. Uh...

364
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,891
a friend died
in a car accident.

365
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,297
- We saw each other at the funeral.
- You didn't tell me

366
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:19,269
- You went to a funeral. Mr. Vance.
- I told her.

367
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:20,463
You told me
that you went to a cemetery.

368
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:22,063
You didn't say anything
about a funeral.

369
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:24,006
'Cause I didn't go
to the funeral.

370
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,567
I met them at the reception
and then later we went back.

371
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:29,171
- Back where?
- The cemetery.

372
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:33,883
- At night?
- Mm-hmm. What?

373
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:36,216
Just weird. That's all.

374
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:39,815
Did your friend Kira
also go back to the cemetery?

375
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:41,791
Yeah. She was there.

376
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:44,693
- Did something happen?
- No.

377
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:49,725
- I think we should tell him.
- Tell us what?

378
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:51,667
Yeah. Tell us what?

379
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:54,399
Look. Sid got drunk
and pissed on a grave.

380
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:56,168
Well. Yeah.
but that's not it.

381
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:58,141
We also sort
of danced.

382
00:39:58,176 --> 00:40:00,440
You what?

383
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:02,776
You know.
danced on some graves.

384
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:06,306
Wait... I'm sorry.
you danced on graves?

385
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,318
Sid found a card
about dancing

386
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:10,946
and. Yes. We danced
on graves... big deal.

387
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:12,512
What card?
Do you still have it?

388
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:14,855
I don't even remember
getting home that night.

389
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:18,191
I'm not sure if you are aware
of the possible ramifications of...

390
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:19,696
We didn't do anything.

391
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:22,359
Yeah. You did... it's called
burial desecration.

392
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,799
Yes.

393
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:29,332
Get the camera.

394
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:31,637
Hey. Check this out.

395
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:48,724
Hasn't done that
before.

396
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,751
2:10 a. M...

397
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:53,195
Mr. Vance's apartment.

398
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:57,099
witnessing what I suspect
to be a low level

399
00:40:57,135 --> 00:40:59,126
of a spectral
manifestation

400
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,832
of a child's
burning footprints.

401
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:04,603
It's not spectral.

402
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:10,346
Is this reward
cash or check?

403
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,553
I spoke to the nurse
at the hospital.

404
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:22,821
She said she's keeping
an eye on Kira.

405
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,226
- The best place for her.
- Yeah.

406
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:27,595
I just hope these people
from the college can help.

407
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:30,430
They said
they were experts.

408
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:32,993
And did you guys see
all that equipment?

409
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:37,531
- And besides they...
- Have a really creepy house.

410
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:48,845
- I'm Vincent Cochet.
- Nice to meet you.

411
00:41:48,886 --> 00:41:51,878
- Oh. Hello.
- Nice house.

412
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:55,051
Thank you. It was left by
a wealthy alumnus

413
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:58,255
who committed his life
to parapsychology study.

414
00:41:58,296 --> 00:42:00,161
We're being taped?

415
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:02,496
Experiments are conducted
throughout the house...

416
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:04,797
- In case anything happens.
- "Happens"?

417
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:09,231
Evidence of the paranormal
is the Holy Grail.

418
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:10,934
Please.

419
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:20,740
So its origin
is not clear.

420
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:24,448
but the verse was obviously intended
as a celebration of life.

421
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:26,080
By dancing on graves?

422
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:28,921
It's a common practice
amongst pagan religions:

423
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,794
Druidism. Satanism. Wicca.
They sort of all embrace

424
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,889
this "live-for-the-moment" philosophy.

425
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:37,662
What has us concerned
is the following verse.

426
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:40,034
Uh. The gravedancers'
lament.

427
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:46,207
"O Fool. O Lout.
O Unfortunate one.

428
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:48,405
The dead now mocked.
their time has come.

429
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:52,177
Heed these words
for souls do roam

430
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:54,343
And though be dead
follow you home.

431
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:58,515
Its rage will swell
as nights grow bright.

432
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:01,252
Despair and fear.
this fatal plight.

433
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:04,489
From moon to moon.
you'll have this guest

434
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:08,191
To seal thy fate
and lay you at rest. "

435
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,170
Scary. Huh?

436
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,501
What you found. My friend.
wasn't a simple rhyme celebrating life.

437
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:21,602
It was a spell.
a curse.

438
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:24,206
How does a curse get
on a bereavement card?

439
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:27,046
Well. Dangerous occult
mediums are fairly commonplace...

440
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,951
tarot cards. Ouija boards.
that sort of thing.

441
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:31,852
Sounds like
a lawsuit to me.

442
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:35,484
You're shitting me? By dancing on
a grave... what? We pissed off a ghost?

443
00:43:35,526 --> 00:43:38,359
Three...
one for each grave.

444
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:44,292
How do we end it? There's gotta be a
gravedancers' cure or something. Right?

445
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:51,541
No... none that
we are aware of.

446
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:54,572
So we're gonna
be haunted forever?

447
00:43:54,612 --> 00:43:58,241
The curse lasts
from moon to moon...

448
00:43:58,282 --> 00:44:02,184
one month...
one month.

449
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:05,211
It's already been
over three weeks.

450
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:07,554
It will persist
until the final moment

451
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:10,025
of the final night.

452
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:11,688
Or...

453
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:16,257
- Or what?!
- Until you're laid to rest.

454
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:21,366
You mean
until we're killed?

455
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:25,102
Well. The curse is tied
to the lunar cycle

456
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:27,872
and moon to moon.
uh...

457
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:30,380
"Its rage will swell
as night grows bright. "

458
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:32,177
So the closer we get
to the full moon.

459
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:34,275
the more severe
the hauntings will become.

460
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:36,809
You're saying we're all
gonna end up like Kira?

461
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:39,448
According
to the lament. Yes.

462
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,516
If we can identify the graves
you danced on. Then...

463
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,859
get some idea of who
these people were...

464
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:48,296
it may help us
to keep you safe.

465
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:51,130
Which is why we need you to take us
to Cresent View Cemetery.

466
00:44:51,168 --> 00:44:54,695
- Screw that. I'm not going back there.
- Not a good idea.

467
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:57,139
If we don't. There is no way
of knowing

468
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:58,801
what could be
coming next...

469
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:40,316
no way.

470
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:42,342
Kira Hayden?

471
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:05,975
He's here. He's here.

472
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,877
- Who's here?
- Get out of here.

473
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:10,210
Let me help.
Come on.

474
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:12,010
Don't touch me.

475
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:14,210
He hates when
other people touch me.

476
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:16,219
Get out of here!

477
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:18,084
Oh. God.

478
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:27,025
Get out of here.

479
00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:34,734
No!

480
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:37,240
Don't touch her!
Stop it!

481
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:38,764
Don't touch her!

482
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:44,040
No! Please!

483
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:46,948
No! No! No!

484
00:47:08,272 --> 00:47:09,637
I don't get it...

485
00:47:09,673 --> 00:47:12,107
you'd think ghosts would dig
hanging out from moon to moon.

486
00:47:12,143 --> 00:47:14,771
- Why are they so pissed?
- The curse pulled them in

487
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:16,905
from the other side...
maybe it hurt.

488
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:20,144
Whatever the reason.
Mr. Vance.

489
00:47:20,184 --> 00:47:22,049
they clearly
don't dig it.

490
00:47:22,086 --> 00:47:24,111
Mm-hmm... "dig it. "

491
00:47:24,155 --> 00:47:27,955
What are you saying?
That if I danced on John Perez's grave.

492
00:47:27,992 --> 00:47:30,290
we'd get haunted?
What about Mother Teresa?

493
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:32,818
Like. You can't just
decide to be haunted.

494
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,490
There's more to it
than that.

495
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:37,296
There's spirit. There's state of mind.
that sort of thing.

496
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:40,030
Yeah. But why wait?
Why not just kill us now?

497
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:43,198
Who says
they are not trying?

498
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,765
Maybe they are not
strong enough yet.

499
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,470
Yeah. Tell that
to Kira.

500
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:50,241
This is it...
this is the spot.

501
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:51,976
Yeah. This looks
familiar.

502
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:03,126
- Oh. You gotta be joking.
- I'm not joking.

503
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,220
This area is designated
for the city's undesirables...

504
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:08,754
the murderers. The rapists.
the mentally-ill.

505
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:10,494
the socially unacceptable.

506
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:11,660
Found it.

507
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:25,174
Are you sure
this is yours?

508
00:48:25,216 --> 00:48:26,376
Positive.

509
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:31,087
What about Kira's?

510
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:33,453
Kira was dancing...

511
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,084
well. Next to me.
to my left.

512
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:38,651
It's gotta be it here.
Yeah. Definitely...

513
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:41,130
this is the... this is it...
the tree.

514
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:43,895
I remember the tree.

515
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,075
I'm afraid your friend
is in trouble.

516
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:04,988
- Hey.
- Hey.

517
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:09,522
I tried calling. But he wouldn't
let me. I tried.

518
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,723
It's okay.
We're here for you.

519
00:49:14,732 --> 00:49:17,200
They said you
and Allison found me.

520
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:20,499
Yeah. You scared us.

521
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:23,131
We heard someone tried
to attack you and a nurse.

522
00:49:23,173 --> 00:49:24,834
It's not what
you think.

523
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,207
I know.

524
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:29,838
Kira. Um...

525
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,110
you're not
the only one

526
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:34,515
having these
experiences.

527
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:37,714
Yeah. We're being
haunted too.

528
00:49:37,755 --> 00:49:40,280
It's because of that night
in the cemetery.

529
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:43,350
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

530
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:45,089
We've met some people
who are trying to help us.

531
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:46,960
- Once we work this out...
- I'm not staying here.

532
00:49:46,997 --> 00:49:48,988
You have to.
This is the best place for you.

533
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:51,228
You'll have security.
the whole thing.

534
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:54,931
- I'm going with you.
- No. You have to stay.

535
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:56,940
I'm going with you.

536
00:50:06,216 --> 00:50:09,413
What we have found

537
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:13,480
sheds some lights
on your experiences.

538
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:20,756
- This is Dennis?
- Yes.

539
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:23,062
That's a happy-looking kid.

540
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,625
Born October 5th. 1948.

541
00:50:25,669 --> 00:50:27,364
to Robert
and Claire Faberly.

542
00:50:27,404 --> 00:50:29,964
Dennis was a quiet
sickly child

543
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:32,134
with an unfortunate
affinity for fire.

544
00:50:32,176 --> 00:50:36,112
By age five. He'd set
numerous minor blazes

545
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:38,706
and ended up burning down
his father's feed store.

546
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:40,444
It's believed
he started the blaze

547
00:50:40,484 --> 00:50:43,351
which accidentally
burned down his house in 1956.

548
00:50:43,387 --> 00:50:46,618
killing Dennis.
his two siblings and his parents.

549
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:50,060
But if it was an accident.
why is he buried

550
00:50:50,094 --> 00:50:52,085
in the psycho section
of the graveyard?

551
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:55,292
Well. The locals
didn't think it was an accident.

552
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:58,897
Uh. Emma Westbrook:

553
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:02,337
a well-liked and respected
high-school music teacher.

554
00:51:02,373 --> 00:51:05,171
In 1923. she began
an affair with a married man

555
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:07,177
named Theodore Gusford...

556
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:10,442
- How do you know that?
- A confession to the police.

557
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:12,676
And after Theo ended
the affair.

558
00:51:12,716 --> 00:51:15,480
Emma was so distraught
that she broke into his house

559
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:16,679
and killed his wife.

560
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,484
- She killed someone?
- With an ax.

561
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:26,027
And then she waited
for him to come back and killed him.

562
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:30,166
When the police found her.
she was sitting

563
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,668
in Gusford's living room.
covered in blood.

564
00:51:32,703 --> 00:51:36,036
playing the piano.

565
00:51:37,307 --> 00:51:39,172
Okay.

566
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:41,677
Kira. Um...

567
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:45,113
the grave you danced on
had "good riddance" on the stone

568
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:46,776
and for...
for good reason.

569
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:49,115
The person buried there
was William Langer.

570
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:51,087
Don't I get a picture?

571
00:51:57,728 --> 00:51:59,025
He was a judge?

572
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,724
And by all accounts
an outstanding citizen.

573
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:03,756
Uh. A churchgoing guy.

574
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,792
family man.
charitable.

575
00:52:05,836 --> 00:52:09,067
When he died in 1890.
the. Uh...

576
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:10,903
the town was gonna set up
a memorial

577
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:12,841
until they found
his journals.

578
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:14,639
What kind of journals?

579
00:52:14,678 --> 00:52:17,306
Personal ones...

580
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:21,545
sort of detailing his appetite
for bizarre sexual exploits.

581
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:25,077
Sadomasochism.
self-mutilation. Tortures...

582
00:52:27,257 --> 00:52:29,589
and then there was this.

583
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:32,151
She was found dead
in Langer's basement...

584
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:34,187
she was in a cage.

585
00:52:35,933 --> 00:52:39,562
Wow. You sure know
how to pick them.

586
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:42,265
We head back
to my house.

587
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:45,275
wait it out. A few days from now
life returns to normal.

588
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:47,300
I don't have a few days.

589
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:51,747
That bastard's getting stronger.
I can feel it.

590
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:55,218
They are all getting stronger
and the lament is quite clear...

591
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:58,551
"To seal thy fate
and lay you at rest. "

592
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:02,048
I'm afraid
you can't wait it out.

593
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:04,754
Why did you call us down here?
To tell me that I'm gonna be

594
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:06,592
killed
by a piano teacher?

595
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,724
No. Ax-murdering
piano teacher.

596
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:13,759
We called you here to tell you
that we may have found the solution.

597
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:17,900
There was this documented case
of the lament in 1935.

598
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:21,069
The victim
did something

599
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:23,079
and it ended
the curse.

600
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:24,307
What?

601
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:27,909
Um. Well. It's um...

602
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:29,942
it's a little extreme.

603
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:36,315
"A little extreme"?

604
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,920
Burial desecration is
the root of your problems.

605
00:53:38,962 --> 00:53:41,294
You rebury the body.
the curse is over.

606
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:11,884
Well...

607
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:57,837
I need to keep
an eye on the others.

608
00:54:57,874 --> 00:55:01,139
What?!
I have to do this alone?

609
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:03,703
Hey.

610
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:06,011
just slide him in.

611
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:09,075
Make sure you get
every single piece.

612
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:13,079
Ugh. Ugh!

613
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:19,261
Hey.

614
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:21,526
Jesus. You scared
the shit out of me.

615
00:55:21,565 --> 00:55:23,726
Make sure you get
every single piece.

616
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,928
- Why?
- If not. This is all for nothing.

617
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:28,403
Go away.
Okay.

618
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:31,134
- Every single piece.
- Okay.

619
00:55:39,616 --> 00:55:42,380
Ugh.

620
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:57,223
Pay dirt.

621
00:56:17,954 --> 00:56:19,945
That's disgusting.

622
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,773
Kira.

623
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:22,185
Help me.

624
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:26,053
Culpepper. Help me!

625
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:35,864
Help help help!

626
00:57:35,899 --> 00:57:37,890
I'm coming. Kira.

627
00:57:39,236 --> 00:57:41,033
Coming!

628
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:45,301
Help!

629
00:57:49,279 --> 00:57:51,144
- Help!
- Hang in there. Kira!

630
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:52,648
Pull harder.

631
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,351
Culpepper.

632
00:58:03,693 --> 00:58:05,217
Help me.

633
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:07,253
Oh my God!
Here we go.

634
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:09,231
Culpepper.

635
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:11,427
Put it out.

636
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:33,113
Oh my God.
I'm trying.

637
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:38,687
Hey. Someone's coming!

638
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:41,959
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go.

639
00:58:41,998 --> 00:58:44,899
Move it!
Get out quick!

640
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:31,306
"The Lord is my shepherd:
I shall not want.

641
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:35,341
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures...

642
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:37,910
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

643
00:59:37,954 --> 00:59:40,320
He restoreth my soul...

644
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:42,518
He leadeth me in the path
of righteousness

645
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,527
for His Name's sake.
Yea. Though I walk

646
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:48,497
through the valley of the shadow
of death. I will fear no evil...

647
00:59:55,438 --> 00:59:57,429
- That's it?
- Yeah.

648
00:59:59,242 --> 01:00:02,405
- That's it?
- Yes.

649
01:00:02,445 --> 01:00:04,310
Careful with
yourself now.

650
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:08,250
I know.
it's a relief.

651
01:00:08,285 --> 01:00:10,515
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

652
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:41,717
Everything seems
all right.

653
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:43,616
Yeah. It is all right.

654
01:00:43,653 --> 01:00:46,349
I don't know
how I know.

655
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:48,380
but it is.

656
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:06,439
You hear that?

657
01:01:06,476 --> 01:01:09,036
Allison. There's someone
in the house.

658
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:34,770
Oh my God!

659
01:01:38,074 --> 01:01:40,941
Oh my God.
they're in the house!

660
01:01:44,014 --> 01:01:46,778
Oh my God.

661
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:49,683
What?

662
01:01:51,588 --> 01:01:52,953
We'll be right there.

663
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:07,492
Are you okay?

664
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:10,199
This shit
ain't over.

665
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:24,080
- Is everybody okay?
- No thanks to you.

666
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,554
We did what you said...
we dug up the bodies.

667
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:28,580
It didn't work.

668
01:02:29,659 --> 01:02:31,456
I know you are
disappointed.

669
01:02:31,494 --> 01:02:33,485
but. You know.
we should remain calm.

670
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:35,998
We also clearly
stated that it might not work.

671
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:39,024
You didn't say anything
about it pissing them off even more.

672
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:41,799
I don't believe the entities
are any more angry.

673
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,535
- Really? And how would you know?
- We are doing the best we can.

674
01:02:45,575 --> 01:02:47,202
This is not
a precise science.

675
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:49,336
Okay. All right.
Look. The bottom line is.

676
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:51,711
we need to keep you safe
and the best way to do that

677
01:02:51,748 --> 01:02:53,443
is to keep
everybody together.

678
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:55,348
Stick together
so we can do what?

679
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:57,546
Come inside
and I'll tell you.

680
01:02:57,587 --> 01:02:59,521
Fuck that.

681
01:03:01,224 --> 01:03:03,215
Where would you go.
Mr. Mitchel?

682
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:05,687
Sid?

683
01:03:09,732 --> 01:03:13,065
Harris. Please.

684
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:15,571
It's not time
to be alone. Mr. Mitchel.

685
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:46,258
Frances.

686
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:50,938
Mm?

687
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:53,602
What are we
looking at?

688
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:56,908
I don't recall seeing
the fence from here.

689
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:01,807
The school probably
cut the trees back.

690
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:02,875
Well. Maybe.

691
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:04,113
What's the plan now?

692
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:07,385
Sit in a circle.
hold hands and chat?

693
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,891
We... we... we wait.

694
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:12,861
- We wait?
- It's the final night of the curse

695
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:16,764
and. Uh... tomorrow. The second
the sun rises. It'll all be over.

696
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,768
- You said we couldn't wait it out.
- Yes. It's true.

697
01:04:22,906 --> 01:04:26,740
- There was no indication...
- That survival isn't possible

698
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:28,767
if we stick it out.

699
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:32,815
Yeah.

700
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:35,716
No. We're not staying.
Let's go.

701
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:38,118
- Please.
- Just like that. Huh?

702
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:41,681
Do the math. Kira. We'd rather
take our chances alone with Emma.

703
01:04:41,724 --> 01:04:43,385
See. Kira.
what'd I tell you?

704
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:46,327
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You bailing is just so typical.

705
01:04:46,362 --> 01:04:47,954
I can't risk Allison.

706
01:04:47,997 --> 01:04:49,760
So you're leaving
because of her?

707
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:52,666
Why shouldn't he? I didn't
let anyone talk me into...

708
01:04:52,702 --> 01:04:54,329
dancing on graves!

709
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:56,395
I didn't talk anybody
into anything.

710
01:04:56,439 --> 01:04:58,669
And. Besides. If you hadn't left
Harris at the wake.

711
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,268
- Maybe things would've been different.
- This is my fault?

712
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:03,336
- I'm just saying.
- Sid. Shut up.

713
01:05:03,379 --> 01:05:05,574
Fuck you. Harris.

714
01:05:05,615 --> 01:05:08,311
If she'd been around.
granted it would've sucked.

715
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,115
but we wouldn't have gotten drunk.
we wouldn't have danced on graves.

716
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:13,452
and you sure as hell wouldn't have
made out with Kira.

717
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:22,897
Is that...
is that true. Harris?

718
01:05:24,534 --> 01:05:26,195
Is it?

719
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,532
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

720
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,610
This is going to be
a long night.

721
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:43,050
Vincent. They shouldn't
be alone.

722
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:44,917
They're not.

723
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:51,551
Do you have
another one of those?

724
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:05,571
Allison. About that night
in the cemetery...

725
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:07,200
Do you still love Harris?

726
01:06:07,243 --> 01:06:08,608
Yes.

727
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:13,746
- But he doesn't love me.
- How do you know?

728
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:16,718
He wants to have
a family with you.

729
01:06:16,753 --> 01:06:18,380
I'm a memory.

730
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:19,888
He still cares
about you.

731
01:06:19,922 --> 01:06:22,584
And I still care
about him. But...

732
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:25,150
what you guys have
is entirely different.

733
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:27,594
He loves you so much...

734
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:30,030
he told me so that night
in the cemetery.

735
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:32,398
Yeah?

736
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:34,300
Yeah.

737
01:06:34,337 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm so over Harris.
anyway...

738
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:40,839
maybe you
haven't heard. But...

739
01:06:40,877 --> 01:06:43,038
I got a new man
in my life.

740
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,070
Tsk.

741
01:06:48,818 --> 01:06:50,786
- They are just talking.
- Mm.

742
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,845
Huh-uh... calm before
the storm.

743
01:06:52,889 --> 01:06:55,949
She made out
with her husband.

744
01:06:55,992 --> 01:06:57,721
We kissed:
we didn't make out.

745
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,785
Don't even try
to pull that shit.

746
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:01,592
I saw you!

747
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:04,623
Why don't we talk about the real reason
that kiss pissed you off?

748
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,067
- And what's that?
- You're in love with Kira.

749
01:07:07,103 --> 01:07:09,628
- What?!
- Yeah.

750
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:12,698
You loved her since college.
but you've always been too chickenshit

751
01:07:12,742 --> 01:07:15,734
to do anything about it.
Jesus. Sid. You can't even admit it now.

752
01:07:15,778 --> 01:07:17,609
Right. It's just
so typical of you

753
01:07:17,647 --> 01:07:19,979
to use these cheap lawyer tactics
to turn the attention on me

754
01:07:20,016 --> 01:07:22,075
when you're the one
cheating on his wife.

755
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:25,821
You know
that's not true.

756
01:07:25,855 --> 01:07:29,450
Nothing is ever your fault.
right. Harris?

757
01:07:29,492 --> 01:07:31,460
I'm not the one
wasting my life.

758
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:33,894
I'm not wasting my life.
I have what I choose to have.

759
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:37,457
- Yeah. Everything except Kira.
- Shut up. Man.

760
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,434
Stop.
Get off me!

761
01:07:53,049 --> 01:07:55,279
Run!

762
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:57,650
Is it him?

763
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:35,552
It's Langer!

764
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,420
I see her...
she's running upstairs.

765
01:10:05,014 --> 01:10:08,313
Fuck you.
you fucking bastard!

766
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:39,644
Let me go.
Let me go. You bastard!

767
01:10:39,682 --> 01:10:41,980
Help!
Please...

768
01:10:42,018 --> 01:10:44,316
bastard. Let me go!

769
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:09,810
No!

770
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,984
Help me.

771
01:11:27,029 --> 01:11:29,156
Oh. She's losing
too much blood.

772
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:34,736
It's gonna be okay. Sweetie.
We'll get you out.

773
01:11:36,906 --> 01:11:38,999
It's gonna be okay.

774
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:10,934
Open the door!

775
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:22,678
Open the door!

776
01:13:52,742 --> 01:13:56,041
Uh. I'm sorry. Guys.
could you...

777
01:13:56,078 --> 01:13:58,069
give me a minute?

778
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:12,617
Have you found
a way out?

779
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:17,429
The gate is wrapped
around the entire house.

780
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:19,991
And still no signal?

781
01:14:20,035 --> 01:14:22,765
And phone out
there too.

782
01:14:22,805 --> 01:14:24,796
Where's
Culpepper?

783
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,166
I'm not sure.

784
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:47,018
Frances?

785
01:14:51,567 --> 01:14:53,933
I am so sorry. Vincent.

786
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:55,994
It's not your fault.

787
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:59,565
We knew the dangers
if they stayed here.

788
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:02,270
You can't blame yourself.

789
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:04,211
You need to understand.

790
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:09,073
Understand what?

791
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:12,781
Yeah... understand what.
Culpepper?

792
01:15:13,923 --> 01:15:16,824
Okay. I...

793
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:20,585
I needed the evidence.

794
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:23,655
I couldn't let it end.

795
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:34,235
- Tell me those are not...
- We buried those!

796
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:41,909
I took them out
of the bag.

797
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:45,318
How could you do that?
How could you do that?!

798
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,788
I'm so sorry. Vincent.
I just...

799
01:15:47,823 --> 01:15:50,189
I needed the house
and the cameras.

800
01:15:50,226 --> 01:15:52,421
I had to document
that there was a haunting.

801
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,564
Look. I knew
I could end it. All right?

802
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:04,004
There's an open grave outside. We just...
we've gotta put the skull in it.

803
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:06,200
How do we do that?!

804
01:16:06,242 --> 01:16:08,733
How do we get
out of this house?

805
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:12,042
I don't know.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

806
01:16:12,081 --> 01:16:14,572
I just... I just...

807
01:16:14,617 --> 01:16:16,676
I just needed
the evidence.

808
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,147
Evidence.

809
01:16:20,189 --> 01:16:21,486
Harris?

810
01:16:23,459 --> 01:16:26,360
Harris!
No no no!

811
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:38,198
Oh. God! Do you have any
idea of what you're doing?

812
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,867
Stop it!

813
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:45,779
This should've
been all over.

814
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:50,181
How are we gonna bury these?
We can't get outside.

815
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:51,686
There has to be
a way out.

816
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:08,529
Come on!

817
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,536
- I can't get it.
- Welded shut.

818
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:17,136
You just can't get good
paranormal help these days.

819
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:20,012
Look. Harris. I'm sorry. Man.
I didn't mean to say those things.

820
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:21,516
I'm sorry too.

821
01:17:23,886 --> 01:17:27,378
- We didn't find anything.
- Does she have to be here?

822
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:30,085
- I can still help.
- Unless you have dynamite for the bars.

823
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:32,252
- Nobody wants your help.
- I know you're angry.

824
01:17:32,294 --> 01:17:34,489
- But now it's not the time.
- When is the time?

825
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,691
'Cause the sun rises
in less than an hour.

826
01:17:36,732 --> 01:17:39,394
Then it's best not to waste it
fighting with each other!

827
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:43,872
You'd better hope that little pyro
gets me. 'cause I swear if I make it...

828
01:17:46,442 --> 01:17:48,103
What?

829
01:17:48,143 --> 01:17:50,611
The flashlights
are in the hallway.

830
01:17:51,647 --> 01:17:52,944
What what?

831
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:22,444
Wasn't Kira
in this room?

832
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:24,241
I locked this door.

833
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:27,874
Oh my God!

834
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,144
What?

835
01:18:39,495 --> 01:18:41,122
That's Emma's song.

836
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,060
I'm not going anywhere
unless something's chasing me.

837
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:49,502
Stay here.

838
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:20,528
Oh. God!

839
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:22,537
What am I looking at?

840
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:26,200
Uh. I-I don't know.

841
01:19:32,848 --> 01:19:34,611
Kira was dead.

842
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:36,174
She was dead.

843
01:19:36,218 --> 01:19:39,278
Maybe she wasn't.
Maybe...

844
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,755
No no no. She is.
She is dead.

845
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:43,587
Then how do you
explain that?

846
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:51,326
Kira?

847
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:57,331
- Kira?
- Harris?

848
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:59,704
I don't know if that's
a good idea. Man.

849
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:01,732
Kira?

850
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:18,086
Kira?

851
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,557
Emma?

852
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,752
Help!

853
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:10,234
Bitch!

854
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:21,950
Help!

855
01:21:54,856 --> 01:21:57,256
- What the hell happened to her?
- I don't know.

856
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:59,692
What do you mean you don't know?
You're the expert.

857
01:21:59,728 --> 01:22:02,026
Wait wait wait...
do you guys smell smoke?

858
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:27,979
I think she's gone.

859
01:22:44,806 --> 01:22:47,798
- Go! Go!
- Wait.

860
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:50,971
Go! Come on!
Come on!

861
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:53,072
- Vincent. Move! Let's go!
- Let's go!

862
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:54,548
Go. Vincent!

863
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:04,454
Hey! Hey!

864
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:11,790
Damn it!

865
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:15,502
Light.

866
01:23:21,476 --> 01:23:25,071
Okay. Fire extinguisher...
I gotta get

867
01:23:25,113 --> 01:23:27,104
a fire extinguisher...

868
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:30,914
Fire extinguisher.

869
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:52,531
Oh. Man.

870
01:23:56,378 --> 01:23:59,074
Help! Help!
Let me out!

871
01:24:01,983 --> 01:24:04,679
Help!
Let me out!

872
01:24:07,322 --> 01:24:09,313
He's in here!

873
01:24:23,572 --> 01:24:25,563
Let me out!

874
01:24:45,827 --> 01:24:48,091
Get away!

875
01:24:56,738 --> 01:24:58,296
Stay away!

876
01:25:05,747 --> 01:25:08,477
Harris.

877
01:25:08,517 --> 01:25:11,111
- Harris!
- Sid?

878
01:25:11,153 --> 01:25:12,882
No! No!

879
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:15,185
- Vincent?
- It's too late. Go!

880
01:25:31,072 --> 01:25:33,905
Allison. The window!

881
01:25:33,942 --> 01:25:36,376
- I don't wanna go.
- Great. No bars!

882
01:25:36,411 --> 01:25:38,504
- Come on!
- I don't wanna go...

883
01:25:38,547 --> 01:25:40,242
No. You have
to do this! Go!

884
01:25:40,282 --> 01:25:43,410
- I don't wanna go without you.
- You can do this. You'll be fine!

885
01:25:43,452 --> 01:25:45,181
- I love you. Harris!
- Go!

886
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:48,815
- I love you. I love you.
- I love you too.

887
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:51,917
- No!
- Please.

888
01:26:00,368 --> 01:26:02,598
I love you. Harris.

889
01:26:02,637 --> 01:26:03,729
Whoa!

890
01:26:40,008 --> 01:26:43,136
Oh. God!

891
01:27:37,899 --> 01:27:39,560
Get in. Get in!

892
01:28:00,889 --> 01:28:04,085
Go!

893
01:28:05,393 --> 01:28:08,954
Go... go!

894
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,328
Allison. Go!

895
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:25,335
Go!

896
01:29:06,821 --> 01:29:09,051
Harris!

897
01:29:53,768 --> 01:29:55,668
Back to hell!

898
01:30:20,295 --> 01:30:22,889
Harris!

899
01:30:22,931 --> 01:30:26,560
Harris! Harris!

900
01:30:29,637 --> 01:30:31,662
Good Lord help me!

901
01:30:31,706 --> 01:30:34,971
- Where the fuck is he?
- Harris!

902
01:30:35,009 --> 01:30:38,536
Oh my God!

903
01:30:42,951 --> 01:30:44,942
It's over.

904
01:30:47,288 --> 01:30:49,279
Could anyone bring me
to the hospital?

905
01:30:52,761 --> 01:30:55,093
I need
an ambulance.

906
01:31:18,586 --> 01:31:20,884
What is it?

907
01:31:20,922 --> 01:31:23,755
Nothing.
just the caretaker.
