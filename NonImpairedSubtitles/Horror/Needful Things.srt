1
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,343
My God.

2
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,114
There's an awning on the new store.

3
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,842
There's still soap on all the windows.

4
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:10,712
So?

5
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,126
They're hiding something.

6
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,897
I don't think so, Nettie.

7
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,062
I think it's just going to be
some kind of antique store is all.

8
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,697
I'm never going over there.

9
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,979
Hey, Raider. How are you, buddy?
Good to see you.

10
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,381
- Hi, Nettie.
- Hi.

11
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,252
- Is Polly around?
- Gosh, yes. It's lunchtime.

12
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,690
Hi.

13
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:59,564
- Morning, Frank, Father Meehan.
- Hi, Alan.

14
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,696
Good afternoon.

15
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:03,600
- Smoked turkey on rye?
- Not today.

16
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,973
Think I'll try one of your specials today.

17
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,242
So I'll have... What's that? I'll have that.
Delicious salami...

18
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:13,478
...provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo,
and two kinds of mustard in a pita pocket.

19
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:14,644
I wouldn't.

20
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,287
Okay, how about smoked turkey on rye?

21
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,614
Good order.

22
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,352
- Smoked turkey, rye!
- And a big piece of Nettie's apple pie.

23
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:29,200
So how's your day so far?

24
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:34,097
A little crazy, actually.
Did I tell you I got the photos back...

25
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,401
"You won't believe your eyes.

26
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,501
"Needful things.

27
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,708
"A new kind of store.

28
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,174
"You won't believe your eyes. "

29
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,443
It says so right there.

30
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,378
Then it must be true.

31
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,479
So, who's the new owner?

32
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,354
Nobody knows.
Not from around here is all.

33
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,882
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

34
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,726
Got a cold.

35
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,620
Hello?

36
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,034
- Is anyone here?
- I'm here.

37
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:30,574
The door was unlocked. I didn't bust in.

38
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:35,517
Of course it's unlocked. I'm open.

39
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:39,190
You've been here before.

40
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:47,129
- No.
- Sure you have.

41
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,692
I never forget a face.

42
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:52,802
Who are you?

43
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,366
My name is Leland Gaunt. And you are?

44
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,208
Brian Rusk.

45
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,312
Nice meeting you, sir.

46
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:06,150
I'm equally pleased
to make your acquaintance, Master Brian.

47
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,976
Now, what would you fancy?

48
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,452
- Fancy?
- What would you like?

49
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:15,755
Everything that's here is for sale,
but not everything that's for sale is here.

50
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:17,624
I have a basement, you see.

51
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,721
Are you from overseas somewhere?

52
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,191
I'm from Akron.

53
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:27,702
- Where's that? England?
- That's in Ohio.

54
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,071
What do you know?

55
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:34,174
There's Wilma Jerzyk
and her husband Pete.

56
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,347
What do you suppose they're up to?

57
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,816
Buying feed for their turkey farm?

58
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,381
Roast turkey?

59
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,580
No, she's a crazy person.

60
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,026
Now, what'll it be? A Walkman!

61
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:54,388
- A mountain bike.
- I already got one.

62
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:58,396
- Air Jordans.
- I don't know.

63
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,937
- Sure, yeah, I guess.
- Of course not.

64
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,203
Those are just objects, aren't they?
Just things. Nothing really important.

65
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,807
Suppose you had one wish, Brian.

66
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,210
What would you say?

67
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,108
- A wish?
- One wish. Just one. To make you happy.

68
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:20,090
What would make you happy again?
Let's see, where do we start?

69
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:24,453
- What could I possibly have around here...
- Mickey Mantle?

70
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:28,889
- Little before your time, wasn't he?
- Yeah. I meant the baseball card.

71
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,367
I mean, me and my dad,
we used to collect them.

72
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,361
Topps or Fleers?

73
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:36,904
Topps. We had a whole collection
of 56 baseball cards.

74
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:40,236
Al Kaline, Whitey Ford, Roy Campanella,
guys of that caliber?

75
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,905
We have every Yankee
except Mickey Mantle.

76
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:47,074
I mean, Moose Skowron was over $65.

77
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,847
Skowron is one thing.

78
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:55,786
Mickey Mantle.
That's got to run $600, $700.

79
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:58,921
You asked me.

80
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:02,965
I believe I might have something
that'll make you very happy, Brian.

81
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,627
Stay right here.

82
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,700
My God. Look at my butt.

83
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,711
- I look awful.
- No, you look fabulous.

84
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,240
Pol, you know how...

85
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:23,310
...you're always saying
that I'm not all that serious about us?

86
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:26,448
This is your camera, right?
I don't look like this.

87
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,856
- I'll commit suicide if I look like this.
- Polly, I...

88
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:32,122
Will you marry me?

89
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:35,166
Sure, whenever you're serious about it.
I gotta check Nettie.

90
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:39,192
Make sure she doesn't burn the French
fries again and put me in the poor house.

91
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,329
Polly...

92
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:43,173
I am serious.

93
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,643
Mickey Mantle!

94
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:53,050
"Topps, 1956."

95
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:56,809
Signed, "To my good friend Brian. "

96
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:00,149
Wait a minute. Brian is my name.
That's impossible.

97
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:03,058
"Best wishes, Mickey Mantle. "
Now, close your eyes, Brian.

98
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,853
Close your eyes.

99
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,913
Now, then. How much would you pay
for this card, Brian?

100
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:32,351
Mickey Mantle. Topps, 1956.

101
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,860
Signed, "To my good friend Brian. "

102
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,933
No, listen, all I got here...

103
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:46,463
The buyer must never tell
the seller how much he has.

104
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:49,166
If you can't tell a lie, then be still.

105
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:52,407
The first rule of fair trade, Master Brian.

106
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:57,676
- So what do you think?
- I can't breathe yet.

107
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,609
It's not as great as it looks.
I got it off the TV.

108
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,819
Such a liar.

109
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,317
- Put it on?
- Yeah.

110
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:24,970
Does that mean yes?

111
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:31,641
- Yeah. Yeah?
- Yes.

112
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,152
No.

113
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:52,536
95 cents!

114
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,039
Now we're getting somewhere.

115
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,074
Not quite enough, okay?
But an intriguing offer nonetheless.

116
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,374
Let's call it...

117
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,010
...half the price, shall we?

118
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,553
Yes. Half the price is 95 cents.

119
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:14,424
The price you paid cash.

120
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,925
The rest...

121
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:22,122
...the other half is a deed.
You understand?

122
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:28,068
- A deed?
- A trick. More like a tiny prank.

123
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,303
No big deal.
And no one's ever going to suspect you.

124
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,703
I promise.

125
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:39,548
Do you remember that lady we peeked at
buying feed across the street?

126
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,477
Yeah, Wilma Jerzyk. The turkey farmer.

127
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,190
You know where she lives?

128
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,815
Out of the car.

129
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:48,509
I said, "Get out of the car. "

130
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,621
Now.

131
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:59,996
Is this your name on this goddamn ticket,
Ridgewick, or is it a forgery?

132
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,293
- You're parked in the crip space.
- The what?

133
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,358
- You can't come in here...
- The what?

134
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,667
The handicapped space.
We've told you about it before, Buster...

135
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,367
What did you call me?
Did you call me Buster?

136
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:13,341
Touch me again, I'll throw you in the cell!
I mean it!

137
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,710
It's Danforth! Danforth Keeton III...

138
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:19,614
...who is Head Selectman
of this piss pot little town.

139
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:23,745
I could get you fired off the force in two...
Make that one second flat.

140
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:27,622
- Am I getting through to you, Norris?
- I told him to write the ticket.

141
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:29,785
In that case, my mistake.

142
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,557
Jesus, Dan,
what in hell's got into you today?

143
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,532
Nothing got into me! I'm just sick
and tired of self-important little pricks.

144
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,796
- Pusillanimous assholes...
- That's enough!

145
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:42,395
I try to do a lot for this town.
I accomplish a lot for this town.

146
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,535
In fact, I am this town. And I am sick
and tired of this goddamn persecution.

147
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,705
- I am not persecuting you, Danforth.
- He called me Buster!

148
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:52,978
- You know how I feel about that.
- Then he'll apologize.

149
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:54,949
Won't you, Norris?

150
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,481
- Don't know that I will.
- You will.

151
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,914
Now.

152
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:03,619
I'm sorry.

153
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,623
- I'm sorry that I called you Buster.
- Yeah, you mama's boy. You candy-assed...

154
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,227
Shut up, you bloated,
cigar-sucking used car salesman.

155
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:14,134
Boats, shithead!

156
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:17,930
I sell quality preowned yachts,
you miserable fucking scuzz bucket...

157
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,806
Shut up! Shut up!

158
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,308
When I moved here, I thought,
"Great, I'm out of the big city. "

159
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:29,319
I'm in a place where people won't be
crawling up each other's asshole every day.

160
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:33,016
Where maybe my biggest nightmare
was gonna be getting a cat out of a tree.

161
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:37,027
But forget that!
Everybody is insane everywhere!

162
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,592
So you guys just fight it out between you.

163
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:43,156
One of you kill each other,
and who's ever left, I'll throw in jail.

164
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:49,204
You can do it. I know you can.
He's not gonna bite.

165
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:54,342
But what will I say?

166
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:58,107
You introduce yourself. "Hi. I'm Nettie. "

167
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,081
Then what?

168
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,217
Nettie, just go. You'll be fine.

169
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,750
Go on.

170
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,029
Hi. I'm Nettie.

171
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:25,732
Thank you.

172
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,504
It's only 19th century. I'm sorry.

173
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:32,545
Enjoy your purchases.

174
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:39,481
What's this? Some old wood chisel?

175
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,992
It belonged to a cabinet maker
at Château de Versailles...

176
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,722
...in the days of Louis XVI.

177
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,500
Look at this, Pete. Looks pretty old.

178
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,067
Yep.

179
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:59,275
My God. I didn't think we had room
for another soul in here.

180
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,435
Hi. My name is Nettie.

181
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,948
That stupid dog barks at me once more...

182
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:10,852
...I won't bother complaining
to Sheriff Pangborn again.

183
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:15,723
- I'll come over your place, skin him alive.
- No, not in here. Dear God, please!

184
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,128
- Throw her Baptist ass in the street.
- I will not.

185
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,135
Dear ladies, let's all be friends.
Can't we all be friends?

186
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:26,736
Not in this life.

187
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:29,869
Please, not in my place.

188
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,099
I'm sorry. Ladies, excuse me!

189
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:34,977
Miss Jerzyk!

190
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:05,534
Pick it up. Go ahead. Go on.

191
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,069
Don't be afraid, Miss Cobb.

192
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:16,185
No. I had one just like it years ago.
But it got broke.

193
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:19,979
- My husband...
- Your husband?

194
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,816
Then it's Mrs. Cobb.

195
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:26,222
Although my George has been passed on
for some time now.

196
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:30,697
- He died, untimely.
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

197
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,170
No need to be sorry.
It's been seven years since he was...

198
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,139
Murder is awful.

199
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,346
- I didn't mean to.
- Of course not.

200
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,544
It wasn't you who took that meat fork
from the drawer...

201
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,519
...and stuck it in his throat.
Are you leaving, Mrs. Roberts?

202
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:53,582
I'll have to think about it.
It is a lot of money.

203
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:55,682
You think about it. So will I.

204
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,227
You baked this?

205
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:09,467
Of course.

206
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:14,740
Homemade every day from apples
picked down at the Mayflowers'.

207
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,607
Polly Chalmers, my boss, sent it over.

208
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:24,982
Go ahead. Take him.

209
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,261
- I'm scared I'll drop it again.
- You won't drop it.

210
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,156
Come, Mrs. Cobb.

211
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,528
Please, sit down.

212
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:46,537
Listen.

213
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:51,511
Sometimes I think I can hear
the tiniest laugh.

214
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:58,851
I like you, Netitia.

215
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,758
I won't yell at you, like George did.

216
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,396
You moron!

217
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:11,994
No!

218
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:30,009
I think it should be yours, Netitia.

219
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,020
I need to go to work.

220
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:41,598
I'll see you soon. I'll drop by for a bite.

221
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,997
Mr. Keeton eats there most every day,
does he not?

222
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,899
Yeah. Danforth Keeton.

223
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:54,135
And everybody calls him Buster
behind his back.

224
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:57,812
Why is that? Pray tell.

225
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:01,843
I don't know.

226
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:05,850
Maybe someone should play
a trick on Buster.

227
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,021
Teach him to be nice.

228
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,390
My husband played a lot of tricks on me.

229
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:16,499
Maybe it would be fun
to play one on someone else.

230
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,966
Nobody would ever know it was you,
I promise.

231
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:23,957
Welcome to Needful Things.

232
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:28,437
Alan Pangborn.

233
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,467
- The sheriff around these parts.
- Leland Gaunt. Owner.

234
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,906
- So, what can I sell you, Sheriff?
- Me?

235
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:41,282
Nothing. I got everything I need, thanks.

236
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:44,446
Fair enough.

237
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:50,454
How about a piece of pie?
Your fiancée Ms. Chalmers sent it over.

238
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,229
- My fiancée?
- Such a pretty lady.

239
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,830
You're a lucky man, Sheriff. I'll be back.

240
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:19,823
Goodness.
I wish I had some cheddar cheese.

241
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:24,216
But beggars can't be choosers, can they?

242
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,958
Certain we haven't met somewhere before,
have we?

243
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,895
What, you and me?

244
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,127
In a big city.

245
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,304
You look familiar, Al.

246
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:41,301
You look out of place here, actually.

247
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:47,180
You don't mind my saying so,
so do you, Leland.

248
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,021
So, where are you from?

249
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:55,517
Ohio.

250
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,191
Akron, to be precise.

251
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:00,928
Pittsburgh.

252
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,629
I'm from Pittsburgh.

253
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,801
So, why did you leave?

254
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:12,542
I was a cop there,
and I got tired of all the shit going down.

255
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,303
And one day I just lost it.

256
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:19,773
I hit this guy.

257
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:24,320
Way too hard.

258
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,988
I reckon he needed some killing.

259
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,830
But it was still wrong.

260
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:38,691
Of course it was.

261
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:45,006
Yeah. So I left, and now I'm here.

262
00:25:50,948 --> 00:25:52,176
So am I.

263
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,554
- Reverend.
- Sheriff.

264
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,255
- Alan, thanks for coming!
- Afternoon, Father.

265
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:40,688
- Hi, Sheriff.
- I got this in the mail this morning.

266
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:44,132
"Listen up, you mackerel snapper. "

267
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:49,203
- Excuse me.
- "We've tried to reason with you...

268
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:53,642
"... but it's been no use.
We have put up with your Popish idolatry...

269
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,942
"... and even with your licentious worship
of the Babylon whore...

270
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:00,174
"... but now you've gone too far. "

271
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:02,785
"Babylon whore. "
I mean, saints preserve us.

272
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:07,518
"Heed our warning.
Give up your plan to turn this town...

273
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:11,857
"... into a den of thieves and gamblers,
or you will smell the brimstone.

274
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:16,256
"'The wicked shall be turned into hell. '
Psalms 9:17.

275
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,232
"The concerned Baptist men
of Castle Rock. "

276
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,638
It's that idiot, Reverend Willie Rose.

277
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:24,230
Maybe you shouldn't have
called it "Casino Night. "

278
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:27,800
For God's sake, Alan.
It's only a little charity gambling.

279
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:30,438
I mean, I don't know why
it upsets the Baptists so.

280
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:32,175
I'll go talk to Rever...

281
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:34,945
When I was younger,
people got along better!

282
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,749
I'll go talk to him.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

283
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,321
You do that, Alan.

284
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:44,757
And when you do,
you tell Rose that if he tries to bump us...

285
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:49,390
...he'll find out just how hard
we "mackerel snappers" can bump back!

286
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:56,103
Pete, get me a gobbler from the pen!
I feel like turkey tonight.

287
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:59,035
You feel like turkey every night, Wilma.

288
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:14,550
Wilma!

289
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,596
- What happened?
- Mud!

290
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:26,467
Mud and shit! Goddamn turkey shit!

291
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:28,663
Why'd someone go and do that?

292
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,709
- Because I told her I'll kill it.
- Told who?

293
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:43,214
<i>Dot. </i>

294
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,922
- Yes, just a sec. It's for you.
- Me?

295
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:50,987
Okay, it's the square key. All the doors.

296
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:54,428
Don't forget the lights.
You can do it. You'll be fine.

297
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,966
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Night.

298
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,434
Hi. This is Nettie.

299
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,907
I know what you done, you crazy bitch!

300
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,400
Done what?

301
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:10,139
Fucking with me
was the worst mistake you ever made.

302
00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:13,750
I'm going to get you for this,
you understand? You and your mutt!

303
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:18,084
You don't dare!
You stop bothering me and my Raider!

304
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:24,384
- He's a good doggie!
- You won't see me coming!

305
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,649
Guy sounds like he's havin'
a fucking pepoleptic fit.

306
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:47,005
Yep.

307
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:53,717
Don't kick the Rock-Ola, Hugh.

308
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,857
You hear me?

309
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:01,420
How you doing at the tracks, Dan?
Horses finally running your way?

310
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:04,999
Every time, Henry. Every goddamn time.

311
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:08,698
I'm gonna kick that jukebox wide open,
you don't fix it, Henry.

312
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,236
All right. That's it. You're out of here.

313
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,709
Give me that back.

314
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:18,373
Any of you fellas heading up to Castle Hill?
Hugh needs a lift.

315
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,010
Pink slip is what Hugh needs.

316
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:25,083
For a city employee making
an ass of himself in a public tavern.

317
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:26,447
Yep.

318
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:30,717
Nice to have friends.

319
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,433
You know, Henry? They do it at night.

320
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:45,634
They come in,
and they take out the mirrors...

321
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:50,676
...and they put in a piece of one-way glass
and stick a camera on the other side of it.

322
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:54,808
Then they watch you,
and they laugh at you.

323
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,983
And they take down every
single word you say.

324
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,753
Yeah.

325
00:31:50,774 --> 00:31:54,710
- You're drenched to your soul.
- They threw me out!

326
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:57,576
- I'm sorry.
- Here.

327
00:31:57,648 --> 00:32:02,449
Let me help you peel this thing off,
before you catch your death.

328
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,083
You got a nice jacket in the window.

329
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:12,791
A classic early-'50s beauty.
Warm as toast. Dry as a bone.

330
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:17,495
It's just like the one I used to have
in high school, before I was a bum.

331
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,860
When I was a kid.

332
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:24,499
I'll bet there are quite a few people
in this shit pit of a town...

333
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,873
...who wouldn't believe
you ever were a kid.

334
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:30,710
I know. It's not fair. I try so hard.

335
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:35,048
Not hard enough. So they crushed you.

336
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,923
They buried that wonderful boy
deep inside you.

337
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:42,591
- Which boy?
- This one.

338
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,253
We'll find him again, Hugh.

339
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,622
We'll resurrect him together.

340
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:55,069
Because, all of a sudden,
it's 1955 all over again.

341
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,518
It was the best hour
of the best day of my life.

342
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:22,989
- God, I loved that jacket.
- Which jacket? This one.

343
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:29,362
This jacket, Hugh.
You could recover, retrace your steps.

344
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:32,464
Take charge of your life again.

345
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,240
God, this is still so beautiful.

346
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:39,040
Say, Hugh, do you happen to know...

347
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:43,077
...a nice little Baptist lady
called Nettie Cobb?

348
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:47,153
Sure. Crazy old wretch killed her husband.

349
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:49,951
How much do you want for it?

350
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:14,009
- Mr. Gaunt?
- I am he.

351
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:17,884
Reverend Rose, sir,
of the First Baptist Church of Castle Rock.

352
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:21,550
May I take this opportunity
to welcome you to Castle Rock...

353
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:23,649
...on the good Lord's behalf?

354
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:26,919
- Why not?
- Excellent.

355
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:32,435
It's my unusual urgency when I ask,
what faith, sir, are you?

356
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:37,336
- What faith?
- Religion.

357
00:34:39,176 --> 00:34:43,545
- You're not Catholic, are you?
- You might say that I am...

358
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:48,016
...nondenominational.
- I knew it!

359
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:52,814
Then you will have little objection
to my placing this in your front window.

360
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,225
I couldn't possibly do that.

361
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:04,227
You see, I, like you,
am here to serve everyone.

362
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:07,998
However, by way of compensation...

363
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:11,968
...perhaps I may offer you something,
which might interest you.

364
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:14,100
Say, how about an <i>objet d'art</i>?

365
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,308
What is your preference, Reverend?
Asian, Roman?

366
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,179
That is 2nd century, Reverend.

367
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:32,556
Wasn't it St. Augustine who said,
"Make me chaste, O Lord.

368
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,556
"But not yet, not yet"?

369
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:48,738
Father.

370
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:53,110
Reverend.

371
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:17,572
"Paper packages tied up with strings

372
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:22,075
"These are a few of my favorite things"

373
00:36:26,116 --> 00:36:30,849
Yes. I'm so thrilled.
Thank you, Mr. Gaunt.

374
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,924
<i>Treasure Island</i>. First edition, actually.

375
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,189
Signed by Robert Louis Stevenson himself.

376
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:43,061
- It's magnificent.
- Take a gander.

377
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:48,297
If it's too hot in here, Mr. Jewett,
just say the word.

378
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,270
I'm afraid I have a tendency
to turn up the heat.

379
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:20,801
Hello, Ms. Chalmers.

380
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,567
- My goodness. What's wrong?
- Where did you...

381
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,336
How long have you been there?

382
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,107
I was just hoping for a cup of coffee.
I didn't realize you were closing.

383
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:34,183
Coffee? Sure, no problem.

384
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:39,985
- You're Mr. Gaunt.
- And you're Polly Chalmers.

385
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:45,650
I'm sorry, I don't shake hands. I have...

386
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:48,191
Arthritis. Forgive me. I forgot.

387
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:00,337
You've been having a devil of a time
with it lately, haven't you?

388
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:05,041
Yes. How did you know?

389
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:07,139
Nettie told me.

390
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:10,114
Here.

391
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:14,551
Just a tiny thank-you note
for that remarkable pie.

392
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,064
My Lord.

393
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:26,329
I don't think I ever had
a tastier cup of coffee.

394
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:33,600
You wouldn't, by any chance,
have something in the way of a doughnut?

395
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:36,271
Something I might dunk, Ms. Chalmers?

396
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:42,379
Please, we're going to be neighbors.
Why don't you call me Polly?

397
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:09,139
Go on.

398
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:20,346
Oh, no! No! No! Shit!

399
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:29,728
- Dan, it's me.
- Jesus! What the hell are you doing?

400
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,633
You scared the hell out of me,
sneaking up on me like that.

401
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:35,762
- Put the gun down, Dan.
- Yeah.

402
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,912
Another couple of seconds, I would've been
out of here. You would've missed me.

403
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:47,141
- What can I do for you?
- I had a call from the state auditors.

404
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:48,241
Yeah?

405
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:52,414
We have an Appropriations Committee
meeting next week to discuss budgets.

406
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:55,822
- Guess what. It's on my calendar.
- They wanna be there.

407
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:59,453
They want me to bring them printouts,
shit from city hall.

408
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:04,390
Yeah, you know those bastards.
They're on some kind of fishing expedition.

409
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:06,802
What the hell's going on?

410
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:15,669
I've been having some bad luck
at the track lately.

411
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:21,113
So I borrowed some money from the town
petty cash fund to cover the shortfall.

412
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,583
Jesus, Dan.

413
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:26,550
I'm gonna pay it back.
I was gonna pay it back before next week.

414
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:30,024
- Honest to God.
- How much we talking about here?

415
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:34,920
- $20,000.
- $20,000? Jesus Christ!

416
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:38,559
I'm getting a loan on my dealership
to pay it back, from Boston.

417
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:39,693
When?

418
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:43,200
Any day now.
Two days, four days, next week.

419
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:44,500
Four days?

420
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:50,738
Done.

421
00:41:07,397 --> 00:41:09,729
You stall them for me, all right?

422
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,963
- Yeah. I will. Till Monday.
- Okay, thanks a lot...

423
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:20,605
- Believe me, I'll make it worth your while.
- Like hell, you will. Just pay it back.

424
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:24,306
I just meant if you wanted a deal
on a new boat. It's all I meant, I swear.

425
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,111
Whatever you want. And for Polly, too.

426
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,649
- I'll get her a deal on...
- Monday!

427
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:47,369
How's my boy?

428
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:52,837
You have something that's mine, Brian,
that you haven't finished paying for.

429
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:56,470
- But you said I could have it if...
- The dealing isn't done, you see...

430
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:59,873
...until Mr. Gaunt says the dealing is done.

431
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:33,875
<i>And away they go!</i>

432
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,351
<i>She's A Hell-Raiser breaks on top</i>
<i>and goes straight to the lead... </i>

433
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,752
<i>... followed by Confucius Sings and Mr. Lee. </i>

434
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:44,089
<i>Lots Of Luck having a go wide, turning. </i>
<i>She's A Hell-Raiser... </i>

435
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:49,663
Yeah! Boy, what the hell?

436
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:54,537
- That was pretty fine.
- Fine as paint.

437
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,936
- Can I...
- Careful. See, this is no ordinary toy.

438
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:05,103
- What is it?
- You see, the man who sold this to me...

439
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:10,283
...his father made their fortune from it.

440
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:14,082
Every morning he'd take
the day's racing form...

441
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:17,257
...and run its races
before they ever happened...

442
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:19,625
...one by one, right on this board.

443
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:24,289
He'd give each tin horse
the real name from the paper...

444
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:27,697
...do it just by touching and whispering.

445
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:32,437
- A brand-new name.
- Citation.

446
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:34,676
Sea Biscuit, Well Away...

447
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:38,209
- Seattle Slew.
- Man O' War.

448
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,280
Whoever were running that day.

449
00:43:40,683 --> 00:43:44,141
Wind her up, let her go.

450
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:46,447
Run the whole damn slate that way!

451
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:48,415
Northern Dancer.

452
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:50,886
Eight, ten, a dozen races.

453
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,758
Then go right to the track,
and bet on those fillies...

454
00:43:53,863 --> 00:43:57,629
...that won on this astonishing toy
from Japan Incorporated.

455
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:01,861
He'd rake in the cash, Dan.
Rake in the goddamn cash.

456
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:03,769
Rake in the cash.

457
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,073
How much?

458
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:19,921
Good day to you.

459
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:22,048
- Good morning, Father.
- Father.

460
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,923
- What do you want?
- Coffee and the usual.

461
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,365
Hey, Corn Cobb.

462
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:33,329
- What's the button on your boob?
- You're crazy.

463
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:40,574
- You leave me alone!
- Take it easy, Nettie.

464
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,272
Put the knife down.

465
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,411
Put it down.

466
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:52,146
Okay, Wilma. What'll it be?

467
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:58,220
Raider on rye, a little glass of puppy pus,
and two nice doggie eyes.

468
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:01,354
- Why don't you just order up or get out?
- Wilma.

469
00:45:02,765 --> 00:45:05,996
- Shit.
- It's okay.

470
00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:08,332
I'll go talk to her.

471
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,493
April Dreaming, Junction Salute.

472
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,421
She's A Hell-Raiser.

473
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:39,700
Tammy's Wonder, Easy Sweep.

474
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,563
That's My Boy.

475
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:48,339
Yes, okay, little puppies.
You ready now? Let's run a good race.

476
00:45:48,444 --> 00:45:51,470
- Ready, set, go!
- <i>And away they go!</i>

477
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:54,277
<i>And it's Tammy's Wonder. April Dreaming. </i>

478
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:58,184
<i>Junction Salute on the outside. </i>
<i>And Easy Sweep is far back. </i>

479
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,656
<i>- Into the far turn. </i>
- Neck and neck!

480
00:46:02,425 --> 00:46:05,861
- <i>Tammy's Wonder on the inside... </i>
- Tammy's Wonder!

481
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,658
<i>Tammy's Wonder's gonna go on to win. </i>
<i>Tammy's Wonder from April Dreaming. </i>

482
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:14,936
We've got Love My Martinis, Trentier...

483
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,836
...Doubter's Ridge, Rancadoo...

484
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:21,238
...By George, and Confucius Sings.

485
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:24,871
Little Chinese puppy.
Okay, fellas, now, let's go.

486
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,143
Make money for daddy!

487
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,218
<i>And they're off!</i>

488
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:34,053
- It's the white one, the red one.
- Danforth?

489
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:36,455
It's the green one. God, they're beautiful.

490
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:40,690
Look at those beautiful horses!
Run, run, run! Come on!

491
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:44,889
Come on. Come on, horsies.
Who's gonna win here?

492
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,971
- Danforth?
- Goddamn it! Go away!

493
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,734
I'll be out when I'm out.

494
00:46:51,874 --> 00:46:54,707
- Aren't you going to work?
- I am at work!

495
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,444
Would you like me
to go down to the bakery...

496
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:01,745
...and maybe get some
honey-dipped doughnuts?

497
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:06,351
Yeah. Honey-dipped doughnuts.

498
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:10,787
Yeah, toilet paper, a nose job.
Just leave me alone!

499
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:15,721
You ready now? Let's run a good race.
Ready, set, go! They're off!

500
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:19,199
And they're coming around the corner.

501
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:24,672
It's a runaway victory!
Yeah! Come on, come on!

502
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,967
Yeah!

503
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:06,879
<i>Good boy. Sit. </i>

504
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,614
Stay. Mommy's got to go scoot
and do something for Mr. Gaunt...

505
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:17,688
...before it gets dark.

506
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:20,995
But don't you worry.

507
00:48:21,764 --> 00:48:24,858
Mommy's going to lock all our doors
from now on.

508
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:29,663
Stay.

509
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:59,232
Lovely day.

510
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:06,240
Come on, girls.

511
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:13,204
<i>The crowd is tense. </i>
<i>Brian Rusk doing the pitching. </i>

512
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:17,786
<i>And let me tell you, he is really</i>
<i>sensational. He's working on the no-hitter. </i>

513
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:21,688
<i>We're in the bottom of the ninth inning. </i>
<i>A count of 2 and 2 on the batter. </i>

514
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:24,352
<i>Two men on base,</i>
<i>but Brian has walked them both. </i>

515
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,827
<i>Right now, he's checking the runners</i>
<i>leading off first and second. </i>

516
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,991
<i>He's gotten the sign from the catcher,</i>
<i>the runners lead away... </i>

517
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:32,694
<i>... and here's the pitch. </i>

518
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:35,771
<i>Strike three! How about that?</i>

519
00:49:37,006 --> 00:49:39,600
<i>Will he make that no-hitter, or will he not?</i>

520
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:46,643
<i>Brian Rusk. Man alive!</i>
<i>Is he really sharp today. </i>

521
00:49:46,716 --> 00:49:50,982
<i>Sensational control</i>
<i>of his 90 mile-an-hour fast ball. </i>

522
00:49:51,354 --> 00:49:55,290
<i>Still the chance of the no-hitter,</i>
<i>and he's ready to work. </i>

523
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:03,326
<i>Rusk has got a swift curve ball</i>
<i>that's dipping and darting. </i>

524
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:05,890
<i>And his fast ball, they can't touch it. </i>

525
00:50:06,669 --> 00:50:09,137
<i>Brian Rusk is delivering a performance... </i>

526
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:12,197
<i>... that can take the Yankees</i>
<i>to another World Series. </i>

527
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:13,799
<i>How about that?</i>

528
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:21,612
<i>Brian Rusk is ready, and he delivers. </i>
<i>And the pitch... </i>

529
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,924
Jesus Christ.

530
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,558
Good girls.

531
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,731
Yessiree.

532
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,268
We're having fun now.

533
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:06,193
Raider!

534
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:09,055
Little pal!

535
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:21,299
Raider. How they hanging?

536
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:30,649
Good fella. Yeah. Ain't you?

537
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,119
And ain't you got a face
just cute as a baby bug?

538
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,281
Yes, you do.

539
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:40,693
And you know what I got?
I got a beautiful jacket.

540
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,464
Yes, I do.

541
00:51:43,232 --> 00:51:45,132
And you know what else?

542
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:47,295
I'm gonna keep it.

543
00:52:02,985 --> 00:52:05,954
They're rounding the bend,
and yellow, and white, and pink...

544
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:24,061
"Punky Boy. " Yeah.

545
00:52:56,505 --> 00:53:02,171
"Gasco Thunder, Hooded Lady,
Mr. P, Lotsa Luck, and Rosie D...

546
00:53:03,212 --> 00:53:06,943
"... Punky Boy, Raise The Dead,
Frank's The Name, Gimme Shelter...

547
00:53:07,016 --> 00:53:08,483
"... Sudden Fame. "

548
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,143
God! I'll kill him! I'll fucking kill him!

549
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,949
Ridgewick!

550
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,481
Raider?

551
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,096
Mommy's home.

552
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,390
Raid?

553
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,426
What the fuck?

554
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,242
That bitch!

555
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,551
You killed my doggie, you bitch!

556
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,254
You broke my microwave, you crazy fuck!

557
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:17,652
Wilma?

558
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,320
See the windows?

559
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,693
They're busted!
