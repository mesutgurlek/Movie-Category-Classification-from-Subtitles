1
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,846
Cotton.

2
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:28,941
Well, what's this? I got him.

3
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,108
No!

4
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,944
- What's this?
- That would be a troublemaker,

5
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,356
- a little troublemaker.
- You think you're going to church?

6
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,715
- Yes.
- Jump in the shower, honey.

7
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,060
We're going to church.
Going to church. We are going.

8
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,494
Come on, come on, come on.

9
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,569
Want to get the door? Thank you, Justin.

10
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:51,964
Thanks.

11
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,334
One of the most anointed men of God
that I think I've ever met in my life,

12
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,402
- I think you know my son.
- Yeah.

13
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,643
I think you know my son. Yeah.

14
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,053
Reverend Cotton Marcus.
Let's give another hand for Jesus.

15
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,617
<i>I started preaching pretty young.</i>

16
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,854
<i>You know, my father was a preacher,
and every preacher has to have a hook</i>

17
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,057
that's gonna bring the people in,
that's gonna get them saved

18
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,094
and, well, frankly, get them in their wallet,
'cause a church doesn't run on love,

19
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,596
<i>and, you know,
the child preacher was a great novelty.</i>

20
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,798
<i>So, he started grooming me
in order to preach.</i>

21
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,801
<i>Other kids were outside playing,
and I'd be learning the Gospel of John.</i>

22
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,104
<i>And by the time he invited me up
on the pulpit one Sunday,</i>

23
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,405
<i>you know, as a surprise,</i>

24
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,340
to let the people know
and the congregation know

25
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,956
that the Holy Spirit had visited his son,

26
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:43,315
as spontaneous as that act
may have seemed to the congregation,

27
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,454
we were ready.

28
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:50,122
I'm saying right here, if you want an answer,
if you want to know...

29
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,923
- Do you want to know?
- Yes!

30
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,426
Look right here!
It's right here, brother. Right?

31
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,461
<i>Well, Cotton is quite a character.</i>

32
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,532
He's what you would call a performer,
a showman, a...

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,733
He's a natural creative.

34
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:06,138
<i>For example, we have a local theater here,
and Cotton writes plays,</i>

35
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,206
<i>and he's making
these little mini movies now.</i>

36
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,109
<i>He's built props for them, special effects.
Oh, my goodness.</i>

37
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,979
I mean,
he entertains like nobody's business.

38
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,114
And, you know, it starts here with us,

39
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,457
<i>but, of course,
it carries on into his professional life.</i>

40
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,186
Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
Yes, you do!

41
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,755
<i>I mean, so many churches are boring.
People don't want to go,</i>

42
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,371
<i>but when Cotton's there, it is never boring.</i>

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,561
Folks, I'm here to tell you today
that the world is filled

44
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,963
with many, many faces.

45
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,465
- Amen.
- Amen.

46
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,168
Right?
Now, some of those faces, they're good.

47
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,936
They're right with God. Right?

48
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,805
And some of those faces,
they're gonna lie to you.

49
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,640
- You gotta watch out for them.
- Absolutely.

50
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,808
So, I'm here to tell you today,

51
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,676
make sure you don't fall for a pretty face,
all right?

52
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:45,844
- Amen.
- Amen.

53
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,894
'Cause that pretty face just may indeed be
the prince of lies.

54
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,584
- That's right.
- Yeah.

55
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:57,135
'Cause I'll tell you right now,
his lies are everywhere.

56
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,857
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

57
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,259
<i>It's all about rhythm.
And you get them going,</i>

58
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,727
you hallelujah, and blood of Christ.

59
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,262
- They love the blood, and...
- They love the blood?

60
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,664
Yeah, I mean,
they're practically not listening.

61
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,499
You get them in the right spot,
they're not even listening.

62
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,700
- I mean...
- No, they're listening.

63
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,303
No, they're so much so not listening,
I could talk about anything.

64
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,107
I could talk about
my mom's banana bread recipe in the...

65
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,274
- Oh, God, no.
- You don't think so?

66
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,542
- See, now you're...
- You don't think so?

67
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,710
No, you're underestimating your crowd.

68
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,846
When I go back in there,
I will preach a banana bread sermon.

69
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,224
- No, don't do that. That's embarrassing.
- I'll bet you 10 bucks.

70
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,151
Do you believe that if you go ahead
and allow the Holy Ghost into your heart,

71
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,753
you can be cleansed of all your sins
and sit in the kingdom of God?

72
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,288
- Amen.
- That is what I'm talking about.

73
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,823
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen.

74
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,191
- Can I get a hallelujah?
- Hallelujah.

75
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,527
- Can I get a hallelujah and an amen?
- Hallelujah, amen.

76
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,929
Do you know if you take two ripe bananas,
you put them in a bowl,

77
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,065
and you put some sugar
and you go ahead then bake it for 400,

78
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,833
you can go and pull it out
and have yourself banana bread?

79
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,735
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

80
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,680
Hallelujah, yes, you can.

81
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,715
Praise Jesus, praise Jesus.

82
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,079
We're in my dad's office,
and actually, that's very special,

83
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,819
'cause he doesn't let anybody in his office.

84
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,782
Don't let them see the combination, Dad.

85
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,261
I won't. Yeah.

86
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,628
Yeah, please don't film this combination,
sir, it's...

87
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,534
To be honest with you,
I'm the only one that knows it.

88
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,627
Me and my accountant.

89
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,229
This is the Hortus deliciarum.

90
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,532
There are about 20 in the whole world.

91
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,100
You can show it to them. Show it to them.

92
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:19,685
This book describes
the various kinds of demons.

93
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,374
Helps you identify them,

94
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:27,479
and then recommends the process
for getting rid of that demon.

95
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:33,395
We have had exorcists in our family
for generations.

96
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,454
Generations. And, we...

97
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,900
How many exorcisms you think
you've done with this book?

98
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,276
Hundred and fifty.
Hundred and fifty exorcisms, yeah.

99
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:49,034
Lucifer, indeed, was an angel at one point.

100
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,636
Some people say that he was actually
the choirmaster of heaven,

101
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,940
<i>for lack of a better word.
He was helping raise hosannas to God,</i>

102
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,042
<i>but he decided
he wanted the praise himself,</i>

103
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,644
<i>and with that, God cast him out of heaven.</i>

104
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,013
<i>He took a third of the host of heaven
with him,</i>

105
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,282
<i>and those are your demons
that you have today.</i>

106
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,219
<i>And then what you have, basically,
is the set-up of the entire Bible.</i>

107
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,788
<i>You have the soul of man
being fought over.</i>

108
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:13,158
<i>God wants you to turn to the light of him,
and Satan wants to grab your soul.</i>

109
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,728
<i>Because ultimately Satan wants
to overthrow God, so you have this clash.</i>

110
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,242
The Bible is filled with demons.

111
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,466
If you believe in God,
you have to believe in the devil.

112
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,867
Jesus himself was an exorcist.

113
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,804
Therefore, if you are Christian
and you believe in the Bible

114
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,820
and you believe in Jesus Christ,
you have to believe in demons.

115
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,422
Mostly people contact me by my website.

116
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,696
Yeah. But this, this is old school. Yeah.

117
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,834
That's from Ivanwood. This is from Georgia.

118
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,566
And this one says,
"Please open immediately. Urgent."

119
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,235
<i>Exorcism is alive and well
in the present age.</i>

120
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,405
People think of it as being a scourge
of the Middle Ages

121
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,575
that somehow went away
and was cured by science,

122
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,744
but the fact of the matter is
it's never gone away.

123
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,089
Exorcism today
is bigger than it's ever been.

124
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:14,019
The Vatican used to have, like,
20 or 25 sanctioned exorcists on the staff.

125
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,022
Now they have well over 300,
and that's just what they're telling us.

126
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,524
And, you know,
they're not telling us everything.

127
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,127
And that's just the Roman Catholic Church.

128
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,895
They get all the press
'cause they got the movie,

129
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,864
- and that's what's sort of culturally...
- Right.

130
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,399
But the reality of it

131
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,539
is that exorcisms are performed
by every religion all over the world.

132
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,643
As a little boy, I thought this was
in every newspaper all over the world.

133
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,883
Tell me what your dad does.

134
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:45,561
He fights with the demons
and the vampires and all the ghosts

135
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,128
and all the monsters.

136
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,456
And fights all the ghosts
and the demons and the vampires?

137
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,590
And the monsters.

138
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,365
Do you believe in ghosts?

139
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,038
Does your dad believe in ghosts?

140
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,370
I do not believe in actual demons, no. No.

141
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,614
But when I was doing exorcisms,
you know, I acted like I did.

142
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,976
It's not like I saw any demons
come out of anybody.

143
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,146
So, for the last something-odd years,
you've just been a fraud?

144
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,382
That's your word, not mine.
I wouldn't say that.

145
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,150
I would say that for the last couple of years,

146
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,086
what I've been doing
is doing what I've always been doing,

147
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:25,694
which is delivering a service for a person
who needs it in a way that they need it.

148
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,025
I'm not saying I'm a doctor,

149
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,462
but I am saying that I helped heal people
from what ailed them.

150
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,064
And what ailed them sometimes
was the thought in their brain

151
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,799
that they were possessed by a devil,

152
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:39,537
and if I helped make that thought go away
and they felt better, so be it.

153
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,382
<i>I got a life, I got a family to feed.
At least that's how I used to justify it.</i>

154
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,978
<i>Well, basically, everything changed
when Justin was born.</i>

155
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,515
<i>He was born early, and so there was
a while where we weren't sure</i>

156
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,051
<i>our son was gonna be alive,</i>

157
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,521
and then finally,
we found out that he was gonna be okay.

158
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,691
And in that moment,
Cotton was so relieved,

159
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,861
and he was just, like,
"We are so lucky, we are so lucky."

160
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,929
The best I can do is say,
"Thank you, Doctor," you know?

161
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,532
I should have been thanking God,
but that wasn't my first thought.

162
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,275
I mean, it just wasn't.
And that realization really shook me.

163
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,239
<i>That was a real crisis of faith.</i>

164
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,509
<i>I started to question whether I actually ever
even believed in God in the first place.</i>

165
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,078
<i>I just... Boom, you know,
I started preaching so early and kept going.</i>

166
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,880
<i>Yeah, I was good,
and I got rewarded for being good,</i>

167
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:22,981
<i>and so who wants to stop that?</i>

168
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,084
So, even when I started to have
this revelation

169
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,519
of maybe I don't believe in God,

170
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,689
and yet I'm still presenting myself
as a preacher, it didn't stop me.

171
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,068
I mean, I was on autopilot. It's what I do.

172
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,164
But it wasn't easy. You know, it got harder.
There's no doubt about that.

173
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,577
He would have quit eventually,
at some point anyway,

174
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:47,446
but there was this one story,
this little boy named Victor.

175
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,221
His name was Victor Turoy,
from Harrisburg, Texas.

176
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,645
<i>This little boy was autistic,</i>

177
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,251
<i>and he was suffocated to death
during an exorcism,</i>

178
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,486
with well-meaning people trying to get
this demon out of this child.

179
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,623
I read that article and at the same time,
Justin was about this boy's age,

180
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,092
and I started having
this recurring nightmare

181
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,627
<i>where I was the exorcist</i>

182
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,363
<i>and I was wrapping a plastic bag
around my own son's head.</i>

183
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,166
I was watching my son die every night,
and I'd wake up in a cold sweat.

184
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,603
It was not long after that,
I was in there washing dishes,

185
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,904
and he came out of the office,

186
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,885
<i>and he had this story about the new pope
opening an exorcism academy.</i>

187
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,213
<i>I mean, he was visibly shaken,</i>

188
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,347
and he said, "Do you know
how many more people this will hurt?"

189
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:33,397
You know, and that's when
I really decided that I was done.

190
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,654
I had to get out of that. I'm not interested
in participating in that whatsoever.

191
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,156
I'm not participating in...

192
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:43,361
What I want to do is expose exorcism
for the scam that it really is,

193
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,629
and that's why we're doing this.

194
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,798
So if I can help expose it for what it really is

195
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:51,110
and save one kid from having
a plastic bag wrapped around his face,

196
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,638
that sounds like God's work.

197
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,773
What I thought we'd do
is that we will open an envelope

198
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,009
and we will follow that request
wherever it takes us,

199
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,012
and I'll let you follow me,

200
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,597
and that way you can film
all the behind the scenes of my exorcism.

201
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:10,054
Pick the one on top.
It's from Ivanwood, Louisiana.

202
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,422
They're basically all the same.

203
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,824
There's a whole bunch of people out there

204
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,826
who are definitely convinced
that they are possessed.

205
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,329
There's probably some sort of crop failure
or something wrong with the livestock.

206
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,880
"I feel that I am dealing with a case
of possession by the devil himself."

207
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,116
"My livestock is being slaughtered nightly."

208
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,054
"Little doubt
that who is doing this gruesome..."

209
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,243
"Please, please, please," right?

210
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,450
Looks like we're going to Ivanwood.

211
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,894
Get Daddy's candlesticks, okay?

212
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,654
- I love you.
- You'll do great. Love you.

213
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:43,860
Give me a hug.

214
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,968
You just really...

215
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,541
Bye, guys. Love you.

216
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,724
It's amazing down here.
It's got a real unique feel.

217
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,364
Nothing like it in any other part
of the country. And it's ancient.

218
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,466
Some of the plantations here have been
standing for, you know, hundreds of years.

219
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,769
And this is the only part of the country
that's been flown under six different flags,

220
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:37,150
so it's a real mix of culture and superstition
and folklore down here.

221
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,213
You've got voodoo, you've got
Roman Catholics, Pentecostalism,

222
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,150
all these different beliefs, you know,
rubbing up against one another.

223
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,426
And they're all looking to save you.
They're all looking to be the answer.

224
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,123
There's a lot of illiteracy
and a lot of poverty,

225
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:58,229
and between that
and the stopped-in-time feel of the place,

226
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:04,247
it's like a perfect breeding ground
for demons and evil and...

227
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,482
Can't fight the devil without the armor.

228
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,827
Granted, it's linen, but it's hot down here.

229
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,631
Sorry, sorry.

230
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,029
Yeah, I'm gonna miss this.

231
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,333
Maybe I'll sell real estate.

232
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,441
Turning onto Louisiana Interstate 39.

233
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,140
Down here, if you ask five people
about a demon story,

234
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,841
they'll give you 10 demon stories.

235
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,043
Yeah? We have time for that?

236
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,818
Sure, absolutely.

237
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,480
About 10 miles out of it.

238
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,249
- Is Bush that way, as well?
- Yeah, Bush is that way there.

239
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,850
- Okay.
- Be careful going down Bush.

240
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,986
You hear so many things about that,
going out there.

241
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,824
I think that the very gates to hell is right
over there, right off of Bush Drive.

242
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,459
- Would you... Would you...
- The very gates to hell.

243
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,561
There was a cult in this area,
and there was a temple.

244
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,431
- A cult?
- It's not... Here, you... That's...

245
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,166
Won't be able to describe
exactly where it is now,

246
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,834
but when you get to the Sweetzer farm,

247
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,302
they'll be able to give you specific...

248
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,137
This guy that ran the cult

249
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:18,576
was so disturbed that he actually thought

250
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:24,749
that he would, like... He needed to,
like, feed, you know, feed human souls...

251
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,451
- Sure.
...to the devil or whatever.

252
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,998
Where's the UFO landing site at?

253
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,098
That is actually in that direction.

254
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,722
Maybe we could ask this guy.

255
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,891
- No, he's stopping, he's stopping.
- He is?

256
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,357
- Hey, afternoon.
- You guys making a movie?

257
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,960
- A documentary, actually. How's it going?
- Great. I like documentaries.

258
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,094
- Cool.
- Good.

259
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,063
Well, we're looking for the Sweetzer farm.
Can you help us?

260
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,898
- What was your name?
- Reverend Cotton Marcus.

261
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,566
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

262
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,335
- The Sweetzer farm, please?
- Yours?

263
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,970
- I'm Iris. This is Daniel.
- Hey.

264
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,405
Sorry, we're just a little behind schedule.
So...

265
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,908
- No, no problem.
- The Sweetzer farm, please.

266
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,710
Right.
Well, you're going the wrong direction.

267
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,646
- You want to make a U-turn, actually.
- Okay.

268
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,948
You want to take this road and go straight.

269
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,084
You'll see things
you've already seen before. Keep on going.

270
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,030
You're gonna hit the highway. Okay?

271
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,167
And then I want you to go back
where you came from.

272
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,626
Are you kidding?

273
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,470
- No, I'm not kidding.
- Gotcha. Thank you.

274
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,933
Sorry about that.

275
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,635
- Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Jesus!

276
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,003
What? What? Keep going!

277
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,676
- What's he doing? What's he doing?
- Jesus Christ, just go! Go!

278
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,542
You okay?

279
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,782
Yeah.

280
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:06,357
Seems like the end of the road.
Well, there's a tractor. That's a good sign.

281
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,368
Here's a farmhouse of some sorts.
This has gotta be it.

282
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,100
You know what?

283
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,469
Let me just make sure it's him
before you guys get out. Okay?

284
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,982
All right.

285
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,477
- Mr. Sweetzer?
- Yeah.

286
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,180
- How you doing? Cotton Marcus.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

287
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,950
Nice to meet you. Pardon my dress,
but it's a work day for me, too.

288
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,918
No, no, no. That's...
I'm dressed for work myself.

289
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,921
I understand that. Well, listen. I can't thank
you enough for coming out here.

290
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,457
Absolutely. I reckon... I just figured...

291
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,860
- Hey. Watch out for this kid.
- Hey.

292
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,531
- We just met him on the road.
- Well, I apologize. That's my son, Caleb.

293
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,366
- My apologies.
- No, what did he do?

294
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,803
Well, you know,
it was probably just a misunderstanding.

295
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,305
We asked for... Doesn't really matter.
Hi, good to see you again.

296
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,674
Hi. Thank you so much.

297
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:07,280
- What's your problem, boy?
- You know they got cameras?

298
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,882
You got cameras?

299
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,651
I was gonna tell you about that.
These are my friends. They came with me.

300
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,987
- This is Iris and...
- Hi. Hi, how are you?

301
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,722
- And Daniel.
- Hi.

302
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,533
Appreciate it.
I'd like you to turn the camera off, though.

303
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,195
Let's go ahead and just turn it off
for right now,

304
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,529
and let's go talk about it, as a matter of fact.

305
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,666
Yeah, great.

306
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,156
This is the second bull I've lost.

307
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,831
Two goats and, I don't know,
several chickens.

308
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,662
Could this have come from an alligator?

309
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,769
But an alligator,
they bite and roll and take chunks.

310
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,902
Not a big, straight cut like that.

311
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,570
You don't think
Caleb could have done this, do you?

312
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,777
No. I'm sure it was Nell.

313
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,679
- And Nell is?
- My daughter.

314
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,591
Right. I knew that.
I remember that from the letter.

315
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,549
I should have read the letter
a little more thoroughly.

316
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:23,361
I thought it was Louis, not Nell.
I don't like working with kids.

317
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,823
That's from last night.

318
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,906
One just like this
every time I lose an animal.

319
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,664
- She doesn't remember this?
- No, sir.

320
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,367
She doesn't remember anything.

321
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:41,248
And so it really frightened her a lot,
and so I just quit asking her about it.

322
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,382
- Hello. Is that Nell?
- Hi. Yes.

323
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,510
Hello, Reverend Marcus.

324
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,845
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

325
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:48,946
- Thank you for coming up.
- Hi.

326
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,722
- Hi.
- Just... Can you come this way?

327
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,519
This is my room.

328
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,388
- Did you do those?
- Yeah.

329
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,800
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

330
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,302
And this is actually
the story of Esther of Antioch.

331
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,443
She's not from the Bible.
It was something I dreamed of.

332
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,336
- Yeah.
- All this artwork and detail,

333
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,006
it's really well thought out.
I'm very, very impressed.

334
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,883
Well, that's...

335
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,844
So, I just want to, you know,
if you don't mind, Nell,

336
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,146
tell me how you're feeling.
Tell me what's been going on.

337
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,448
Your dad told me about the livestock.

338
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,484
What do you know about that?

339
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:31,069
Well, I can only think one thing,
that I killed them.

340
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,532
Do you remember killing them?

341
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,361
- No, but...
- Do you remember getting out of bed?

342
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,063
Do you remember walking down the stairs?

343
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,599
- Do you remember walking outside?
- No.

344
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,869
Do you remember doing anything
to the animals at all?

345
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,037
No, but...

346
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,211
Well, then maybe you didn't do
anything at all.

347
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,748
As I mentioned in my letter,
my wife died two years ago.

348
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,179
It was cancer,

349
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,350
and she was being treated,
we thought successfully, for breast cancer,

350
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:03,888
and then six months later,
it metastasized into her bones,

351
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,698
<i>and three weeks after that she was gone.</i>

352
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,960
<i>It was quite a shock, especially for Nell.
I mean, she was 14 years old.</i>

353
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,264
<i>Just coming into young womanhood,
and so it was very difficult.</i>

354
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,633
I saw that picture downstairs.
You look just like your mother.

355
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,767
- Really?
- Yeah.

356
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,803
- Yeah, I saw the painting downstairs.
- Thank you so much.

357
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,038
That's such a compliment.
She's so beautiful.

358
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,973
She is. Well, so is her daughter, so...

359
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,575
Thank you so much. Thank you, sir.

360
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,912
- Were you very close? Plus being a mom.
- Yeah, she was my best friend.

361
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,359
Yeah. That's safe to say.
She was my best friend.

362
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,062
Did Caleb act any different
after your mom passed?

363
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,664
I think Caleb got frustrated.

364
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,235
He got kind of scary.
He started hating God a lot.

365
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,664
How about your father? How has he been
affected since she's been gone?

366
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,780
It hit him very hard.

367
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,572
It hit him...

368
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:56,440
If it weren't for my wife, Delle,
and the faith that she instilled in me,

369
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,876
I don't think I would have made it through.

370
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,680
So, since she died,
I have been very determined

371
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,317
to give my children
a more fundamental Christian upbringing.

372
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:11,589
<i>I'm not real crazy about the influences
that exist in the world today,</i>

373
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,264
and therefore I decided
to home-school Nell.

374
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,597
For a while, I let her go
to the Sunday school at our local church,

375
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,399
but that just didn't seem right, either.

376
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,903
Pastor Manley didn't really teach
only religious music.

377
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,305
So, that's why he pulled me out.

378
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,707
Your dad likes religious music then?

379
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,442
Yeah. Yeah.

380
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,179
I've tried keeping her
as close as I possibly could,

381
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:39,127
maybe even a little too protective.
I'll admit to that.

382
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:45,766
But somehow, still, the devil got in her.

383
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,369
<i>Her mother gave her a small crucifix,
and it burns her.</i>

384
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,148
<i>The symbol of our Lord,
and she can't wear it.</i>

385
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,246
I don't know if it's Nell
who's going around killing those animals.

386
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,516
I know she's really isolated out here.
That's gotta drive you crazy.

387
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,387
But the burning cross,
that's just like a nickel allergy.

388
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,470
You get a reaction like that on your skin,
especially if you're stressed out.

389
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,238
Hey, son.

390
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,765
Hi.

391
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,404
Why were you throwing rocks at me?

392
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,573
Are you still gonna perform an exorcism?

393
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,350
An exorcism? Well, I don't know.
That's what I'm here to find out.

394
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,624
'Cause, apparently, there's deaths involved
and people have died.

395
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,618
Well, if you're worried
about something like that,

396
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,221
I'm here to go ahead and assure you
nothing like that happens with me.

397
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,822
I'm here to help.

398
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,857
We don't need your help, though.

399
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,460
Well, your livestock do.
They seem to be dying left and right.

400
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,761
You know anything about that?

401
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,164
I know my father's a superstitious drunk.

402
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,299
- Really?
- Yeah.

403
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:06,270
Well, do you think he's superstitious
or drunk enough to harm his own animals?

404
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,906
It's possible, you know. I don't know.

405
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,041
Do you think
Nell had anything to do with it?

406
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:14,178
No, I don't. I don't think Nell's the problem.

407
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,879
Nell doesn't need help.

408
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,281
Well, I...
That remains to be seen, now, doesn't it?

409
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,718
If anything happens to her,
I will hurt you, okay?

410
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,287
And I don't care if the camera's watching.

411
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,632
Okay? It can watch all it wants.
I will hurt you.

412
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,302
- Thank you.
- Thank you, son.

413
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,908
Thank you.

414
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,900
There you go. Nice and relaxed.

415
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,402
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No.

416
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,705
Okay, 'cause you can't be nervous
when I do this.

417
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,008
- Okay. Let's try again. There you go.
- Okay.

418
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,609
- Feel any pressure?
- A little.

419
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,054
You do?

420
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,548
Well, my throat's been a little sore
'cause I've been waking up screaming.

421
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,250
So, you have a sore throat, as well?

422
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,619
Well, just 'cause I've been waking
up screaming, like I said before.

423
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,655
That's all right.
There's nothing to be nervous about.

424
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,392
It's absolutely fine.
Night sweats and night fevers

425
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,362
and the loss of appetite
and fatigue in the afternoon and...

426
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,000
- Whoa.
- What?

427
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,239
- What?
- An...

428
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:11,902
What?

429
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,518
Let me have your finger. Come here.

430
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,974
Right back here. Can you feel that?

431
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,352
Right there, that indention?
Nell, look straight ahead, please.

432
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,381
Have you always had it this deep?

433
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,784
- Have you guys checked this at all?
- I guess it's deeper now, but...

434
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:27,918
Yeah, it's a lot deeper now.

435
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,889
Louis, would you get me a pan of water
big enough to go ahead and put her feet in.

436
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,458
- Pan of water. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

437
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,227
I need you to take
your socks and shoes off, okay?

438
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,029
Very pretty shoes you got.

439
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,474
Thank you.

440
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,679
I like your shoes. They're real nifty.

441
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,687
Want to try them on? Here you go.

442
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,911
Hey, they look good on you.

443
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,379
They look...

444
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,480
They're yours.

445
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,282
- No way, Miss Iris.
- Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.

446
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,284
- I got a pair of Converse in the car.
- No, please. I mean...

447
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,554
You look good in them, and I'm sure
you can't find them in 300-mile radius, so...

448
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,590
Oh my, Miss Iris. This is the nicest thing
that's ever happened.

449
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,899
Dad, look. Miss Iris gave me her boots.

450
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:13,764
Well, let's take them off your feet right now.
How about that for starters?

451
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,504
There you go.

452
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,902
Okay, lift them up.

453
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,806
Let's all close our eyes for a moment.
Let's all close our eyes and pray to Jesus

454
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,286
to help us out
in this time of need right now.

455
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:30,485
Oh, Lord, we ask you
to please give us your strength,

456
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,352
give us your hope and give us your clarity.
Please help us.

457
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,856
We ask you to please take care of Nell,

458
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:43,160
and in this test, may you please show us
an unadulterated sign

459
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,362
of whether or not we should continue
upon this way,

460
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,698
if we should go ahead and indeed find out
whether we should

461
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,906
- continue down the path...
- Reverend Marcus.

462
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,945
Is this regular water?

463
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,082
Yes.

464
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,527
That's the temperature change.

465
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:12,527
I was afraid of this.
We will proceed with the exorcism.

466
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,506
It's okay.

467
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:23,003
I'm afraid that I suspect that Nell
is possessed with a demon named...

468
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,269
"Abalam."

469
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,475
Abalam.

470
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,207
What is this? What is...
What kind of language is this part?

471
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,843
- Do you not read Latin?
- No, sir.

472
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,511
- It's all right. I got it for you.
- So...

473
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,217
What this tells us is...

474
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,817
Abalam. Inside. Abalam.

475
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,557
- Right there. See, you can see.
- Right, right.

476
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,556
What it says is he's very powerful.

477
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,158
He is perhaps the most powerful being
in the entire book.

478
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,359
What he does is like a snake.

479
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,965
He wraps himself around the coil,
the soul of the person,

480
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,199
and that is why
there's the temperature fluctuation,

481
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,334
up, down, like Nell was showing.

482
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:02,419
The thing about Abalam is that he preys
on the flesh of the innocent.

483
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,443
He defiles the flesh of the innocent.

484
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,786
- That is what he does.
- Defile?

485
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,189
And it's particularly bad
when he's in young girls.

486
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,864
Look at him.

487
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:20,868
It says right here that the possessed's
only salvation will come in death.

488
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,543
What? The only salvation is death?

489
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,445
Unless she is exorcised.

490
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,738
You're a fraud.

491
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,481
Hello, Caleb.

492
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,585
You threw something in there.

493
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,914
I saw you. But I won't tell, okay?

494
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,758
I don't know what you're talking about.

495
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,796
That was really good.

496
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,766
We don't have any problems now.

497
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,430
This will shake nicely.

498
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,112
Come in.

499
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,558
Come now. Stand here for a second.

500
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,452
Caleb, if you would, over there.
Louis, beside her.

501
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,754
Nell, go ahead. Get on the bed.

502
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:36,033
You can sit or you can lay down.
Whatever makes you comfortable.

503
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,566
Are you comfortable?

504
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,402
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Nothing to be nervous about.

505
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,904
Gentlemen, I do not need your help
unless I ask for it.

506
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,339
I ask you to respectfully stay over there.

507
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,742
What I need from you gentlemen
is your faith.

508
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,145
- Yes, sir.
- Your courage and your love.

509
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:59,650
Because why we are here is because
we love Nell, and we want Nell to get better.

510
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,852
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, Reverend.

511
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,588
Well, then let's do that. Let's start
by praying to the Lord, our God above.

512
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,390
Please, let us close our eyes.

513
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,725
"Beside restful waters, he leads me.
He refreshes my soul.

514
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,495
"He guides me in the right paths,
for his namesake.

515
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,831
"Even though I walk in the dark valley,
I shall fear no evil,

516
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,535
"for you are by my side with your rod
and your staff that give me courage."

517
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,103
- Do you have courage, Nell?
- Yes, sir.

518
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,772
- Do you believe in Jesus Christ, Nell?
- Yes, sir.

519
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,573
Do you believe
that Jesus can get this demon out of you?

520
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,043
- Yes, sir.
- Then let him expel the demon from you.

521
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,278
I say, demon, begone,
in the name of Jesus Christ.

522
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,114
I say, demon, cast yourself out.
Leave this girl.

523
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,184
In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord,
and the blood that washes over her,

524
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,719
I say, demon, begone!

525
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,062
I command thee to begone!

526
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:45,509
No, demon. Don't listen.
Pay no attention. Don't listen at all.

527
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,437
No. No, no.

528
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,303
- Don't worry.
- Hey.

529
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,181
Don't listen to that, Louis. Pay no attention.

530
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:00,043
Pay no attention! For he is the father of lies.

531
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,246
All he knows are lies,
where all we know, the father of love.

532
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,448
- Oh, my God.
- The prince of peace.

533
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,950
- Our Father who art in heaven...
- The God above who shall save you all.

534
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,752
...please, please!
- Save you all, save you all

535
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,336
by the power, by the power,
name and authority of Jesus Christ, as it...

536
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,459
Sound is so important. Got my player.

537
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,441
I go ahead and program
over 800 different demon sounds.

538
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,070
Trust in the Lord. The Lord shall save you.

539
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,005
- Reverend, the...
- The Lord shall provide for you.

540
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,141
- Reverend, he is here! He's here!
- The laws of our God.

541
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,777
Do you believe in Christ?
Do you believe that Christ shall heal you?

542
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,213
Do you believe that Christ
can heal you, Nell? Can Christ heal you?

543
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,148
- Yes, Christ can heal me.
- Then be healed!

544
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,684
That's right. Be healed! Be healed.

545
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,952
- Say, I love Jesus.
- I love Jesus!

546
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,354
Say that I love Jesus! I love Jesus Christ.

547
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,868
Believe in Christ Jesus, be saved. Saved!

548
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,927
These are two 9-volt batteries,
and attached are wires at the end.

549
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,197
And then you go ahead and run
one of the wires down the sleeve,

550
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,365
and then you attach it right in there.

551
00:31:55,513 --> 00:32:00,270
Believe, believe! Believe, believe, believe!

552
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,817
Oh, my God...

553
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,021
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command thee to leave!

554
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,923
In the blood of Christ, demon, get thee out!

555
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,929
I can't do it.

556
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,563
You have to. You have to.

557
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,462
God, take me!
Take the demon from this girl.

558
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,800
Grant me thy will, O Lord!
Take the demon, O Lord!

559
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,711
Let me take the demon!

560
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,724
- Praise God.
- Oh, God.

561
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:43,680
<i>The demon is gone.</i>

562
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:44,815
<i>Are you okay?</i>

563
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:49,252
<i>The demon is gone. The demon could not
withstand the sign of our Lord!</i>

564
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,731
<i>Praise God!</i>

565
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,676
You're okay?

566
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,413
- How's she doing? Yeah.
- She's sleeping like a child.

567
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,522
With a little smile on her face.

568
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,780
That's fantastic.

569
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:20,022
- It's all there?
- There's no reason to count it.

570
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,988
Thank you. Take care.

571
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,791
- Thank you all. Thank you.
- What?

572
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,705
- No, I was just saying thank you.
- What? I can't hear you.

573
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,739
Reverend?

574
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,213
I don't understand.

575
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,377
Reverend.

576
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,881
The Lord has a prophecy for you, Louis.

577
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,844
The Lord says he knows your pain.

578
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,714
He knows
that you're sad for your wife to be gone.

579
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,729
The Lord says, rejoice for she is with him.

580
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,952
The Lord does not want
you to bottle it up inside.

581
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,388
The Lord does not want you to stuff
your anger and your sorrow

582
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,023
and your burden into this bottle
and drink from it.

583
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,625
- No, sir.
- He does not want you to do that.

584
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,294
- No, sir, no. Lord, I won't.
- He does not want you to hide.

585
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,097
- I won't.
- He wants you to smash that bottle,

586
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,100
and in its place,
he wants you to accept love.

587
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,035
He wants you to accept the Lord's love.

588
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,549
I will. Thank you, Lord.

589
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,045
That was highly impressive.

590
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,516
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

591
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,848
Much more than I expected.

592
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,023
- Hey, Louis.
- Yes, sir.

593
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,591
Now, just remember.

594
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,461
I took the devil out of your house,
but it's your job to keep him out.

595
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,463
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

596
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,666
Now, listen. You sure
I can't convince y'all to stay with us?

597
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,167
No, no, no. Thank you for your hospitality.

598
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,902
We're gonna find a motel up the road.

599
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,381
- All right.
- Take care.

600
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,814
She did? Well, why don't you put her on?

601
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:01,918
Can you do that for me?
I love you, too. Brush your teeth.

602
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,158
Brush them.

603
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:07,100
Justin said you were crying. Is that true?
What's going on?

604
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,563
We're paid up on that.
He needs a new hearing aid.

605
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,509
We are paid up on that. I am sure of it.

606
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,974
Who's Cassandra?

607
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,180
You know,
I used to want to have a TV ministry.

608
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,457
I thought that'd be cool.

609
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,387
And now, frankly,
all I really want is health insurance.

610
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,419
- You got what you needed today?
- Yes, really, really awesome stuff.

611
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,331
- Thank you. You have a good night.
- All right.

612
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,164
- Good night, good night.
- Good night.

613
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,995
What is she doing here?
What is she doing here?

614
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,964
- I don't know.
- What can I do?

615
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,799
I don't know. She hasn't said a word.

616
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,901
Nell? Can you hear me?

617
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,469
She hasn't responded
to anything I've said so far.

618
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,505
- Where's her dad?
- I have no idea. That's why I called you.

619
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,107
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I woke up. She was standing here.

620
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,476
- Nell. Nell.
- Daniel, stay back, okay?

621
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,114
I think she's bleeding.

622
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,493
Nell, are you okay? Honey?

623
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,264
Honey, can you hear me?

624
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,463
Okay, be gentle with her.
I'm gonna call her dad.

625
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,205
Honey, can you tell us how you got here?

626
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,521
Honey.

627
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,660
I'm not getting any answer here.

628
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,134
Nell, stop.

629
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,606
Okay. No, we need to get her to a hospital.

630
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:31,609
Nell. Nell. Oh, my God.

631
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,745
I've seen people react, but not 10 hours
after the fact in my hotel room.

632
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,481
Their farm is 5 miles away from the hotel,

633
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,117
and how did she even know
where I was staying?

634
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,857
And that's why I don't work with kids.

635
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,720
Is there a doctor around?
We have a little girl who's sick.

636
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,056
Well, yes, but what...
Hey, where are you going with that camera?

637
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,157
- Sorry. He's with me.
- He's with us.

638
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,693
Okay, well, he can't be with you.
He's gonna have to turn the camera off.

639
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,428
- Okay, well, he's not gonna shoot inside.
- That's fine.

640
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,697
As a matter of fact,
I need him to turn it off and take it outside.

641
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,066
- We don't allow filming in here.
- Okay, okay. All right, that's fine.

642
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,300
I understand. No problem. We'll turn it off.

643
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,568
What part of turn the camera off
do you not get?

644
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,650
Take the camera outside
or I'm going to call security.

645
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,677
Excuse me, sir?

646
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,421
Thank you.

647
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,347
- Is that the doctor?
- Yes, but that camera is turned off?

648
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,360
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

649
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,152
Well, it looks like we got
most of the blood tests back...

650
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,354
- And?
...and everything appears to be normal.

651
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,956
So, what we're gonna do
is let her continue to rest right now.

652
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,125
Can you run
some sort of psychiatric tests on her?

653
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,227
No, we'd have to have
the parents' permission to do that.

654
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,428
Now, what we're gonna do is,

655
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,168
we're gonna wait
for the rest of the tests to come back.

656
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,044
This is Mr. Sweetzer.

657
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,479
Louis Sweetzer, I'd like to see my daughter.

658
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,081
- This is the father.
- Mr. Sweetzer, if you can wait just a minute,

659
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,616
let me see
if I can get in touch with the doctor.

660
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:54,984
- So, this is...
- She was standing, babbling,

661
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,352
- then she was lying on the bed.
- Well...

662
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,254
You watched her do all this?
Why didn't you call?

663
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,857
I did call you, but nobody answered.

664
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,427
Louis, I feel very strongly that she needs to
have some professional take a look at her.

665
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:05,695
- She's a young girl. A doctor...
- Excuse me.

666
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,363
- Yeah? Pardon me.
- Mr. Sweetzer.

667
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,631
Thank you.
If you could sign this and give me...

668
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:09,766
What is this?

669
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,334
That's gonna be
a release for your daughter.

670
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,037
This is just for release.
It's not about any tests or anything?

671
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,138
- No, sir.
- Do you have the form

672
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,173
that he could sign
in order to get psychiatric tests?

673
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,375
- Can we have that?
- Mr. Sweetzer hasn't asked for any forms.

674
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,843
- Louis, how do you get... Since we're here.
- No.

675
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,016
- I'll let him talk to the doctor.
- Please, you didn't...

676
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,515
It looked like
the sort of thing for a young girl,

677
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,952
- considering what she's been through...
- I think we know what Nell...

678
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,590
Mr. Sweetzer.

679
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,822
Nell, how you doing?

680
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,325
Do you remember
being at the hotel last night?

681
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,695
- Did you know you were at his hotel?
- I think so.

682
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,663
Do you want to wait and talk to the doctor,
Mr. Sweetzer?

683
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,244
No, I don't.

684
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,406
What happened, Reverend?
That's the question.

685
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,709
Well, I believe that the demon is gone.

686
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,178
It's as if Nell's house had been vandalized.

687
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,781
The robber is gone, but we need somebody
else to put things right again...

688
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,751
No, don't slough it off
to the big city doctor thing.

689
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,187
Eight of them could not save my wife.

690
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,600
Eight of them could not prolong her life
one day.

691
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:11,461
And psychiatry? Psychiatry is not of God.

692
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,463
Louis, the tools that God provides for us

693
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:17,233
<i>sometimes are not always the tools
that we recognize or the tools...</i>

694
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,849
"Our weapons of war are not carnal.

695
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:24,048
"They are mighty in God
for the pulling down of strongholds."

696
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,243
Am I right? Am I right?

697
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:32,385
- Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely. Amen to that.
- That's what we're dealing with, Reverend.

698
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,819
He's stuck on this idea that
I'm some sort of slick, big city preacher.

699
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,798
He's not gonna listen to anything
I have to say.

700
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,999
Let's get somebody local.

701
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,741
It's got to be that one over there.

702
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,766
- Hi.
- Good afternoon,

703
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,467
I'm Reverend Cotton Marcus
from Baton Rouge.

704
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,169
- Hi, I'm Becky.
- Nice to meet you, Becky.

705
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,737
- From where?
- Baton Rouge.

706
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,407
- Okay.
- I'm looking for Pastor Manley,

707
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,989
- if he's around by any chance.
- Yes, he's right back there.

708
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,719
- What are you all doing?
- We're making a movie.

709
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:09,094
- So, are you all shooting this now?
- Yeah.

710
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,061
- So, will I be in it?
- Yeah, you will.

711
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,925
- Pastor Manley, we've got us some visitors.
- All right.

712
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,561
Afternoon, Reverend Cotton Marcus
from Baton Rouge. How you doing?

713
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,962
Welcome to Second Calvary.

714
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,577
- Thank you.
- Hi.

715
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,701
I know he respects the church,

716
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,004
but at this point, since I'm an outsider,
he's not respecting my opinion,

717
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,239
'cause I'm pushing him to go see a doctor,
'cause she's not well,

718
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,878
and I was hoping you could back me up.

719
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,778
Well, let me tell you my history with Louis.

720
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:39,082
When she was unexpectedly
pulled out of the Sunday school...

721
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,719
- Right.
...we never found out exactly why,

722
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,121
But he was definitely hostile.

723
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:49,359
He felt that our Sunday school curriculum
wasn't, you know, sufficiently medieval,

724
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:53,463
and this was not the same Louis
that I originally knew...

725
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,965
- Did he threaten you at all?
- No, not per se,

726
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,274
but there were voices raised.

727
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,672
So, I think I'm the last guy

728
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,288
- that Louis would really take counsel from.
- Wow. Yeah, maybe.

729
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:09,412
And as I say, I mean, I wasn't afraid,
but it was very uncomfortable.

730
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,425
How long ago was this?

731
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:16,219
Two, I guess it's... Since I've seen Nell,
two and a half, two and a half years.

732
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,855
It's been two years?
They haven't even come to church?

733
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,563
No. And I heard about
the home-schooling thing.

734
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,861
I'm not really one to sit here
and say whether that's right or wrong.

735
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:29,946
I will say that Nell was, when she was here,
a vibrant, happy girl,

736
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:35,972
and I just don't think to be cut off is,
you know, the best thing for the child.

737
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,974
Would you be willing to come out
to the farm with me?

738
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,352
Lf... Okay, I tell you what.

739
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,259
You get Louis to agree for me
to come to the farm,

740
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,284
and I'll be happy to do that.
I also can line up...

741
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,652
I have a good friend,

742
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,056
psychiatric head of the department
in Baton Rouge, that I can line up for Nell.

743
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,726
Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna
get back to the farm. Thank you, Pastor.

744
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,364
- Well, let me know. Great.
- I appreciate your time.

745
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,709
- You get the pastor to make his contact...
- What's going on over there?

746
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,412
That doesn't look good.

747
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:11,384
I want my mother. I want my mother.

748
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:18,219
- She's fine. Get that damn camera off.
- I want my mother. I want my mother.

749
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,325
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Caleb, you okay?

750
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,494
Can you write?

751
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,906
All right, all right. All right, here.

752
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,219
Caleb? Caleb?

753
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,378
Louis, we need to get him to the hospital.
Really bad pain.

754
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,148
- Louis, what happened?
- He was trying to calm Nell down,

755
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,696
and she attacked him with a knife.

756
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,628
- She did this?
- Yes.

757
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,824
- I got to get him to the hospital.
- Yeah, you better do that.

758
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,793
Could you take him for me?
We need to get him there.

759
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,900
Louis, what if the demon comes back?
I need to be here for that.

760
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,449
You be well.

761
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,889
Look what Caleb wrote.

762
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,495
That's why I wanted to stay.

763
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,897
Nell?

764
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,036
Nell, honey. Can we come in?

765
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:43,812
- He locked her in.
- Yeah. Hey, honey.

766
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,835
Oh, my God. Hey.

767
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:49,305
- Are you kidding?
- Let's go find something,

768
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,546
something to get her out of that.

769
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:05,755
I'm bad. I am. I'm bad.

770
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,491
No, you're not. You're not bad.
Nell, you're not bad.

771
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,328
He's gonna be mad when he comes home
and I'm not chained up.

772
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:13,462
Okay.

773
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,598
- I'm not gonna go to heaven.
- Honey, yes, you are.

774
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,977
You'll go to heaven. All right?
You'll go to heaven. Oh, my.

775
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:25,711
I remember hearing screaming,
and when I woke up, his face was cut.

776
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,844
Does Caleb frighten you at all?
Does he ever hurt you

777
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:32,450
- or tease you or anything like that?
- No, no. Never Caleb.

778
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,022
Nell, has your father ever hurt you?

779
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:39,928
No.

780
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,904
- You can tell me.
- No.

781
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,079
Let's put you back into bed.
What do you say?

782
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,742
You hear that?

783
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,598
- Is she sleepwalking?
- I don't know.

784
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,169
Nell?

785
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,049
Honey, can you hear us?

786
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,821
Honey?

787
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,966
- Nell?
- Nell? Honey?

788
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,776
Oh, my God. Nell. Nell!

789
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,642
Okay. It's okay. Right here.

790
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,744
Just a doll. You're giving your doll a bath.
That's all.

791
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:45,157
Hey. Here we go.

792
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,964
Here we go. It's all right, honey.
It's gonna be okay.

793
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,632
Let's take her to bed.

794
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,164
Well, you look better.
I can see your eyes now.

795
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,406
Did you make this?

796
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,974
No.

797
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,683
This is what I got
while we were in the bathroom.

798
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,918
I don't know how she'd know Latin, though.

799
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,660
- Maybe Louis taught her.
- He doesn't know.

800
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,863
- So, it's Nell making those baby noises?
- Yeah.

801
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,199
<i>Nell.</i>

802
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,945
<i>- What's going on?
...and you can give her Pepto-Bismol</i>

803
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,859
<i>For her nausea,
which is very common at this stage of a...</i>

804
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,557
<i>Hi, this is Dr. Kile
from the Ivanwood General.</i>

805
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,924
<i>We just want to make sure
that Nell does not take the Halcyon,</i>

806
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:05,628
<i>as the person that prescribed it
did not know that she was pregnant.</i>

807
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,965
<i>And you can give her Pepto-Bismol
for her nausea, which is...</i>

808
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,501
Well, this explains it. There you have it.

809
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,904
- Your underlying trauma.
- All they told us was that she was pregnant.

810
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,438
You don't know who she's pregnant by.

811
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:17,706
We're dealing with incest, okay?
Abusing his...

812
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,009
Iris, you can't go saying that sort of thing
down here.

813
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,343
It would ruin a person's life,
you understand?

814
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,078
It's right there. It's obvious.
I mean, it's right there.

815
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,613
We have to wait for him to come back
and talk to him.

816
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:25,915
That's exactly what we have to do.
You can't...

817
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,116
We need to take her, and we need to leave.

818
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,185
We're not taking her anywhere.
That's kidnapping.

819
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,786
Well, then what?
You're gonna keep exorcising her

820
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,088
while her dad's raping her
upstairs in the bedroom?

821
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,090
Okay, why don't we just take a break?
Can we just take a break?

822
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,258
What? What kind of break are we taking?

823
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:37,726
We have to wait for him, no matter what.

824
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,428
- Fine.
- All right.

825
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,665
Guys, why don't we just take a nap
for an hour? We're all pretty wiped out.

826
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,178
Okay, great.

827
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,499
Here, kitty, kitty.

828
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,972
Nell! What are you doing?

829
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:58,033
It's okay. Good girl. Let go. Let go.

830
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,302
- Put the camera down.
- I'm so sorry.

831
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,439
Let's get some clothes on you.

832
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,546
Seems to be all right.

833
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,313
Guys, come here. Take a look at this.

834
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,580
- Oh, my God.
- Look at these pictures.

835
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,754
- Same cat picture.
- Wow. Look at this one.

836
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,730
Yeah, something's on fire.
Maybe the house.

837
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,089
And look at this one on the right.

838
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,468
- Is that me?
- Yeah. It's all of us. All of us dead.

839
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,271
- I'm in the fire.
- I'm in a million pieces.

840
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:32,141
- Daniel, you get your head chopped off.
- She's more messed up than I thought.

841
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,603
Not comfortable with what?

842
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,739
Well, I'm not comfortable
that we're in a house with someone

843
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,042
who's doing pictures of my head
being chopped off. You know?

844
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,745
Relax. It's just a bunch of drawings
from a little girl's imagination.

845
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:43,946
Yeah, imagination's one thing,

846
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,248
but she killed those animals,
and she cut her brother up pretty good.

847
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:48,717
Well, do you think she's gonna hack you
to pieces and cut your head off?

848
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,352
- Is that what you think?
- No, that's not what I'm saying,

849
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,021
but we've seen signs
of her being dangerous before.

850
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,756
They're just drawings, Daniel. You know,

851
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,557
I mean, we happen to be in the house,

852
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:56,658
and we happen to be in her drawings.

853
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,561
She's a 16-year-old girl. All right?
We can overpower her if we need to.

854
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:00,662
Yeah, well, a 16-year-old girl

855
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,865
and a 16-year-old psychopath
are two different things.

856
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,034
She's psychotic, but she's not capable
of chopping your head off.

857
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,468
- Are you worried about that?
- I'm not worried.

858
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:07,569
I'm just saying
that we should be concerned...

859
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:08,971
Guys, just take it easy, all right?

860
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,639
- We're all tired and...
- Right.

861
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:14,043
...we're here to help her, okay?
So, let's keep things in perspective, okay?

862
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,989
- All right, all right.
- All right, fine.

863
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,670
- They saw you drag him around?
- Probably. No doubt.

864
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,943
I'm gonna kill them both.

865
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,718
- You hear that?
- Sounds like there's two people.

866
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,943
- Who were you talking to?
- No one.

867
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,794
I swear there were two people in there.

868
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,908
<i>...just want to make sure
that Nell does not take the Halcyon,</i>

869
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:29,578

870

872
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,387
<i>But please do not give her the Halcyon.</i>

873
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:39,555
<i>- The book was right.
- Thank you.</i>

874
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,729
<i>If you have any questions,
please call us here.</i>

875
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,662
- The book was right?
- Book was right.

876
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:50,541
- What are you talking about?
- The demon defiled my daughter.

877
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,070
My daughter is a virgin, 16-year-old virgin.

878
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:58,774
How did she get pregnant?
The book said it. You showed it to me.

879
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,243
I don't think
the book has any bearing on this.

880
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:05,191
I think it's more earthly matters
that we're dealing with now.

881
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,752
Reverend, I need you to perform
another exorcism.

882
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,356
Get rid of that thing.
I will not let that thing grow inside of her.

883
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,024
Louis, I'm not gonna perform
another exorcism.

884
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,436
Reverend, I need you to help me.

885
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,641
I need you to help Nell. Please.

886
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,966
I don't believe a demon had anything
to do with this.

887
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,468
Reverend, I need you to do another
exorcism for the soul of my daughter.

888
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,403
- Louis, this is not about an exorcism.
- I need you to do this.

889
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,206
Louis, I'm not gonna do an exorcism.
What she needs is a doctor.

890
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:34,255
I know this must be really hard to hear,

891
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:38,590
but Nell's welfare
is what we're all concerned with.

892
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,330
Right, Louis?

893
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:50,731
Reverend, if you can't save
my daughter's soul, I will.

894
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,303
What are you talking about?

895
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,301
I would like you all to leave my property.

896
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:04,273
If you're not off my property in five minutes,
I will consider you all trespassers.

897
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,720
Now, Louis.
Louis, you need to be reasonable. Louis.

898
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,834
I bet he doesn't want to take her to a doctor.

899
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,457
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

900
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,693
I don't want to wait around to find out
what he's gonna do to Nell.

901
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,062
- I'm afraid he's gonna try to hurt her.
- He's gonna kill her.

902
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,531
Death is the only salvation.
You told him that.

903
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:32,100
Yeah, I know. I think you're right.

904
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,336
We should just take her.
Just grab her and go.

905
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:37,976
- How are we gonna do that?
- We'll just take her and go.

906
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,823
- What's he doing?
- He's still praying.

907
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:47,192
- He's got a lot of guns in the house, Cotton.
- I know.

908
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,031
Come on.

909
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:57,773
- Cotton, what is that?
- I don't know. Somebody upstairs.

910
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,969
- Nell?
- Nell?

911
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,986
I have a key. I have a key here.
Hang on, Nell!

912
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,727
Nell!

913
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,376
Come on, honey.

914
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,483
It's us. Come on.

915
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:31,295
There you go.
That's a good girl. That's a good girl.

916
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,464
That's a good girl. Right here, yeah.

917
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:38,405
It's Cotton. It's Cotton. Come on.

918
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,141
Come on, honey. That's it.
That's it. Good girl.

919
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,036
Good girl. It's gonna be okay.
Here you go. That's good.

920
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:50,546
Nell, we're gonna go now.
We're gonna get you in the car.

921
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:54,589
Are you okay?

922
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:56,716
Nell!

923
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,521
Nell!

924
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,333
Nell, stop!

925
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,033
Nell?

926
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,105
- You okay?
- It's not that bad.

927
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,276
Nell?

928
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,588
Nell?

929
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,248
Here.

930
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,566
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.

931
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,310
Lights are on. Louis is here.

932
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:58,366
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

933
01:01:58,514 --> 01:01:59,467
- We'll get back to the hotel.
- Fine.

934
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,412
- We'll call the cops from there.
- Fine. Do you have the keys?

935
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:03,814
- Yeah.
- Here. Cotton.

936
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:09,457
- Nell.
- No, let's go. Can we please just go?

937
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,123
- Cotton.
- Here, come here. Come on.

938
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,964
- Nell?
- Cotton.

939
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:26,831
- Nell, are you all right? Honey?
- Cotton.

940
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:31,838
Nell, look at me. Can you look at me?

941
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:37,853
No!

942
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:46,353
- Iris.
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

943
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,821
- You got her?
- Oh, God.

944
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:51,820
- Louis!
- Look.

945
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,299
It's Louis!

946
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,333
Louis, put the gun down, please. Please.

947
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,841
Get the door! Lock the door!

948
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,604
Get away from the door! Come here!

949
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,310
- He's coming!
- Come here.

950
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:32,494
- Let her go! Get away!
- No! Louis, no!

951
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,496
- You don't want to kill her.
- Move away from her!

952
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,669
- No, no.
- Shoot me, Daddy!

953
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,408
- Nell. No, Nell.
- Just shoot me!

954
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:44,244
I was wrong. You were right.
She's possessed. I'll do another exorcism.

955
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,053
I'll do it.

956
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,902
<i>I set out to make this documentary
to save children,</i>

957
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,408
<i>and now I'm gonna get her killed.</i>

958
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,805
<i>- What would you have said?
- I don't know.</i>

959
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:19,118
It's a no-win situation. What, is she gonna
admit that she's pregnant? And then what?

960
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,843
Soon, we're all gonna have
a shotgun in our face.

961
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:25,085
What could a second exorcism
possibly accomplish?

962
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:00,595
Hey, Nell.

963
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:19,540
I didn't get him out.
I didn't get the demon out. It's my fault.

964
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:25,745
But if you can be strong,
I need you to do it one more time.

965
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,324
- Can you do that for me?
- No, I don't think I...

966
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,653
I just need to see him one more time.

967
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:40,288
It's not that I don't think I can,
it's just that I don't know how to do it.

968
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,458
- It just comes involuntarily.
- I think you can.

969
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,700
I don't have any control over
what happens to me.

970
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,640
I think you could.

971
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,981
I think if you want to.

972
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:57,071
I wanted to get better last time, though.

973
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,306
- I know. I know.
- Sorry.

974
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,008
- That was...
- I really wanted it.

975
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:03,011
I mean, I don't think I could have wanted it
any more than last time.

976
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:06,424
I know. I failed you that time.

977
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:11,324
But this time, I won't.
This time, I won't. I promise.

978
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:16,400
But I need you to be willing
to bring him up again.

979
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,139
I think you can do it. I think...

980
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:25,313
I think if you just allow yourself,
I think you can do it.

981
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,717
- Nell, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

982
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,823
All right, I'm right here.

983
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,783
- I'm feeling like I'm falling a lot.
- Okay. Well, you're right here.

984
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:43,865
I've got you right here.

985
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:47,197
- But it's getting hard to see you.
- Okay.

986
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:53,127
Here we go. I'm right here. I'm not going
anywhere. I'm not going anywhere, honey.

987
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,266
- Right here.
- What is that?

988
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,900
- There's nothing there.
- What is it?

989
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:02,074
There's nothing there.
I'm right here, honey. I'm right here.

990
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,873
- Right...
- What? Don't. Please, help. It's right...

991
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,107
- It's coming.
- Good, let him come.

992
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:07,208
Let him come, Nell.

993
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,516
He's coming through my skin.

994
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,480
Get him out of my skin. Please.

995
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:16,291
It's okay. I'm right here.
I'm right here, Nell. It's okay.

996
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:23,230
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

997
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,903
Nell?

998
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,806
Nell.

999
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:36,650
He has her!

1000
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:46,417
Nell, can you hear me? Nell?

1001
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:55,066
Reverend Marcus.
I hear you don't believe in me.

1002
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,205
Who are you?

1003
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:08,010
Abalam.

1004
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:14,888
- Where's Nell?
- In the fire.

1005
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,889
She's been there for some time.

1006
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,226
Soon you'll join her.

1007
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,796
Don't believe the demon's lies, Louis.

1008
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,733
The demon's lies?

1009
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,005
If I invoke the name of Jesus Christ,
our savior,

1010
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:47,020
you should be compelled to leave this girl.

1011
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:51,512
If I beseech our Lord and invoke him,
and I say,

1012
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,147
"Put on the whole armor of God,

1013
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,316
"that he may be able to stand
the wiles of the devil.

1014
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,018
"For while we wrestle not
against flesh and blood,

1015
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,486
"but against principalities, against powers,

1016
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,854
"against the rulers of darkness
in this world,

1017
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,055
- "against the spirits! We have..."
- Words.

1018
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:03,398
Words, words, words!

1019
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,106
I'll tell you what.

1020
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:13,077
If you can keep quiet for 10 seconds,
I'll let the girl go.

1021
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:18,010
- Yes.
- Agreed.

1022
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,614
One.

1023
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:27,887
Two.

1024
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,120
Nell.

1025
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,031
- Three.
- Stop it. Stop it!

1026
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:38,396
- Honey. Honey, stop.
- You lose.

1027
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:53,087
- Louis, I'm sorry.
- Do something.

1028
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,325
I'll do something, Daddy.

1029
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,821
- Reverend, how about a blowing job?
- Nell.

1030
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:08,429
What did you say?

1031
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,738
What's a blowing job?

1032
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,045
Tell me what that is.
You don't know, do you?

1033
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:23,137
You don't even know that's not what
it's called, because you are not a demon.

1034
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:24,872
A demon would know what that is.

1035
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,080
But maybe not a 16-year-old
home-schooled girl.

1036
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,311
- Because I don't think you're a demon, Nell.
- No.

1037
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,346
I don't think you're a demon.
I think you're an innocent girl.

1038
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,714
- No.
- I think you're an innocent girl.

1039
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,484
I think you're a little innocent girl who
doesn't know what she's talking about!

1040
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,019
- I think you're an innocent little girl!
- No! No!

1041
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:41,055
That's what I think!
I think you're a little girl!

1042
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:43,433
She isn't innocent!

1043
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,338
She isn't innocent.

1044
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,476
- It's okay. It's okay. Let it out.
- She...

1045
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:53,208
It's all right. It's just... Turn the camera off.

1046
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:55,970
- She isn't...
- It's gonna be okay.

1047
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,338
- She isn't innocent.
- Let it out, honey. It's okay.

1048
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:59,073
- She isn't innocent.
- Turn it off.

1049
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:00,279
Turn it off!

1050
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,161
She looks like she's resting.

1051
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:12,296
She is relieved,
and she is resting really well.

1052
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,388
- Praise God.
- Praise God, indeed.

1053
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:17,258
- Louis, do you know a boy named Logan?
- No.

1054
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:18,926
He works at a cafe or a restaurant
somewhere around here.

1055
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:20,598
Is Abalam gone?

1056
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:25,203
Louis, your daughter doesn't have a demon.
Your daughter's suffering from shame.

1057
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,478
Nell is pregnant, and the father is Logan.

1058
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:31,439
No, sir. That's impossible. I'm afraid not.

1059
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,608
Louis, you have to admit
that if Nell says that's what happened...

1060
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,917
She's delirious.
Look what she went through.

1061
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,454
- Look what she went through.
- Listen to her yourself, okay?

1062
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:41,716
We'll talk to Nell ourselves,
and we'll hear it from her,

1063
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:43,331
and you'll see the truth that she has.

1064
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:44,485
Can we do that?

1065
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,101
A couple years ago
when her mom was dying,

1066
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:51,768
and he came by and asked her if she wanted
to go for a ride in his car,

1067
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,875
and he was driving a sports car.

1068
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:58,341
It was old, but still a sports car.

1069
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:04,277
And she got in it,
and they started driving out to a field.

1070
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:09,718
Then he turned to her and he asked her
if she wanted to have sex.

1071
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,687
And she said yes.

1072
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:17,059
She asked him, she said, "Am I pretty?"

1073
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,027
And he said, "Yes."
He said, "I think you're so pretty."

1074
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:24,659
- And he took her and he laid her back.
- Stop it!

1075
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:28,095
- She loved how he touched her.
- You were raped! You were raped!

1076
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:32,009
- She said yes. She liked it.
- That's enough, honey.

1077
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:46,027
Well, she's right about one thing,
Reverend.

1078
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:49,757
There is a boy that works at that cafe,

1079
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:56,029
and I have no idea what his name is,
but for all I know, he could be Logan.

1080
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,902
Pastor Manley,
Reverend Cotton Marcus calling.

1081
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:07,042
Could you please call me back?
I'm at the Sweetzer farm.

1082
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:19,188
Pastor Manley, thank you so much
for coming out.

1083
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:20,948
Reverend Marcus, a pleasure.

1084
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,064
- Good to see you. Welcome.
- Good to see you.

1085
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,196
- Well, just don't forget to smile.
- Hello.

1086
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,630
Louis is upstairs with Nell.

1087
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:34,929
She finally admitted that Logan was the boy
who impregnated her.

1088
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,798
- Logan.
- Yeah, he works at the cafe down the road.

1089
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:39,174
I know him.

1090
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:40,601
So, frankly, Pastor,

1091
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:44,005
I don't know what more I can do
for them at this point.

1092
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:47,775
Is Louis on board with psychological help
with my friend in Baton Rouge?

1093
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:51,012
Yes, do you... I think Louis would be
amenable to that at this point.

1094
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,648
I'll be... I'll call him first thing.

1095
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,383
- Louis.
- Pastor Manley, thanks.

1096
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,863
- It's been too long. Good to see you.
- Thank you for coming, sir.

1097
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,494
My pleasure.

1098
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:03,438
- Hello. I'm Louis.
- Becky.

1099
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,436
- Hey, Nell.
- Hi.

1100
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:09,130
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

1101
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,610
"I cried out to you, O Lord.
You are my refuge,

1102
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,835
"my portion in the land of the living.
Please attend to my cry.

1103
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:18,806
"Please attend to this child,
for thou art stronger

1104
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:23,210
"than any possible thing that could
attack this lovely servant of yours.

1105
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:25,680
"Bring this child's soul out of prison

1106
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,955
"that I may praise your name."

1107
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:54,551
I'd be lying if I said I was sure of everything
I did when it came to that.

1108
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:58,756
I've never seen anything like that. Poor Nell.

1109
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:02,596
She's gonna have to get some serious help.

1110
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,795
Louis could use some, as well.

1111
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:10,458
Hey, what was the name of that cafe
that that boy worked at, Logan?

1112
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:12,471
- Riche's, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1113
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,233
Hi, how you doing?

1114
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:20,438
She's lying, all right?
I'm not the father of her child at all.

1115
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,604
I don't even know the girl.
We met once, you know.

1116
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,073
It was Pastor Manley's party,
and we were both there,

1117
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,676
and she saw me,
and she started talking to me

1118
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:31,245
for, you know, maybe, like, a minute. Okay?

1119
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:32,613
- This is Pastor Manley's house?
- Yes.

1120
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,548
- Last summer?
- Yes, last summer. But...

1121
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,823
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1122
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:42,294
I didn't get her pregnant, though.
And another thing, I don't...

1123
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:47,966
She's nice and everything, but I'm not
exactly, interested in, you know...

1124
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:53,539
- Girls.
- Right. So, she's lying.

1125
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,171
What's a pastor doing throwing a party
for a bunch of 16-year-olds?

1126
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,273
He said he hadn't seen her
in three years, right?

1127
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:02,109
Yeah, he's lying. And Nell was lying,
'cause the kid was obviously gay.

1128
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:04,555
- Yeah.
- Why would she lie to us?

1129
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,648
To get rid of us? Maybe she wanted
to get us out of the house.

1130
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:09,263
Yeah, but why?

1131
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:14,201
- What are you doing?
- Turning around.

1132
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,869
- Going back to the house?
- Yeah.

1133
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,727
Louis!

1134
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:01,509
Louis!

1135
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,091
Oh, my God.

1136
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:34,444
Cotton, the phones have been ripped out
of the wall.

1137
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,909
- Do you hear that?
- What?

1138
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,291
Cotton? Cotton? Cotton, listen to me.

1139
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,191
Cotton, please.

1140
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:59,627
- This is insane.
- We need to find Nell.

1141
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:01,868
She's got a point, Cotton.

1142
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,013
Turn off that light.

1143
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,515
That's Nell right there on the table.

1144
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,316
Is that Louis?

1145
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:56,917
- It is Louis.
- Is he tied up?

1146
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,829
- Oh, my God.
- We should get the police, guys.

1147
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:03,662
- I want to get out of here.
- Wait, wait.

1148
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:08,204
That's Pastor Manley.

1149
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,309
That's Pastor Manley.

1150
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:15,139
Is he leading the thing?

1151
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:22,046
- We got to get help right now.
- What are they doing?

1152
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,792
- What are they doing with her?
- What is it?

1153
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:31,991
- Oh, God.
- That isn't human.

1154
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,697
Hail Abalam!

1155
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:52,544
Daniel, I want to get out of here. Right now.

1156
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:06,558
We got to go. We got to go.

1157
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,314
Cotton, what are you doing?
Cotton. Cotton!

1158
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:30,215
Demon, you cannot have the soul
of this girl, for she is a creature of God!

1159
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:36,692
- The one with the camera! Get him!
- Daniel, they're coming! Run! Run!

1160
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,722
Go! Go! Go!

1161
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:52,377
- Wait! Please! No! No!
- Kill her! Kill the bitch!

1162
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,489
Caleb.
