1
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:04,426
I try now "Happy New Year."
He must learn for tomorrow.

2
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:20,826
- Look, there it is.
- You sit in the road.

3
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:24,311
- I'm sorry, honey.
- It is not bad.

4
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:27,446
Why we live in a house
such as Aunt Chloe?

5
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,546
Someday maybe, baby.
We will see if he wants.

6
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:44,106
Aunt Chloe.

7
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,826
Paulie, come on.

8
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:56,906
- A drink would be heaven.
- Hey, buddy.

9
00:02:56,941 --> 00:03:00,143
Happy New Year in Chinese.
Not bad, huh?

10
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:03,346
- Do you speak Chinese? Cool.
- Yes.

11
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:07,026
- Do never gone.
- I received an offer.

12
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,871
You look beautiful.

13
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:12,226
- I can not.
- Yes it is.

14
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:18,586
Chloe, hello.

15
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:24,644
Casey, I was the Man
from Uncle Chuck in Tomarno.

16
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:26,386
You change in a pop.

17
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:31,031
- Casey, look how big you are.
- Hi, Uncle Robbie.

18
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:36,306
Let the uncle but fall.
Come on, let's start this party.

19
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:41,066
- Say hello, dear.
- Who wants a Christmas?

20
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:42,746
Me.

21
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:47,586
- Who think this is the best New Year ever?
- I.

22
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:56,586
- View Leah go, it is even.
- Unbelievable, huh?

23
00:03:56,621 --> 00:04:00,186
- She is her Inhalator off.
- That is fantastic.

24
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:03,626
Is not it great? The children
are as enthusiastic as we are.

25
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,906
Come here, sister.

26
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:11,186
- Hi, Casey.
- Hello.

27
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:22,286
Ruined the weekend, right?
There are also parties.

28
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:25,431
- It is not just one.
- You know I can not go.

29
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:29,606
- Because you are married to a fool.
- The only two days.

30
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:33,746
You get your way the rest of the year.
Perhaps a few hours?

31
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:36,226
You know how hard I am looking for.

32
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:38,511
Please?

33
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:41,706
- Mouse.
- Call me if not.

34
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,746
Please.

35
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:47,766
Paulie. It is in order.

36
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:51,391
- Baby anyway.
- Mommy.

37
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:55,226
I think you are car sick.
It is not bad.

38
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:58,906
Paulie and help this weekend, right?

39
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:02,706
Have you ever heard of contraception?

40
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:13,866
- Mama was invited for Christmas.
- Yes, euphemistically speaking.

41
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:17,386
Did she put out a cafe?

42
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:19,466
Daddy, look.

43
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:22,346
If you play with your gift?

44
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:27,066
Sorry,
Casey has chosen Christmas gifts.

45
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:32,062
Did you know that mama has called
at eleven o'clock in the evening,

46
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:34,066
she wanted the children speak.

47
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,244
Excuse me, I can not invite.

48
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:40,146
They are interfering too
much, you understand me?

49
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,271
Is that make-up?

50
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:46,126
This year we had a drunken Christmas.
I sent the kids to bed.

51
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:49,946
I had a special punch and then
we had a nude snowballs fight.

52
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:53,855
You should see the photos.
They are fantastic.

53
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,186
We were just different.

54
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,826
Granny fell off the toilet.

55
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:05,626
- Mommy.
- It's all right.

56
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,266
Let's drink.
Someone who thinks that attention...

57
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,591
Jonah.

58
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:13,346
- Normally he never rough.
- Come here, baby.

59
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,586
Not like his mama, then.

60
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:58,546
Really. I had to pretend to the Director
and teachers of Casey. Terrible.

61
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:02,386
- I think I did pee in my pants.
- We do much OJ.

62
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,543
I never talk with my mouth full.

63
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:08,666
- What is OJ?
- Potbelly buttercup.

64
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:21,266
Did you read the article, which I'll
have sent, on MMR jobs?

65
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:24,906
You are cleaning your teeth.
Forward.

66
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:29,738
Hey, Leah, Nicky. Bedtime.

67
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:33,386
Have fun with your nephews and nieces.

68
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:39,746
I love you.

69
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:51,771
What happened to that
web design thing happened?

70
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,226
That was a complete waste of time.

71
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:58,111
A lot of techies
the whole day playing Sim City.

72
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:01,826
Actually I have a much better idea.
I met these guys...

73
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:04,111
I get no reception.

74
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:08,031
That was outside. I show you.
You can use anything.

75
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:12,906
Casey should really talk to anybody.
Papa has given her house arrest.

76
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:15,271
House arrest? That sounds interesting.

77
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:18,334
Mama wants Jonah's
self-confidence upgrading,

78
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,506
so we try not to be disobedient.

79
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:35,226
Casey drink whiskey.

80
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,146
This is heaven.

81
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:50,551
Have you been told Elaine
that the children get home schools?

82
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:52,275
Are you qualified for it?

83
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:55,686
I mean, the school
is in the neighborhood, huh.

84
00:08:55,821 --> 00:09:01,626
It is logical. Since the case sold,
we have the time.

85
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:06,366
At that age they are so plastic.
I really wish them the chance to...

86
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:10,586
I think it would be a good idea. I try
Miranda Mandarin words to learn.

87
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:14,826
Chinese, how many schools do that?
None. Why, certainly not us.

88
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:18,306
- Oddly, it's a world economy.
- Is this again a sect?

89
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,946
Now we do not chant?

90
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:24,346
And I show too thick in monk attire.

91
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:34,631
What is it, honey?

92
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,226
- Are you okay?
- Come here, baby. What is wrong?

93
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:41,471
I was afraid of Paulie.

94
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:47,505
Honey, it's Paulie it.
This morning he was still fun.

95
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:50,546
It is in order.

96
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:53,571
Miranda, Leah does
not bring you to the top?

97
00:09:53,772 --> 00:09:54,946
No.

98
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:59,146
- Honey, do not start.
- Let her wait.

99
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,226
That is like Leah.
Right, honey?

100
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:08,066
Maybe you can
a gold star to give Miranda.

101
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:20,386
- Goodnight, Daddy.
- Goodnight, Princess.

102
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:23,306
- Ga me.
- Come here.

103
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:31,266
- Goodnight, lickspittle.
- Goodnight, Mommy.

104
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:33,626
Goodnight, Mommy.

105
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,506
Super Mama.

106
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,671
- Miranda?
- What?

107
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:06,346
You know how a real Liavor sounds?

108
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:59,506
Are you still in the school orchestra?

109
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:05,626
- Your dad said you played flute.
- I call him Dad.

110
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,946
I think you have certainly not called uncle.

111
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:15,386
Try here.

112
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:21,546
- Does it work?
- Yes.

113
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:28,386
- Good night.
- Good night.

114
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:41,226
- With Lisa. I'm busy or dead.
- Thanks to record.

115
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,826
You had better not deceased,
miss Demurray.

116
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,946
Is not this great. I think
that we still have to take ten children.

117
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:24,186
You look so tired and Lainy.

118
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,631
She is so bad.

119
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,466
You would also be tired,
with all those rough conditions.

120
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,431
Ecotourism. What a farce.

121
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:53,186
Take photographs of a gorilla that fleas
of his butt unplucked

122
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:56,466
and we burn you away atmosphere.

123
00:13:56,826 --> 00:14:01,426
They have so much luck. They have
their five cases no two brain cells.

124
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:07,186
And that home schools. I thought Chloe's
capabilities in design-earth 'layers.

125
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:10,906
Now they
fundamentalist in Buddhism.

126
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:17,026
- Why did your book in Chinese medicine?
- I thought Robbie would have interest.

127
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:21,626
Why you insulting me, when I
China talking? Support me, right?

128
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,906
I said already.
It is a great idea.

129
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,191
Come on.

130
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:38,826
I thought you and I we would
fun this weekend.

131
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:42,586
Does your daughter understand that?

132
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:30,586
Goodnight, my angel.

133
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:59,466
Leah, Nicky. Come play with me.

134
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:08,786
From the road.

135
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:22,766
Since the children on sledges, Robbie.
Stay with one seat.

136
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:27,266
You're right. For the first time up.
First up, may not.

137
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:35,186
Leave it on, Paulie.

138
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:09,071
I've just had 24 hours nonversatie.
Just come.

139
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,186
Take me home.
Come to the exit. You have my card, huh?

140
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:22,186
Whatever you want.

141
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:30,711
- Have you seen Jinxie?
- A while ago in the forest.

142
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:34,946
- Where have you been?
- For you a question, for me to know.

143
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:40,866
- No adults in the tent.
- I think I now regret.

144
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:51,591
I must be the worst
vegetarian ever.

145
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:55,951
- I looked briefly in the oven and I...
- Me too.

146
00:20:55,986 --> 00:21:00,106
- Is Robbie still to the city today?
- Occasionally. If you want his advice.

147
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:02,431
- Is he sleeping?
- Not much.

148
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:07,186
- But mostly he?
- What? Lainy, milk.

149
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,306
- That smells good.
- Where are you going?

150
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,586
I get a little ga.

151
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,666
You too.
Is it good?

152
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,866
Yes, great.

153
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:25,326
We will do more as a family.
These are my New Year plans.

154
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:30,186
- Casey helps much?
- She has the Christmas gifts purchased.

155
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:35,106
- Look how hard I was.
- Lainy, you were pregnant.

156
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:38,551
You were not really an example.

157
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:43,186
- I do my job is not bad, huh?
- No, Lainy.

158
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:47,586
Promise me that you kill
If I completely change mama.

159
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:49,386
I promise.

160
00:21:51,106 --> 00:21:52,666
I've missed.

161
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:58,951
You must know everything
on Chinese medicine.

162
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:02,231
He does not know that the Internet
there is full of them.

163
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:05,018
You should be able
to help Elaine and Chloe.

164
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,306
And feminism, then?

165
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:09,466
Does that have anything to do
with selfish?

166
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,666
I ga you.

167
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:29,026
- Welcome to my office.
- Thanks.

168
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:33,826
I have spoken to those guys.
They import a lot through the internet.

169
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:37,883
Many ingredients come from China.
And you know, thank you...

170
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:41,906
There is already a big market.
We know that. Thank you, honey.

171
00:22:51,426 --> 00:22:54,746
... viruses, I think,
each year are identified and...

172
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:07,666
... that is traditional Chinese medicine
and that is to explode.

173
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:14,786
It has serious side effects.

174
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,466
I get you.

175
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:30,626
It is finished.

176
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:33,386
Where's Paulie?

177
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,791
Jesus.

178
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:45,826
- Are you okay?
- It is.

179
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:53,386
- It is only a graze.
- Excuse me.

180
00:23:57,146 --> 00:24:01,386
- It was an accident.
- Here we do not save children.

181
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:03,626
It is in order.

182
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:07,146
- Dad is very angry.
- It's okay. Who brought him?

183
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:09,906
- Where were you, Casey?
- What have I done?

184
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:14,466
It is in order. Do not cry.

185
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:29,386
He was not here.

186
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:35,706
Now it's just a quiet time,
while we prepare for the party.

187
00:24:35,786 --> 00:24:40,106
You are the oldest.
You are the mommy.

188
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:42,991
I feel sick, Mommy.

189
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:46,426
Be a good boy
ga and lie down.

190
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:50,626
I mean, Mommy.
I do not.

191
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:58,546
If you help Leah
with them to dress for the party,

192
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,866
she maybe
another gold star.

193
00:25:08,426 --> 00:25:10,666
Leah, come here.

194
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:15,186
Favorite.

195
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:20,986
Stop.

196
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:43,106
Can I what?

197
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,746
Come on.
Like I've never smoked.

198
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:09,546
Jim Morrison imitation.
And you would an expert be?

199
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:14,426
Jim Morrison lives on
in the lost centuries.

200
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:22,311
Miranda and Paulie are a nightmare.

201
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:27,706
They see how they can go
just like you.

202
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:33,506
What was that?

203
00:26:39,786 --> 00:26:43,666
They do not know
So you can not tell you.

204
00:26:45,546 --> 00:26:48,751
It is...
It is a baby.

205
00:26:48,786 --> 00:26:54,226
Did you not?
I am the abortion that is escaped.

206
00:26:57,626 --> 00:26:59,946
Time to work, huh?

207
00:27:05,786 --> 00:27:11,186
- I was looking for Miranda.
- It is up to the other children.

208
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:42,426
Happy new New Year.

209
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:47,426
- Everyone starts it. Do not let it cool.
- Do I get the pepper?

210
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,806
Do you have meat?

211
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:52,111
For anyone peas.

212
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:56,506
Robbie is excited about
my new business project and...

213
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:59,871
... and it does so on the market.

214
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:02,791
It can be fun, it will be something
as a family.

215
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:06,386
- We discuss later on.
- Yes, but you see something in there, huh?

216
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:09,631
- Bon appetit, everyone.
- Enjoy.

217
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:12,751
We can something like a junior Thesium do

218
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:16,546
such as the immunity of children up
naturally.

219
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,311
Sit down, come.

220
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:28,471
Look, Jonah, I'm glad you think a
way to have a start

221
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:33,266
but I do not understand why you think
that we want them involved.

222
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:38,026
Legal import of rhino horn or
tiger balm to cure acne and impotence?

223
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:41,466
You still know what Chloe and I
Job did?

224
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:48,391
Is that a tattoo, Casey?

225
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:52,026
Remember that you always wanted one,
Lainy, but I forbade you?

226
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:54,426
Can I look?

227
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:05,066
That is beautiful.
Very seasonal.

228
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:08,666
It's actually a self portrait.

229
00:29:09,186 --> 00:29:14,586
- I mean, what could have happened.
- I think it is cool.

230
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:25,586
I feel sick.

231
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:34,871
- Mommy, I feel sick.
- You're not sick, sweetheart.

232
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:40,786
You must not always imitate niece.
Besides Miranda has not yet eaten.

233
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:47,146
- Miranda, please eat something.
- Let her.

234
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,546
- That is enough.
- Jesus.

235
00:30:00,986 --> 00:30:03,146
Not the rest of you.

236
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:05,506
What if

237
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:10,991
Miranda again I gave a gold star

238
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:16,546
... because they eat a few peas.
- It's okay. I can handle it.

239
00:30:16,786 --> 00:30:18,866
It does nothing.

240
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:43,346
Come game time, we make a tent.
We are an indoor igloo. Come here.

241
00:30:43,381 --> 00:30:47,346
- I am on the bad side.
- Okay, the bad side. Casey, help out.

242
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:51,346
- Everything is ruined.
- It's okay. Let me look.

243
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:58,306
Please, stop it.
What is wrong with you.

244
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:01,766
- Who is the Arthenon?
- I.

245
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:03,991
- Who is the Invectra?
- I.

246
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:08,546
Leah, come here.
Your coat is not properly closed.

247
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:17,906
- I'm glad you liked it.
- Let us hope that your mom that is.

248
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:21,266
I need to call.

249
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:38,351
I am so sorry.

250
00:31:38,386 --> 00:31:41,906
Maybe she is sick. I thought yesterday
Paulie that car was sick,

251
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,306
but perhaps he was really sick.

252
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:46,151
Great.

253
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:50,786
You bring them here if they are sick.
You know how Leah is admissible.

254
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:56,306
They are children, Chloe.
Things go round, there it is.

255
00:31:56,746 --> 00:31:58,786
Ga just sit.

256
00:34:11,146 --> 00:34:13,266
My God.

257
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:17,706
What do you...
Please bring the children inside.

258
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:21,626
Bring the kids inside.
Please.

259
00:34:25,586 --> 00:34:27,826
Come here.

260
00:34:36,546 --> 00:34:40,746
Damn.
What the hell going on?

261
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:56,706
Listen to me.
Go sit down.

262
00:35:00,986 --> 00:35:02,786
Paulie.

263
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:08,571
The ambulance and police
are about half hour.

264
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,626
Police?

265
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:12,911
If the roads were bad.

266
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:16,366
- God, what happened?
- Fucking Paulie, what do you think?

267
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:19,786
- Is he okay? Where is he going?
- It's my damn blood.

268
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:23,026
I get...
Casey, you...

269
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:40,546
Let him.

270
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:46,826
Where are the children?
Where are my babies?

271
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:51,186
- I think they started the forest.
- God.

272
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:53,546
Stay here.

273
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:58,226
- Quiet. I will search the woods.
- I want my babies.

274
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:01,266
I do not know what to do.

275
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:57,506
- Is he really dead?
- You have it so cold.

276
00:36:59,146 --> 00:37:04,786
- Tell me then, dear.
- I do not know.

277
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:09,026
- But you were there.
- I think he was on the sled. He must...

278
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,946
- But you should still have seen...
- I have not seen. Okay?

279
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,346
But Robbie helped you with the children.

280
00:37:17,426 --> 00:37:20,186
I was not there.

281
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:26,026
I went to the track to see Lisa.
She came to retrieve me for the party.

282
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:32,706
I am returned.

283
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:39,346
I would be Chloe.

284
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:44,026
Search for the children.

285
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:28,386
Leah, what is it?

286
00:39:34,946 --> 00:39:39,106
I am.
Casey.

287
00:39:47,226 --> 00:39:49,306
It is okay.

288
00:40:19,226 --> 00:40:21,146
Princess?

289
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:34,226
Hello, Princess.

290
00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:48,226
- Are you mad at me?
- Of course not. I would never be.

291
00:40:48,261 --> 00:40:53,666
- What you are doing.
- Where is Uncle Robbie?

292
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:59,386
Come here. Sit down.

293
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:03,106
I have something to say.

294
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:18,791
- I love you.
- I love you, Daddy.

295
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:23,146
I am sorry that I was not at.
I was upset.

296
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:28,706
- Why were you upset?
- Casey.

297
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:40,551
It is okay.
Chloe, please come inside.

298
00:41:40,586 --> 00:41:43,671
- No, I want him to leave.
- You'll freeze.

299
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:47,290
Casey is a moment
with the children. It is okay.

300
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:48,906
I want him to leave.

301
00:41:48,946 --> 00:41:54,106
- You can not see me Robbie.
- She told him not to move.

302
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:58,066
Come on. Chloe, come inside.

303
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:12,786
Yes, I understand that.
But now it takes much longer.

304
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:13,466
- Help me. Mommy.
- Paulie.

305
00:45:17,386 --> 00:45:19,706
It is okay.

306
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:27,231
Come here, baby.
Come on.

307
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:31,026
Mommy is here.
It is all right, Paulie.

308
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:34,946
No, Paulie. Wait.
It is okay. Take my hand.

309
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:37,946
Take my hand.
Yes, you're a good boy.

310
00:45:43,146 --> 00:45:47,226
Not moving. Give me your hand.
It is okay. Not moving.

311
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:52,586
Come to me. Come on.

312
00:46:22,586 --> 00:46:25,426
Mommy.

313
00:47:03,746 --> 00:47:05,706
Excuse me.

314
00:47:41,586 --> 00:47:43,546
Mommy.

315
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:55,146
Stop.

316
00:48:00,466 --> 00:48:02,746
What is wrong with you?

317
00:48:06,546 --> 00:48:10,386
- Tell it to the tent to go.
- I do not here with him.

318
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:14,066
Please, Casey.
Let her not enter.

319
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,546
Favorite.

320
00:48:25,106 --> 00:48:27,266
It's Mommy.

321
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:33,546
Favorite?

322
00:48:51,426 --> 00:48:53,466
My God.

323
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:39,186
Come out.

324
00:49:54,746 --> 00:49:57,306
Paulie, baby.

325
00:50:32,506 --> 00:50:35,066
My God, no.

326
00:50:35,101 --> 00:50:37,626
It is good.

327
00:50:38,026 --> 00:50:40,186
It is good. I got it.

328
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:44,386
Paulie, baby.

329
00:50:48,786 --> 00:50:53,346
Paulie, come on. Look at me.

330
00:50:58,506 --> 00:50:59,639
Papa.

331
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:05,466
It's good, baby. I do so. Ga in.

332
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:14,746
They can not see.

333
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:52,346
What have you done?

334
00:51:54,826 --> 00:51:58,466
Paulie would be in my face
have been.

335
00:51:58,826 --> 00:52:02,706
Mama had to keep him from me.
She had no choice.

336
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,866
Mama.

337
00:52:26,866 --> 00:52:29,266
You have to say.

338
00:52:31,706 --> 00:52:33,666
I do not know.

339
00:52:34,306 --> 00:52:36,866
I do not know.

340
00:52:44,146 --> 00:52:47,266
You guys are monsters.

341
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:49,986
How could you do that?

342
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:55,346
You were never a mother figure,
but even then.

343
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,746
You have your baby killed.

344
00:53:01,226 --> 00:53:06,306
Jonah, what should we do now?

345
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:11,726
Maybe we should go to the police.

346
00:53:11,761 --> 00:53:14,271
Nobody leaves here
my children are.

347
00:53:14,306 --> 00:53:17,346
We can not help them.
They were stabbing you down in the tent.

348
00:53:17,381 --> 00:53:19,706
- You've seen them.
- We must find them.

349
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:22,586
Get your hands on my body.

350
00:53:30,026 --> 00:53:32,386
Excuse me.

351
00:53:40,146 --> 00:53:45,106
Elaine, you stay here. Wait for the police.
The rest are looking into the children.

352
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:47,426
- I let Mommy alone.
- You do what I tell you.

353
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:50,466
It remains away from my family.

354
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:14,186
Mama.

355
00:54:17,746 --> 00:54:22,626
I am. Mouse.

356
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:25,111
It was your fault.

357
00:54:25,146 --> 00:54:28,111
They do not want to really.
I think they are sick.

358
00:54:28,146 --> 00:54:32,806
There was vomit in the woods
and Paulie was sick yesterday, huh.

359
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:37,466
Even if you believe me not, stay
Please away from Leah and Nicky.

360
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:40,066
I think they are very sick.

361
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,826
They are here.

362
00:55:57,346 --> 00:56:01,026
What have they done with my babies?

363
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:09,186
Open your eyes.
Jonah, it's Casey.

364
00:56:13,106 --> 00:56:16,066
She was out with Robbie.
It was me.

365
00:56:16,101 --> 00:56:20,031
And then she Lainy Paulie dead.

366
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:23,122
God. Look, Jonah, blood.

367
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:26,986
The blood of my children.

368
00:56:29,906 --> 00:56:32,227
She is in my house.

369
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:36,626
What if they go home? It is there.

370
00:56:37,506 --> 00:56:43,426
We must do something.
You must be the case in hands.

371
00:57:06,866 --> 00:57:09,346
A policeman.

372
00:57:26,066 --> 00:57:31,186
- You have to stay here...
- Your mom is upset.

373
00:57:31,221 --> 00:57:35,786
She is hurt.
She must rest.

374
00:57:35,821 --> 00:57:37,546
Mommy.

375
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:58,226
And Lisa?

376
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,866
I can call her.
They can come out.

377
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:05,306
- Search into the phone, lickspittle.
- I look at Mommy.

378
00:58:05,346 --> 00:58:09,546
Whatever you do,
Please do not let them inside.

379
00:58:42,746 --> 00:58:44,306
Mommy.

380
00:58:49,146 --> 00:58:54,626
God, you so cold.
Are you sick?

381
00:58:57,066 --> 00:59:01,706
You need it so cold.
Honey, where is your brother?

382
00:59:01,741 --> 00:59:04,066
Where is it, baby?

383
00:59:04,906 --> 00:59:06,946
Where is he?

384
01:00:04,306 --> 01:00:07,746
My God, I love you.

385
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:13,306
- Mommy.
- My beautiful boy.

386
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:17,386
Mommy is here.
I leave you with nothing done.

387
01:00:50,826 --> 01:00:52,586
Do not.

388
01:01:13,226 --> 01:01:16,986
Get up. Open the door.
Come on.

389
01:01:31,826 --> 01:01:35,346
Ga out.
Miranda, ga out.

390
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,111
Papa.

391
01:01:45,146 --> 01:01:48,386
If its something you have done,
than you... I swear

392
01:01:50,906 --> 01:01:52,746
Papa.

393
01:01:59,066 --> 01:02:01,386
Let her mom not murder.

394
01:02:05,906 --> 01:02:08,146
What is going on?

395
01:02:08,786 --> 01:02:12,866
- Casey has hurt me.
- Jonah?

396
01:02:12,906 --> 01:02:14,946
Stay here, honey.

397
01:02:18,786 --> 01:02:20,986
You guys are fucking each other while.

398
01:02:21,021 --> 01:02:23,026
Jonah, please.

399
01:02:29,226 --> 01:02:31,846
- Bye, Mommy.
- What?

400
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:34,466
Be nice to Leah and Nicky.

401
01:02:37,226 --> 01:02:40,066
I do, Dad.

402
01:03:18,466 --> 01:03:23,506
It is okay, Princess.
Everything is fine.

403
01:03:36,226 --> 01:03:38,106
Mama.

404
01:05:44,986 --> 01:05:46,586
Mama.

405
01:05:49,226 --> 01:05:52,186
Please do not let them inside.

406
01:06:17,586 --> 01:06:20,866
Mama, say something.

407
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:43,226
- Please tell me something.
- Casey, silent.

408
01:07:12,906 --> 01:07:14,746
Mama.

409
01:08:28,546 --> 01:08:31,426
It is okay, Leah.

410
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:33,986
It is Lainy.

411
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,866
God.

412
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,071
Stay.

413
01:08:52,106 --> 01:08:55,826
Stay away from me.
Please.

414
01:09:11,946 --> 01:09:14,386
I do not...

415
01:09:15,426 --> 01:09:18,546
Please, Mommy.
Please.

416
01:09:25,226 --> 01:09:28,226
Where is Mommy?

417
01:09:33,506 --> 01:09:35,746
God.

418
01:09:36,466 --> 01:09:38,826
Paulie.

419
01:09:39,866 --> 01:09:42,986
Excuse me, Casey.

420
01:09:44,906 --> 01:09:48,546
Excuse me.

421
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:54,226
Please.

422
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:51,466
Stupid idiot.

423
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:55,191
I am so sorry.

424
01:11:55,226 --> 01:11:58,706
I told you already
that he was a fool.

425
01:13:10,866 --> 01:13:14,506
It is okay. I ga do.

426
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:33,146
Okay, baby, okay.

427
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:50,066
- Is it okay?
- I gotta ask.

428
01:17:50,146 --> 01:17:52,986
I go to my mother.
