1
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:38,575
IN THE YEAR 2055

2
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,359
A NEW TECHNOLOGY WAS INVENTED

3
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,837
THAT COULD CHANGE THE WORLD...

4
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:49,317
OR DESTROY IT.

5
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,362
A MAN NAMED CHARLES HATTON

6
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,841
USED IT TO MAKE MONEY.

7
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:08,497
A SOUND OF THUNDER

8
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:37,765
I haven't seen any wildlife yet.

9
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:41,896
We could be in downtown Pittsburgh,
for all I know.

10
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:44,245
Dad, how are you holding up?

11
00:01:44,593 --> 00:01:46,071
I'm fine, I'm fine,

12
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:49,246
except for you asking me every
two minutes how I'm holding up.

13
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,377
Sorry, honey.

14
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,117
I'm hot.

15
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:56,422
How much further do we...

16
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,901
Jesus, take that thing
out of my face!

17
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:03,597
Sorry, Dad doesn't like cameras unless
he's got his trench coat over his face.

18
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,163
How's the old man doing?

19
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,425
Heart rate slightly elevated,
blood pressure normal.

20
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,426
I got $100 says Travis
taps his daughter tonight.

21
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:14,731
Sucker bet.

22
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:17,862
You might want to record
over the last bit.

23
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,037
When are we gonna see something?

24
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:24,733
What?

25
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:27,212
If you don't talk,
you might hear something.

26
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,735
Hear what?

27
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:33,779
All right, everyone, get ready!

28
00:02:33,997 --> 00:02:36,998
Remember, your weapons
won't fire until mine does,

29
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:38,737
so be patient!

30
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:47,001
What the...?

31
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,088
Wait for my command!

32
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:56,002
Dad, how are you...

33
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:58,872
Sorry!

34
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:06,962
Whatever happens,
do not step off of the path.

35
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:08,571
Thank you for sharing.

36
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:15,007
Oh, my God!

37
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:18,878
Cute, isn't he?

38
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:28,055
You don't see that in downtown
Pittsburgh, do you Mr. Wallenbeck?

39
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,318
Shoot, for Christ's sake!

40
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,666
Heart rate elevated.

41
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,493
- Shoot it!
- Wait.

42
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,452
Hold it.

43
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:57,149
- Not yet!
- Are you crazy?

44
00:03:57,845 --> 00:03:58,758
Shoot it!

45
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,107
Now!

46
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:48,467
Anything to say, Mr. Wallenbeck?

47
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:04,384
Gentlemen and lady.

48
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:08,429
Today you stood shoulder-to-shoulder
with Columbus discovering America,

49
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:12,169
Armstrong stepping on the moon,
Brubaker landing on Mars.

50
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:13,213
You are true pioneers

51
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,605
on the very last frontier:
Time.

52
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:19,780
On behalf of us all at Time Safari,
Incorporated,

53
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:23,736
I congratulate you
on a truly thrilling hunt.

54
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,780
I'm proud to know you.

55
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:27,781
I have to say,

56
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,043
of all the jumps I've seen,

57
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:35,087
your group's was by far
the most courageous and skillful.

58
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:38,480
I was scared out of my mind.
My heart's still pounding.

59
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:41,959
That's a nominal physiological
reaction to the jump.

60
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:45,264
Your heart rate will slow
as we gain distance from the event

61
00:05:45,482 --> 00:05:47,700
and adrenaline flow
is reduced.

62
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:48,961
What?

63
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,483
It is.

64
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,485
Can I ask you something, Mr. Hatton?

65
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:01,095
Of course.
Anything at all.

66
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,922
Where's Travis Ryer?

67
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,971
- You look like you could use a drink.
- Nope.

68
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,841
You're a government inspector.

69
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:32,494
- You're supposed to drink on the job.
- I don't drink.

70
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:35,190
Then this is the best
you'll feel all day.

71
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:38,582
- I hate these jumps, is all.
- Picked the right line of work.

72
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,279
Biding my time.
Couple more years, I'll be out.

73
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:44,367
Civil Service pays you guys
enough to retire early?

74
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:47,802
Have a good night.

75
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:52,152
This is the clearest reading of
molecular blood structure

76
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,587
<i>- we've ever had.
- You are correct, Dr. Ryer.</i>

77
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,153
I'm getting closer and you know it.

78
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,806
<i>- Yes, Dr. Ryer.
- Contain your enthusiasm.</i>

79
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:01,762
<i>My function is to facilitate
the operation of Time Safari,</i>

80
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:04,110
<i>not your private research.
On that subject,</i>

81
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:07,633
<i>will you be filing your report
on today's jump tonight</i>

82
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,851
<i>or at the last possible moment
tomorrow, as usual?</i>

83
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,721
<i>- Nobody likes a nag.
- Reminding is not nagging.</i>

84
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,722
You've got an answer for everything.

85
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,157
<i>I have to.
I was extremely expensive.</i>

86
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,853
It's not always a good quality.

87
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,593
<i>I understand, Dr. Ryer.</i>

88
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,507
So don't have the last word.

89
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,594
<i>- I won't, Dr. Ryer.
- You did it.</i>

90
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:25,638
<i>- I'm sorry, Dr. Ryer.
- You did it again.</i>

91
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:28,378
Anything going on between you two
that I should know about?

92
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:31,162
<i>- Good evening, Mr. Hatton.
- Hello, TAMI.</i>

93
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:33,293
The guests are asking for you.

94
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:35,598
I'll be finished in a few minutes.

95
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:39,207
When I say guests,
it's a euphemism. I mean clients,

96
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,295
as in "people who pay."

97
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:43,774
If I remember correctly,
clients keep us waiting,

98
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:46,035
not the other way around.

99
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:47,340
I'm almost done.

100
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:52,036
I don't think
you're catching my drift.

101
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,776
You work here so you can study

102
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:59,081
your silly animals
who don't exist anymore.

103
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:01,734
I work here so I can grow
rich and fat

104
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:04,735
and own everything
that does happen to exist.

105
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:08,475
I hired you because
you're this big deal scientist

106
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,563
and clients pay more for a big deal
anything, it makes them feel important.

107
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:14,608
Rotten, I know.
But progress is a rotten business,

108
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:17,304
which is why you have to go
out there and mingle with them.

109
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:20,957
They pay, you study, I get rich.
Is this a great country, or what?

110
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:25,567
Did I mention you signed
a contract and you have to do this?

111
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:27,481
I don't remember if I did.

112
00:08:31,308 --> 00:08:33,569
Oh, my speech was that good?

113
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:35,657
Or were you done anyway?

114
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,441
A safari suit, boots, helmet

115
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:45,702
and a holo-disc to relive the jump.

116
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,138
Take an especially close look
at this disc,

117
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:50,617
- Mr. Wallenbeck.
- Why's that?

118
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:51,834
Well...

119
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:56,053
I can't be certain
until I review it myself,

120
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,315
but I'm pretty sure
your shot brought him down.

121
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,273
Well, yeah.

122
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,147
Security!

123
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,191
A toast to all of you big,
brave hunters!

124
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,757
Congratulations!

125
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:30,454
What's the matter?

126
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,323
You want to shoot dinosaurs,
you're afraid of a little blood?

127
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,542
You don't understand
the danger of what you're doing!

128
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:39,673
You keep messing with the past,
one day you'll ruin the future!

129
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:42,326
You should know better!

130
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:45,283
Are you so stupid
you can't see you're being used?

131
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,720
Well, that was fun.

132
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:55,156
Harder and harder to get good waiters.

133
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:14,117
- What was she yelling about?
- The usual:

134
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:16,814
Time jumps
will destroy the world. Crackpot.

135
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:21,118
A century ago she would have been
screaming about the Internet or biotech.

136
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:24,685
Some people are afraid of progress.
She's a dinosaur herself.

137
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,294
Let her yell all she wants.

138
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,773
Don't let her spoil the party.

139
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,210
I'm fine!

140
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:39,471
- I prefer walking on my own, thanks.
- Guys, whoa! Hold on.

141
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,081
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

142
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,691
Tell me what that was all about.

143
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:49,257
You don't have a clue what you're doing.
You'll destroy everything!

144
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:52,823
Lady, no offense, but I think
I'm qualified to offer an opinion.

145
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:54,910
I work with TAMI. I lead the jumps.

146
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:56,955
You're the one who's clueless.

147
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,173
- You're Travis Ryer?
- That's right.

148
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,434
Mr. Ryer, there's a lot
about TAMI you don't know.

149
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:04,043
- It's Dr. Ryer.
- Dr. Ryer.

150
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:06,870
One of the many things
you don't know is that I'm Sonia Rand.

151
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:09,306
I invented TAMI, you asshole.

152
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,958
Excuse me!

153
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,785
Miss, wait up a second.

154
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:18,481
There are seven credited names
on TAMI's patent.

155
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,569
I don't recall
a Dr. Rand being one of them.

156
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:23,700
- I don't have time for stupid people.
- Make some time.

157
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:26,353
And stop with the insults.
It gets on my nerves.

158
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:29,354
Do you think I'd devote
my career to designing

159
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:31,833
an amusement park ride
for rich men with little willies

160
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,703
to shoot prehistoric animals?

161
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:35,747
I think if you were a guy

162
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:38,356
someone would have knocked you
on your ass a long time ago.

163
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:40,618
So shoot me.

164
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,488
If you oppose TAMI's use,
why build her

165
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:46,359
- in the first place?
- I built her because I'm a scientist.

166
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:50,360
Possibilities drive us. What they said
was impossible, I knew could be done.

167
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,969
I applied for a research grant
with a company called CJN Co.

168
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:56,231
They handed out money
and left me alone.

169
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,754
Your actual dream come true,
until I finished developing TAMI.

170
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:00,493
Then why haven't I heard of you?

171
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,232
I'm a nerd, not a lawyer. Turns out
there was a clause in my contract.

172
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:07,277
CJN Co. Owned the patent on whatever
I developed with their money.

173
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:08,842
Guess who controls the company?

174
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:11,104
- Charles Hatton.
- Very good.

175
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,365
It seems I signed
a non-disclosure agreement,

176
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,192
so Hatton removed my name and,

177
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,062
except for tonight, shut me up.

178
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,194
I get upset watching you people
destroy the world with my dream.

179
00:12:21,411 --> 00:12:24,021
That can piss someone off.
What's your excuse?

180
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:25,369
You really want to know?

181
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,938
I'm getting close,

182
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:43,635
- really close.
- Close to what?

183
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,766
Look carefully.
Tell me what you think it is.

184
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:49,245
A DNA strand of some kind.

185
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:52,680
- Can you tell what kind?
- No, I got a D in Biology.

186
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:59,812
His ancestor.

187
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:04,248
When I was a little boy,
my grandfather used to tell me stories

188
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,554
about actually seeing
real animals in the wild.

189
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:10,641
Imagine seeing him run free.

190
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:14,251
The last wild animal born
out of captivity was a crocodile.

191
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:16,252
She died 38 years ago.

192
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:18,426
Then the poachers started
hitting the zoos and the virus

193
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:21,079
took care of the rest.
Millions of years of evolution,

194
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:23,210
and we kill them off
in a few thousand...

195
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,385
and screw up their DNA.
We can't even clone them.

196
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:28,298
- He was beautiful.
- That's why I do this job.

197
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:32,126
When we go on a hunt we obviously
can't take physical samples,

198
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:35,257
but I've created a way
to take remote DNA readings.

199
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,562
I can only do it in bits,
but the bits add up.

200
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,302
One day, I'll reconstruct
the DNA from animals

201
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,388
that lived long before the virus.

202
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:45,128
I can bring them back.

203
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:47,564
Saving animals by killing them,
that makes sense.

204
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:50,391
The animals we hunt have to be
in the last seconds of their life

205
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:52,391
so we don't upset
the course of history.

206
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:54,435
That allosaurus is shot cleanly,

207
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:56,653
seconds before
he gets bogged down in a swamp

208
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,480
5 minutes before
a volcano erupts and fries him

209
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:01,350
in hot lava.

210
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,569
I wish people would pay
for a photo safari

211
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:07,004
instead of a hunting safari.

212
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,005
But they don't.
There's no other way.

213
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:12,832
So you bring rich tourists back
to the past o jeopardize the future.

214
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:15,746
I appreciate
what you're trying to accomplish.

215
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:17,877
But it's dangerous. This is bigger

216
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:20,269
than what you
or anyone else is working on.

217
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,226
It's bulletproof.

218
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:24,226
A new government agency
is assigned to us.

219
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:27,010
They check our protocols up,
down, and sideways.

220
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:28,706
That's how Hatton
got the green light.

221
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:31,401
You don't have a clue about
Charles Hatton! It's about money.

222
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:34,359
It's always the same
when there's so much of it involved.

223
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,098
But this is different.

224
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,969
You are messing
with the whole of evolution.

225
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,404
Nothing is bulletproof.

226
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,274
It must have been amazing.

227
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:46,449
God help us.

228
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:57,061
Hey, pal, you break it,
you bought it.

229
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:58,148
Sorry.

230
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:08,629
Whoa, what's that?

231
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,804
The molecular structure
of allosaurus blood.

232
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:11,978
No way.

233
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,152
Cool.

234
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,638
The doorman let me in.

235
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,248
I told him I was
your cousin from St. Louis.

236
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:54,293
I always did like Aunt Martha.

237
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:09,863
I'm afraid I've killed it.
Or at least driven it to suicide.

238
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:11,471
Got a bit of a brown thumb.

239
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:17,081
- Maybe a little sunlight will help.
- You just moved in?

240
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,691
No, I've been here
for about two years.

241
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,735
Okay.

242
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:34,738
Chloe thinks I'm going to a farm.

243
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:35,521
What's that about?

244
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:37,609
My wife told her I was
going to sow some wild oats.

245
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,609
Adorable. Little kids are adorable.

246
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,262
Could you say that
with less enthusiasm?

247
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,089
I'm not fond of adorable.
I rate it just below perky.

248
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:48,612
It's nice you have a family.

249
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:50,917
Without families,
what would we do with Christmas?

250
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,352
Me? I run my company
and that's about it.

251
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,396
Your kids will grow up.

252
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,745
My company will be
acquired by somebody. So what?

253
00:16:57,962 --> 00:17:00,050
We're sleepwalking through life.

254
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:02,789
Admit it or not,
we're bored out of our minds.

255
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,485
I'm not bored out of my mind.

256
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:07,138
What's the last exciting thing you did?

257
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,182
- Play fetch with your dog?
- I don't know...

258
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:12,052
Come on! This'll arouse
the old, dormant male instinct.

259
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,662
- Make us feel alive.
- It's awfully expensive.

260
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:16,793
Why be rich if we don't buy things

261
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:18,532
other people can't afford?

262
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:29,579
George, how's life?

263
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:32,406
I can't complain.
If I did, who would listen?

264
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:34,754
Tell me about it. Oh, could you...

265
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,233
- I'll get a cab for your cousin.
- Thanks.

266
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,844
Standard liability release forms.

267
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:48,932
- That's a lot of forms.
- There's a lot of liability.

268
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,323
We take you back
65 million years to hunt

269
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,063
the greatest predator
the world has ever seen.

270
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,759
We are the first
and only people able to do this.

271
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,891
We use technology that wasn't
even a dream a few years ago.

272
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:03,500
A new federal agency,
the Department of Temporal Regulation,

273
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:05,240
was created for us.

274
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:08,415
This is not a game.
There is no reset button.

275
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:10,067
Today, on this hunt...

276
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:11,677
someone will die.

277
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:13,373
The prey... or the hunters.

278
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:17,591
There is no middle ground.
Imprint where indicated.

279
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,593
By the way,
deposits are non-refundable.

280
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:27,159
- Sure we should do this?
- There's a 6-year waiting list.

281
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,812
We paid double to cut
to the head of the line

282
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,639
and you want to slink home?

283
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:34,727
You want to spend the rest of your life
with balls the size of BBs?

284
00:18:38,423 --> 00:18:39,380
What the hell!

285
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,554
They're so big
I can hear 'em clanging.

286
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:50,339
How was the other night
with the lovely Ms. Wallenbeck?

287
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:53,731
- It's none of your business.
- He said defensively.

288
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,340
If you must know, I sent her home.

289
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:57,515
Before or after?

290
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,211
Sometimes you can be a real brat.

291
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,169
Jen, I promised your father
that I would always look after you.

292
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:07,996
- Are you going to lecture me?
- No, I just...

293
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,345
Good, because Jeffrey
and I only went out for...

294
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:12,823
Who is Jeffrey?

295
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,302
- You don't know?
- No. Who is he?

296
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,999
I thought you were talking
about Jeffrey.

297
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:20,130
What exactly did you and Jeffrey do?

298
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,174
- Nothing.
- Tell me now.

299
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:23,870
Not going to happen.

300
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:29,698
What were you going to say just now?

301
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,828
I don't know.

302
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:36,003
I know we're sure
about what we're doing...

303
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,177
Yeah, and?

304
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:38,395
But maybe...

305
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,047
Maybe what?

306
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:43,135
I don't know. It's nothing.

307
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:58,922
Derris, what do you do
when you're not spying

308
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,662
for the government on us?
You got a family? Wife?

309
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,402
Significant other?

310
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:05,707
Goldfish?

311
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:08,490
No, you probably
go crazy at home, right?

312
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:12,839
Lampshade on your head,
chicken feet, whips.

313
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:14,405
I know it.

314
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,057
Everyone,

315
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:20,146
this is Mr. Middleton

316
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:22,232
and Mr. Eckles.

317
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:25,189
Gentlemen, this is your jump team.

318
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:29,191
Jennifer Krase will record
the holo-disc of your hunt.

319
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:32,191
Marcus Payne is your jump technician.

320
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,062
Dr. Lucas keeps
everyone ticking. And this...

321
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:39,411
is Dr. Travis Ryer.

322
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,933
You must be Mr. Eckles.

323
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,890
It's an honor to meet you, Dr. Ryer.

324
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:45,152
You're half the reason
my wife let me do this.

325
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,891
- What's the other half?
- He has a huge insurance policy.

326
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,196
Mr. Middleton.

327
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:54,502
It's nice to have clients who look
like they know what they're doing.

328
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,764
I have a good feeling about this jump.

329
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,286
You're in for the ride of your life.

330
00:20:59,503 --> 00:21:01,417
We have developed technology

331
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,722
that is absolute cutting edge.

332
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:07,636
Actually, it was developed for us
by a Dr. Sonia Rand.

333
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:08,984
Isn't that correct?

334
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:17,160
Gentlemen, your weapons are
laser designated.

335
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:21,422
They're gauss rifles. They fire
frozen liquid nitrogen bullets

336
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:24,335
- that completely dissolve in 2 minutes.
- Wait a minute.

337
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:26,380
We'll take down a dinosaur with ice?

338
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:38,687
Second rule of time jumping:
Don't leave anything behind.

339
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:50,778
Not another.
I'm getting track marks.

340
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:54,126
The third rule of time jumping:
Don't bring anything back.

341
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:56,431
What's rule number one?

342
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,780
No matter how small, never change

343
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:02,258
anything in the past. Nothing.

344
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:06,042
You kill a bee, then maybe the flower
it was going to pollinate doesn't grow

345
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,043
and its seeds don't get spread

346
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:11,739
and the animal that was going to

347
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,870
eat the vegetation can't,
and it dies,

348
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:16,306
and it was carrying genes
for a new kind

349
00:22:16,523 --> 00:22:18,263
of animal that doesn't occur

350
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,046
and it alters the course of evolution.
A single bee.

351
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:26,352
The farther back,
the more catastrophic changes could be.

352
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:28,526
So, rule number one?

353
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:29,875
Don't change anything.

354
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:33,049
Hey. Brass balls, remember?

355
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:53,359
Everyone, visors down.

356
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:00,795
This is a com check.
Everyone hearing me okay?

357
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:02,665
- Ryer, check.
- Krase, check.

358
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,840
- Derris, check.
- Lucas, check.

359
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:05,971
Check.

360
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:08,972
Tell him you can hear him.

361
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:11,929
Okay, follow me.

362
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,066
Hands to your side.

363
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:50,808
Oh my God, it's so tight.
I can't move.

364
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:52,548
Why so tight?

365
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:55,071
We are going to enter
the virtual receiver.

366
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:58,854
You've got to stay still or the particle
beam will not hit the right spot.

367
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:00,985
You want all those atoms winding up

368
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:03,508
in the same place
and as the same people.

369
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:17,860
If you feel disoriented,

370
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:20,773
concentrate on your heartbeat,
it'll calm you down.

371
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:24,644
And whatever you do,
don't look into the light!

372
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:25,601
What?

373
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:28,863
Just kidding.
This is supposed to be fun.

374
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,167
Let's go get him!

375
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:17,919
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're both fine.

376
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:21,006
Remember, don't touch anything.

377
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:41,925
- Something up, Mr. Eckles?
- My gun doesn't work!

378
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:44,056
That's a safety feature.
They won't fire until

379
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:46,970
- Travis fires first.
- Why the hell not?

380
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,623
To keep clients from
shooting things they shouldn't.

381
00:25:50,188 --> 00:25:52,841
Derris, let's not mention this
in our report.

382
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:55,233
- No harm, no foul.
- Appreciate it.

383
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,016
I'm not that big of a dick.
I just like to talk.

384
00:25:58,277 --> 00:26:01,278
Eckles is barely holding it together.
BP's through the roof,

385
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:03,670
breathing's shallow. Watch him.

386
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:05,540
This animal's big, right?

387
00:26:05,757 --> 00:26:07,715
Better be for this money.

388
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:10,671
Check it out.

389
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,150
That's him, isn't it?

390
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:16,238
- Guys, remember...
- Is that him?

391
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:18,151
...wait for my command.

392
00:26:19,934 --> 00:26:22,587
Whatever happens,
do not step off of the path.

393
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:27,763
Holy...

394
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:29,372
Cute, isn't he?

395
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:37,635
Get a grip, Ted!

396
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:42,897
All right, big guy.

397
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:44,028
Three steps.

398
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:52,161
Now turn your head to the right.

399
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:56,249
Wait! Not yet.

400
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:00,163
Hold it.

401
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:03,772
Hold it!

402
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:06,338
Now!

403
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:09,556
Jenny, take the shot!

404
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,123
Payne, we got a major problem here!

405
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:22,429
The designator shorted out! The safety
won't release on the other guns!

406
00:27:22,647 --> 00:27:24,821
- Fix it!
- Even if I could, it'll take time!

407
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,082
We don't have time!

408
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,257
Cut it out, for Christ's sake!

409
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:31,736
This is part of the show, right?

410
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:33,954
Over here! Try and get me!

411
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:36,912
Come on, you bastard, take me on!

412
00:27:37,216 --> 00:27:39,043
Get behind the bushes!

413
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,348
That's right! Come and get me!

414
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:46,740
- Get behind the bushes!
- We're not going alone!

415
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,741
You guys, run! Take off!

416
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,741
Get behind him!

417
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,612
Over here! Take me on!

418
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:59,656
Come on! Over here, you asshole!

419
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:08,311
- Shit!
- Over here, big guy! Yo! Yo!

420
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:09,615
Jenny, no!

421
00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:12,094
Jenny, get down!

422
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,052
Go, yo!

423
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,227
Come on, over this way! Over here.

424
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,966
Come for me!

425
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:22,315
Jenny, go!

426
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:25,316
- Payne, my gun!
- I got it!

427
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:28,273
Over here! Look at me!

428
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,621
Now try it!

429
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,629
Don't you ever
pull a stunt like that again!

430
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:04,065
If anyone dies to save someone's rich,
fat ass, it'll be me. Got it?

431
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:06,891
Where are the clients?

432
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:10,632
Let's go.

433
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:12,719
Anyone hurt?

434
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:13,980
They're fine.

435
00:29:16,851 --> 00:29:17,938
You sure he's dead?

436
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:21,852
- You want to check his pulse, Ted?
- He fell right where he was supposed to.

437
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,940
You got lucky.

438
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:26,462
Did anyone break any protocols?

439
00:29:27,028 --> 00:29:28,376
Then we're clean.

440
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,463
- Travis, the volcano.
- We better get going.

441
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:31,854
Follow me.

442
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:57,035
By the time I'm done suing you,
I am going to own this joint!

443
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,079
That's your right, Mr. Middleton.

444
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:01,384
I understand you're upset.

445
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:03,602
But look beyond
your immediate feelings.

446
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:06,124
Look at what you achieved today.

447
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:08,429
I almost achieved getting eaten!

448
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:10,039
And you weren't.

449
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:12,779
Countless clients
have jumped back through time

450
00:30:12,996 --> 00:30:16,127
faced the allosaurus, and gone home

451
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:19,433
proud that they cheated death.
And in reality, they cheated nothing.

452
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,606
It was elaborate, expensive,
authentic, and a fantasy.

453
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:23,911
It was controlled.

454
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:26,608
The outcome never in doubt.
Not for a moment.

455
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,912
You two.

456
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,478
Circumstances were thrust upon you,
like all moments of great courage.

457
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:35,480
Sue me if you want to,
but for Christ's sake,

458
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:37,872
look at what you two did today.

459
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:41,481
You faced death for real!
All controls off

460
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,134
and you survived!

461
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:46,309
You stood shoulder-to-shoulder,
Columbus...

462
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:47,831
Jesus.

463
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:51,354
...discovering America,
Armstrong walking on the moon,

464
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:54,398
Brubaker landing on Mars!

465
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,095
You are true pioneers!

466
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:02,922
Gentlemen,

467
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:05,792
I salute you.

468
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:26,623
I swear, that dude could sell
art lessons to a blind man.

469
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,450
So what happened?

470
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,103
Moisture damage. A leak

471
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:34,191
from a broken box of nitrogen bullets.

472
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:36,104
I tested the gun before we jumped,

473
00:31:36,322 --> 00:31:38,105
but the short occurred after.

474
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:41,323
We have to change our whole procedure.
This cannot happen again.

475
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:43,976
It was an accident, you know?

476
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:47,325
We cannot have accidents.

477
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:50,456
While I was a physics major in college,

478
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:54,762
we studied something called
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

479
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,502
It proves that there is no such thing

480
00:31:57,719 --> 00:32:00,242
as zero tolerance. It doesn't exist.

481
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:04,242
You basically can't be
a hundred percent sure of anything.

482
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:07,156
No matter how hard you try, accidents...

483
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:08,547
...happen.

484
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:11,722
We can't have accidents.

485
00:32:24,465 --> 00:32:27,292
Good evening, Dr. Ryer.
How about this weather?

486
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:30,075
I guess this is
what they call Indian summer.

487
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:32,597
70 degrees... in November!

488
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:35,337
It's different, that's for sure.

489
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:54,907
<i>Unseasonably hot weather continues
today with highs in the upper 80s.</i>

490
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,951
<i>The skies will be clear</i>

491
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:59,604
<i>and the humidity
will remain around 90 percent.</i>

492
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:02,953
<i>Thousands of fish beached themselves
on the shore of Lake Michigan overnight.</i>

493
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,693
<i>Scientists from the University
of Chicago are investigating.</i>

494
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,781
<i>They're at a loss to explain
what caused the phenomenon.</i>

495
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:12,825
<i>The beaching provides an opportunity
for amateur fishermen,</i>

496
00:33:13,043 --> 00:33:15,609
<i>but wait until
the cause is determined</i>

497
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:18,044
<i>before you eat your catch.</i>

498
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,827
<i>Suicidal fish. That's a new one.</i>

499
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:22,045
<i>The Health Department says</i>

500
00:33:22,263 --> 00:33:24,568
<i>that the UV count is extremely high,</i>

501
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:26,916
<i>so if you want to soak up</i>

502
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:29,656
<i>this amazing
warm sunshine in November,</i>

503
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,352
<i>you'd better protect yourself.</i>

504
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:34,570
<i>An SPF of 45
or stronger is recommended.</i>

505
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:46,094
What happened here?

506
00:33:46,312 --> 00:33:47,486
Check it out.

507
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:50,139
This wall's at least
three feet thick.

508
00:33:50,574 --> 00:33:52,575
That plant
must've really wanted out, huh?

509
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:04,013
Sorry.

510
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,796
What? You've seen me skinny-dipping.

511
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:07,318
You were eight.

512
00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:08,536
Get over it.

513
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,450
When did you become such a brat?

514
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,277
You ready for this today?

515
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:18,147
You know what they say
about falling off a horse?

516
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:19,321
Take a cab?

517
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:20,930
Get right back on.

518
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:24,714
What if your horse weighs
12,000 pounds and tries to eat you?

519
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:28,759
Everyone, everyone!

520
00:34:28,976 --> 00:34:32,976
Mr. Zong, Mr. Chang,
get ready for the ride of your lives!

521
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:37,021
Travis! Don't you want to say
something about the light?

522
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,631
Gentlemen,
please don't look at the lights.

523
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:45,241
Whatever.

524
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:48,154
All right. Let's do this.

525
00:35:13,509 --> 00:35:15,031
You feel it?

526
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:16,641
Something's off.

527
00:35:18,163 --> 00:35:19,641
Something's different.

528
00:35:25,512 --> 00:35:27,904
Travis! Look!

529
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,559
Oh, my God.

530
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:38,733
What is noise?

531
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,777
Back to the portal! Now!

532
00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:43,212
Everybody get back! Move!

533
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:46,300
Get them back to the portal now!

534
00:35:46,518 --> 00:35:48,040
Come on, let's go! Hurry!

535
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:49,823
Move! Get back!

536
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:51,302
Jenny, leave it!

537
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,259
When the path retracts,
it'll fall! On the ground!

538
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,738
Get them back to the portal now!

539
00:35:58,564 --> 00:36:00,782
Let's go, Jenny! Come on!

540
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:02,522
I said, let's go!

541
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,827
I can do this! Calm down!

542
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:07,828
Keep moving!

543
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:10,350
Run!

544
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:12,263
Jenny, run!

545
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:27,311
Lucas! What the hell
just happened back there?

546
00:36:27,528 --> 00:36:29,703
TAMI missed her entry point
by five minutes!

547
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,269
- We were late!
- Make sure everyone's all right.

548
00:36:32,486 --> 00:36:34,922
TAMI has never been off
by a millisecond before.

549
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:37,487
TAMI, why were you off
in your calculations?

550
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:39,358
<i>Please be specific, Dr. Ryer.</i>

551
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:42,880
On our last jump, you missed
our entry point by five minutes.

552
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:45,359
<i>- Why?
- I'm afraid you're mistaken, Doctor.</i>

553
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:49,404
<i>My calculations were precise. You were
sent to the correct coordinates.</i>

554
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:50,796
We need to talk.

555
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:00,928
We've just stepped
into a world of trouble.

556
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:03,581
She was off by five minutes,
out of 65 million years.

557
00:37:03,798 --> 00:37:05,755
It's a minor glitch.
We can fix it.

558
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,495
I had to file a report.

559
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,669
Jeez, Clay,
you didn't have to do that.

560
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:11,670
I had no alternative.

561
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:14,105
Of course you had an alternative.

562
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:17,193
You could have thought big
instead of little, which is all

563
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:20,325
your pea-brain is capable of
before it explodes.

564
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:23,065
Now you get to cause me grief
just because you can.

565
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,848
History's not a class struggle,
it's a vision struggle.

566
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:29,023
It's people like me trying to get free
from narrow-minded pricks like you.

567
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,893
Nothing moves without us,
we're the goddamned engine.

568
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:35,416
- This is out of my hands now.
- Like hell it is.

569
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:39,026
You know that regulations dictate
that this meeting has to be recorded.

570
00:37:39,243 --> 00:37:40,200
Of course.

571
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:44,723
The Temporal Regulation Division

572
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,897
proclaims this facility closed.

573
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:52,550
TAMI...

574
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,724
<i>ItAL Access denied.</i>

575
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,899
They don't waste time.

576
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:20,949
You can't ask me to do that.

577
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,472
I'm not asking you to do anything!

578
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:27,603
I'm simply reminding you of the
potential delicacy of our situation.

579
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:28,604
What's done is done.

580
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:31,170
Even I have my limits. I can't.

581
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:37,780
We can't leave this
to some government agency

582
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:39,694
to figure out.

583
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:41,780
Why not? It's their job.

584
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:43,085
They're bureaucrats.

585
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:46,086
If they fell out of a window, it would
take them a week to hit the ground.

586
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:48,478
Do you have any idea
how long it would take them

587
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:50,696
to clear this up?

588
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:53,740
They'll have TAMI shut down for months.
I'll go bankrupt.

589
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,045
What happened today
has to be connected to our last jump.

590
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:58,959
- We must have changed something.
- You just made that up.

591
00:38:59,177 --> 00:39:01,003
Something happened back there.
I know it.

592
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:04,004
Really? You know it?
You don't know anything of the kind!

593
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:07,179
I'll tell you what,
there is someone who does know.

594
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:50,059
You okay, man?

595
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:25,938
We represent the tenant board.

596
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:28,547
We have vines growing
into our windows, down the halls,

597
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:30,592
one broke the elevator!

598
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:33,027
Open this door at once!

599
00:40:33,244 --> 00:40:33,984
Dr. Rand!

600
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:36,593
This is loaded! Now back off!

601
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:37,898
She's crazy!

602
00:40:38,115 --> 00:40:39,464
You're crazy!

603
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:49,075
Dr. Rand, I need...

604
00:40:56,729 --> 00:40:59,078
Excuse me.
Where are you delivering that?

605
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,470
Rand. 7-E.

606
00:41:04,688 --> 00:41:06,906
I told you, I'm not responsible.

607
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,776
Look outside,
it's happening out there, too.

608
00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:11,472
Use your brain
while you still have one.

609
00:41:12,124 --> 00:41:13,429
Fertilizer.

610
00:41:17,473 --> 00:41:19,213
Lady, it's real heavy.

611
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:24,084
Close the door.

612
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,870
Put it by the rhododendron.

613
00:41:39,088 --> 00:41:41,176
The white flowers.

614
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:44,350
Then go.

615
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,700
I thought I recognized your voice.

616
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:53,701
You sound just like TAMI.
Although, she's a little nicer.

617
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:56,876
That thing doesn't work.
It's an antique.

618
00:41:58,398 --> 00:41:59,877
I've been expecting you.

619
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:01,920
I'm afraid we've done it.
What you warned us about.

620
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:03,746
- I knew it.
- What do you mean?

621
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:06,964
- Don't I seem a little on edge?
- About the same as last time.

622
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:09,183
How far back?

623
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,444
The Cretaceous.

624
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,357
Jesus. And what did you change?

625
00:42:12,575 --> 00:42:15,358
We don't know. As far as we can tell,
no one stepped off the path.

626
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:16,967
The animal fell in the kill zone.

627
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,751
The kill zone, the path.
The kill zone, the path.

628
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:22,447
You're so blind.

629
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,535
24 hours, isn't it?
Since you got back.

630
00:42:25,926 --> 00:42:26,970
Yeah, almost exactly.

631
00:42:27,188 --> 00:42:28,231
- Why?
- Watch this.

632
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,019
Son-of-a-bitch.

633
00:43:00,065 --> 00:43:02,196
- That was you.
- What the hell was that?

634
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:05,719
A time wave. So much
for your system being bulletproof.

635
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,592
Jesus.

636
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,420
Let's go. Get moving!

637
00:43:46,077 --> 00:43:49,513
- What is that pipe for?
- Water for the oxygen condensers.

638
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,124
Over there, get over there!

639
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:04,387
The oxygen!

640
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,170
Come on!

641
00:44:23,392 --> 00:44:24,827
You okay?

642
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:33,829
Look at this!

643
00:44:36,351 --> 00:44:40,048
This tree was never here before.
It's extraordinary.

644
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,484
It's okay.

645
00:44:58,705 --> 00:45:01,619
I think the window's our best bet.

646
00:45:07,534 --> 00:45:11,144
Jesus. Why didn't this happen
until now? Why the delay?

647
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:14,449
When you change something in the past,
the future isn't affected all at once.

648
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:18,146
Changes come in ripples,
like dropping a stone into a pond.

649
00:45:18,363 --> 00:45:20,320
So you mean there'll be more of these.

650
00:45:20,537 --> 00:45:22,929
And they'll get bigger and bigger.

651
00:45:23,146 --> 00:45:27,278
All the changes in evolution
that you affected will come in the waves.

652
00:45:27,452 --> 00:45:30,192
It'll start with climate,
then vegetation,

653
00:45:30,366 --> 00:45:32,062
the early manifestations of life.

654
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:34,845
Then come the more complex organisms.

655
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:39,542
- So what will happen in the last wave?
- It'll be us.

656
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,760
We wave goodbye.

657
00:45:40,977 --> 00:45:43,935
Last wave changes
the last species to evolve,

658
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:46,979
Homo sapiens.
God knows what we'll become.

659
00:45:47,196 --> 00:45:49,371
We may have no eyes,
we may be sea creatures.

660
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:53,372
We may not exist at all. We don't have
too many more waves before that one.

661
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:55,851
Can we fix what we did?

662
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:58,765
I don't know. Maybe.

663
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:10,593
There's no way
I can allow another jump.

664
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,594
I'll lose my badge.

665
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,725
If we don't fix this, you won't have
a chest to pin that badge on, moron.

666
00:46:16,943 --> 00:46:19,900
Careful, you don't want
to start calling people names.

667
00:46:20,118 --> 00:46:23,510
- She says it's the easiest way.
- No, I said it was the only way.

668
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:24,771
I also said I would help.

669
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:27,033
I didn't say I would be
in the same room with you.

670
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,903
Hold on. I go back

671
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,599
to just before
the original hunting party arrives,

672
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:35,122
meet them when they step
out of the portal and turn them back.

673
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,557
Whatever went wrong never happens.

674
00:46:37,775 --> 00:46:39,340
Things go back to normal.

675
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:42,472
- How can we be sure it'll work?
- We can't be sure if it'll work,

676
00:46:42,689 --> 00:46:45,560
but we can be sure
doing nothing will not work.

677
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,692
No. I'm sorry.

678
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:58,563
The whole of time
has been turned upside down

679
00:46:58,781 --> 00:47:01,128
and you're running around
with your toothbrush,

680
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:02,781
worrying about your pension.

681
00:47:02,998 --> 00:47:05,999
We have more than just
a software problem on our hands.

682
00:47:06,173 --> 00:47:08,000
We have got to fix this

683
00:47:08,174 --> 00:47:11,479
...and we have to make sure
no one ever finds out about it.

684
00:47:13,219 --> 00:47:15,393
If I go down,
I'm not going down alone.

685
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,787
Can you compensate
for TAMI's margin of error

686
00:47:25,005 --> 00:47:26,788
so he gets where he has to go?

687
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:28,832
Well, I built her.

688
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:36,703
How's that?

689
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:42,575
I want every moment
of this jump recorded, understand?

690
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:48,852
Another time wave is coming! Hang on!

691
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:10,293
Is everyone all right?

692
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,773
Lucas, make sure everyone's okay.

693
00:49:15,642 --> 00:49:16,643
Give me your hand.

694
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:21,296
Let's see
if the backup generator works.

695
00:50:08,743 --> 00:50:11,048
The power is out all over the city.

696
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:13,919
Power's probably out
all over the world.

697
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,311
Why couldn't I get back?

698
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:18,920
You weren't able
to jump through the time wave.

699
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:23,746
Remember, I explained
it's like a ripple in a pond.

700
00:50:24,181 --> 00:50:26,051
We can't break through the rings.

701
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:29,966
We seem to be stuck ahead
of the changes that are occurring.

702
00:50:30,183 --> 00:50:32,314
What do we do?
Jesus Christ, what do we do?

703
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:34,054
Let me work on it.

704
00:50:34,271 --> 00:50:35,793
This is not a time for panic.

705
00:50:36,011 --> 00:50:38,403
Actually, as times for panic go,
this is right up there.

706
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,230
What we need to do is take a look at
the jump and find out what was changed.

707
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,064
That was nothing.
I was standing right there.

708
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:12,150
<i>That's a safety feature.</i>

709
00:51:12,368 --> 00:51:15,325
<i>They're all tied to Travis's gun,
won't fire until he fires first.</i>

710
00:51:15,543 --> 00:51:16,456
<i>Why the hell not?</i>

711
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,326
<i>To keep clients from shooting
things they shouldn't.</i>

712
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:23,197
<i>Derris, how about
we don't mention this in our report?</i>

713
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,806
<i>No harm, no foul.</i>

714
00:51:25,024 --> 00:51:26,415
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

715
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:27,807
Go forward.

716
00:51:30,373 --> 00:51:31,417
Let's see that.

717
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:34,070
<i>Over here!
Try and get me!</i>

718
00:51:35,374 --> 00:51:36,940
<i>Get out of here!</i>

719
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,593
<i>Get behind the bushes!</i>

720
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,593
<i>We're not going alone!</i>

721
00:51:44,246 --> 00:51:46,203
<i>Get behind the bushes!
Over here!</i>

722
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:47,987
Can we follow them down the path?

723
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:50,596
Once they're out of range of my recorder,
there's no way to see them.

724
00:51:50,813 --> 00:51:52,640
Speed up again to after the kill.

725
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:01,076
<i>Travis, the volcano!</i>

726
00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:02,381
<i>We better get going.</i>

727
00:52:02,598 --> 00:52:03,729
<i>Follow me.</i>

728
00:52:06,686 --> 00:52:08,339
Anybody see anything?

729
00:52:08,557 --> 00:52:11,427
Anything small
that may have fallen off one of us?

730
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,474
Nothing.

731
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:37,608
Boys and girls,
I think I found something.

732
00:52:37,826 --> 00:52:39,957
You're not gonna believe this,

733
00:52:40,174 --> 00:52:42,218
but, according to the physical log,

734
00:52:42,436 --> 00:52:45,437
when we came back we weighed
1.3 grams more than when we left.

735
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:47,655
What does that mean?

736
00:52:48,176 --> 00:52:50,351
It means we brought something back.

737
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,481
No, it's impossible.
There's the bio-filter.

738
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:56,917
No organic matter
can pass through the...

739
00:52:57,656 --> 00:53:00,570
We never needed it.
We've always been so careful.

740
00:53:02,745 --> 00:53:03,788
You turned it off?

741
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:06,485
You turned the bio-filter off?

742
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:10,921
It takes a lot of energy. It costs
a fortune and we never needed it.

743
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:13,095
My God. Are you insane?

744
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,879
Did you know about this?

745
00:53:16,096 --> 00:53:17,879
Of course not.

746
00:53:23,794 --> 00:53:25,664
Why does this not surprise me?

747
00:53:27,491 --> 00:53:30,448
We need to find out
what you brought back.

748
00:53:35,232 --> 00:53:36,754
Did you get through?

749
00:53:36,972 --> 00:53:41,015
Line's busy. It'll be Forrest on
with one of his pals.

750
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:45,930
Donna will be freaking out,
all her yard work down the drain.

751
00:53:46,408 --> 00:53:47,408
Do you buy it for a minute?

752
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:48,757
The great asshole-in-the-sky

753
00:53:48,974 --> 00:53:52,018
doesn't check the bio-filter once?

754
00:53:52,236 --> 00:53:54,280
Nothing gets by that freak.

755
00:53:54,454 --> 00:53:56,454
"Two years and I'll be out."
That's what he told me.

756
00:53:56,672 --> 00:54:00,369
Got a little touchy when I asked him
how he'll retire on a government salary.

757
00:54:00,586 --> 00:54:02,326
You think Hatton paid him off?

758
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:06,588
It would be worth it... all the money
he saved on running that filter.

759
00:54:08,153 --> 00:54:10,980
Clean. That's the last one.

760
00:54:11,937 --> 00:54:14,373
It's gotta be on the clothes
on one of the clients.

761
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:18,156
Somebody must have panicked
and stepped off the path.

762
00:54:18,374 --> 00:54:19,330
The sweaty guy.

763
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:20,374
Eckles.

764
00:54:22,114 --> 00:54:23,071
Eckles.

765
00:54:23,288 --> 00:54:27,246
I have an idea to get you back.
It's never been tried, but it might work.

766
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:31,072
We can't break through the rings,
but I should be able to open a wormhole

767
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:33,246
on the other side of the ripples.

768
00:54:33,464 --> 00:54:36,813
Instead of 65 million years,
you go back 65 million and one.

769
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:40,640
- It would be like jumping over the rings.
- And then what? Travis waits for them?

770
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:42,249
Back here,
the change hasn't happened yet,

771
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:45,032
so there are no time waves.

772
00:54:45,293 --> 00:54:47,598
I should be able to slingshot you
forward to the target zone.

773
00:54:47,816 --> 00:54:51,165
- You "should"? You're not sure?
- I'm fairly certain.

774
00:54:51,425 --> 00:54:54,339
But don't intercept the party
to turn them back.

775
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:55,775
Why not?

776
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,862
The slingshot effect
will use up all your energy.

777
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,602
Your window will be small
and highly unstable.

778
00:55:00,819 --> 00:55:03,342
You won't have time to explain what
you're doing, let alone convince them.

779
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:04,473
How much time will I have?

780
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,908
I can't say for certain.
15, 20 seconds.

781
00:55:08,169 --> 00:55:09,561
Can you say anything for certain?

782
00:55:09,778 --> 00:55:12,170
Yes, I can say for certain
I can't say anything for certain.

783
00:55:12,388 --> 00:55:16,085
Let's find out what we're trying
to prevent, because you won't have time.

784
00:55:16,302 --> 00:55:17,650
We better talk to Mr. Eckles.

785
00:55:18,433 --> 00:55:20,390
It'll have to be in person.

786
00:55:21,128 --> 00:55:22,259
Nothing.

787
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:23,955
Dead.

788
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,306
Where are the guards?

789
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:36,263
What's that?

790
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:39,525
My God.

791
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:47,310
You're all loaded. Designators are off.
You can shoot at will.

792
00:55:50,659 --> 00:55:52,746
- Who told you to distribute weapons?
- I did.

793
00:55:52,964 --> 00:55:54,007
Just one thing. Plants like this

794
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,269
- haven't grown in millions of years.
- We're shooting at plants?

795
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,879
It isn't exactly like it was then.
It's stronger, more developed.

796
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:03,793
The alternate reality
taking over outside that door

797
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:05,576
has been evolving uninterrupted
for 60 million years.

798
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,577
Are you suggesting
that there are dinosaurs out there?

799
00:56:09,794 --> 00:56:11,837
I doubt it. More likely,
whatever they've evolved into.

800
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:13,708
That's one hell of a "just one thing".

801
00:56:13,881 --> 00:56:17,796
This building is still under government
control. I can't leave TAMI unattended.

802
00:56:18,013 --> 00:56:18,970
Of course not.

803
00:56:20,188 --> 00:56:22,493
We all set? Let's go.

804
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,020
Eckles lives
on the other side of the park.

805
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:46,586
Wouldn't it be quicker going around?
Sticking to the streets?

806
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,587
- What streets?
- Good point.

807
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:33,033
Guys?

808
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:40,861
That thing was huge.

809
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:48,385
Let's keep moving.

810
00:58:15,131 --> 00:58:16,262
Trav, you better take a look.

811
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:17,958
They're all over.

812
00:58:18,175 --> 00:58:20,915
Big mothers, judging by the depth.
Couple hundred pounds.

813
00:58:21,133 --> 00:58:22,568
These aren't classic reptilian.

814
00:58:22,785 --> 00:58:26,699
There are other markings. A little bit
of primate mixed in. I don't know.

815
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:28,135
That's not good.

816
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:32,266
It means we're not more than a couple
of waves away from being changed ourselves.

817
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,832
I suggest we get the hell out of here.

818
00:58:34,963 --> 00:58:36,354
Let's go.

819
00:58:46,878 --> 00:58:49,705
What do you think? Do we go around?

820
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:52,184
What was that?

821
00:58:54,228 --> 00:58:55,359
I have got to get home.

822
00:59:01,012 --> 00:59:01,665
Lucas!

823
00:59:02,317 --> 00:59:02,926
Get them out!

824
00:59:03,143 --> 00:59:04,318
Get these thorns out of him.

825
00:59:07,362 --> 00:59:08,145
Calm down!

826
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:10,189
- Travis?
- Hold your fire!

827
00:59:10,406 --> 00:59:12,885
Whatever's out there has been tracking
us since we entered the park!

828
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:16,278
Man, it hurts.

829
00:59:16,495 --> 00:59:19,104
Come on, Marcus.
Try slowing your pulse rate down.

830
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:23,019
It'll slow the progress of what those
brambles put into your bloodstream.

831
00:59:23,236 --> 00:59:26,976
Whatever those thorns
put in my bloodstream,

832
00:59:27,194 --> 00:59:29,064
it's already working.

833
00:59:29,629 --> 00:59:31,368
I can't feel my legs.

834
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:33,542
Watch out for these!

835
00:59:33,847 --> 00:59:34,847
Man, I'm losing it.

836
00:59:53,374 --> 00:59:54,635
Everything's...

837
00:59:55,636 --> 00:59:57,114
getting really weird.

838
01:00:03,072 --> 01:00:04,377
Take care of him.

839
01:00:44,692 --> 01:00:46,257
Come on. You okay?

840
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:47,475
Get up, let's go!

841
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,958
Head for the bridge now! Go!

842
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:06,437
Aim for their throats!

843
01:01:06,655 --> 01:01:09,090
It's their only soft spot!
Aim for their throats!

844
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,787
Go!

845
01:01:19,788 --> 01:01:20,614
Go on, I'll hold them off.

846
01:01:25,267 --> 01:01:27,398
I'm not gonna leave you. Let's go.

847
01:01:28,007 --> 01:01:29,877
Travis, those thorns.

848
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,095
I can't make it.

849
01:01:33,052 --> 01:01:36,140
I can't and you know it.
And I know it.

850
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:39,750
Just set things right,
and I'll be fine.

851
01:01:40,272 --> 01:01:41,228
See?

852
01:01:43,707 --> 01:01:44,534
Just set things right.

853
01:01:44,751 --> 01:01:45,751
I'll fix it.

854
01:01:47,926 --> 01:01:48,883
Go!

855
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,622
- What about Payne?
- I said go!

856
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,018
Why is he staying there?

857
01:02:10,062 --> 01:02:11,323
- Payne!
- Marcus!

858
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,889
- Payne, come on!
- Now go!

859
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,153
Forrest?

860
01:02:28,632 --> 01:02:31,850
Look, Forrest, that's Orion.

861
01:02:32,459 --> 01:02:34,460
Those stars there make his belt.

862
01:02:35,112 --> 01:02:37,156
I'll get you
a telescope when you're nine.

863
01:02:37,635 --> 01:02:39,896
That's when Grandpa got me mine.

864
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:43,897
Forrest. Know what those are?

865
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:48,203
That's right,

866
01:02:49,595 --> 01:02:51,594
the Seven Sisters.

867
01:02:51,812 --> 01:02:53,856
Look like stars, don't they?

868
01:02:56,682 --> 01:03:00,292
But each one is a whole entire galaxy.

869
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,777
I know how you feel.
I feel it, too.

870
01:03:24,603 --> 01:03:28,431
But if we fix this,
then he'll be right back with us.

871
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,084
So let's keep moving. Eckles's place
is still two blocks to the north.

872
01:03:32,301 --> 01:03:34,650
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What are you talking about?

873
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:37,085
It can't ever happen again.

874
01:03:37,303 --> 01:03:41,042
If we're lucky enough to fix things,
it'll go back to the way it was before.

875
01:03:41,259 --> 01:03:44,043
We have to stop it, the Hattons,
Time Safari, the whole thing.

876
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,956
If we fix the time line, though,

877
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:48,740
when we come back, we won't know
any of this has happened.

878
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:50,784
So now you see the problem.

879
01:04:05,657 --> 01:04:08,223
At least it means there's still
some people alive in there.

880
01:04:08,441 --> 01:04:11,311
- I think we can get down here.
- Those creatures back there are smart.

881
01:04:11,529 --> 01:04:13,442
A lot smarter than us
if we don't get over this wall.

882
01:04:13,747 --> 01:04:15,008
Wait.

883
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,142
There's got to be
something around here.

884
01:04:32,881 --> 01:04:33,621
You see anything over there?

885
01:04:39,014 --> 01:04:39,796
What's this?

886
01:04:40,971 --> 01:04:42,145
I got something.

887
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:43,928
What the...

888
01:04:54,714 --> 01:04:55,366
Daddy!

889
01:05:05,717 --> 01:05:07,717
It's okay, stay where you are.

890
01:05:27,939 --> 01:05:29,766
All right. It's okay.

891
01:05:40,552 --> 01:05:41,378
We don't have room.

892
01:05:41,595 --> 01:05:43,205
- He saved their lives!
- Go somewhere else.

893
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:45,553
Either let us in or kill us.

894
01:05:55,643 --> 01:05:58,383
We just need to find
someone and then we'll go.

895
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,297
Ted Eckles.

896
01:06:03,036 --> 01:06:06,124
He lives in this building.
Does anyone know where we can find him?

897
01:06:09,734 --> 01:06:11,038
Apartment 6-A.

898
01:06:12,516 --> 01:06:14,865
When we're done, we'll get you food.

899
01:06:36,262 --> 01:06:39,524
- No! That's Ally's.
- The fire's going out.

900
01:06:39,741 --> 01:06:40,698
Not that!

901
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:42,829
- Mr. Eckles.
- Who the hell are you?

902
01:06:43,047 --> 01:06:44,264
Remember me?

903
01:06:44,482 --> 01:06:48,135
Somebody brought something back
from your jump. Something small.

904
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:50,440
Check in there.

905
01:06:55,006 --> 01:06:57,181
Jenny! Look at this.

906
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:00,356
We have reason to believe
somebody stepped off the path.

907
01:07:00,529 --> 01:07:01,398
Are you accusing me?

908
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,791
We're not accusing you of anything.

909
01:07:06,008 --> 01:07:08,792
Maybe in the excitement something
happened. Maybe you don't remember.

910
01:07:13,054 --> 01:07:16,142
We think something happened
on your hunt that caused all this.

911
01:07:16,359 --> 01:07:19,012
If we can find out what it was,
we might be able to set it straight.

912
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:20,882
I didn't step off the path.

913
01:07:24,927 --> 01:07:27,884
You think because I was scared I didn't
listen and I stepped off the path.

914
01:07:28,102 --> 01:07:30,146
- Well, I didn't!
- He's telling the truth.

915
01:07:30,363 --> 01:07:31,885
I've been over every inch of
his clothes, there's nothing on them.

916
01:07:32,059 --> 01:07:33,364
What about your friend?

917
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:36,930
I don't know if...
We weren't together the whole time.

918
01:07:37,148 --> 01:07:39,148
- You were separated?
- Just for a few seconds.

919
01:07:39,366 --> 01:07:41,410
We have to find him.
A time wave could come any moment.

920
01:07:41,627 --> 01:07:42,627
Where does he live?

921
01:07:42,845 --> 01:07:45,454
He's not at his apartment.
His wife kicked him out.

922
01:07:45,672 --> 01:07:47,846
He stays at his office
at the Division Tower, 23rd floor.

923
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:48,760
We'll never make it on foot.

924
01:07:48,977 --> 01:07:50,846
There's a parking garage down below.

925
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:54,195
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Eckles. Let's go.

926
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:58,196
- You have to.
- I have to what?

927
01:07:58,414 --> 01:07:59,544
Set things right.

928
01:07:59,762 --> 01:08:01,110
We will.

929
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:11,896
Sonic resonator lock mechanism.
Almost impossible to break.

930
01:08:12,113 --> 01:08:13,200
Any suggestions?

931
01:08:13,418 --> 01:08:16,332
If we had an audio oscillator
I could find the waves and...

932
01:08:24,856 --> 01:08:27,074
How do you think I put myself
through medical school?

933
01:08:39,251 --> 01:08:41,468
We promised those people
we'd get them food.

934
01:08:41,686 --> 01:08:44,078
In an hour we'll have the time line
fixed and they won't need it.

935
01:08:44,339 --> 01:08:45,904
- What if we don't get it fixed?
- Then they'll be the food.

936
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:46,817
Look out!

937
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:50,297
What the hell was that?

938
01:08:59,865 --> 01:09:01,082
Sonia, come with me.

939
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,431
You two stay to protect the car.

940
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:06,171
Thanks.

941
01:09:21,001 --> 01:09:22,175
Brambles.

942
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,567
Be careful.

943
01:09:45,442 --> 01:09:47,138
What the hell happened here?

944
01:09:47,355 --> 01:09:48,269
Look at this.

945
01:09:50,443 --> 01:09:51,835
Jesus!

946
01:09:53,748 --> 01:09:57,010
It's the brambles. These people
went crazy and killed each other.

947
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,232
Mr. Middleton?

948
01:10:23,973 --> 01:10:25,887
Get out of here!
There's no food in here!

949
01:10:26,104 --> 01:10:27,061
Mr. Middleton!

950
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:31,062
It's Travis Ryer from Time Safari.
We just want to talk to you.

951
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:35,455
Mr. Middleton, we're gonna come in.

952
01:10:45,066 --> 01:10:47,154
Mr. Middleton, we just want to talk.

953
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,415
Okay? We're gonna come in.

954
01:10:52,764 --> 01:10:54,460
What do you want? Who is she?

955
01:10:54,678 --> 01:10:56,635
Be careful, he's infected.

956
01:10:56,809 --> 01:10:59,244
No whispering!
You think I can't hear you?

957
01:10:59,461 --> 01:11:02,114
She's with the company. We just want
to look at your outfit from the jump.

958
01:11:02,332 --> 01:11:03,289
Why?

959
01:11:03,506 --> 01:11:05,724
Someone may have inadvertently
brought something back.

960
01:11:05,898 --> 01:11:08,855
Who told you that?
Eckles, that little weasel?

961
01:11:09,421 --> 01:11:11,464
He hates me! He's lying!

962
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:13,812
Not your fault.
You're not in trouble.

963
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:14,900
Damn right, I'm not!

964
01:11:15,508 --> 01:11:16,857
Where are you?

965
01:11:17,248 --> 01:11:19,901
How dare you come here and accuse me?

966
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,338
That piece of crap safari!
I haven't felt right since!

967
01:11:46,865 --> 01:11:49,170
Don't you run away
when I'm talking to you!

968
01:11:53,693 --> 01:11:55,998
Drop the gun!
I don't want to shoot you.

969
01:11:56,216 --> 01:11:57,433
Why not? I want to shoot you.

970
01:11:57,651 --> 01:11:59,521
Listen to me, we can fix this.

971
01:11:59,738 --> 01:12:00,825
No, you can't.

972
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,564
Nobody can.

973
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:14,046
Tell me I wasn't lying.
Tell me we can fix this.

974
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:18,612
Family albums, nice.

975
01:12:20,091 --> 01:12:21,352
Here we go!

976
01:12:28,137 --> 01:12:29,137
I don't believe it.

977
01:12:31,659 --> 01:12:33,051
A single butterfly.

978
01:12:33,268 --> 01:12:34,356
Isn't that amazing?

979
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:35,878
Yes, it is.

980
01:12:40,401 --> 01:12:41,401
What the hell are you shooting at?

981
01:12:41,619 --> 01:12:44,706
Those birds, if that's what they are.
Did you find it?

982
01:12:44,924 --> 01:12:47,229
Middleton stepped off the path.
He killed a butterfly.

983
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:59,753
- A butterfly caused all this?
- Is that so hard to believe?

984
01:12:59,927 --> 01:13:02,537
- It's a bug!
- It's an insect that laid eggs.

985
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:06,538
The point is, Jenny, it wasn't a bug
that was stepped on, it was evolution.

986
01:13:43,721 --> 01:13:44,634
Watch it!

987
01:14:00,074 --> 01:14:01,639
The wave's coming!

988
01:14:05,336 --> 01:14:06,597
Hang on!

989
01:15:06,309 --> 01:15:08,222
This can't be good.

990
01:15:12,006 --> 01:15:12,919
Travis?

991
01:15:16,355 --> 01:15:17,529
It's Hatton.

992
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:21,442
I got a feeling there's only one wave
left, then it's our turn to be altered.

993
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,834
This isn't gonna be easy to do
with flippers instead of arms, is it?

994
01:15:24,617 --> 01:15:27,574
If this place is wrecked,
then we won't be able to send you back.

995
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:31,315
Then we have to find a way to make
another place work. Is it possible?

996
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,098
Let me think.

997
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:35,011
Maybe.

998
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:37,969
Let's take a look around
and see what we can salvage here.

999
01:15:38,186 --> 01:15:42,231
Okay, with TAMI's hard drive,
all we need is another portal.

1000
01:15:42,448 --> 01:15:44,927
- Let's go to Home Depot.
- There's one at the University.

1001
01:15:45,145 --> 01:15:47,624
- A Home Depot?
- No, a portal.

1002
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:50,581
Well, not exactly a portal,
a particle accelerator.

1003
01:15:51,016 --> 01:15:54,539
With the right software it becomes
a portal. TAMI's hard drive is.

1004
01:15:54,756 --> 01:15:56,887
- Are we talking "plug and play"?
- Yeah, more or less.

1005
01:15:57,104 --> 01:15:59,844
- Which one is it? More or less?
- More, I hope.

1006
01:16:00,062 --> 01:16:02,715
Get the jumpsuit,
I'll try and make this work.

1007
01:16:03,585 --> 01:16:06,803
The University is two miles away.
Will we travel through the city on foot?

1008
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,586
Derris! What are you doing in here?

1009
01:16:10,369 --> 01:16:11,803
Please be quiet.

1010
01:16:12,021 --> 01:16:12,847
What are you talking about?

1011
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:17,240
- You'll wake them up.
- Wake who?

1012
01:16:32,331 --> 01:16:33,201
My God.

1013
01:16:48,509 --> 01:16:50,771
We still have a chance,
but we have to go now.

1014
01:16:50,988 --> 01:16:52,815
Come on. We're getting out of here.

1015
01:16:53,293 --> 01:16:56,425
There's still time,
but we've got to hurry.

1016
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,038
Suit yourself.

1017
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:23,127
Wait.

1018
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:28,346
You can't leave me here.

1019
01:17:29,781 --> 01:17:31,172
Wait for me.

1020
01:17:51,655 --> 01:17:54,526
We can go underground
using the subway tracks.

1021
01:17:58,962 --> 01:18:00,354
What's that smell?

1022
01:18:00,571 --> 01:18:02,615
- Rotten eggs?
- Sulfur.

1023
01:18:05,268 --> 01:18:07,442
- It's a swamp.
- Let's go back up.

1024
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:08,791
No, this is the only way.

1025
01:18:09,008 --> 01:18:12,052
You're crazy, I'm not going in there.
I say we go back up and run for it.

1026
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,923
God knows what's under there.

1027
01:18:17,532 --> 01:18:18,576
Come on.

1028
01:18:46,061 --> 01:18:49,192
- We almost there?
- We passed two stations already.

1029
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:51,976
It can't be more
than a couple a hundred yards up ahead.

1030
01:18:57,369 --> 01:18:58,325
Wait a second.

1031
01:19:02,457 --> 01:19:04,023
Turn off your lights.

1032
01:19:06,676 --> 01:19:08,328
Don't make a sound.

1033
01:19:23,332 --> 01:19:24,898
It's okay, come on up!

1034
01:19:45,642 --> 01:19:47,425
At least it's dry in here.

1035
01:19:50,382 --> 01:19:52,514
Let's see if it's collapsed up ahead.

1036
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:00,820
If it's clear,
maybe we can get through.

1037
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,344
Let's keep moving.

1038
01:20:25,043 --> 01:20:27,696
The door's blocked, we gotta go back.

1039
01:20:52,529 --> 01:20:53,399
Jesus.

1040
01:20:53,617 --> 01:20:56,313
This thing
isn't gonna stay watertight forever.

1041
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:16,144
There's gotta be
access vents in the tunnel,

1042
01:21:16,361 --> 01:21:17,840
some way to get to the street.

1043
01:21:18,014 --> 01:21:19,884
- How do we find out?
- We gotta bust a window and swim up.

1044
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:21,711
What if there's no vent there?

1045
01:21:21,928 --> 01:21:23,885
Then we drown.
But, either way, we can't stay here.

1046
01:21:24,276 --> 01:21:26,060
I'll shoot out a window.

1047
01:21:26,277 --> 01:21:28,365
It should take about 30 seconds
for this thing to fill up.

1048
01:21:28,582 --> 01:21:29,974
Stay close to me,

1049
01:21:30,148 --> 01:21:33,105
take the deepest breath of your life,
then we'll go for it.

1050
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:34,975
Okay. Just...

1051
01:21:37,237 --> 01:21:38,237
Give me a second, okay?

1052
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:50,327
Come on!

1053
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:52,502
Hold on to me!

1054
01:21:53,546 --> 01:21:55,503
I got you! Let's go!

1055
01:21:55,894 --> 01:21:56,851
Hold on to me!

1056
01:22:01,938 --> 01:22:03,721
Take a breath and go under!

1057
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:05,417
Here we go!

1058
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:07,549
Let's go!

1059
01:23:44,835 --> 01:23:48,010
Travis?
Travis, stay with me!

1060
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:03,797
Come on.

1061
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:06,797
There's an access way down here.

1062
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:41,154
- Those animals are pretty evolved.
- The next wave is us.

1063
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:22,904
Start praying
that the backup generators work.

1064
01:25:31,254 --> 01:25:32,515
Oh, yes.

1065
01:25:39,561 --> 01:25:40,909
Not good.

1066
01:25:48,433 --> 01:25:50,564
Almost there, get ready.

1067
01:26:01,175 --> 01:26:04,046
Remember, even if this works
it'll be highly unstable.

1068
01:26:04,263 --> 01:26:05,698
You'll have about 20 seconds.

1069
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,525
<i>Hello, Dr. Rand.
Where exactly are we?</i>

1070
01:26:11,743 --> 01:26:12,786
We're at the University.

1071
01:26:13,004 --> 01:26:15,700
<i>In the public sector now?
Not a good sign.</i>

1072
01:26:15,918 --> 01:26:18,440
We're going to attempt
a slingshot jump. What do you think?

1073
01:26:18,658 --> 01:26:20,702
<i>It's theoretical.
It's never been attempted.</i>

1074
01:26:20,919 --> 01:26:22,311
There's a first time for everything.

1075
01:26:36,054 --> 01:26:37,141
It's gonna hurt.

1076
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:40,838
You'll be back a year before the hunt
for about half a nanosecond,

1077
01:26:41,055 --> 01:26:43,099
then you'll be thrown
forward again to the hunt.

1078
01:26:43,317 --> 01:26:45,143
- Now would be a good time.
- I'm working on it!

1079
01:26:48,884 --> 01:26:50,493
I've gotta find a way to get proof.

1080
01:26:51,493 --> 01:26:53,450
If this works,
everything goes back to normal.

1081
01:26:53,668 --> 01:26:55,581
You don't remember anything
and I don't remember anything.

1082
01:26:59,582 --> 01:27:01,712
I gotta get proof
that something went wrong,

1083
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,713
otherwise
we wouldn't have made a difference.

1084
01:27:05,148 --> 01:27:07,670
We've gotta make sure
that this never happens again!

1085
01:27:10,454 --> 01:27:12,020
I'll find a way.

1086
01:27:21,979 --> 01:27:23,371
The wave, it's here!
It's coming!

1087
01:27:26,067 --> 01:27:27,459
Hit a button! Any button!

1088
01:27:35,156 --> 01:27:36,287
I'll find a way!

1089
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:39,739
Over here, big guy!

1090
01:28:43,522 --> 01:28:45,392
Come on, over this way!

1091
01:28:45,609 --> 01:28:46,261
Jenny!

1092
01:28:50,263 --> 01:28:52,437
- Jenny!
- Payne, where the hell is that gun?

1093
01:28:52,655 --> 01:28:54,307
You have to get me on the holo-disc!

1094
01:28:54,525 --> 01:28:56,873
Hatton and Derris turned
the bio-filter off

1095
01:28:57,091 --> 01:28:59,265
and something went very wrong!

1096
01:28:59,483 --> 01:29:00,526
When you get back,

1097
01:29:00,744 --> 01:29:04,093
make sure you check the filter
and give the disc to me!

1098
01:29:06,789 --> 01:29:07,963
Only me!

1099
01:29:41,276 --> 01:29:44,016
Don't you ever pull
a stunt like that again!

1100
01:29:44,233 --> 01:29:47,408
If anyone's gonna die saving someone's
rich, fat ass, it's gonna be me, got it?

1101
01:29:47,712 --> 01:29:48,669
Yeah.

1102
01:29:49,061 --> 01:29:50,235
Where are the clients?

1103
01:29:56,367 --> 01:29:57,933
Why are you looking at me like that?

1104
01:30:01,455 --> 01:30:03,500
- You sure he's dead?
- You want to check his pulse?

1105
01:30:03,978 --> 01:30:05,326
Anyone hurt?

1106
01:30:05,935 --> 01:30:07,892
- They're fine.
- What happened back there?

1107
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:09,110
Don't you know?

1108
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:11,328
He fell
right where he was supposed to.

1109
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:12,893
You got lucky.

1110
01:30:13,807 --> 01:30:17,286
Did anyone break any protocols?
Then we're fine.

1111
01:30:17,503 --> 01:30:18,808
Travis, the volcano...

1112
01:30:19,026 --> 01:30:20,374
We better get going.

1113
01:30:20,590 --> 01:30:21,721
Follow me.

1114
01:30:25,809 --> 01:30:27,853
Clay, by the way, I know.

1115
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:31,898
When we get back, the bio-filter...

1116
01:30:32,115 --> 01:30:33,985
turn it back on, okay?

1117
01:30:34,203 --> 01:30:35,160
Good boy.

1118
01:31:10,387 --> 01:31:12,430
Welcome! Gentlemen!

1119
01:31:13,256 --> 01:31:14,213
And well done!

1120
01:31:14,431 --> 01:31:17,953
We promised you
the experience of a lifetime

1121
01:31:18,171 --> 01:31:19,301
and we delivered.

1122
01:31:19,562 --> 01:31:23,172
As long as you know,
everything was according to plan.

1123
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:24,564
What the hell happened?

1124
01:31:24,738 --> 01:31:27,826
Equipment malfunction.
We're okay, but it was close.

1125
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:34,958
- Clay, what went...
- We have a problem.

1126
01:31:43,569 --> 01:31:44,961
I have to talk to you.

1127
01:31:45,135 --> 01:31:46,396
What's wrong?

1128
01:31:47,396 --> 01:31:49,614
You've gotta take a look at this.

1129
01:31:49,832 --> 01:31:53,007
I told Hatton
the recorder malfunctioned.

1130
01:31:53,224 --> 01:31:54,355
Don't let anyone see it.

1131
01:31:54,572 --> 01:31:55,877
Why? What's on here?

1132
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,574
I don't know how to say this
without sounding nuttier than usual.

1133
01:32:00,052 --> 01:32:01,008
You.

1134
01:32:01,225 --> 01:32:03,574
- Of course I'm on it...
- No!

1135
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:05,444
It was another you...

1136
01:32:06,357 --> 01:32:08,140
Actually, very much the same you.

1137
01:32:12,576 --> 01:32:15,012
Just take it and get outta here.

1138
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:16,708
You'll understand.

1139
01:32:55,413 --> 01:32:58,632
You come for another argument?
I'm kind of tired. Come back tomorrow.

1140
01:32:58,849 --> 01:33:00,980
I need to speak to you.

1141
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:02,241
Hatton send you?

1142
01:33:02,459 --> 01:33:06,156
If he knew what I had, he'd do
anything to stop me from seeing you.

1143
01:33:11,635 --> 01:33:14,810
Make yourself useful.
There's a bag of fertilizer,

1144
01:33:15,028 --> 01:33:17,811
- put it on the rhododendron.
- The white ones.

1145
01:33:18,855 --> 01:33:21,551
You know, I'm a gardener myself.
I've got a fern.

1146
01:33:21,769 --> 01:33:23,073
So, what do you want?

1147
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:25,422
I want to put myself out of a job.

1148
01:33:26,944 --> 01:33:30,554
- I have a disc for you.
- I don't have time to watch discs.

1149
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:34,033
Take a look at this one. Seen it
twice myself and it's got everything:

1150
01:33:34,251 --> 01:33:37,599
Action, disaster, government corruption.
It's the proof you need.

1151
01:33:37,817 --> 01:33:41,904
Everything you've been warning us about
has already happened and it's all here.

1152
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,166
Why don't you stop
being such a pain-in-the-ass

1153
01:33:47,384 --> 01:33:49,036
and take a look at this?

1154
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:51,950
Who gave that to you?

1155
01:33:52,559 --> 01:33:53,733
I did.

1156
01:34:03,214 --> 01:34:04,519
So, do you want

1157
01:34:05,389 --> 01:34:06,867
a cup of coffee?
