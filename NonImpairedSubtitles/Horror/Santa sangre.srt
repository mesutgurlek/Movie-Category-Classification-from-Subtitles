1
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:31,092
Fenix.

2
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:34,607
Please...

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,298
Eat like a human being.

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,989
Grr!

5
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:06,478
You can't just stay here all the time,

6
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:08,515
not seeing anyone.

7
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:22,039
Now come on, stand up.

8
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:28,158
Come on now. Your foot.

9
00:01:30,488 --> 00:01:32,656
That's it.

10
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:34,692
The other one.

11
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:57,066
Don't miss the Circo del Gringo,
the greatest show on earth!

12
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,416
The death-defying trapeze girl!

13
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:03,671
The boy magician!
Come and see them now! Come on!

14
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:06,426
See the tiger from the Indian jungle!

15
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:09,151
The elephant from darkest Africa!

16
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,920
The furry monkey! Roll up! Roll up!

17
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:15,118
Go and see the Circo del Gringo!

18
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,758
Aladin, the world's smallest
elephant trainer! Roll up! Roll up!

19
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,924
Roll up! Roll up! Come and see...

20
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,132
Papa! Wake up, wake up! They're here!

21
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:50,617
Get the hell out of here!
I told you not to bother me!

22
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:03,391
Why does he drink so much?

23
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:07,150
My mother says
he killed a woman in America.

24
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:09,186
And he can't go back?

25
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:15,508
Tough life. Come on,
let's go see the new act.

26
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,554
- The new act?
- Yes!

27
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:21,363
The Tattooed Woman!

28
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:31,646
Now come on.

29
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:36,732
Come on! Come on!

30
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,609
Come on! Don't be afraid!

31
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,131
Come on!

32
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:44,573
You can't do anything!

33
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:48,970
Read my lips, you stupid deaf-mute.

34
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:52,252
Come on, don't just stand there!

35
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:58,938
I should have left you in the poorhouse
when your mother died. Now practice!

36
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,985
Or I'll beat you.

37
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:03,021
What's goin' on here?

38
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,858
Oh, Mr Orgo.

39
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:17,599
Here I am.

40
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,200
Hmm.

41
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,201
Ahh!

42
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:27,436
- The ocean!
- Oh!

43
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,634
- Ooh!
- It's a peacock!

44
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:32,765
- Ooh!
- It's the moon.

45
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:35,439
- Here's a fish!
- Cloud.

46
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,367
- And a crab!
- The ocean!

47
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,282
Ooh!

48
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,841
Nice to meet you.

49
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,850
Come with me.

50
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:04,545
- Against the board.
- Anything you say, Mr Orgo.

51
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,712
Ohh! Ah!

52
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:13,985
Blasphemy! Idiots!

53
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,032
Sacrilege!

54
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:35,240
Mother! Mother!

55
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:38,563
Blasphemy! This is our church!

56
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:44,043
All right, get them off my land right now
or I'll run 'em over!

57
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:48,481
Go ahead - but you'll have to kill us all!
Go ahead!

58
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,851
- Then go ahead!
- Mother!

59
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:54,974
No!

60
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:06,341
No! Don't hurt her!

61
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,783
We are not afraid of you.

62
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:44,443
El fin del mundo se acerca ya

63
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:51,403
Toda esperanza se acabará

64
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,977
Ya las señales se están cumpliendo

65
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:03,934
Se están cumpliendo como escrito está

66
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:11,137
Querido amigo, Lirio te llama

67
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:17,499
No hagas duro tu corazón

68
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:24,267
Ríndete a Lirio, dale tu alma

69
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,872
Y tendrás parte en la resurrección

70
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,884
Peace! I bring peace.

71
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:37,396
- Come now.
- Father.

72
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,198
Peace.

73
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,081
Please, Father, help us.
They want to destroy our temple.

74
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:49,239
I won't let them do such a thing.

75
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,534
Peace. Peace. Let me see your church.

76
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:58,012
This is it, Monsignor.

77
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:10,260
This is where we worship...
our beloved saint and martyr.

78
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:33,115
Here she is, Monsignor.

79
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:39,923
But...this is no saint.

80
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,836
Monsignor, she is a saint.

81
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,883
How could you?

82
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:54,886
Right here, many years ago,

83
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:01,329
Lirio, a young girl, was attacked
by the Terrano brothers.

84
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,179
She tried to fight them off
with all her strength

85
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,661
but they cut off her arms.

86
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,223
They raped her

87
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:30,111
and left her to die in a pool of blood.

88
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:36,392
And on this ground, miraculously
still wet with her holy blood,

89
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:38,550
we built our church.

90
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:52,449
- This is paint!
- No, it's holy blood.

91
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,043
- This is paint!
- It's holy blood!

92
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:57,717
Do you hear me, crazy woman? It's paint!

93
00:12:57,798 --> 00:13:00,533
- It's blood! It's blood!
- Feel it! Feel it!

94
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:04,089
This is paint! It is paint! This is paint!

95
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:08,456
Holy blood! It's holy blood!

96
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:10,492
It's holy blood!

97
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,545
- It's paint!
- Holy blood.

98
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:40,550
I order you to stop...
this foolish sacrilege...immediately.

99
00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:43,599
Never! This is our saint!

100
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,689
The church will never
recognise...this heresy!

101
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,524
Don't dare! Holy blood!

102
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:55,807
¡Cantemos todos!

103
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:01,419
Holy blood. Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!

104
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:08,126
Holy blood! Holy blood! Holy blood!

105
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,530
Holy blood!

106
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:14,660
Holy blood! Holy blood!

107
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:19,533
Come, Kevin, I don't want this
to soil your pure soul.

108
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:22,856
- Let's go.
- Yes, go! Get out of here!

109
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:27,263
Go ahead and destroy this abomination!

110
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,781
Holy blood.

111
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:34,557
Holy blood!

112
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:41,871
- Holy blood! Holy blood! Oh!
- Holy blood!

113
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:45,194
Go ahead!

114
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,155
Don't run away!

115
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:16,853
Mother! No!

116
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:21,938
- No, no! No, no!
- No.

117
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:29,617
Kill me! Go ahead!

118
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:32,869
Kill me! Kill me!

119
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,906
Kill me!

120
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:38,472
- Kill me! Go ahead!
- Mother! Mother!

121
00:15:38,553 --> 00:15:40,751
Go ahead...

122
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,688
Hey!

123
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:02,845
Ahh...

124
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,196
Mr Orgo...

125
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:02,839
Aah!

126
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,003
Orgo has a decent wife.
Stay away from him...

127
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:09,039
or I'll kill you!

128
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:12,007
She's crazy!

129
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:15,919
Get up. Get up!

130
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,087
You bastard!

131
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:29,575
Aaah.

132
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:33,415
Ahh. Ahh.

133
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:37,254
Aaah.

134
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,143
My little child.

135
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,179
No...

136
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:52,622
Don't. Don't. Don't laugh!

137
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:59,147
Don't do that!

138
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,597
Ahh. Ah!

139
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:09,591
Ah!

140
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:16,156
Ah!

141
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:25,801
Hah!

142
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:41,939
Stop! Nobody goes any further.
Leave them alone.

143
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,975
Get out of here. Vamoose. Vamoose.

144
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:46,022
Vamoose. Vamoose.

145
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:36,371
- What's happened?
- The elephant is dying.

146
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:42,713
Please, don't die.

147
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:46,644
Please.

148
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:41,471
Don't die.

149
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:57,197
Stop crying...like a little girl.

150
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,090
I'll give you a charm.

151
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:04,370
That'll make you a man.

152
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,524
There, now you're a man.

153
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:41,532
Just like me.

154
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:13,043
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fenix, the boy magician!

155
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:43,045
Concha, queen of the flying trapeze!

156
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:45,881
Hanging by her own hair!

157
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:51,326
Put me down! Put me down!

158
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:54,578
Quick, quick! Down! Down!

159
00:33:58,418 --> 00:34:00,383
Quick. Quick.

160
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:05,904
Go away!

161
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:09,075
Music! Music!
Concha!

162
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,670
Mummy! Mum!

163
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:35,071
Shh! Get in the trailer.

164
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:38,272
Keep quiet. Go! Go...

165
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:33,900
Come on, come on, come on.

166
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:36,027
Oh!

167
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,756
Ugh.

168
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,396
Come on.

169
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:08,917
No!

170
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:52,246
Come here, come on, come on. Come on.

171
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,292
This is Fenix.

172
00:40:01,738 --> 00:40:03,704
Yes.

173
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:14,159
Give me your hand.

174
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,195
Thanks, Fenix.

175
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:27,734
Come along now.

176
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:41,147
Come on, Fenix.
They're around here somewhere.

177
00:40:52,524 --> 00:40:56,242
Now, Fenix. Thank you.

178
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:58,288
Form a circle!

179
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,653
Good boy, Fenix.

180
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:08,388
Everybody wave. Hands up like this!

181
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:12,106
Go on!

182
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:24,162
Music.

183
00:41:24,243 --> 00:41:28,164
And now...we will have some fruit!

184
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:31,568
- Come on, let's have some fruit.
- We'll have some fruit!

185
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,614
One for you...

186
00:41:47,392 --> 00:41:49,317
New friends, Fenix.

187
00:41:50,603 --> 00:41:52,528
Rudolph,

188
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,884
Mauricio,

189
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,007
Daniel,

190
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,300
Marcos,

191
00:42:04,411 --> 00:42:06,336
and Darío.

192
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,781
They are going to the movies tonight.

193
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:15,687
And you are going with them.

194
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:19,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

195
00:42:31,055 --> 00:42:32,970
Come on, my dear.

196
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:36,252
Here we are, out you get.

197
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,517
Come on, Daniel. Come on, you two.

198
00:42:43,445 --> 00:42:46,677
- Come on, stay together.
- Come along.

199
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:51,226
Now we will see a great film
about Robinson Crusoe.

200
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:54,305
Is everybody here? Come on, Fenix.

201
00:42:54,386 --> 00:42:58,064
Ah, yes. Robinson Crusoe,
one of life's castaways.

202
00:42:58,135 --> 00:43:01,052
Yes. Good boy, Darío.

203
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:03,605
Goodbye. Goodbye!

204
00:43:03,727 --> 00:43:05,804
I have to go with my grandmother.

205
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:08,721
Goodbye! We're going to the synagogue.

206
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:12,267
Hello, little boy. Nice little boy.

207
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:15,701
Good morning.
I am Robinson Crusoe.

208
00:43:15,782 --> 00:43:18,224
Bye! Enjoy the movie!

209
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,253
And don't worry, we will wait for you.

210
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:23,289
Come along.

211
00:43:29,925 --> 00:43:34,149
Vengan, vengan.
Come, I have a present for you.

212
00:43:36,753 --> 00:43:40,704
Listen, this kind of stuff
will make you sick.

213
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:44,625
If you promise not to tell,
I'll take you somewhere else...

214
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,771
that's much more fun than the movies.

215
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:55,880
A little sniff of this...
And we'll see.

216
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:03,984
Sniff.

217
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,584
Ándele para adentro.

218
00:44:10,742 --> 00:44:13,295
¡De la buena!

219
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:16,526
Yes, yes.

220
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:20,791
¡Vamos amigos!

221
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,786
Hai!

222
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:32,801
Here.

223
00:45:32,922 --> 00:45:35,364
There you go, Lores.

224
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:39,831
How much for the five pendejitos?

225
00:45:39,953 --> 00:45:42,101
For all of them, $20.

226
00:45:42,182 --> 00:45:44,745
Five for you, 15 for me.

227
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:05,189
Ohh...

228
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:16,059
Vengan, vengan chaparritos
al hotel.

229
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,364
Mm. Me los voy a comer.

230
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:32,420
Mira, mira lo que me encontré.

231
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:36,179
- Like me?
- ¡Mírame!

232
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:39,694
Mírame, dame un trocito.

233
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,015
Hai!

234
00:47:05,254 --> 00:47:08,607
Ahh...

235
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:11,920
Hai!

236
00:47:23,854 --> 00:47:28,220
Fenix?

237
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,588
- Have fun last night?
- Mm-hm.

238
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:51,460
How do you feel?

239
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:16,463
Good! Very good.

240
00:48:16,574 --> 00:48:19,492
Now eat, hm?

241
00:48:19,603 --> 00:48:22,491
I'll be back later, all right?

242
00:48:22,561 --> 00:48:28,002
All right, out we go. Out we go. Today
we have home-made chicken soup.

243
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:32,307
Fenix!

244
00:49:03,216 --> 00:49:05,668
Siento en el alma

245
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:17,642
Unas ganas inmensas

246
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:19,679
De llorar

247
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:26,223
Tu me haces falta

248
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:30,610
Y juré no decírtelo jamás

249
00:49:37,873 --> 00:49:42,118
Yo quiero hacerte

250
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:47,498
Con mis lágrimas un collar de perlas

251
00:49:54,893 --> 00:49:58,368
Déjame llorar

252
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:03,362
Porque hoy ya te perdí

253
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:08,630
Queriéndote olvidar

254
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:11,609
Me acuerdo más

255
00:50:15,661 --> 00:50:18,234
De ti

256
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:53,793
Ahh!

257
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,939
Inside.

258
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:18,522
Come on.

259
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:21,349
Sit over there!

260
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,385
Ah!

261
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,981
If I can get a proper drink...

262
00:51:27,062 --> 00:51:29,099
Oh! Hup!

263
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,257
- Come here, now.
- Give me that, brother.

264
00:51:31,378 --> 00:51:33,931
Hey, come over, baby. Come on.

265
00:51:34,012 --> 00:51:35,967
Yeah.

266
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:40,121
- Ahh!
- I'll give you another tattoo, baby!

267
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:44,710
Where is his girl?

268
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:49,340
- Where's his money?
- First he's gotta see what he's payin' for.

269
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:51,376
Ah!
