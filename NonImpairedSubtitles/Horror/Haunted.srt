1
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,227
SUSSEX, ENGLAND, 1905.

2
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,325
Enough.

3
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:32,193
Enough said.

4
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,180
Well, that's enough.

5
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:04,029
Juliet.

6
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,730
Mother.

7
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:29,448
David...

8
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:34,486
David...

9
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:15,288
After the loss my twin sister.

10
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:19,213
My mother took me to his home in America.

11
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:22,758
Do not return to England until 1928.

12
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:27,859
As a professor of psychology
University of Camberley.

13
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,207
Psychic phenomena.

14
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,578
There?

15
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:41,815
Lord, his books deny its existence.

16
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,583
As I said before.

17
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:48,288
The aim of these classes is not
discuss the content of my books.

18
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:51,624
Which by the way,
have had great success.

19
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:55,039
I advise you make a copy.

20
00:05:56,763 --> 00:06:00,300
The only thing that my
book is called evidence.

21
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,272
I'm not here to change
any of your precious beliefs.

22
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:07,497
But I'm here to tell you.

23
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,877
When investigating psychic phenomena.

24
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:15,277
Should adopt a
objective and scientific position.

25
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,369
Now if you want my opinion.

26
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,644
There are no ghosts.

27
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:23,974
Or spirits.

28
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:25,659
Neither angels.

29
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,887
It is only the desire to exist.

30
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:32,622
To relieve pain and our fears.

31
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:58,190
Bless you for coming.

32
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:04,368
I can feel the excitement of
our loved ones on the other side.

33
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:07,298
Join me.

34
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,928
Clare...

35
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:40,695
There's someone here.

36
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:44,165
You want to talk to Clare.

37
00:07:46,072 --> 00:07:47,707
I'm Clare.

38
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:49,807
Jeremy?

39
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:52,944
Hello, Clare.

40
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:56,403
You stop worrying about me.

41
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,950
I am very happy here.

42
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,170
Come talk to me again.

43
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,710
I have many things to tell you.

44
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:09,828
What would you do for my Clare?

45
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,591
Jeremy...

46
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:24,869
Is anyone here named Brook?

47
00:08:26,846 --> 00:08:28,846
Ed?

48
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:31,308
Edward Brook?

49
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:34,452
Ed Brook?

50
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,217
Many people want to talk.

51
00:08:56,676 --> 00:08:58,044
Charlotte.

52
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:00,694
Ask if your child is here.

53
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,189
My mother was Charlotte.

54
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,819
Hello, dear.

55
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:14,855
Know that I am very proud of you.

56
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:19,687
I see you do well.

57
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,835
Mother you okay?

58
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,046
Aunt Lily is with you?

59
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,571
Yeah, she's here.

60
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,820
Your hip still hurts you?

61
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:33,375
No more pain.

62
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,615
Except for being away from you.

63
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,186
Ladies and gentlemen.

64
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:43,091
My mother's name was Charlotte.

65
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:45,058
She was from the United States.

66
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,726
Never broke her hip.

67
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,962
And I never had an aunt named Lily.

68
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:52,207
This woman is a despicable fraud.

69
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,015
Get him out.

70
00:09:57,115 --> 00:09:59,115
Get him out of here.

71
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,611
Hello.

72
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:08,362
Ladies and gentlemen.

73
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:10,462
This is my mother.

74
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,352
It's a fraud.

75
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:15,002
Madame, you are despicable.

76
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:18,861
This is terrible.,
as you can do that?

77
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
She should be ashamed.

78
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,429
Has no conscience.

79
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,567
This is different...

80
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:32,906
You can stop with his performance.

81
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:35,839
Please do not do it...

82
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:39,377
You are pathetic.

83
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,846
David...

84
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:45,084
David...

85
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:48,449
Please...

86
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:12,908
Where were you?
- Come on.

87
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:16,223
A race to the house.

88
00:11:27,393 --> 00:11:28,674
Correspondence.

89
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:30,133
Thanks, Kate.

90
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,098
All this for me?

91
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:34,467
His book touched heartstrings.

92
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:38,222
Everyone wants to go
investigate something.

93
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:41,428
My article on Madame Brontski.

94
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:44,628
I hope that out of business.

95
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:48,348
She wrote again.

96
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,083
Who?
- Ms. Webb.

97
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:52,278
Mrs. Webb?
Let me see.

98
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:00,558
A lady and great.

99
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,028
It is not believed to be imprisoned...

100
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:05,464
...Of evil spirits, or something?

101
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:07,564
Herself.

102
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,502
He says he promised to go see it.

103
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:12,237
Promised?

104
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:14,337
Certainly not.

105
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,842
I have no time for that now.

106
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:20,917
She seems desperate.

107
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:22,827
It is the region?

108
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:25,902
In Sussex, I think.
Edbrook Mansion.

109
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:30,587
Edbrook?

110
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:33,423
Edbrook Mansion.

111
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:37,868
I think I could take a look.

112
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,629
David Ash?

113
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,038
Mrs. Webb?

114
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:25,711
Christina Mariell.
I came at the request of the Nanny Tess.

115
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:28,780
A pleasure. Nana Tess?
- Ms. Webb.

116
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:31,750
Nana always called Tess.

117
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,995
Excuse my delay.
- Do not worry.

118
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,420
No problem...

119
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:42,319
You are not as expected.

120
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,527
We Come?

121
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,235
So you're in the colonies?

122
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,202
In Chicago?

123
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:51,917
It's pretty smart.

124
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:53,354
Not so.

125
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:56,475
I have read his biography in his book.

126
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:58,110
At least he's honest.

127
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,347
Not that it is not smart
means that you read.

128
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:04,483
It is the first American I know.

129
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,919
Actually, my father was an English
and lived here until eleven.

130
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:10,739
So it remains unknown.

131
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,260
The nanny did not come because
afraid to leave the house.

132
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,264
It is difficult to see someone
love and lose clarity.

133
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:22,768
I fear you you're wasting your time.

134
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:25,333
I hope I can help.

135
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:29,034
And I promise to keep you entertained.

136
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:32,575
You handle this?

137
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:39,082
Sorry.

138
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:41,491
Put your bags behind.

139
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,372
Where did you learn to drive?

140
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:03,532
I did not learn, it's my first time.

141
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:06,223
Just kidding.

142
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,958
I learned watching my brothers.

143
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,115
You are very funny.

144
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:36,372
Welcome to Edbrook.

145
00:15:37,142 --> 00:15:39,142
I found Nana Tess.

146
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:43,513
Hello.

147
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:52,750
Sometimes this is very odd.

148
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:57,481
It's that thing of ghosts.
Is obsessed with it.

149
00:15:57,696 --> 00:15:59,696
Have you seen any?

150
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:09,172
Mrs. Webb?

151
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:11,743
Nana Tess, do not be rude.

152
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:13,843
He is here for you.

153
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,782
Thank you very much, Professor.

154
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:20,177
I'll take him to his room.

155
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:21,765
Do not worry nana.

156
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:23,865
I do.

157
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,590
Then we talked.

158
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:31,207
That such a fantastic house.

159
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:34,132
Only two of you live here?

160
00:16:34,232 --> 00:16:37,235
No, my two brothers,
Robert and Simon out there.

161
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:40,055
And of course the ghost of Nana.

162
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,815
I know I should not,
But I can not resist.

163
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:53,465
We get along well as children.

164
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:58,123
I hope you feel comfortable here.

165
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:00,223
I'm sure.

166
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,767
When unpacking,
I can show you the house if you want.

167
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,803
No, do not bother,
I can do it myself.

168
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:14,306
Make yourself at home
You can go wherever you like.

169
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,786
Dinner is served at 7:30.

170
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:22,058
Think it's all in your imagination?

171
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,048
You think?

172
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:28,046
Sorry.

173
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:30,146
Hello.

174
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,849
Can enter.

175
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:34,951
Robert Mariell.

176
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,512
David Ash. A pleasure.
- Sure.

177
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:41,040
It's a novelty have a teacher in the house.

178
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,443
Really?

179
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:47,558
They've been good?
- Yes, if the room is very comfortable...

180
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:51,162
This house is magnificent.

181
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:54,599
It was my great-grandfather bought it.

182
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:58,246
The Marielle money according to my father.

183
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:00,808
We lose a little in it.

184
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:03,848
We try to use only rooms needed.

185
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:07,385
It is difficult to maintain such a place,
without domestic servants.

186
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:09,485
Oh, yes. It should be.

187
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:12,724
Things are not as
Mariell before in the Family.

188
00:19:12,824 --> 00:19:14,864
Nana told him.

189
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,026
Yes, Mrs. Webb...

190
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:22,933
He's very generous of you for coming.

191
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,436
And I owe you an apology.

192
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:27,237
An apology?

193
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:29,139
I gave his book.

194
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,239
A Nana, his book.

195
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:36,263
And that was the beginning of everything
and you have come.

196
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:38,148
Anyway, now that you're here.

197
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:40,584
Brindare you all the help we can.

198
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:42,286
Good.

199
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:46,976
You think someone might
be playing a joke on Mrs. Webb?

200
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:50,542
Some neighbors, perhaps?
- My God, no.

201
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,539
We're very isolated here.

202
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:57,935
And Nana has not been
contact with anyone in years.

203
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:00,035
She lives in seclusion.

204
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:08,308
Christina already knew, of course.
- Yes.

205
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:10,914
You paint the picture of the corridor?

206
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:12,850
Yes, I did. You like it?

207
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,485
Yes, I like.

208
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:17,645
It is very impressive.

209
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:21,142
The painting is a funny thing...

210
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:26,883
When done well, is captured
the soul of the painter and the model.

211
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:29,564
It makes them immortal.

212
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:49,112
It's so quiet here.

213
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:53,878
I even wonder because living in the city.

214
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:56,792
He met Robert?
- Yes, I did.

215
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:59,053
It is very nice.

216
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,032
He must think the same about you.

217
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:04,501
Never let anyone see it painted.

218
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:06,601
I am honored.

219
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:11,096
Tell me,
always uses the same model?

220
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:21,116
Suggests better?

221
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:05,151
It was a joke, a joke.

222
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:07,064
I did not scare you, friend.

223
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:10,054
I'm Simon, the clown of the group.

224
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:12,783
Oh, are you?

225
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:17,174
The last swim of the season
do not know what they're missing.

226
00:22:17,274 --> 00:22:19,076
How about a swim?

227
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:21,511
No thanks, too cold for me.

228
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:23,611
Whatever.

229
00:22:36,526 --> 00:22:38,585
Oh... I'll catch up...

230
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:04,821
He, give me that.

231
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:07,491
Christina.
Christina, give me that.

232
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:09,793
Thanks David,
Are you a gentleman.

233
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:12,165
Unlike my brother.

234
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,612
Give me that.

235
00:23:13,712 --> 00:23:16,393
Give me that.
Give it back.

236
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:20,163
Admiring our mermaid?

237
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:22,404
Stunning, no?

238
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:24,461
Yes, indeed.

239
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:26,771
We're all crazy, you know?

240
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:31,146
How about some tea?

241
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:33,713
I'd love a cup of tea.

242
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:18,215
Good morning.
- Good morning, David.

243
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:20,315
Sleep well?

244
00:26:20,617 --> 00:26:23,200
To be honest, I did not sleep well.

245
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,661
Oh, how I regret it.

246
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:28,416
What happened?
He heard noises in the night?

247
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,825
Because you say that?

248
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:33,330
God.,
it seems very tense this morning.

249
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,430
If I'm not.

250
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:40,331
It happens that I do not like
the childish pranks.

251
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,244
Mischief?

252
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:46,104
There were small noises at my door.

253
00:26:46,842 --> 00:26:48,377
Rats.

254
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:50,513
It is normal in an old house.

255
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:54,693
Then they began knocking louder.

256
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:58,499
That was me, hunting rats.
Mate three last night.

257
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,961
I hate rats.

258
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:02,061
There were rats.

259
00:27:02,157 --> 00:27:04,157
When I opened the door.

260
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:07,093
I could not do, because...

261
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:10,441
Someone was pulling the other side.

262
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,193
Someone as strong as me.

263
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:25,516
It must be the ghost of Nana.

264
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,133
Poor Nana.

265
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,233
Help you.

266
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:37,491
Care.

267
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,324
David.

268
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:42,757
Sit down and eat breakfast.

269
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,097
I promise, no...

270
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,470
All right.

271
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,570
It's a chase.

272
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:10,573
What more do you want from me?

273
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:13,953
It was not enough?
Leave me alone.

274
00:28:15,364 --> 00:28:17,364
I can go?

275
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Sure, Professor.

276
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:24,237
Are you okay?

277
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:28,444
Hoped we had a little chat.

278
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,544
I can sit?

279
00:28:31,547 --> 00:28:33,547
Please sit down.

280
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:37,820
He asked me to come
because he hopes to discover something.

281
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,150
You expect to discover?

282
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:46,695
He has always lived in
the Mansion Edbrook?

283
00:28:46,795 --> 00:28:48,530
Many years.

284
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,010
The children were born here.

285
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:54,536
His father was a diplomat,
I was always outside.

286
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:57,139
Ms. Mariell always accompanied him.

287
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,707
And the children?

288
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:02,378
I care for them until
age had to go to boarding school...

289
00:29:02,478 --> 00:29:04,478
...In England.

290
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,249
Looked forward to the holidays...

291
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,474
...Back to Edbrook.

292
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:13,987
To be together.

293
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,593
Where are the parents?

294
00:29:17,693 --> 00:29:19,693
The two have died.

295
00:29:21,897 --> 00:29:24,022
Died here at home?

296
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:30,767
They... died in India.

297
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:36,145
It's the parents you think you see?

298
00:29:36,245 --> 00:29:38,245
The mother?

299
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:40,974
Or is the father, Mr. Marielle?

300
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,450
He was a good man.

301
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:46,602
May he rest in heaven.

302
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:49,181
Mrs. Webb.

303
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:52,575
Why not tell them, you here...

304
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:55,394
...And that their children
are well cared for...

305
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:59,230
...And that can be left in peace.

306
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:08,031
Christina.
- David.

307
00:30:12,948 --> 00:30:15,084
I did not tell at breakfast.

308
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:18,119
It must be Simon, even deny it.

309
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:21,021
It's so boring.

310
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:25,191
I figured it was him.

311
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:28,295
But why?

312
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:32,690
In the Name of God Nana and his haunts?

313
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:34,868
Torment?

314
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,570
Christina...

315
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:42,280
...She is disturbed.
I do not need, it requires a doctor.

316
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:44,080
So we're not happy?

317
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,531
Delighted?

318
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:47,756
Now I can sleep better.

319
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,454
That means that leave us?

320
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:53,989
I want to stay...

321
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:59,891
...To convince your Nana,
there are no ghosts in Edbrook.

322
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:02,696
Great.

323
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,167
Then stay for centuries.

324
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:06,669
Empújeme.

325
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:08,769
Push?
- Yes.

326
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:12,865
Stronger.
- Stronger?

327
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:19,915
Dr. Doyle will call to come.

328
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:22,151
It is known the family for years.

329
00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:24,651
Good.
I can ask...

330
00:31:25,254 --> 00:31:27,389
...That is above,
in the locked room?

331
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:29,124
The fourth of my parents.

332
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:32,794
Nana Tess as maintained as a sanctuary.

333
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:35,228
Stronger.

334
00:31:39,434 --> 00:31:41,737
I did not know the formal attire for dinner.

335
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:44,299
Usually not.
Not when we're alone.

336
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,722
In fact let's go.

337
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,201
Is it rude?

338
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:48,655
No, not even for a bit.

339
00:31:48,755 --> 00:31:51,346
It's a commitment we can not cancel.

340
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:54,383
Nana take care,
is an excellent cook.

341
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:56,752
I hope you feel at home.

342
00:31:56,852 --> 00:31:58,852
Will.

343
00:31:58,987 --> 00:32:00,556
I feel bad for this.

344
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:04,056
Please I have much work to do.

345
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:07,661
We delayed.

346
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:19,398
No.
You do not...

347
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:22,175
Why?

348
00:32:27,316 --> 00:32:30,080
Please sit professor.

349
00:32:35,824 --> 00:32:38,204
To talk to,
Mrs. Webb?

350
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:42,762
They're still here?

351
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:45,423
They will always be here.

352
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:53,736
I've been to hundreds of homes...

353
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:55,909
Countless seances...

354
00:32:56,002 --> 00:33:01,758
...And I have not seen anything
can not be explained rationally.

355
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:06,928
Everyone I met,
had one thing in common.

356
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,028
The pain.

357
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:10,959
I thought it would help me.

358
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:13,729
Mrs. Webb I'm trying.

359
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:17,484
You're telling me you do not see...
nothing?

360
00:33:19,234 --> 00:33:21,234
I see nothing.

361
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,573
The problem here is that you if you do.

362
00:33:24,673 --> 00:33:28,507
If you just give me some details...

363
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,090
Try to prove...

364
00:33:31,213 --> 00:33:34,698
...There is nothing to fear at home.

365
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:36,952
There are spirits in this house.

366
00:33:37,052 --> 00:33:39,177
I know you see...

367
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,137
Breathe.

368
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:48,526
Just breathe.

369
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:51,965
Are you all right?

370
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:54,234
Breathe deep.

371
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:59,229
Come sit here.

372
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:05,366
I have things to do,
but I'll be here if I need.

373
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,199
If I had known,
would have smiled for you.

374
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:59,024
Dr. Henry Doyle.

375
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:01,597
Thank God you're here.

376
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:06,000
Thank God if you will,
but better thank her Christina.

377
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,900
Mrs. Webb did not feel well,
your nerves are shattered.

378
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,353
Christina told me.

379
00:36:11,453 --> 00:36:13,574
Where's Nana?
- I wear with it.

380
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,146
Very nice of you.

381
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:17,211
Tell me... if you please.

382
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:21,391
You expect to find
all those wires and gunpowder?

383
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:24,022
The ghost of poor Nana, maybe?

384
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:27,621
Or someone getting
pass through the ghost.

385
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:32,426
We were talking,
and suddenly had a seizure.

386
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:35,671
It seemed that something was choking.

387
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:39,300
I was hoping that forgotten about the ghost.

388
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,415
It used to be so strong
before the death of Messrs. Mariell.

389
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,719
Meet the family of long ago?

390
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:48,847
I've always known.

391
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:51,280
I was at the birth of three children.

392
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,380
I see.

393
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:56,437
I have not been of much help here.

394
00:36:56,524 --> 00:37:00,138
Perhaps a familiar face calm a little.

395
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:09,797
Leave us alone for a moment, please.

396
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,266
No, please.
I'll be fine...

397
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:14,366
Sure, Nana.

398
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,260
They did well to call me.

399
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,889
She is suffering emotional trauma.

400
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:37,291
I gave him something to help her sleep.

401
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:39,752
Is there anything I can do?

402
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:44,337
Try to convince that Edbrook is haunted.

403
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,598
I'll try.

404
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:48,202
She is resting now.

405
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:50,437
Let it rest a while.

406
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:53,407
Christina knows where
find me if you need me.

407
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:55,346
See...

408
00:37:55,446 --> 00:37:56,877
...I know where the exit is.

409
00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:58,977
Thank you, doctor.

410
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:08,873
What panic?

411
00:39:09,149 --> 00:39:12,175
Of course not.

412
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:15,864
Sorry, I could not endure.

413
00:39:15,964 --> 00:39:17,964
Naughty girl.

414
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:23,693
Perhaps, behind all the cynicism,
only one question.

415
00:39:23,897 --> 00:39:25,733
Well, doubt is healthy.

416
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:29,536
Serves to test our convictions.

417
00:39:29,636 --> 00:39:32,106
I expected to find,
when she opened the door?

418
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:34,416
Someone playing the piano.

419
00:39:34,494 --> 00:39:35,809
Who?

420
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,909
I do not know.

421
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:40,245
But still opened.

422
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,848
It is very brave.

423
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,220
An adventurous spirit.

424
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,265
What was that?

425
00:40:03,003 --> 00:40:05,003
A rat?

426
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:10,642
A shadow moved, was nothing.

427
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,279
He returned early?

428
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:18,250
If... the party was boring.

429
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:21,166
I said I had a headache.

430
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:23,835
Someone brought me home.

431
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,923
He is in love with me.

432
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:30,554
I presumed to say?

433
00:40:31,665 --> 00:40:33,724
No, not you.

434
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,300
It's beautiful.

435
00:40:42,876 --> 00:40:44,876
Thank you.

436
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,420
Reminds me of my mother.

437
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,569
Not funny, like music
the memories become so vivid?

438
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:59,112
Yes, indeed.

439
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:24,109
What the hell was that?

440
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:27,318
Are you all right?

441
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:34,060
I see you have been working hard teacher.

442
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,160
I play this?

443
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:39,766
Yes, it was intermittent
and it only went up a bit.

444
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:41,482
Do not touch the gas in
this part of the house...

445
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,910
...Is very dangerous.

446
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,335
Oh yes, I realize.

447
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:50,937
This place is a fire trap.
If you understand me?

448
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:53,894
Time to go to sleep Christina.

449
00:42:23,442 --> 00:42:24,911
Good morning.

450
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:27,011
How is Mrs. Webb?

451
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
It is a little better.

452
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:32,579
I'll be honest with you, David.

453
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:36,450
I particularly I did not want you to come.

454
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,992
I agreed because I thought
that would help the Nana.

455
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:42,642
But it seems to have worsened.

456
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:46,564
I'm not a healer.

457
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,936
You will not believe Edbrook
This haunted. Truth?

458
00:42:50,036 --> 00:42:52,538
I have not found some evidence.

459
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:57,568
So, is there anything
in particular to keep it here?

460
00:43:02,615 --> 00:43:06,119
He was invited to come to help Nana.

461
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:09,789
Do not abuse the hospitality of my sister.

462
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:16,227
I finish my work tonight
and I'm leaving tomorrow as scheduled.

463
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,440
Unless you want to do now.

464
00:43:23,536 --> 00:43:25,536
Tomorrow is fine.

465
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:36,981
Good morning.

466
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:44,223
You and Robert seem be getting along.

467
00:43:44,323 --> 00:43:46,120
Think?

468
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,574
Sleep well?

469
00:43:47,674 --> 00:43:49,462
Okay, thanks.
And you?

470
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:50,931
Very bad.

471
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:52,482
I dreamed all night.

472
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:54,050
With what?

473
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,150
With you.

474
00:43:57,203 --> 00:43:59,923
Something fell into their traps?

475
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:03,004
No, I'm afraid not.

476
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:06,579
Do not be discouraged,
that's good news.

477
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,414
You talk to her?

478
00:44:08,514 --> 00:44:10,514
No, not yet.

479
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:18,904
Nana, good news.
David has not found any ghost.

480
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:26,232
Sad, no?

481
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:28,332
She is so lost.

482
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,320
I knew I was going tomorrow?

483
00:44:38,878 --> 00:44:40,746
I have work to do.

484
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:43,115
Perhaps not let it go.

485
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:45,215
Enough.

486
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:51,188
I sign your book?

487
00:44:52,491 --> 00:44:54,491
With pleasure.

488
00:45:05,104 --> 00:45:07,104
You can support me.

489
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:19,345
Please do not move,
My handwriting is terrible.

490
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:29,662
'For the bold and charming Christina'.

491
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:31,762
'Never forget'.

492
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:37,703
Thanks, David.

493
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,204
Simon.

494
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,210
I did it.

495
00:45:48,147 --> 00:45:49,732
You should not do that.

496
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:51,141
He is impossible.

497
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:53,386
You're getting so boring, Christina.

498
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:55,655
We need some fun here.

499
00:45:55,755 --> 00:46:00,090
Robert is always serious
Tess and Nana is crazy.

500
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,455
I'm always being watched.

501
00:46:05,164 --> 00:46:07,164
Come with me.

502
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,468
Where are we going?

503
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:13,472
I want to spend more time with you,
without being disturbed my brothers.

504
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:15,908
Do not argue.
Already decided.

505
00:46:16,008 --> 00:46:19,323
It's your last day,
I want to use it.

506
00:47:20,706 --> 00:47:23,256
Why return to England?

507
00:47:25,678 --> 00:47:29,418
The irresistible call of the roots, I think.

508
00:47:31,217 --> 00:47:32,618
What?

509
00:47:32,718 --> 00:47:35,353
Talk like a vegetable.

510
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:43,861
On behalf of the empire
It is an honor to have you with us.

511
00:47:51,203 --> 00:47:53,203
Herbs for luck?

512
00:47:58,377 --> 00:47:59,728
No thanks.

513
00:47:59,828 --> 00:48:01,828
I read your future?

514
00:48:02,014 --> 00:48:03,695
Sixpence.

515
00:48:03,795 --> 00:48:05,159
We...

516
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:08,020
Do not believe in those things, do you?

517
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,010
I want to know what will happen.

518
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:18,161
Sixpence?

519
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:20,397
Tome.

520
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:31,988
'I'm getting married soon.'

521
00:48:32,278 --> 00:48:35,406
Is getting married soon.
This year.

522
00:48:36,448 --> 00:48:39,185
'I will live a long life
and happy with my wife.'

523
00:48:39,285 --> 00:48:43,790
You will have a long life
and be happy with your wife.

524
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:45,623
'Many children'.

525
00:48:45,723 --> 00:48:48,283
Have many children.

526
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,663
One will be named...

527
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:55,843
...Of a loved one,
lost as a child.

528
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,064
Thank you.
It's your turn.

529
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,616
There is something that
can say, you do not know.

530
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:21,424
I must go now.

531
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:24,026
Forgive me.

532
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,574
He does not like that?

533
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:44,246
Is this true?

534
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:47,254
What he said about his childhood?

535
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,611
He had a twin sister.

536
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:53,181
He died very young.

537
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,360
Sorry.

538
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:00,029
What happened?

539
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:03,866
Drowned.

540
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:07,169
David, I'm sorry.

541
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:12,746
He was with her when it happened.

542
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:17,915
I consider psychology because of that.

543
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:21,288
To prove it really was.

544
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:24,054
She will not ever, David.

545
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:27,269
There is magic in nostalgia.

546
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:31,565
Without that magic,
just the ability to love.

547
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,832
This is my magical place.

548
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,714
What is it?

549
00:50:46,814 --> 00:50:48,814
My mother adored him.

550
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,140
He came here every summer days.

551
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:55,527
I can almost see it now...

552
00:50:55,753 --> 00:50:58,898
...Sitting in that chair with a book.

553
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:01,964
It's like more memory.

554
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,975
How old was she when she died?

555
00:51:06,998 --> 00:51:10,143
It was a day before my birthday 14.

556
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,668
Valentine's Day.

557
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:18,407
Year after year, every day
Valentine come here...

558
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,911
...I just sit.

559
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,747
Trying to understand.

560
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:31,238
I can not accept that
death is the end of everything.

561
00:51:31,315 --> 00:51:33,533
It's hard to accept.

562
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:43,018
His parents died in India?

563
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:49,479
They were heading to the mountains.

564
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:52,998
The rain fell earlier in the year.

565
00:51:53,978 --> 00:51:55,978
Just disappeared.

566
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:03,548
For my Mother Nana come here every night.

567
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:06,286
She says she saw her once.

568
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:09,260
She says you saw her?

569
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,845
That was the beginning of their problems.

570
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:31,056
A race to the house.

571
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,359
Where have you been?

572
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,881
Riding.

573
00:52:44,981 --> 00:52:46,631
Riding?

574
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:48,731
At night?

575
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:50,535
Sorry, Robert.

576
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:52,085
Sorry?

577
00:52:52,185 --> 00:52:54,185
You should.

578
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:57,350
We wait for hours for dinner.

579
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,976
I was worried.

580
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:02,346
It was not our intention to slow us down.

581
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:05,316
Is supposed to help
to Nana, but tell me what has he done?

582
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,351
For now, not David's fault.

583
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,451
Of course not.

584
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:12,537
Nana was very worried.

585
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,425
It's terrible that you do that.

586
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:22,383
Sorry.

587
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:37,981
His sister is an adult woman.

588
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:40,583
And the fault is all mine.

589
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:45,421
Good night.

590
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:21,507
How well we were close.

591
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:23,607
Algae...

592
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:25,956
I could not shake them.

593
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:28,056
Algae?
What algae?

594
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,203
I had caught.

595
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,282
Suffocate.

596
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,382
There are no algae.

597
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:42,691
They were around my neck.

598
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:45,046
Suffocate.

599
00:57:45,619 --> 00:57:47,619
And suddenly...

600
00:57:53,627 --> 00:57:55,627
He was free.

601
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,541
That was me.

602
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,641
David.
David.

603
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,600
That was me.

604
00:58:02,835 --> 00:58:05,300
Come friend, let's go inside.

605
00:58:24,924 --> 00:58:27,304
I came for your wet clothes.

606
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:30,154
And I really appreciate it.

607
00:58:30,462 --> 00:58:34,797
I'll put in the kitchen be dry in the morning.

608
00:58:37,803 --> 00:58:39,843
I'm worried, David.

609
00:58:40,806 --> 00:58:43,186
As it fell into the lake?

610
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,240
Christina...

611
00:58:47,012 --> 00:58:49,012
I did not fall.

612
00:58:50,882 --> 00:58:52,882
I was pushed.

613
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,133
Pushed?

614
00:58:55,233 --> 00:58:57,233
Someone pushed me.

615
00:58:59,023 --> 00:59:01,759
Do not be thinking about what I said.

616
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:03,281
My Mother was a gentle person.

617
00:59:03,381 --> 00:59:05,329
She never push someone to the lake.

618
00:59:05,429 --> 00:59:08,592
Heaven.
No, Mother.

619
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Someone pushed me.

620
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:13,569
Who would do that?

621
00:59:14,438 --> 00:59:17,074
Perhaps the same person
this scaring Nana.

622
00:59:17,174 --> 00:59:21,245
The same person who
I was scratching the door that night.

623
00:59:21,345 --> 00:59:24,142
Where was Simon?
- Sleeping.

624
00:59:25,015 --> 00:59:27,735
I knew he was in the lake?

625
00:59:28,018 --> 00:59:30,018
Is accusing me?

626
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:34,057
You just have to accuse the Nana.

627
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:37,561
Why do any of we want to hurt him?

628
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:40,126
He could have drowned, David.

629
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,255
I should be grateful.

630
00:59:45,368 --> 00:59:47,368
Sorry.

631
00:59:50,807 --> 00:59:54,410
I am very grateful to you.
I'm just...

632
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,510
...Very confused.

633
00:59:57,613 --> 00:59:59,613
All is well.

634
00:59:59,707 --> 01:00:04,169
I'm sorry I upset.
It must be awful for you.

635
01:00:10,225 --> 01:00:13,030
You may feel better with this.

636
01:00:14,963 --> 01:00:17,683
We remove the taste of the lake.

637
01:00:19,934 --> 01:00:21,934
You must be exhausted.

638
01:00:22,303 --> 01:00:23,711
It was a day so difficult.

639
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:25,811
Everything happened.

640
01:00:25,907 --> 01:00:28,426
Probably need sleep.

641
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:09,563
I'm not crazy.
Are not teacher?

642
01:01:09,643 --> 01:01:11,184
Take me with you tomorrow.

643
01:01:11,284 --> 01:01:14,174
You are my salvation.
Please.

644
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,922
No, no.
Let.

645
01:02:52,648 --> 01:02:55,028
Good morning.
- Good morning.

646
01:02:56,018 --> 01:02:59,455
When packing,
Simon will help with the bags...

647
01:02:59,555 --> 01:03:03,040
Christina... and take him to the station.

648
01:03:04,193 --> 01:03:06,193
I'm afraid I will not.

649
01:03:10,932 --> 01:03:12,932
As you wish.

650
01:04:37,282 --> 01:04:40,427
The number, please.
- Camberley, 284.

651
01:04:51,163 --> 01:04:52,865
Ash professor's office.

652
01:04:52,965 --> 01:04:55,767
Kate, I'm David.
Listen, I need your help.

653
01:04:55,867 --> 01:04:57,867
Is everything okay?

654
01:04:58,036 --> 01:05:01,707
Last night I went home.
I had returned.

655
01:05:01,807 --> 01:05:04,275
Will have to cancel my classes tomorrow.

656
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,244
I'm staying a few days.

657
01:05:06,344 --> 01:05:08,250
David does not sound so good..

658
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:09,757
I'm fine.

659
01:05:09,857 --> 01:05:11,949
I want to do something for me.

660
01:05:12,049 --> 01:05:17,282
Look for the edition of the Times
February 17, 1923.

661
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:21,607
Page 13, top left.
Understood?

662
01:05:21,707 --> 01:05:23,594
Yes, I have it all.

663
01:05:23,694 --> 01:05:24,840
I'll call you later.

664
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,940
Well David, we are.

665
01:05:31,268 --> 01:05:33,268
Robert, please, no.

666
01:05:35,805 --> 01:05:37,805
Basta, Robert.

667
01:05:41,011 --> 01:05:43,011
Enough.

668
01:05:45,048 --> 01:05:47,048
Please...
- Continued.

669
01:05:47,884 --> 01:05:49,884
Continua.

670
01:05:50,487 --> 01:05:52,487
Continua.

671
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,400
Let's see...

672
01:06:29,558 --> 01:06:33,049
Come on. Right here.
For here we go.

673
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:47,873
It's David.

674
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:51,159
Le Atina, knew it was David.

675
01:06:52,647 --> 01:06:54,480
We are a party of four.
Edbrook we play.

676
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,927
Five, with Nana.

677
01:06:56,027 --> 01:06:57,585
Yes, Nana can play.

678
01:06:57,685 --> 01:07:00,490
Come on, Nana.
It's your birthday.

679
01:07:01,778 --> 01:07:04,229
Happy birthday to you.

680
01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:06,679
Happy birthday to you.

681
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,780
Happy birthday dear Nana.
Happy birthday to you.

682
01:07:14,468 --> 01:07:15,936
Of course you're playing.

683
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,562
Now...
The game Edbrook.

684
01:07:17,662 --> 01:07:18,975
It is very simple.

685
01:07:19,075 --> 01:07:20,583
Each puts a shilling.
- Someone is hiding.

686
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:22,056
Whoever finds it wins.

687
01:07:22,156 --> 01:07:25,245
If no one is...
That gets the money.

688
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:26,946
I'm no good for games.

689
01:07:27,046 --> 01:07:31,210
We need you.
Do not be a killjoy.

690
01:07:32,151 --> 01:07:34,276
Is to encourage Nana.

691
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,555
You never know who you can find.

692
01:07:36,655 --> 01:07:38,089
David, hide first.

693
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:39,868
And we will seek.

694
01:07:39,968 --> 01:07:41,342
Count to 100.

695
01:07:41,442 --> 01:07:43,652
Slow.
It has to be slow.

696
01:07:44,525 --> 01:07:48,989
1, 2, 3...

697
01:07:49,935 --> 01:07:52,485
Come on David, you must hurry.

698
01:07:54,075 --> 01:08:01,255
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

699
01:08:01,355 --> 01:08:10,305
...11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16...

700
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:54,190
I always look here first.

701
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,015
I found you.

702
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,115
I won.

703
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:23,013
I find it?
- I have it.

704
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,767
It is the report about a death.

705
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:29,555
'Tragedy in Edbrook Mansion'.

706
01:09:29,655 --> 01:09:31,005
'Mr. Anthony Yates'

707
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:35,100
'Judge...'
Fast. Just tell me what happened?

708
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:39,468
It says here that Ms. Mariell
drowned in the lake.

709
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,343
The verdict was suicide.

710
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:44,879
For a period of mental disorder.

711
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,680
David?
- Thanks.

712
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:09,336
What is the problem, David?

713
01:10:09,436 --> 01:10:11,436
What is the problem?

714
01:10:12,106 --> 01:10:16,441
You do not know what to believe,
that's the problem.

715
01:10:17,077 --> 01:10:19,108
I'm worried about you.

716
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:22,277
Oh yeah?
I too.

717
01:10:25,218 --> 01:10:27,387
I do not know if I'm imagining things.

718
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:30,122
I do not know if Nana is crazy.

719
01:10:30,323 --> 01:10:33,059
Now I'm seeing what she sees?

720
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:37,069
Do not trust anyone,
or anything in this house.

721
01:10:38,865 --> 01:10:40,366
You can trust me.

722
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:42,466
Really, I can?

723
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:50,327
This date means anything to you?

724
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:01,751
Why lie?

725
01:11:06,258 --> 01:11:09,962
Invented who died in India because...

726
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:12,357
...Can not stand the truth.

727
01:11:20,137 --> 01:11:22,942
Why his mother committed suicide?

728
01:11:26,811 --> 01:11:31,316
After father's death,
became very depressed.

729
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:36,550
Back to Edbrook only makes things worse.

730
01:11:36,921 --> 01:11:38,921
So many memories...

731
01:11:41,025 --> 01:11:43,025
I miss her so much.

732
01:11:45,328 --> 01:11:47,330
Who found the body?

733
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:50,024
Died.
What is enough?

734
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,000
Now you know our dirty little secret.

735
01:11:54,938 --> 01:11:57,488
You have to ask this?

736
01:11:57,707 --> 01:11:59,707
Yes, I'm afraid so.

737
01:12:00,443 --> 01:12:02,779
Want to know how found the body, right?

738
01:12:02,879 --> 01:12:05,081
The blue lips, swollen skin...

739
01:12:05,181 --> 01:12:07,817
...And cracked.
The eyes open and fixed.

740
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:10,453
You have a morbid fascination for the dead.

741
01:12:10,553 --> 01:12:13,188
You should see a doctor, David.

742
01:12:14,523 --> 01:12:16,292
Nana Tess was the one who found it.

743
01:12:16,392 --> 01:12:19,112
It was never the same.
Satisfied?

744
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,366
Help.

745
01:17:03,851 --> 01:17:07,751
Christina.
Christina.

746
01:17:09,608 --> 01:17:11,608
Help.

747
01:17:17,616 --> 01:17:19,616
Christina helps.

748
01:17:24,822 --> 01:17:26,434
There's a fire.
Leave the house.

749
01:17:26,534 --> 01:17:28,773
David. Wait.
- The basement is on fire.

750
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:31,848
What fire?
- In the basement, going.

751
01:17:33,631 --> 01:17:35,333
No fire.

752
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:37,473
Come see, no fire.

753
01:18:00,523 --> 01:18:02,523
I do not understand...

754
01:18:05,862 --> 01:18:07,902
What is happening to me?

755
01:18:21,111 --> 01:18:23,111
There was a fire.

756
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:25,452
You're imagining things.

757
01:18:48,036 --> 01:18:50,501
Come on, David.
I'll take you.

758
01:19:19,466 --> 01:19:21,931
I'll be waiting in the car.

759
01:19:36,082 --> 01:19:38,518
The things he says have been...

760
01:19:38,618 --> 01:19:42,552
...Are symptoms of a
great emotional stress.

761
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:45,656
What happened in the lake.

762
01:19:46,059 --> 01:19:48,059
Fire.

763
01:19:48,527 --> 01:19:52,182
For the first time you see these things?

764
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:58,114
He fought in the war, David?

765
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,476
In the Argonne, Sedan.

766
01:20:03,576 --> 01:20:05,311
But he survived.

767
01:20:05,411 --> 01:20:07,411
Yes, I survived.

768
01:20:07,847 --> 01:20:11,417
Also survived the death of his sister.

769
01:20:12,318 --> 01:20:15,123
Christina told me.
She drowned.

770
01:20:16,421 --> 01:20:17,805
It's true.

771
01:20:17,905 --> 01:20:19,424
It is because of that?

772
01:20:19,524 --> 01:20:21,524
It was my fault.

773
01:20:22,994 --> 01:20:24,829
I push her.

774
01:20:24,929 --> 01:20:27,054
And I could not save her.

775
01:20:28,132 --> 01:20:29,934
Know?
I find it fascinating...

776
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:34,611
...That is dedicated to disprove
spiritual phenomena.

777
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:39,543
Belief in the afterlife,
helps us continue to heal.

778
01:20:39,944 --> 01:20:42,879
You are not allowed to have faith.

779
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:48,033
Feel you can not explain. Truth?

780
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:54,825
I saw strong men,
who survived the war...

781
01:20:54,925 --> 01:20:57,794
...Destroyed by their own fault.

782
01:20:57,894 --> 01:20:59,894
My fault not explain...

783
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:03,367
...What is happening
Edbrook in the Mansion.

784
01:21:03,467 --> 01:21:06,470
Symptoms of Nana Tess are very similar...

785
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:12,209
...Does not accept that people who
served all his life, not more.

786
01:21:12,309 --> 01:21:15,879
You agreed with my diagnosis.

787
01:21:17,046 --> 01:21:19,596
You are alone, without family.

788
01:21:20,182 --> 01:21:23,157
Unable to tell their experiences.

789
01:21:23,986 --> 01:21:27,726
The mind is very fragile.
You know, David?

790
01:21:29,258 --> 01:21:32,403
Christina told me he has not slept.

791
01:21:41,069 --> 01:21:43,789
Take these if you can not sleep.

792
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:45,866
It may help.

793
01:21:46,107 --> 01:21:49,082
Thank you.
I have been very helpful.

794
01:21:50,078 --> 01:21:51,880
Goodbye, David.

795
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,980
And good luck.

796
01:21:54,215 --> 01:21:56,985
I'm always here if you want to talk.

797
01:21:57,085 --> 01:21:59,085
Thank you.

798
01:22:02,123 --> 01:22:04,673
If you need an obsession...

799
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:07,664
...Christina would be healthier.

800
01:22:09,863 --> 01:22:11,863
Indeed.

801
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,722
Are you okay?

802
01:22:20,822 --> 01:22:22,822
I'm fine.

803
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:44,375
You're sorry you came?
- No.

804
01:23:49,293 --> 01:23:51,818
I have fear of losing you.

805
01:23:54,765 --> 01:23:56,765
You do not have.

806
01:23:57,668 --> 01:24:00,535
I want you with me tomorrow.

807
01:24:02,106 --> 01:24:04,106
I can not.

808
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:07,241
I can not Edbrook.

809
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:10,611
Why?

810
01:24:12,615 --> 01:24:14,655
Robert Munce leave me.

811
01:24:18,421 --> 01:24:21,651
This has nothing to do with Robert.

812
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:28,896
No, it does not.

813
01:26:28,713 --> 01:26:30,713
Sleep, David.

814
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,475
DIED IN THE GREAT ALL.

815
01:30:26,575 --> 01:30:29,720
OF FIRE
EDBROOK MANSION - 1923.

816
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:34,526
MARIELLA ROBERT, SIMON
MARIELLA, MARIELLE CHRISTINA.

817
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,875
DIED IN THE GREAT ALL.

818
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:42,120
OF FIRE
EDBROOK MANSION - 1923.

819
01:31:45,352 --> 01:31:48,237
There is no Dr. Doyle, David.

820
01:31:48,337 --> 01:31:50,542
He died many years ago.

821
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:52,790
Juliet?

822
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,638
Are you?

823
01:31:55,738 --> 01:31:57,597
Let me take.

824
01:31:57,697 --> 01:31:59,822
No, this can not be.

825
01:32:00,734 --> 01:32:03,624
Take my hand,
you're safe with me.

826
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:15,655
Do not go with her, David.

827
01:32:16,538 --> 01:32:18,538
David.

828
01:32:27,226 --> 01:32:29,226
Is everything okay?

829
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:31,795
I was so worried.

830
01:32:40,939 --> 01:32:42,939
I'm here, David.

831
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:46,309
Stay with me.

832
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,811
Indulge me.

833
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,814
Do not resist.

834
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:58,487
Get in the car.

835
01:33:19,977 --> 01:33:23,714
Never will I leave you, David.
We'll be together forever.

836
01:33:23,814 --> 01:33:25,814
It's not what you want?

837
01:33:30,088 --> 01:33:32,400
Christina.
Care.

838
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:25,471
Christina is dead.

839
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,541
Of course she's dead.

840
01:34:29,344 --> 01:34:31,344
Forgive me.

841
01:34:31,438 --> 01:34:33,563
I should not have called.

842
01:34:34,114 --> 01:34:36,239
Never going to let go.

843
01:34:43,624 --> 01:34:46,460
I want to know what happens here.

844
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,393
And I know now.

845
01:34:51,632 --> 01:34:55,712
One day Mrs. Mariell
returned home unannounced.

846
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:58,805
He went up to see the children.

847
01:34:59,505 --> 01:35:02,310
They were in her room.

848
01:35:02,542 --> 01:35:04,542
Simon was drunk.

849
01:35:05,211 --> 01:35:08,441
Robert and Christina were doing...

850
01:35:10,516 --> 01:35:12,641
She told me what he saw.

851
01:35:13,953 --> 01:35:16,456
Something so horrible could not bear it.

852
01:35:16,556 --> 01:35:19,423
That day is thrown into the lake.

853
01:35:20,393 --> 01:35:22,228
And after that happened, Nana?

854
01:35:22,328 --> 01:35:24,328
Continua.

855
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,376
It was you.

856
01:35:26,476 --> 01:35:28,200
You were born evil.

857
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,300
Who is evil?

858
01:35:31,136 --> 01:35:33,136
I never killed anyone.

859
01:35:33,338 --> 01:35:35,338
Corrupted others.

860
01:35:35,414 --> 01:35:40,015
They locked us in the room,
and then set it afire.

861
01:35:40,812 --> 01:35:43,212
They deserved to die.

862
01:35:44,216 --> 01:35:46,256
You see, she'll kill us.

863
01:35:46,651 --> 01:35:49,541
He thought he would get rid of us.

864
01:35:49,988 --> 01:35:53,825
Now, I'm afraid no longer
you need more, Nana.

865
01:35:53,925 --> 01:35:55,925
Already served.

866
01:37:45,566 --> 01:37:49,221
How could I spend so
much time without you?

867
01:37:51,004 --> 01:37:53,129
You do not feel the same?

868
01:37:55,008 --> 01:37:57,008
It must be love, David.

869
01:37:57,944 --> 01:38:01,089
Making a sacrifice for someone else.

870
01:38:01,481 --> 01:38:03,861
To spend eternity with her.

871
01:38:04,784 --> 01:38:07,788
I'm so happy I found you.

872
01:38:07,888 --> 01:38:10,186
Stay, we'll be together.

873
01:38:22,034 --> 01:38:24,034
He slept well, David?

874
01:38:28,107 --> 01:38:30,742
You were very funny, David.

875
01:38:33,979 --> 01:38:36,784
Had the opportunity to leave.

876
01:38:48,426 --> 01:38:50,426
Die for me, David.

877
01:42:16,794 --> 01:42:20,024
Never forgive me, so you pass.

878
01:42:20,397 --> 01:42:24,477
It was not your fault, David.
It was an accident.

879
01:42:25,669 --> 01:42:28,304
We would have been so attached.

880
01:42:28,973 --> 01:42:30,973
Always will be.

881
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,600
Goodbye, David.

882
01:43:36,003 --> 01:43:38,128
David, welcome home.

883
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:43,840
Scared all the ghosts?

884
01:43:45,379 --> 01:43:47,379
A most.
