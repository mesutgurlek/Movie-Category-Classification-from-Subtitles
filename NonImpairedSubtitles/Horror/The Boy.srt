1
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,700
Apologies, miss.

2
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,564
I didn't know how else to wake you.

3
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,207
The Heelshires had to step out
for a moment.

4
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,848
They beg your pardon, miss,
and they ask that you wait in the parlor.

5
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,526
It's like something out of
a storybook, isn't it?

6
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,571
Oh, the Heelshires have
already taken care of that.

7
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,370
And I put your things inside.

8
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,851
Thanks.

9
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,201
(DOOR SHUTS)

10
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,481
(EXHALES)

11
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,645
Whoa.

12
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,047
(DOOR SHUTS)

13
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,681
Is anyone up there? Hi.

14
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,251
(DISTANT RUMBLING)

15
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,410
Is anyone up here?

16
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,801
(TWANGS)

17
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,321
(CHUCKLES)

18
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,525
(WHIRRING)

19
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,531
- Hi there.
- (GASPS)

20
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,127
GRETA: Sorry.

21
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,165
Believe it or not, I was actually
trying not to scare you.

22
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,180
No, I'm sorry I jumped.

23
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,009
I... I thought I heard someone upstairs.

24
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,201
(LAUGHS)

25
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,660
Are you all right?

26
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,366
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's so stupid.

27
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,300
- Are you Mr. Heelshire?
- No.

28
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,420
- I know you're not. Yeah.
- (LAUGHS)

29
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,363
Uh, no, I'm the grocery boy.

30
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,443
Well, grocery man. You know.

31
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,420
I own the shop, actually.

32
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,567
(LAUGHS)

33
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,700
Okay. I'm Malcolm, by the way.

34
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,780
Hi.

35
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,881
You must be here for the nanny job.

36
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,365
Yeah. Greta Evans.

37
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,060
I've got some groceries to unpack
downstairs if you want to join me.

38
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,323
I could give you a tour
of such exotic locations...

39
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,887
Uh, as the pantry and bread bin.

40
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,001
- Does that interest you?
- (CHUCKLES)

41
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,407
Sounds great. Sure. Lead the way.

42
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,161
MALCOLM: You're American, yeah?

43
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,209
Yeah. My first trip to the UK.

44
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,204
All right, let me guess.

45
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,723
California, right?

46
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,409
- Montana. In this?
- Oh.

47
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,521
Yeah. It goes in the basket.

48
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,449
You know, I'm usually
so good at these things.

49
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,780
I've got a touch of the gift.

50
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,041
The gift?

51
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,660
Prognosticator, clairvoyant,
whatever you like to call it.

52
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,220
Uh, I had a grandmother
that read tea leaves.

53
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,890
My mother read palms, so...

54
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,089
Okay, what do you read?

55
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,089
- Me?
- Yeah.

56
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,481
Uh...

57
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,120
Chewing gum.

58
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,204
Okay. (LAUGHS)

59
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,860
We don't get to choose
our gifts, Miss Evans.

60
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,611
Come on, if you'll allow me. Don't be shy.

61
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,286
Allow you to...

62
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,660
Yeah, I'm going to read your gum.

63
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,444
I'm a professional. Trust me.

64
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,766
Okay.

65
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,525
Oh, my God.

66
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,686
All right. Oh. Okay.

67
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,020
Huh.

68
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,929
Interesting teeth marks. Uh...

69
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,206
(CHUCKLES)

70
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,482
I see that you're a writer...

71
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,481
From Phoenix, Montana.

72
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,002
It looks like you've come here to be
inspired by the English countryside...

73
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,211
To get away from the hustle and bustle
of your life in the US of A.

74
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,641
No.

75
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,484
- Close.
- Um...

76
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,127
Not at all. No.

77
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,045
- Okay, one more try.
- Okay.

78
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,531
Okay? Just one.

79
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,085
Ah. Okay.

80
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,740
Okay, I see where we went wrong now.

81
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,365
- It's very obvious now.
- Of course.

82
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,166
Um...

83
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,289
I see a dark past.

84
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,841
On the run from someone, are we?
(CHUCKLES)

85
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,083
That's what it looks like.

86
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,369
I'll throw it away now.

87
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,300
I'm afraid that was
my best attempt at flirting.

88
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,925
Believe it or not, I'm actually
considered charming in this country.

89
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,201
It's okay.

90
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,810
It's amazing that any of us manage
to procreate at all, really.

91
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,260
Bread?

92
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,771
Yeah, in the cupboard behind.

93
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,845
So... Um...

94
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,526
So, what's the family like?

95
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,620
Well, they're nice, you know?

96
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,051
They're very generous.

97
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,362
As good a people
as you'll ever hope to meet.

98
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,327
And the son? Brahms?

99
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,926
Brahms.

100
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,900
Oh, he's, um...

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,240
- Uh...
- (DOOR OPENS)

102
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm not sure quite
how to explain it, really.

103
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,880
Oh, look.

104
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,771
GRETA: Mrs. Heelshire...

105
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,210
(SIGHS) It's so nice to finally meet you.

106
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,841
Hmm. Where are your shoes?

107
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,321
Uh...

108
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,380
Brahms is very excited
to meet you, Miss Evans.

109
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,540
He's never met an American before.

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,847
I'm very excited to meet him, too.

111
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,526
I, um...

112
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,246
I was sure I left my shoes right here.

113
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,900
They'll turn up.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,321
It's Brahms. He can be playful.

115
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,660
I assume you brought other shoes.

116
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,171
Yes, I did.

117
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,660
Then let's hurry up.

118
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,001
We've kept them waiting long enough.

119
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,166
MR. HEELSHIRE: Her name is Miss Evans.

120
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,806
So, we want you to be
on your very best behavior.

121
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,210
You're looking very smart.
You know, I like that tie.

122
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,500
Do you know why I like that tie?

123
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,761
Daddy.

124
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,209
Miss Evans, allow me
to introduce Mr. Heelshire.

125
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,840
Miss Evans.

126
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,002
And this is our son, Brahms.

127
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,684
(LAUGHS)

128
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,761
(CLEARS THROAT)

129
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,963
MALCOLM: So, you've met Brahms then.

130
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,562
How are you doing, Brahms? Eh?

131
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,127
Now, you take it easy on Miss Evans.

132
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,409
She's traveled a long way
just to meet you.

133
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,603
I'll be off then. The bill's on the table.

134
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,860
A pleasure to meet you, Miss Evans.

135
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,660
I hope to see you on my next delivery.

136
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,006
- MRS. HEELSHIRE: Thank you, Malcolm.
- MALCOLM: Of course.

137
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,729
It's so nice to meet you, Brahms.

138
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,722
I hope that you and I can be friends.

139
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,285
MRS. HEELSHIRE: Daddy, will you take
Miss Evans' things up to her room, please?

140
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,060
Miss Evans, we might as well get started.

141
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,650
I have a lot to show you.

142
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,446
MRS. HEELSHIRE:
You'll be all alone out here.

143
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,220
Do you think you can manage?

144
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,560
Yeah, of course.

145
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,060
Hmm. Well, we've had a number
of potential nannies come through already.

146
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,220
Brahms has rejected them all,

147
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,961
though they weren't nearly
as young or as pretty

148
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,885
as you.

149
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,660
You will wake him at 7:00 each morning

150
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,330
and you will dress him.

151
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,860
Okay.

152
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,361
You'll find his clean clothes behind you.

153
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,001
So, I should...

154
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,740
Wake him up and dress him, Miss Evans.

155
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,002
There's no better way
to learn than by doing.

156
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,321
Okay.

157
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,051
(WHISPERING) Wake up, Brahms.

158
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,411
Well, I don't know about you,
but that certainly wouldn't wake me.

159
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,540
It's time to wake up, Brahms.

160
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,722
He's not a baby, Miss Evans.

161
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,287
You needn't be afraid of hurting him.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,620
Change this stuff...

163
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,131
Excuse me. (CLEARS THROAT)

164
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,801
Mmm-hmm.

165
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,009

It's his world.

Of course, he likes it
rather louder than I prefer...

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,210
and it's a tragedy that he was
taken at such a young age.

492
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,700
And the pub talk?

493
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,540

that he wasn't such a lovely lad.

494
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,086

What's the truth?

496
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,961
One night, I came out here for a delivery.

497
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,322
I didn't know it at the time, but it was
Brahms's birthday or would have been.

498
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,924
And Mrs. Heelshire, she was in the sitting
room opening presents with the doll.

499
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,925
And Mr. Heelshire...

500
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,164
He was in here.

501
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,926
Off his pickle. (SNICKERS)

503
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,802
that he couldn't do it anymore.

504
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,690
I told him I'd come back...

505
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,860
But he said, "No, no, come on.

506
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,166
"Have a drink with an old man."

507
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,260
So I do.

508
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,805
Well, we get a couple of drinks in.

509
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,284
We're chatting about the weather
and so on and finally...

510
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,765
I get the courage to ask him
that exact question.

511
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,010
"What was Brahms, the real Brahms, like?"

512
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,362
God, he just looks at me
with this heartbroken look.

513
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,220
It made me sorry I even asked.

514
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,810
And he said one word.

515
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,164
"Odd," he says.

516
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,281
Odd.

517
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,180
And that was it.

518
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,726
Which, I suppose is all
the answer we'll ever get.

come over here and check the whole house.
