My mom owns a cabin out here.

172
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,219
We're just staying at it
for the weekend.

173
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:58,223
Well, we've had some
disturbances around here...

174
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,026
some break-ins, vandalism,
animals being killed.

175
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,128
Obviously, you kids wouldn't
know anything about that,

176
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,295
would you?

177
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,163
No, nothing.

178
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,264
We just got here.

00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,599
You're just visiting.

180
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

181
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,335
See, we get a lot of that.

the weekend, getting drunk,

they want.

184
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,509
I'm here to tell you
that's not the case.

While you're in my town
you best behave,

to deal with me

and you don't want to do that.

188

189
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,950
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,252
I'm gonna give you a warning.

Yes, thank you.

It's beautiful out here.

200
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,885
Yeah, April, when you
said cabin in the woods

201
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,222
I thought this was gonna be
a total shithole.

202
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,935
Oh, yeah!

This is such a trip.

Last time I was here,
we were in middle school.

207
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:36,121
Yeah, we used to come out
here every summer.

208
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,489
I'm gonna go grab my camera,

209
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,257
hopefully I can get all the
rooms before it gets dark out.

210
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,259
Do you need help?

211
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,460
No, it's ok baby, I got it.
Alright.

212
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,622
Hey, think fast, fuckhead!

[dance music]

215
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,335
I figured it was coyotes, so I
replaced the whole damn fence.

216
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,372
Now I don't know what to think.

217
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:33,111
Well, it doesn't look like
coyotes, Rick.

218
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,513
It's too perfect,
too clean.

219
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,982
If this keeps up, I'm not
gonna survive the season.

220
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,018
I'm gonna get animal control
down here,

221
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,853
get things cleared up, ok?

222
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:45,456
You take care.

223
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,998
I'm over here at
the Riseman farm,

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,102
got another animal mutilation
same as the others.

in this town, huh?

No.
Yeah.

228
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:16,955
Oh my God, I can't believe you
slept with that guy.

229
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,423
Yeah.
No!

230
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:21,292
Yeah!
He was, like, forty
and so guido!

231
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,727
Oh, whatever.

232
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:26,698
He was hot.

233
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,600
So um...

234
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:32,003
NYU probably has a pretty
good writing program.

235
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,673
You know, it would probably
be easy to transfer there.

236
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,041
What?
For Kyle.

237

Melanie, I put a lot of thought
into this, ok?

239
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,014
I just don't see it happening.

240
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,382
I don't know,

241
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,452
it's just that there are a lot
of douchebag guys out there,

242
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,954
and Kyle isn't one of them.

243

have been.

00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,645
about 2400 clicks an hour,

334
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,046
it stopped right on
a goddamn dime,

335
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:13,251
did a 180 quicker than
any aircraft known to man.

336
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,685
You had to see it.

337
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,753
No way!

338
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,122
Way.

339
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,692
Oh, you guys are so young,

340
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:26,063
you have no idea what's going
on out there.

341
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,933
Why should you?

342
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,102
When I was your age,

343
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:36,741
I thought the world was a good
and fair place.

344
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:39,410
I've seen some shit since then.

345
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,013
People nowadays live
in their naive,

346
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:46,584
comfortable bubble worlds, and
the people behind the curtain

347
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,152
want to keep them that way.

348
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,454
The last thing they want
is an informed,

349
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,657
public cable free-thought.

350
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,326
<i>Free.</i>

351
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,594
<i>Yeah.</i>

352
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,196
People out there, they think
they're free,

353
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,464
but they couldn't be further
from the truth.

354
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,533
That's why you gotta stay
off the radar.

355
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,036
Keep off the grid.

356
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:14,712
'Cause they're out there,
and they're watching.

357
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,618
So, um, can I buy some weed?

358
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,290
Of course you can.

359
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,491
So then, I was like

360
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,359
Oh.

361
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,460
My.

362
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,795
God.

363
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:31,963
And I was, like, freaking
out and I felt super dizzy

364
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,331
and out of it,
and I mean,

365
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,332
I was having a full on
panic attack

366
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,533
in the middle
of the club!

367
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,635
All of my friends were
totally like TTYL,

368
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,803
I didn't know what to do.

369
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,805
So anyway, out of nowhere,
he comes over

370
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:44,208
and he's all like
hey, are you alright?

371
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,111
He takes me to his dorm and he
takes care of me all night

372
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,913
and he gives me water

373
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,382
and I just knew he was
the right guy for me.

374
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,685
<i>So yeah, that's how we met.</i>

375
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:59,223
Wow, that sounds amazing.

376
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,492
<i>I know, right?</i>

377
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,394
Hey, um...

378
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,329
can I talk to you for a second?

379
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,164
Just, like, upstairs?

380
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,834
Yeah, ok, sure.

381
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,366
Actually, could you close
the door?

382
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:23,881
Are you ok?

383
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,149
You're acting really weird.

384
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,118
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

385
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,254
Um, so I uh...

386
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,592
I don't know how
to say this, really.

387
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:35,626
Um...

388
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,328
Say what?

389
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:43,901
You know that I care
about you a lot, right?

390
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,970
Yeah, of course I do.

391
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,172
What is it?

392
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,340
Ok, here goes.

393
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,642
Um...

394
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:57,682
April, we know each other
inside and out,

395
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:58,849
and the last three years
have been

396
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,419
the best three
years of my life.

397
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,554
I love waking up next to you,

398
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:06,691
and I want to keep waking
up next to you

399
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:09,560
for the rest of my life.

400
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:12,596
So...

401
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,533
What are you doing, Kyle?

402
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:18,836
April, what do you say?

403
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:23,374
You want to keep waking up
next to me, too?

404
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,143
Kyle, are you serious?

405
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,112
Is that a yes?

406
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:32,583
I don't know.

407
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,953
You don't know?

408
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,788
Oh, fuck.

409
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:47,264
You can't leave me
hanging here.

410
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,373
Kyle, I...

411
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,941
I can't.

412
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,310
But why?

413
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:02,012
Fuck, I haven't told you
this yet.

414
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:06,050
I... I didn't want it to be
like this.

415
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,186
I got a job offer in New York.

416
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,154
New York?

417
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,222
Yeah.

418
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:15,159
When does it start?

419
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,262
The middle of May.

420
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:19,714
That's like a month away!

421
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:21,165
When the hell were you
gonna tell me this?

422
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,967
This weekend, but
then you ended up

423
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,236
inviting a bunch of people
over here.

424
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,470
That's right in the middle
of the semester,

425
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:30,741
I can't transfer that quickly.

426
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,412
What, did you not
want me to go with you?

427
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,413
No, Kyle, I didn't say that.

428
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,514
I just...

429
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:37,314
I...

430
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,116
Oh my God.

431
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:43,087
You're breaking up with me.
No, no Kyle, I just...

432
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,522
I don't know if I'm ever
gonna get another opportunity

433
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,857
like this again.

434
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,328
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

435
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,930
I'm such a fucking idiot.

436
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,432
Kyle...

437
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,736
Kyle, don't walk away.

438
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,406
(All): SURPRISE!

439
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,408
Let's get this motherfucking
party start...

440
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,344
Fuck off, Seth.

441
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:10,281
You said no?

442
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,716
Seth!

443
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,721
<i>That is some cold ass shit.</i>

444
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:07,371
Welcome to the gayest
surprise party ever!

445
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,640
Not only did the surprise
completely backfire,

446
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:13,410
but there's no TV, there's no
cell phone service,

447
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:18,482
and I just got the worst news
that my chick is on the rag.

448
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,451
In this corner we have Kyle,

449
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,820
who has just taken a merciless
beating from April

450
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,355
and could be out for the count.

451
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,073
Hey!

452
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,034
Say something for the camera,
champ!

453
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,129
<i>Come here, you fuckin'
dumb dog.</i>

454
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:35,099
<i>Oh yeah, gimme this shit.</i>

455
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:38,569
<i>What are these dirty sluts
up to?</i>

456
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,671
Fuck, I just wish it didn't
have to go down like that.

457
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:41,772
I fucking care about him.

458
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:42,873
Are you filming this?

459
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,275
That is some fucked up shit.

460
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,710
I mean really, who says
no to a guy on one knee?

461
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,811
Seth, fuck off.

462
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,648
I just, I'm trying to understand
the situation.

463
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,482
So am I.

464
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:52,683
Seth.

465
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,653
I thought we were
happy together.

466
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:56,720
I'm Kyle, remember?

467
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,888
We're in it for the long haul.

468
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,623
Where you go, I go.

469
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,325
He fuckin' loves you, April.

470
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:02,092
Enough.

471
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,328
Seth, get the fuck out of here.

472
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,963
I care about you, but...

473
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:06,797
But what?

474
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,831
But what?

475
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,266
I fucking love you
and you love me.

476
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,536
I don't even think I believe in
the concept of marriage, Kyle.

477
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,204
Look how well it turned out
for my parents,

478
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,173
they can't stand each other!

479
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,541
But you are the one for me.

480
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,710
Kyle, that is just something
we are raised to believe

481
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,845
that we're supposed to want, ok?

482
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,247
The one, you know?

483
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,982
Like it's some magical
fucking thing

484
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,550
that is going to complete us
and it's crap!

485
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,585
Are you listening to me?

486
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,353
What are you talking about?

487
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,955
I'm saying that at the end
of the day,

488
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,424
we're all just alone
in the universe.

489
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,860
April, that is the worst
fucking logic...

490
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:37,962
What the fuck is that?

491
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:41,832
[rumbling]

492
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:47,605
[explosion]

493
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:48,906
What the fuck?

494
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:49,840
Holy shit!

495
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,308
What was that?

496
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,409

But not everyone.

There's hundreds of people
still alive up there.

Some of them have been up
there for years.

Maybe even their

in the woods.

We thought it was a plane,
but it was, like,

this disc shaped craft...

902
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:28,424
It took our fucking friend.

That's why we shot at you,
you dumb pig.

Why do you think we boarded
up all the windows?

this load of shit.

the basement,

we'll find us a full-on meth
lab, won't we, you little shit?

We can prove it!

in the house.

into outer space to get probed.

You see? I fucking told you!

You can't be serious.

It's because of this,
isn't it?

980

It's been ten years, Alan.

981
01:01:06,597 --> 01:01:10,282
Now look.

982
01:01:10,283 --> 01:01:13,968
I mean no disrespect, but it
is time to face reality.

983
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:17,005
She left you.

984
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,641
People have been trying
to convince me

985
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:24,079
that she just split town, just
took off with another guy.

986
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:25,180
People have been
saying it so long

987
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,848
I almost believed it myself

988
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,118
but now I know
what happened.

989
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,120
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

990
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:34,923
She would have never done
that to me.

991
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:37,559
We were in love with each other.

992
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:41,063
That night I went to bed
sleeping next to her

993
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:46,735
and I woke up and she was...

994
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:50,639
she was gone.

995
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:56,178
She didn't take any of her
clothes, didn't leave a note.

996
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:00,615
How could she lock the front
door without taking her keys?

997
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:05,320
I don't know, but I think
you need to accept the fact

998
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:07,689
that she ain't never
coming back.

999
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:10,692
If it had been her choice,
Mitchell, then I would.

1000
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:13,628
But I don't think she had one,
she was taken from me!

1001
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,731
Kidnapped, abducted,

1002
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:18,533
but goddammit, what happened
to her is what's happening

1003
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:20,635
to these kids right now!

1004
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:23,271
And we gotta get 'em
outta here.

1005
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,911
Woah, what the hell is that?

1006
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,747
What the hell is that!?

1007
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,281
[muffled]

1008
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:40,722
Oh, shit!

1009
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:42,124
Start the damn car!

1010
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,717
Woah, woah!

1011
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,058
[gunshot]

1012
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:21,029
[cocks gun]

1013
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:26,635
Don't do it!

1014
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:31,173
[gunshot]

1015
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:36,077
[muffled]
Fuck!

1016
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,781
Fuck! Shit! Shit!

1017
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:54,963
Are you ok?

1018
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:57,365
Get me out of this fucking car!

1019
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,867
Get these things off me,
man!

1020
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:01,069
Get 'em off, get 'em off!

1021
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:01,870
What the fuck happened?

1022
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:04,706
Shit!

1023
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,374
They made him do it!

1024
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,677
They got inside his
fucking head,

1025
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:11,880
and they made him blow his own
fucking brains out!

1026
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:13,748
Oh shit.

1027
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,851
Shit, they're gonna take
control of all of us!

1028
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:16,885
Just stay away from me!

1029
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,320
Seth. Calm down, ok?

1030
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:19,754
We can't stay here, ok?

1031
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:22,691
We can't stay here
'cause this shit,
this shit

1032
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:24,860
is not gonna do
anything, alright?

1033
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:27,295
We are gonna die in here.

1034
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:30,198
Give me that cop's gun.

1035
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:30,999
What?

1036
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:34,002
I said give me the fucking gun!

1037
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,871
Shut the fuck up, Melanie.

1038
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,505
Put the fucking gun down.
[punched in the face]

1039
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,474
Oh my God!

1040
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:41,710
I'm the one with the gun,
so you listen to me, ok?

1041
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:44,212
Do you understand that,
tough guy?

1042
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,146
Seth!

1043
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:47,482
Back the fuck off!

1044
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:53,889
Ok everyone, just calm
down, alright?

1045
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:57,325
Ok, just let me think.

1046
01:04:57,327 --> 01:05:00,829
Just let me think.

1047
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:04,032
Those fuckers are not gonna
get inside my head.

1048
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,867
Just give me a second,
alright?

1049
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:09,738
Just, everyone just fucking
calm down.

1050
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,807
These fuckers are not gonna
get inside my head, alright?

1051
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:14,643
So this is what we're gonna do.

1052
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,478
We're gonna make a break for
town, you're coming with me,

1053
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,214
you get up, you're coming
with me.

1054
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:22,817
You stay put, because this
is your fault.

1055
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:23,885
They want you!

1056
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:26,321
So if they want you,
they can fucking have you!

1057
01:05:26,323 --> 01:05:27,756
You're out of your fucking
mind, Seth!

1058
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:29,257
We're not leaving
without her.

1059
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,692
Is that right?

1060
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,193
Is that right?

1061
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:34,629
Well to HELL with you.

1062
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:37,232
You can all stay here and rot.

1063
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:44,139
Have fun on your fucking
honeymoon!

1064
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,107
Oh my God, are you ok?

1065
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:46,942
Yeah.

1066
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:47,944
Yeah?

1067
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,278
I can see why you didn't
want him to come.

1068
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:55,050
[dishware rattling]

1069
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:06,995
You guys?

[bottle breaks]

1071
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,246

What do you want from us?!

1075
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:40,996
Get away from the window!

1076
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:41,998
Oh God.

1077
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:51,072
[painful white noise]

1078
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:59,114
Oh my God.

[thunderous sounds]

1082
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,105
We gotta get to the basement!

1083
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:59,474
[thunderous sounds]

1084
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:00,875
Go, go, go!

1085
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,216
Kyle, let's go!

1086
01:08:12,355 --> 01:08:13,755
Kyle, what're you doing?

1087
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,757
I'm not letting them get
you, babe.

1088
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:17,192
No, Kyle!

1089
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:18,093
Open the fucking door!

1090
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:19,794
No, I'm gonna be ok!

1091
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:22,630
No, Kyle, please
don't do this!

1092
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:23,598
Babe, there's no
other choice.

1093
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,867
I have to, I'm sorry.

1094
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:27,135
You are gonna get
out of here,

1095
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:28,236
and you're gonna survive.

1096
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:29,904
No!

1097
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:32,073
What about you?

1098
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:33,241
I'm full of surprises!

1099

Kyle?

1100
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:40,815
Kyle, No!

[twig snaps]

1120
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:12,006
Who's there?

1121
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:19,013
Who's out there!?

1122
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:24,719
Fuck, who's out there?!

1123
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:25,954
Huh?

1124

[growling]

1125
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:30,158

[gunshots]

1129
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,533
Good luck taking me!

1130
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:40,568
You fuck!

01:11:27,017 --> 01:11:28,583
Fuck!

1137
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:35,223
No!

1138
01:11:35,225 --> 01:11:37,525
Noooo!

1139
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:43,598
No, no, please,
you can't take me!

1140
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,933
You can't...

1141
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:04,719
[rumbling sounds]

1142
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,030
You remember when
we came out here

1143
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:18,933
that summer before
high school started?

1144
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:22,870
Yeah, it was right before
my parents broke up.

1145
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,806
We raided your parents'
liquor cabinet

1146
01:12:24,808 --> 01:12:26,474
and got so drunk.

1147
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:31,079
[laughs]

1148
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:33,114
And your dad took us fishing
the next day

1149
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:38,219
and I threw up all over
the boat.

1150
01:12:38,221 --> 01:12:40,254
[laughs]

1151
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:46,394
And you covered for me,
you said I was just sea sick.

1152
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:49,097
We were only on the lake.

1153
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:57,705
That was the best
summer ever.

1154
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,451
I think I took too many.

1155
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:12,019
No Mel.

1156
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:15,390
No, Mel, why did
you do that?

1157
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:17,392
I'm so sorry.

1158
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:20,428
I'm so sorry.

1159
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:23,131
I don't want to go up there.

1160
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:25,166
I don't want them to take me.

1161
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:27,602
[crying]

1162
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:31,005
No, it's ok.

1163
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:34,475
[crying]

1164
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:37,345
I'm really tired.

1165
01:13:37,347 --> 01:13:41,416
I think I'm gonna close
my eyes for a little while.

1166
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:43,684
No.

1167
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:45,486
