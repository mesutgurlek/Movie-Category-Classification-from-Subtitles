1
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,924
My dad...

2
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,293
My dad is a police officer..

3
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:16,138
He is strong, kind,
and like a superhero.

4
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,279
He helps those who get
lost or lose something.

5
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,246
He works really hard for everyone.

6
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:32,153
I would like to become a
police officer, just like my dad.

7
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,889
Hey.

8
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,213
The criminal is Koji Tanaka, age 29.

9
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,188
Previous convictions for
robbery and abduction.

10
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,058
He's kidnapped and held
a female passer-by captive.

11
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,924
He has barricaded himself
in an abandoned building.

12
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,063
There is no time to
consider the circumstances!

13
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:29,871
Those of you in the riot squad,
don't go easy and please kill him off!

14
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,608
Divine punishment!

15
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,608
Secured!

16
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,878
It's an engineer!

17
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,247
Ruka, it's an engineer!

18
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,319
Tokyo Gore Police

19
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,628

21
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,563
We will protect you.

22
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,036
The crime extra-territoriality
law is our ally.

23
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,746
We have no mercy for criminals.

00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,012
Serial killer Yoshiki Takahashi
Murdered 15 kindergarten children

25
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,682
We will protect you.

27
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,053
Serial killer Yoshiki Takahashi
Dead

28
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,763
Privatizing the police will lead
to more plentiful lives for us.

For a better society
Tokyo Police Corporation

30
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:02,128
Ruka always shows no mercy.

31
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,932
She's definitely a model hunter..

32
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:55,279
There's no mistake. This one
is definitely an engineer..

33
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,753
Within these past few year's...

34
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,121
These so called "engineers,"

35
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,682
criminals who have
remodeled their bodies

36
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,787
to turn into ferocious, fiendish
murderers, have increased in numbers.

37
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,890
An engineer's main characteristic
is that when they're wounded,

38
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:15,498
their wounds become a dangerous weapon.

39
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,700
Also...

40
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,510
a key-shaped tumor is
always found within the body.

41
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:28,386
To kill an engineer, you have to destroy
or sever that piece from the body.

42
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,413
Where did they come from?

43
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,488
What is their objective?

44
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:38,359
The only thing that is clear is
that I have the duty to hunt them.

45
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:42,566
Because I am a police
officer, an "engineer hunter.."

46
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,951
Privatizing the police will lead

53
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,239
Welcome.

54
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,143
What would you like?

55
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,682
Orange juice.

56
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,413
I'm on patrol.

57
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,618
So hard-working.

58
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,128
You're always so serious.

59
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,108
What happened?

60
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,248
You're bleeding.

61
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,052
Are you okay?

62
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,821
Let's go to the hospital.

63
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,218
Let's go!

64
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,824
Let's go!

65
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,451
What are you guys doing?

66
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,863
Stop wandering around!

67
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,329
Don't ever come around here again.

68
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,028
Are you okay?

69
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,643
Mama, are you open?

70
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,842
I'll come back another time.

71
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,182
I'm sorry. I'll leave.

72
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,016
It's okay.

73
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,020
You have a righteous job, right?

74
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,163
Then you should sit here boldly.

75
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:27,991
Ruka, there's trouble!

76
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,500
Come back to the station immediately!

77
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,728
I have to go.

78
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,252

Happy birthday, Ruka!

84
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,777
Happy birthday!

85
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,522
Plus, congratulations on your.
achievement of hunting 50 engineers.

86
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,355
You have acquired a single badge.

87
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,394
Congratulations!

88
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,158
Yeah!

89
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,468
The Shouwa seesaw,

90
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,198
It's a sad conclusion,

91
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,576
If you close your eyes

92
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:04,241
the flower hangs and sways,

93
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,316
The night butterfly,

94
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,288
Palm of the white hand

95
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:20,496
on your chest,

96
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,593
If we decorate it gently...

97
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,298
When my father, a police
officer, died at his post,

98
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,400
the chief of this station
raised me like his own daughter..

99
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:39,207
To me, this place is the same
as a home with a waiting family.

100
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,152
It was supposed to be the same...

101
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,152
But...

102
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,667
I'm home.

103
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,497
I'm home.
Welcome home.

104
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,832
Here, Ruka.

105
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,762
Happy birthday.

106
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,341
Thank you, Dad!

107
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,357
Come on, hurry. You, too.

108
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,500
What are you saying is wrong?

109
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,529
What are you doing?

110
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,364
What are you saying is wrong with me?

111
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,464
It's okay. It's okay, so...

112
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,567
Please! Please, just tell me,
will you?

113
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,200
Let go of me!

114
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,780
What are you saying is wrong with me?

115
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,769
What are you saying is wrong with me?
It's okay.

116
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,872
It's okay.

117
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,149
Don't worry.

118
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,579
It's okay.

119
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,847
It's okay. Calm down.

120
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,304
Did it hurt?

121
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,340
It was so good.

122
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,446
Do you want to do it again?

123
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,153
W-What is it? I didn't.
This was consensual.

124
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,813
Extension fee.

125
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,553
Much appreciated. The next
is also here at 307. Hurry up.

126
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,431
If it goes over, even one
second, it's an extension.

127
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,725
I even made a "10-minutes left" call.

128
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,269
I was using a vibrator, so I
couldn't hear the phone vibrating.

129
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,503
Hurry up and go!

130
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:43,775
I'm sorry.

131
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,311
Come on.

132
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,437
Come on.
You're absolutely right.

133
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,845
That doesn't matter..
Just hurry up and pay!

134
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,956
Thank you for waiting.

135
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,165
Yuka, right? I understand.

136
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:50,108
Then may I have the hotel and the time?

137
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,076
Okay.

138
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,776
Okay, in 30 minutes.

139
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,907
I understand. I will make the girl
head over.. Please treat her well.

140
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,585
Yuka, in 30 minutes, SM play.

141
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,257
Don't be saying you don't
want to do things that hurt.

142
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,030
SM play is good money,
and you know that.

143
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,006
Right, right.

144
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,443
You just have to do it.

145
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,416
You want to do kinky stuff?

146
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,950
There are cuter and
younger girls for that.

147
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,392
How about Yoko?

148
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,270
I can call her right away.

149
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,368
Also, from now on, please
make reservations by phone.

150
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,609
There is a website and
a cell phone site too.

151
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,010
I'm not available.

152
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,452
I'm...

153
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,763
America Yokocho

154
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,730
You. Yes, you. What's up
with these documents?

155
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,359
Commit suicide by seppuku, harakiri!

156
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,926
Yes, I understand.

157
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,331
I'll commit harakiri.

158
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,669
If I was brave enough to
stop the harakiri, then...

159
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,109
If I had the courage to
say I couldn't do it...

160
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,107
If I was able to say my own self
was more important than my job...

161
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,855
Ah, he's done it!

162
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,456
Harakiri is also suicide.

163
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,725
Stop the Harakiri

164
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,175
Heaven's Punishment

165
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,709
Incident occurrence.

166
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,580
Scene of the crime is the
Tokyo subway Miyama station.

167
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:54,844
Again...

168
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,988
Once again, the body of a prostitute
has been discovered.

169
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,187
She was broken, cut into pieces
and packed up into a small box.

170
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,128
There wasn't even a drop of
blood at the scene of the crime,

171
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:08,757
but there was testimony that
they heard a security buzzer,

172
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,030
so the location of discovery and the
crime are thought to be the same.

173
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,613
Engineer?

174
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,183
Yeah.

175
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,684
With the cases so far....

176
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,520
Our point of view is that engineers
are generally simple berserkers

177
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,652
and they usually don't think
of evidence or their safety.

178
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,232
But the criminal this time is
carrying on everything pretty calmly.

179
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,630
It's definitely the same criminal.

180
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,671
Even though he's an engineer, this guy
is definitely trying to pick a fight.

181
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,507
If a newcomer like that has shown up,

182
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,067
it means he's trouble.

183
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,073
Ruka, we're counting on you.

184
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,070
Let's go stylish with wrist-cutting.

185
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,832
It's cute!

186
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,637
The design is cute.

187
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,574
When you cut, it doesn't hurt that much.

188
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,508
The blood becomes tastier..

189
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:08,944
Die!

190
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,987
No, no!

191
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,886
Wrist Cutter. G!

192
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,253
New product!

193
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,390
It's a cutter with a cute design.

194
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,919
It hurts! It hurts!

195
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,717
I-It's a mistake.

196
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,722
Ouch!

197
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,349
It's a mistake!

198
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,084
I-It's a mistake!

199
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,559
It's not me!

200
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,125
You have the wrong person!
I think that's enough!

201
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,531
It's not me...ouch!

202
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,770
Please, it's a mistake!

203
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,537
Ouch!

204
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,835
It really is a mistake!

205
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,604
Please forgive me!

206
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,510
It's a mistake! It really wasn't me!

207
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,180
An act of molestation
is clearIy a crime.

208
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,461
Remember....

209
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,372
Everything...

210
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,581
It cuts well. It cuts well.

211
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,177
The Japanese sword of Kohka.

212
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,088
It cuts well!

213
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,188
It cuts well. It cuts well.

214
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,784
The Japanese sword of Kohka.

215
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,763
It cuts well!

216
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,861
It cuts well. It cuts well.

217
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,457
The Japanese sword of Kohka.

218
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,368
It cuts well!

219
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,747
I thought they stabbed each other..

220
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,459
There isn't any particular.
abnormality in your body.

221
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,260
For now there's evidence.

222
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,662
Once you catch your breath...

223
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,269
...stop by the autopsy room.

224
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,034
Let's go.

225
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,904
From this part of the face,
we didn't find the key.

226
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:27,313
But with this much evidence left, we
should be able to identify it right away.

227
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:34,816
Granted that it's still alive
after losing half of its face...

228
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,723
It's definitely an engineer..

229
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,828
Engineers...

230
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:44,096
We have to kill them by any means.

231
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,433
They are

232
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,632
humanity's new enemy.

233
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,238
Yes, I agree.

234
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,508
Extermination is the only answer..

235
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:56,572
What's wrong?

236
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,442
Are you okay?

237
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,113
You should rest today.

238
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:25,075
Bar lndependant

239
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,872
Akino Miyama.

240
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,878
Died at the age of 24.

241
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,474
It says that he committed suicide.

242
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:40,183
Oh.

243
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,775
His parents also died
before and after that.

244
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,354
This college...

245
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,457
What's the KGE Laboratory?

246
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,559
That's the laboratory this one was at,
but it's not there anymore.

247
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,167
For now, I need the
laboratory's contact address.

248
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,965
There are countless numbers
of them in the whole country.

249
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,410
Please print it out.

250
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,536
Okay.

251
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,310
Thanks.

252
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:51,053
The number that you have
dialed is not in service anymore

253
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:02,622
and has been changed.
The new number is...

254
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,104
I'm sorry, but please check
the number again and redial...

255
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:25,888

I am an able eulogist...

About Megumi's disappearance...

265
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,295
...no one knows,

266
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:31,987
Are your siblings,
family and friends safe?

267
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,191
Are they exposed to
the threat of a madman?

268
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,620
This is not fiction,

269
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,629
For those of you that cried
yourselves to sleep, you can relax now.

270
00:46:58,415 --> 00:46:59,882
Remote execution.

271
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,983
The government is the
ally of the victim.

272
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,613
Government lnformation

273
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:22,731
The volcano erupted, and
the rain of ash poured down.

274
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,935
The snow of death falls and accumulates.

275
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,984
Everything is buried under rubbish.

00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:46,392
Like ruins...

279
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,994
Just like this town of cruelty...

280
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,434

Ah, so tired.

291
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,785
I can't do all-nighters anymore.

292
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,450
Hey!

293
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,284
Is anyone here?

294
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,365
At times like this,
I wish I had speed.

295
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,340
This feels so good.

296
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,941
It soaks into my body.

297
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,913
I wish I had never. been born.

298

You guys...

299
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,646
If you're going to end up like me,

300
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,588
then die while you can!

the light comes on,

305
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:10,954
It's what that child put in,

306
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:18,396
Hanaichimonme,

307
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:25,803
I don't understand words,

308
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:32,608
I cannot hear you,

309
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,384
If you are lonely,

310
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:40,287
you should come eat some tsuruko,

311
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:43,487
If you are lonely,

312
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,153
you should come eat some sushiko,

that child was watching,

00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:03,077
There is a night that you don't know,

I bare your secret,

00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:14,252
Did you forget the gold fish's eyes?

320
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,425
My feelings, do you know them?

321
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,887
