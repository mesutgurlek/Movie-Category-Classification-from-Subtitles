We've got no money for this.

Did the funeral parlor
deliver the package?

Aye. 'Tis on the porch

- Tory, honey,

162
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,380
you really think money's all you
need to get by in this life, huh?

163
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,591
Okay. I'll go with that theory.

(GASPS) Dad! Do you see that spider?

167
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,437
It's huge. That thing could kill us.

168
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,523
Okay, I'm going to turn around and
I'm walking out of this basement,

169
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,192
and I'm going back up to the jeep.

170
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,028
I'm making a reservation at
the nearest hotel in town.

171
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,905
This is worse than summer camp!

172
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,199
I'd rather sleep in a tent!

174

Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Hello? We're breaking up.

175
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,375
Wait. Okay. Okay. That's good.

176
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,627
Okay, hi. I'd like to
make a reservation.

177
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,630
Yes. I'd like it to be a really tall
room, and I want it to be very...

178
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,007
- Ow! Oh!
- Great!

179
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,134
- Who are you?
- Uh...

180
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,388
I was a guy carrying
some paint thinner.

181
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,390
Oh, G... Okay.

182
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,350
Here. Does that cover?

183
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,227
Wait. Hold on a second.

184
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,312
You knock over my can
of paint thinner,

185
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,273
and then you offer me 20 bucks?

186
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,859
Okay. Okay.

187
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,570
How about that? Will that do it?

188
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,239
Uh, no.

189
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,994
But maybe if you said you were
sorry, you know, it might.

190
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,663
Okay. Here. Look, keep the change.
I'm in a really big hurry.

191
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,582
There's a big, ugly, disgusting house
I'd just like to distance myself from.

192
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,543
What, you mean this house here?
The O'Grady place?

193
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,462
Yeah, that place. It's really gross.
There's bugs. There's cobwebs.

194
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,881
God only knows what else is in there.

195

- (LAUGHING)
- What's so funny?

196
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,846
Well, I just think it's
funny the way girls

197
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,931
are always afraid of spiders
and stuff, you know?

198
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, wait a minute.

199
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,355
Did I misplace my 1950s
calendar here? Girls?

200
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,275
Listen, Bud. Okay, this is the '90s.

201

Women are treated equal.

202
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,072
Well, first off, my name
isn't Bud, it's Nathan.

203
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:53,076
And I don't know many guys
that are afraid of houses.

204
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,537
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah.

205
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,039
Well, you know what? Neither am I.

206
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,708
I'm not afraid of anything.

207
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,084
- Okay.
- Right.

208
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,545
- Tory? Honey?
- Yeah?

209
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,921
- What?
- Let's go.

210
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,590
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

211
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,885
I'm not gonna fight you anymore.
The house. You hate the house.

212
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,137
- No...
- It's dirty, it's dusty.

213
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:16,099
You really think I'm afraid of
a little dust and some bugs?

214
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,768
Come on. Just put
the bags back, okay?

215
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,988
I want to stay.

216
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,941
Dad, would you put the bags back?

217
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,036
I'm gonna stay.

00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,293
It came right down out of the sky.

221
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,171
There it was,

222
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,507
this flying saucer.

223
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,551
Had these really weird
lights, you know?

224
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,803
And making all these weird noises.

"boop boop boop boop..."

gonna tell any more stories.

227
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:04,147
This really happened, Alex. It did.

228
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,858
It's like magic, you know? Like...

229
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,778
Like, um...

230
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,240
Well, when you see
a star in the night sky...

- Stop with the magic stuff.

- How you doin', Ozzie?
- Hi.

He used to own this place.

He was really a weird,
strange guy, you know?

I need me gold!

318
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,283
There's a leprechaun in the basement!

319
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,993
Oh, there's a leprechaun
in the basement!

320
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,038
- Hold on. Slow down.
- He come right up out of a box.

321
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,666
He had these long really
scary fingers, and, uh...

322
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,170
He wasn't nice like Lucky Charms or
anything, and then he ate a bug!

323
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,421
A leprechaun?

324
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,341
Can we inject a little bit
of reality in here, please?

325
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,593
I saw him! I really did see him!

326
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,720
He even tried to polish my shoes!

327
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,264
- So, then, where's your pot of gold?
- That's what he said he wanted.

328
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,517
- He said he wanted his pot of gold.
- All right.

329
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,478
Where you going?

330
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,855
Well, if it'll make you
feel any better, Ozzie,

331
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,732
we'll all go down in the
basement and check it out.

332
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,401
Don't go in there, don't go
in there, don't go in there!

333
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:09,822
Hey. Okay? Just in case.

334
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,075
I better go with you.

335
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,285
Just in case.

336
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,120
Uh, Nathan? Nathan?

337
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,873
I don't think that stick's
gonna be big enough.

338
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:23,299
Well, wait. Wait for me.
I'm coming, just in case.

339
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,722
Geez, Ozzie, you really
busted up this crate.

340
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,017
No, no, no. No, I...
I did... I didn't do that.

341
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,437
Uh, that... that was the leprechaun.

342
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,940
Leprechaun.

343
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,445
Well, I don't see anything, Ozzie.

344
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:55,076
But... this guy was real.

345
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,578
I mean, he had buckles on his shoes,

346
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,748
and he had them real horrible teeth,

347
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,584
and they were all rotten and
everything, and... and, uh...

348
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,089
Oh, I... I know he
never does brush 'em.

349
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,384
- (CLATTERING)
- Th-That's him.

350
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,354
He's gonna kill every one
of us, and I'm first.

351
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,156
- Ozzie, come here.
- I ain't goin' in that dark corner.

352
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,455
Neither am I.

353
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,537
- (CLATTER)
- What was that?

354
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,040
Hey, hang on. Hang on.

355
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:59,057
- (BOTH GASP)
- ALEX: It's only a rat.

356
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,727
It's just a rat. (LAUGHS)

357
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,021
Well, Ozzie, I think we
found your leprechaun.

358
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,398
- (SIGHS)
- No, no, no.

359
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,277
Y-You don't understand. He...
He was bigger than that.

360
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,529
All right, all right. I think
we've solved this mystery now.

361
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,283
Can we just get out of here?

362
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,258
- Hey! Hey, look up in the sky!
- So what, Ozzie?

363
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,013
- It's just a rainbow.
- It's a magic rainbow.

364
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,766
Leprechauns and rainbows.
It's a sign.

365
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,852
Yeah. Yeah, it's a sign, all right.
It's time to get back to painting.

366
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,938
- Come on.
- No, no, no. No.

367
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,940
We gotta go... go see
what's at the end.

368
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,234
Ozzie, you're embarrassing me.

369
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,903
Come on. Go with me.

370
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,822
We... We gotta get to
the end of the rainbow.

371
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,199
- There's always a pot of gold!
- NATHAN: Ozzie.

372
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,159
He's so easily sidetracked.

373
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,578
Like always, I'll take care of it
and get him back on the job.

374
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,998
Ozzie, come on! Alex!

375
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,084
Oh, come on. Let 'em
go chase rainbows.

376
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,836
Let's you and I go paint.

377
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,806
Um, this is biodegradable, right?

378
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,803
Ozzie, this is stupid! You can't
find the end of the rainbow!

379
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,648
Uh-oh.

380
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,518
It's where the rainbow ends.

381
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,436
ALEX: It does sort of
look like where it ends.

382
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,565
OZZIE: Hey, look. It's going away.

383
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:38,156
Don't cut yourself on any
of this rusty old metal.

384
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:42,287
If you do, it'll make
your jaw lock shut.

385
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,746
This is neat. Hey,
Ozzie, I got an idea.

386
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,623
- What?
- Let's hotwire this.

387
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,798
I don't think the battery
would be any good.

388
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,754
(SIGHS)

389
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,965
Ooh.

390
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,259
Look at that.

391
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,386
- Ooh!
- Give me it!

392
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,762
- No, no, no.
- Give me it!

393
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,182
- Just let me look at it for a minute!
- Give me it!

394
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,482
I'll give it right back to you,
I promise. I promise.

395
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,649
- Give me that.
- Hey!

396
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,112
ALEX: Wow! Look at that!

397
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,906
All right, here's your coin.

398
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,751
I found a bag full of 'em!

399
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,994
- Wow!
- Cool!

400
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,164
I told you. I told you! Uh-oh.

401
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,416
It's what that leprechaun
was talking about.

402
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,628
Will you stop with that
stupid leprechaun stuff?

403
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,298
We found this gold. Finders keepers.

404
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,551
I just hope it's real.

405
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,803
I know how to tell if it's real.
You just bite on it.

406
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,597
I seen it in a movie.

407
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,265
(GRUNTS)

408
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,101
(GULPS)

409
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,146
Oh, my God.
I swallowed that gold coin.

410
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,320
Nice going, Jaws.

411
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,236
Hey, hey, hey, can you die
from swallowing gold?

412
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,321
Yeah, after I kill you!

413
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,157
Now, you just let me
take charge, okay?

414
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,909
I'm just gonna keep one,

415
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,120
and then I can get it checked out
in town and see if it's real or not.

416
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,457
We're gonna hide the rest.
We can't tell anyone about this.

417
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,460
Right, right. Why?

418
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:18,172
'Cause you know how adults are,
especially when it comes to money.

419
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,675
They'll just try to take it away.

420
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,886
I got the perfect place to hide it...

421
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,555
the old well beside the house.

422
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,900
Hey, Ozzie, do you
know what this means?

423
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:34,272
We're rich, and... and I
can buy comics every week.

424
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:38,818
- Yeah, but you know what else?
- What else?

425
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,362
We can get you an operation.

426
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,990
- For what?
- To make you smart.

427
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,075
See, we can go to the hospital

428
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,536
and have them operate
and fix your brain.

429
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,456
But... But I-I'm smart.

430
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,918
Yeah, well, sort of.

431
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,254
What I mean is,
we could make you real smart.

432
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,474
That way, people won't
make fun of you.

433
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,635
- They make fun of me?
- Not in front of you.

434
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:09,232
Only behind your back.
Come on. Let's go the well.

435
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,115
Come on!

436
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,788
Um, wait. Here, start in the corners.

437
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,793
Nice, even strokes.

438
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:40,046
Wow. That's it.

439
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,798
- You got it.
- Not bad, huh?

440
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,722
Yeah, yeah. A regular Picasso.

441
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,013
Put me out of business.

442
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,307
- Oh, need another can of paint.
- Oh, okay.

443
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,726
Well, you just watch how
a pro gets a can of paint.

444
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:57,276
All right. Let me get a rag first,
all right? Go ahead.

445
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,333
Ah...

446
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,331
Oh...

447
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,338
Nathan.

448
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,342
Nathan, come on. What are you doing?

449
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,430
Oh, my God.

450
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,934
(SCREAMS) Oh, what was that?

451
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,186
Oh, geez.

452
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,480
Honey, are you okay?
I heard you scream.

453
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,024
I thought that was
you rubbing my leg.

454
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,485
- And you let me?
- That's not the point.

455
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,445
Something was rubbing my leg,

456
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,657
like caressing it,
and it ran off over there.

457
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,992
J.D.: It's probably just
an old possum, honey.

458
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,828
No, Dad, that was
not an animal, okay?

459
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,747
I know what it feels like
when a man caresses my leg.

460
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,165
You do?

461
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,209
Look, we gotta get
these cuts cleaned up.

462
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,586
Yeah, I should probably go
look for that animal, huh?

463
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,005
- Absolutely.
- Wait. Why?

464
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,508
- Might have rabies.
- Great.

465
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,636
(CAT MEOWS)

466
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,098
- (CAT MEOWS)
- It was a cat.

467
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,892
I think we found your
secret admirer, honey.

468
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,987
- (CAT MEOWING)
- It wasn't a cat.

469
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,023
Sounds hurt. Come on,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

470
