CONSTANTINE 01x01 - Pilot

English subtitles: Praveen Nautie (Nautie)

9
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:09,831
You witnessed the murder of a girl. 
Talking will help you to understand that it is not your fault.

10
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:12,349
That would be a beauty. Let's just get this part.

11
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,296
Start telling me what happened that night in Newcastle.

12
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:19,180
- Do you remember the killer? - I see that devil every time I close my eyes.

13
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:23,916
- With "demon" you mean "killer". - With 'devil' I mean <i> demon </ i>, shit.

14
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,303
Disgusting creature. It smells like a butcher.

15
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:32,835
Look what happens, John. You feel guilty for failing to protect the girl, then ...

16
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:35,865
You make killer in this incarnation of evil.

17
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:38,335
We are all powerless against demons.

18
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,476
- Not all, boss. - Ah, yes ...

19
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:48,524
Before interning here three months ago, you worked as an exorcist, demonologist ...

20
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,634
- "Master of the Occult Arts"? - It says master, right?

21
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:56,998
I should switch to "amateur paltry". I hate to brag.

22
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:01,451
- Well, you did not stop the girl's death. - "Astra".

23
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:06,213
Her name was Astra.

24
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:10,677
Do not care about his death. It is his conviction that drives me to despair.

25
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:13,013
- Dragged to Hell ... - John, it's time to face the truth.

26
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:15,278
Nine years, suffering for eternity.

27
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,697
- Only those who suffer here is you. - It's my fault, man.

28
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:21,000
- There are no demons. - You already said!

29
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:24,764
Now make me believe it.

30
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,753
That's what I paid you, is not it?

31
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:36,275
I want to be able to stop to do my rituals.

32
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:39,923
If I make a cup of tea I move nine times.

33
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:44,989
Here I am nine minutes to drink, so I sit for nine minutes.

34
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:48,991
Everything always in multiples of nine, you know?

35
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:50,992
But today ...

36
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:57,576
Today I stopped doing the ritual, and nothing horrible happened.

37
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:59,523
Only Mexican tea once.

38
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:35,795
Girl? Whatever you are painting here, better stop now.

39
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,103
Girl?

40
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:46,057
No. No, no, no ...

41
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:48,360
That's not my problem.

42
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:53,817
Shit ...

43
00:03:55,506 --> 00:04:00,030
I turn to the entity inside. Who are you? Say your name.

44
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,415
Listen to me!

45
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,586
In the name of the Creator, I command you to leave this place!

46
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:14,057

- What does it mean? - What I've been wasting my time here.

54
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,339
I have work to do.

55

She who did this.

Who has a better future: me, or the girl above, the cafeteria?

57

- The girl above. - What?

58
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,952

Stay away. Go back ... Stop! Do not approach.

It is easier to ignore than to face the danger, but make no mistake:

80
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:04,737
If you do not listen to me, will be dead by morning.

- What brings you back to the streets, John? - The girl, of course.

90
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:09,466
- An old friend asked me to protect her. - Must be a dead friend.

91
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:12,635
He made the request after owning a body, but could my attention.

92

- Who are you? - You can call me Manny.

93

- I was told to take care of you. - "Take care of me"?

94
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:24,233
No offense, sir, I do not want angels on my ass. That would spoil my reputation.

- Hospice too. - Is it? Have I left. I'm great.

- Bate wings here. - You're not fine, John.

98

You ordered a girl to Hell. Along with your soul.

Now, I can not change your destiny, but can reduce their suffering.

100

- It will take advantage of the defeat of another will. - Their is estraordinária!

Do not worry about me, mate. I can handle an attack of the devil.

102
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:02,006
I'm not so sure. You spent time out of the game.

103
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:06,601
It has a lot of panic here. People feel what's coming.

104
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,641
And what is coming?

105
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,329

It looked like a rapist.

123
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:02,874
You always go to the police?

124
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:07,534
My friend was killed last night.

125
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,247
Sorry about that.

126
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,264
I found on my door. What is it?

127
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:20,487
The Eye of Horus. 
Egyptian symbol of protection, so they say.

128
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:24,342
There was a man in the hallway 
yesterday. I think he killed Talia.

129
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:30,763
Liv, meet Chas. My oldest friend.

130
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,098
He who has the symbol, which kept you alive.

131
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:37,177
- I'm glad you're okay. 
- He does not talk much.

132
00:15:37,446 --> 00:15:39,285
Now, to business.

133
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,797
If we do not get you to a safe place, 
the bodies will keep appearing.

134
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:45,292
Why would anyone want to kill me? I am a nobody.

135
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:48,074
I hate to end your happiness but you is not nobody.

136
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:53,029
I met his father, Jasper Winters. 
I promised him I would take care of you.

137
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,016
This is not possible. 
My father died before I was born.

138
00:15:57,454 --> 00:16:02,071
Who told you that was lying. 
Jasper died last year.

139
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:05,845
He was a good man.

140
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,235
So there you go.

141
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:14,020
Abra. Belonged to him. He wanted you to have this.

142
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:31,232
- Everybody out! Chas, take them here. 
- Come out!

143
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,984
That was my table. 
I should be sitting here.

144
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:37,670
Who is behind you can track you,
 feel your energy.

145
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:40,077
Will not give up until you are dead.

146
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:50,436
- Oh my God! Talia ...?

147
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,378
- She's alive! - Is not. Something is using it.

148
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,320
It's all wrong. They never act so openly.

149
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,678
Who are you? Who sent you?

150
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:13,512
- Liv? - Gone.

151
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,272
Wonder.

152
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:23,482
Mother, look into my eyes and say it again: when my father died?

153
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm not ready for that conversation.

154
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:31,382
You deprived me of it my whole life. 
I do not care if you do not want to talk now.

155
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,649
- Who was he? 
- He was just a guy.

156
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,843
I met him at a show. 
He did not want to see you after you were born.

157
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:42,360
And God knows that his grandmother
 - God rest her 
- did not encourage it.

158
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:47,151
- A friend of his found me. 
- Do not know how, Jasper did not know where we lived.

159
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:51,176
The man I met said it was his. 
Have you seen this before?

160
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:58,208
Liv ...? What?

161
00:17:58,422 --> 00:17:59,964
Grandma ...

162
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:07,307
Liv! Dear! What happened?

163
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:16,966
- What is happening to me? 
- Are you waking up. Seeing the world as it is.

164
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:19,548
- As your father. 
- That means what?

165
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:24,983
Holy impatience! The disease of the twenty-first century.

166
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,189
Where's the necklace?

167
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:31,762
Look around.

168
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:58,144
- What are they? - Souls. Trapped, looking for an exit.

169
00:18:58,251 --> 00:19:00,885
- You see them? - No.

170
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,232
What else do you see?

171
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:12,884
- There's a train coming. - It is?

172
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:19,486
What r u doing? Comes a train! Let me go!

173
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:22,017
What you 'doin? The train is coming!

174
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:27,825
We have to go off the rails! Let me go, let me go!

175
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:47,166
- What happened? - A ghost train.

176
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,867
The more involved the dead, but are vivid visions.

177
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:53,079
- All this is impossible. 
- Deny will not make it go away.

178
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,831
- How can I see these things? 
- Sounds like you have the gift of his father.

179
00:19:56,832 --> 00:20:00,808
When you touch the pendant, 
you concentrate your skill and see what he saw.

180
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:05,073
There are worlds beyond our own. Plans of parallel existence.

181
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:09,962
Entities between us ... Jasper could see it all.

182
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:13,263
He tried to teach me, but ...

183
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:18,053
- I had no talent. - You said you were coming.

184
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:22,141
We can talk later. Now, we are the prey.

185
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:24,164
Leave your car for your mother, you come with us.

186
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:40,147
John would tell me about Jasper. I want to know how he died.

187
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:42,867
In Ragley.

188
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,853
- Were you there? - Enough.

189
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:49,455
Just thought what's behind me might want revenge for something that my father did.

190
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,827
I do not care why.

191
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:56,108
I just want to send it back and pay off my debt to his father.

192
00:20:56,844 --> 00:21:00,975
- Turn it off. - I can not.

193
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:08,460
Chas!

194
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:18,533
- John ...? - Astra?

195
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:23,301
Who is following me? Does it go away! Please!

196
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,008
Come here, I'll protect you.

197
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:31,555
- You will not catch her! 
- You can not save her ...

198
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:35,519
- Do not go! You will not get it! - John! Get me out of here!

199
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,420
- No. ..! - John!

200
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,848
John, get us out of here! Help us!

201
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:52,846
John helps us! My foot is stuck!

202
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:57,061
- Do something, please! - Okay, calm down!

203
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:16,920
The Santa Cruz commands you! 
The Star of David commands you!

204
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:21,852
The Lord commands you: Get out of this place!

205
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:26,202
Exit this place <i> Dispersum in Ventum </ i> (If disperse with the wind!)

206
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:29,116
Disappear now!

207
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,320
I think I caught him. Come forth, Chas!

208
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:36,994
The Lord commands you. The Lord commands you.

209
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:39,966
The Lord commands you!

210
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:46,024
Chas, beware!

211
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:48,587
- No. ..! - Do not!

212
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:56,522
There are millions of demons. 
We have to figure out which one you want dead.

213
00:22:56,523 --> 00:23:01,269
- Do not worry, you're safe here. 
- 'You're kidding! After what happened to Chas?

214
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,867
Things are not what they seem, love. If you want to get out of this alive, need to understand.

215
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:09,302
I do not understand half of what he says! You say something clararamente?

216
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:13,171
This house belonged to his father. If that day came ...

217
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:19,224
I promised I would put those keys in your hands.

218
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,442
Clear enough for you?

219
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:28,079
Jasper said I should take care of you. He had to keep away ...

220
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,573
- For your safety, naturally. - There is nothing natural about it.

221
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:47,221
This is crazy! Can you survive an apocalypse down here.

222
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:51,279
It is, or start one. Jasper used this place for divination.

223
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:56,730
Nobody found trouble faster than his father. Literally.

224
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:04,919
Put it there, love, before he "lower" you.

225
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:21,498
This looks like a map of Atlanta. What are these places?

226
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:25,029
- "Cascade of Illusions"? - Jasper called "mapping".

227
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,790
He started drawing the map itself, with things he saw.

228
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:32,059
- You said he thought trouble? - Divination with Crystals.

229
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,335
Place the pendant over a map for you to see.

230
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,502
Ah, here it is!

231
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:41,555
I thought the demon that is hunting you. Goes by the name Furcifer.

232
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:45,260
That bastard angel was right. The stakes are rising.

233
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:47,603
- What angel? - Nevertheless, Keep your eyes on the map.

234
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:50,465
Furcifer draws its power from electricity.

235
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:53,774
Can manifest in lightning and storms.

236
00:24:54,966 --> 00:24:59,058
In addition to controlling power lines, and ... dead bodies.

237
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,644
I still do not understand why.

238
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:04,175
You are a threat to the darkness that is rising.

239
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:06,942
Now you can see these things, they can see you.

240
00:25:06,943 --> 00:25:09,541
Most of them do not like to be seen.

241
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:13,011
Eleminar you are a precaution.

242
00:25:15,654 --> 00:25:19,086
- Ouch! - Secure! Let the blood drip.

243
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,056
- My god, what is this? - What you asked: trouble.

244
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,874
What blood showed?

245
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:35,606
Edgewood Avenue. And then have something bad going on there?

246
00:25:35,607 --> 00:25:38,333
Will happen. It is day now.

247
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:41,668
Most things that its powers located hunts at night.

248
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:45,001
- We should tell someone. - Not exactly have a service for this, right?

249
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:50,239
- We have to do something. - We're making. Keeping you alive.

250
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:54,438
I have an idea to end what is attacking you, but ...

251
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:59,623
- Means to use you as bait. - Why do you feel now 'doin' that?

252
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:04,361
I have a contact at the University of Ivy that can help. Just be quiet until I get back.

253
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:08,475
<i> University of Ivy </ i>

254
00:26:13,302 --> 00:26:15,481
Can I help you, sir?

255
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:24,156
You know, there's a line between tênua take charge and pursue.

256
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:28,093
I was right, right? Crazy down here.

257
00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:31,475
Can you open the door, please? My time is precious.

258
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:57,781
That's new.

259
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:10,364
- He discovered that the girl is hunting? - A demon elite.

260
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:11,813
Oh really ...?

261
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,709
And you think something can come here without much help?

262
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,576
Sounds like you want me to find out some information.

263
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,692
- I want to. - How come?

264
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:25,900
We're here from the beginning, John. Beginning of time.

265
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:29,591
We were put here to guide the evolution of the human spirit.

266
00:27:29,592 --> 00:27:34,149
An invisible hand on his shoulder a whisper in the wind ...

267
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:39,233
- Not the most efficient way. - You want to do everything with their own hands.

268
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,374
Escorradio way, friend.

269
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:47,091
- That's what the First of the Fallen did. - For different purposes.

270
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:49,829
Listen. If you find out what we are facing,

271
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:52,754
I will use this information to save lives.

272
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:58,292
And my life? You condemned me to Hell.

273
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:04,082
Why should I risk my last days on Earth ...

274
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:09,446
Why, indeed? You are a sideshow.

275
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:12,078
- A vendedorzinho cheap magic. - Whoa there ...

276
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,568
Your decisions are questionable and without any conscience.

277
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,845
Why should you risk your spare time?

278
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,466
Because you are doomed to Hell.

279
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,539
At least so far.

280
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:39,710
Are you suggesting that it is not too late to save my soul?

281
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:46,327
All right, sir?

282
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:49,007
No.

283
00:28:49,882 --> 00:28:52,137
Not a bit.

If I tell you, will you leave?

Right. Yes, yes, I have seen a lot of unexplained femômenos.

Never.

I need your help, Simpson. Can you hack a network of energy?

Yes, I can do it, and I step. Thank you very much.

Whatever happened with that girl ... And you know what?

301

I do not go a day without sleeping pills, pain medication.

- All learned the lesson. - We learn. And my lesson?

304
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:47,888
My lesson was painful to do everything to get away from you.

You know, the cops Newcastle still looking for the man who killed Astra.

It should have been you, John.

00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:24,889
Santa ...?

313
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,595
- Do not cry, I brought food. - I saw a man in the mirror in the fireplace.

314
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:37,016
- Yep ..? - Jasper? Seems so.

315
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:40,240
- His ghost? - No.

316
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:43,729
The weather is confused in that mirror. You watched the past.

317
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,387
You will find so many dangerous things in this place.

318
00:32:46,388 --> 00:32:48,580
Here, brought clothes for you.

319
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,401
- How did you get into my apartment? - Liv?

320
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:57,490
- I'm fine. Sorry to scare you. - But you ...

321
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:02,149
- You died. - Not exactly, it's ... complicated.

322
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,353
Has a reason to be Chas my oldest friend.

323
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:06,806
It has ability to survive.

324
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:09,294
No, no one can survive what I saw.

325
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:13,002
Excellent. If you're not confused, you are not paying attention.

326
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:17,855
Now, his famous grilled lamb. Do not face the demons on an empty stomach.

327
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:22,601
- Wait, go after him tonight? - "Live the present," is what I say.

328
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,574
Three hundred, four hundred ... five hundred dollars.

329
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:32,933
Only to have sex on the roof?

330
00:33:32,934 --> 00:33:36,629
- Come on! - She ''re on fire, huh.

331
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,157
One more detail worth a hundred dollars.

332
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:45,953
Keep your hand. If you delete, you call me.

333
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,485
- Do not want to get into any of that. - Neither do I, friend.

334
00:33:51,642 --> 00:33:56,971
Just keep an eye out and call me. You have my cell number.

335
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:05,542
- What is it? - Demonic Seal.

336
00:34:09,474 --> 00:34:11,414
You found on the internet?

337
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:15,587
No, this is patented.

338
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:19,502
The Triangle of Solomon, with some ancient runes and Enochian alphabet.

339
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:22,557
When it arrives, you have to enter the circle.

340
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:26,107
The label will handle it, and I can send him to hell.

341
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:27,953
This should work.

342
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:32,764
It's time. Enter the circle.

343
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:40,936
No, no! It's my highest score.

344
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:50,783
- Where are you from, John? - The passion of my parents.

345
00:34:51,551 --> 00:34:54,212
- You do that a lot. - Do what?

346
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:56,549
- Hides emotions with humor. - I do, is it?

347
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:59,773
A strange mood, which makes me wonder if you're a sociopath.

348
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:04,617
Sorry if I do not drown in my feelings, I believe in repressing the past.

349
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:07,291
- What matters is where we are. - Do not believe it.

350
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:10,968
You risked your life to convince me that my past is important.

351
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:14,002
Come on, John, I'm trusting you with my life.

352
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:18,438
The least you can do is to share some personal detail.

353
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:21,503
My mother died at my birth.

354
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:25,003
It is a great detail.

355
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:28,086
My father said it was my fault.

356
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:34,105
He had a nickname for me, I heard all night.

357
00:35:34,256 --> 00:35:36,256
"Hello, killer!"

358
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:41,407
And every night since then he gave me a punch in the head and said:

359
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:45,046
"This is for what you did with your mother, murderer".

360
00:35:45,716 --> 00:35:51,521
- You imagine how his mother was? - There's no point imagining. I'll find it.

361
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:55,587
As a teenager, I started reading every book he could find on the occult.

362
00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:00,859
I learned spells, rituals, curses ... I learned to rely on dead things.

363
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:03,123
But her.

364
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:08,406
Not yet.

365
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:12,269
If you can summon people, may invoke my father?

366
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:14,534
You would not like the outcome.

367
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,358
Prepare yourself.

368
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:27,058
- I told you to call me. - Do not you wanna stay here.

369
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,006
Oh, he wants to, yes.

370
00:36:30,382 --> 00:36:32,277
Not the guard.

371
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:39,881
Stay there, Liv.

372
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:44,759
You killed that good man. I should have foreseen this.

373
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,138
You want it, boss? Come and get it.

374
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,093
If you insist ...

375
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:09,805
<i> Hic incipit of existing world ... </ i>

376
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:12,745
<i> In nomine Dei udders ... From hoc existing world ... </ i>

377
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:14,460
<i> In nomine Dei udders ... </ i>

378
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:17,727
Nergal said in its ritual power lack of intent.

379
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:23,058
Liv, run!

380
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,532
John!

381
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:30,322
Thought he could ambush me? That could use electricity?

382
00:37:30,622 --> 00:37:32,802
Night ...

383
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:43,377
In this place I am a God.

384
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:45,131
That reminds me.

385
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:46,974
I almost forgot.

386
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,134
Hope it works, John ...

387
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:11,381
- What happened? - "Power of intention."

388
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,820
Let me out, John. I release the soul of the Astra.

389
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:36,693
As if you could ...

390
00:38:40,674 --> 00:38:43,335
John, are you?

391
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:45,573
- Astra ...? - John!

392
00:38:49,005 --> 00:38:52,710
I wanna go home ... take me home!

393
00:38:56,011 --> 00:39:00,901
Release me, and her soul will be free.

394
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:08,917
John, I'm afraid!

395
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,526
<i> Ethera me ... </ i>

396
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,528
<i> Aperi Circulum ... </ i>

397
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:22,433
<i> potest berius evicte ... </ i>

398
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,728
Stop John, is not the Astra. Not her.

399
00:39:30,526 --> 00:39:32,775
I'm afraid ...

400
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:42,161
Think you can control my life? I got news for you, pal!

401
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:48,168
I'm behind the Astra. I go after Nergal.

402
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:51,909
Can pass it on, in Hell.

403
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:54,866
<i> In Christo cuam ignis ... </ i>

404
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:56,976
Ex hoc <i> that this ... </ i>

405
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,095
John!

406
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,540
<i> Et testo, solid ex facto </ i>

407
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:03,504
<i> ... Ex Constantine </ i>

408
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:23,412
You 'okay?

409
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:27,941
Have a friend down there will take you home.

410
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:35,783
Go!

411
00:40:44,013 --> 00:40:45,629
Who is Astra?

412
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:50,355
She was the daughter of a friend of ours in Newcastle, England.

413
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:55,468
Was possessed by a demon. John made his way ...

414
00:40:55,857 --> 00:40:58,991
Invoked an even more powerful demon.

415
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:02,337
- Nergal? - He said he would ...

416
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,774
Order him to take away the lowest demon.

417
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:08,976
- But he was led Astra? - It's ...

418
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:12,586
After ripping it to pieces in front of us.

419
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:18,021
Look, even John believes he has everything under control.

420
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:22,679
Do you believe that. It's the "magic" of it.

421
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:25,501
But also his curse.

422
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,808
If I were you, I'd stay away from him, Liv.

423
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:33,468
I can not tell you that, but he wanted his father had said.

424
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,414
This is the Edgewood Avenue.

425
00:41:37,777 --> 00:41:41,378
John told me to use the crystal that avenue today and appeared on the map.

426
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,524
Stop, stop the car.

427
00:41:49,391 --> 00:41:54,813
Let me go, let me go! What ...?

428
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:59,068
Who would ... Who would ...?

429
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:02,552
Who would do that to a kid ...?

430
00:42:11,785 --> 00:42:16,146
A teenager was killed tonight. On Edgewood Avenue.

431
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,731
We knew something was going to happen and I could not stop!

432
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:20,991
Forget this philosophy, that will leave you crazy.

433
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:22,946
Or we can save innocent lives!

434
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:26,756
I have to find out if anyone else is having problems.

435
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:29,871
I went to the library, I used the guessing game with the crystal and look:

436
00:42:29,872 --> 00:42:31,997
It is happening everywhere!

437
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:36,088
Accept advice: go back to the rental car, living in a hole hobbit.

438
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:38,444
- It will keep you safe. - I do not care to be sure!

439
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:45,678
Not with people dying! I need to find these people and prevent, as my father. But ...

440
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,004
- I can not do this alone. - You're sniffing the wrong post.

441
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:52,663
I paid my debt to your father, you're alive.

442
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:54,819
If you will not do for them, make the Astra.

443
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,327
- Write her loss worthwhile. - I'll think about it.

444
00:43:06,882 --> 00:43:08,406
Thanks, buddy.

445
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,838
Congratulations. You made her believe that it was all her idea.

446
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:19,062
Easy. Was difficult to convince Richie to divert ten blocks up the avenue.

447
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,926
- Why did not you help her? - She does not trust me.

448
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:24,571
It had to be her idea.

449
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:28,748
A pity. That man in Edgewood Avenia lost his life.

450
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:32,760
"Sorrow" is what I face every day.

451
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:36,487
Liv and the boy would die tonight.

452
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,710
I could only save one.

453
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:42,131
So ... you're going to hell ...

454
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,227
You will find that kind of strength we are facing.

455
00:43:45,228 --> 00:43:48,268
- It's what you wanted, right? - I have to ask ...

456
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:53,656
You are doing it to save lives ... Or save your miserable soul?

457
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:58,484
It's a trick question. I will not answer.

458
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,339
Pays the bill? I owe the bastard ''re ignoring me.

459
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,081
<i> My name is John Constantine. </ i>

460
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:26,055
<i> I am the one who comes out of the shadows, wearing an overcoat and arrogance. </ i>

461
