1
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
Pass it to me!

2
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,500
Hit it!

3
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,200
Yes! Yes!

4
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,000
Jack, I just wanted to say that
she's not doing too well right now.

5
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,000
Her condition has gotten a lot worse.
I've given her something for the pain.

6
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,100
Mark?

7
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,200
Hi, sweetie.

8
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Hi, Mom.

9
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,500
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I thought you should sleep.

10
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,700
Rather see you.

11
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,000
- Has Dad told you everything?
- Yeah.

12
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,000
I know you'll be OK.

13
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,100
Mom...

14
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,600
I'll always be with you, Mark.

15
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,000
Always.

16
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,800
I love you.

17
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,000
I love you too, Mom.

18
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,600
You're not gonna die, Mom.

19
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,800
I promise.

20
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,000
You're not gonna die cos I won't let you.

21
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,200
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

22
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,700
The Lord bless her and keep her.

23
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,100
The Lord make his face to shine
upon her and be gracious to her.

24
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,600
The Lord lift up his countenance upon her
and give her peace. Amen.

25
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
I can't leave him.

26
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,800
- He needs me.
- It's two weeks, Jack.

27
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
I can't do it.

28
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,100
It's not like you'll be
leaving him with strangers.

29
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,500
- I'm your brother. We're family.
- Mm-hm.

30
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,300
You said, if you could close this deal
in Tokyo, you and Mark would be set.

31
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,700
- You'd never have to leave him again.
- I only want what's best for him.

32
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,500
I know this is tough,
but this is your chance, Jack.

33
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,300
You have to take it, for you and for Mark.

34
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,000
Besides, it'll do him good
to be around other kids right now.

35
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,900
I'll bring him to Maine myself.

36
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,400
We need to spend some time together.

37
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,500
Hey, you. Copilot.

38
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,600
If you ever get tired
of bombing the universe...

39
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,900
...you're missing
a lot of great stuff out here.

40
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Mark, I know you're hurting...
but please don't shut me out like this.

41
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,900
- She's coming back.
- No, Mark.

42
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,000
Maybe not as herself,
but she's gonna come back.

43
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Mark, I miss her, too.

44
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,600
But she's gone.

45
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,800
No.

46
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Mark.

47
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Mark!

48
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,000
They're here!

49
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
- You made it.
- Oh, man. Eleven states in three days.

50
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,100
- Connie, say hello to your Uncle Jack.
- Hello, Uncle Jack.

51
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,600
- She's beautiful, Wallace.
- Like her mom.

52
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,000
- How's it goin', Mark?
- Pretty good.

53
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,000
- Mom said I can show you the house.
- She always gets her way.

54
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,500
Things are gonna be OK, Jack.

55
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
Mom! Guess who's here!

56
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,100
- Mark?
- Hi.

57
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,200
Oh, my gosh. Look at you!

58
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,500
I can't believe it's been ten years.

59
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,300
Jack.

60
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,000
Hi. I really appreciate
everything you're doing.

61
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,100
Janice would have done the same.

62
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Henry. Come on down here.

63
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Hospitality, Henry.

64
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,400
Here. I made two of 'em,
so we could be brothers.

65
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Oh, well,
as if one wasn't enough.

66
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,300
OK. You know, I spoke with
Alice Davenport this morning.

67
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
She's the therapist who works
with Wallace at the hospital.

68
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,900
She said she'd be glad
to talk with Mark while you're gone.

69
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,300
I think it's a good idea.
I can't seem to reach him.

70
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,000
Does everyone have everything they need?

71
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,700
Sure, Mom.

72
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
This is really beautiful.

73
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,600
- Do you want some salad, Jack?
- Please.

74
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,400
You know they
tore down the lighthouse?

75
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, no. That one on the point?
I loved that old place.

76
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,200
Yeah, so did we.

77
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,400
- Isn't that where you two first, uh...
- First what?

78
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:51,200
It's, um... where your father
and I... had our first picnic.

79
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,300
- No, that's not gonna do it.
- Hey, here we go.

80
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,700
Now you have to get the insides out.
That's where this comes in.

81
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Like that.

82
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,900
Henry, please!

83
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,800
OK, wait, wait, wait.

84
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,800
Jack. I think he's gonna be fine.

85
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,500
Yeah.

86
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,400
Mark, you understand, don't you?

87
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,600
I'm leaving you now so I...
so I never have to leave you again.

88
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,900
Two weeks, could be less.

89
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,000
So cheer up!

90
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,200
It's winter break. All you have to do is
play with Henry and you have a great time.

91
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,300
I love you, Dad.

92
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,500
I love you, too.

93
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,900
We'll be together real soon.

94
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,400
I promise.

95
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Give me a kiss.

96
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,600
I love you.

97
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,200
Bye, Dad.

98
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Grenade!

99
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

100
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,900
Not so fast. How about some breakfast?

101
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,500
- Did you sleep OK last night?
- Yeah.

102
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,500
Yeah? Henry didn't keep you
up all night talking?

103
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,700
- No. It was fine.
- Good.

104
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,800
We're really glad you're here, Mark.

105
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,000
Hey, Mark! Come on! Let's go!

106
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,400
- See you at lunch.
- Thanks.

107
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Mark!

108
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,300
- Nice catch. Hit me.
- Hey!

109
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,500
Afraid of heights?

110
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,600
- No.
- Good.

111
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,300
See you at the top.

112
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,700
- You coming?
- Sure.

113
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,700
Come on, it's easy.

114
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,600
Help me up.

115
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,100
If I let you go,
do you think you could fly?

116
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,600
Help.

117
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,700
Hey!

118
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Stop!

119
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Hey, Henry, grenade!

120
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

121
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,400
Wow! Great shot.

122
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,800
Yeah!

123
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,700
Hey! What the hell's goin' on here,
goddamn it?!

124
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,300
- Time to go.
- Come back here, you little bastards!

125
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,500
Hey, wait up, Henry!

126
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,600
Hey, cool.

127
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,100
What you got in the box?

128
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,200
- Go on.
- They give you cancer.

129
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,600
Who cares? You're gonna die anyway.

130
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,900
Did you see your mom after she was dead?

131
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,200
I wanted to. They wouldn't let me.

132
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,800
You should have made them let you.
It's very important.

133
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,300
See, people don't like to talk about death.
That's why you have to investigate.

134
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,700
- It's scientific.
- It doesn't feel like that.

135
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,000
What did your mom look like
the last time you saw her?

136
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,400
- Kinda pale.
- Kinda pale.

137
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,600
I took a real good look when my kid brother
Richard drowned in the bathtub.

138
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,400
- Your brother drowned?
- He was completely blue.

139
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,000
You should've looked at her eyes and lips...

140
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,300
...and touched her skin to see
what it felt like-hot, cold.

141
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,300
- Shut up about my mom.
- Hey, don't get mad.

142
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
- I'm just trying to be scientific.
- Shut up or I'll hit you.

143
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,300
Try it...

144
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
...and I'll throw you down there.

145
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Oh, yeah?

146
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,700
Hey, look. I'm sorry.

147
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,200
That was really dumb of me.
I know how I'd feel if I didn't have a mom.

148
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,100
Friends?

149
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,700
OK.

150
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,900
- I know, but that guy was scary.
- I know, and big. You were just...

151
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,600
You were white.
And you were like, brrrrm!

152
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,700
All right, guys, it's late.
Knock it off.

153
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,900
I mean it. Not another peep.

154
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,000
Peep! Peep!

155
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,400
Hey, Henry.

156
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,500
- What?
- Today was fun.

157
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,000
Tomorrow will be even better.

158
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,500
Whoa!

159
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,800
- Hey, you ever read Skeleton Man?
- Who?

160
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,400
He's this really cool superhero
you can't kill cos he's already dead.

161
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,000
- Don't you ever read comic books?
- No, those things warp your mind.

162
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Hey!

163
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,100
Nice knowin' ya!

164
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,500
Come on!

165
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,600
No!

166
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,800
Henry, come on! Let's go.

167
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,800
I love that dog.

168
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,200
- Isn't that your mom?
- Yeah. She's always out there.

169
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,600
- Why?
- She's goes up there to think about Richard.

170
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,700
Kinda weird, huh?

171
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,300
Come on. I wanna show you
my new invention.

172
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Come on.

173
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,000
- Where are we going?
- To my shed.

174
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,900
Awesome! What does it do?

175
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,300
It took me three months
to make it. Beautiful, huh?

176
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,300
You pull the cable back to here,
and you load over there.

177
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,700
Grab a bolt. Go ahead. Lock and load.

178
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,800
Now we...

179
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,700
...line up the kitty cat.

180
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,600
Don't hit her! Just give her a scare.

181
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,900
Sure.

182
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,300
What a great shot!

183
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,400
Yeah. But the sight's not right yet.

184
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,600
You know, this is a nice change.

185
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,400
Most of my patients,
all they wanna do is talk.

186
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,700
Well, I just don't have anything else to say.

187
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,400
Your dad thinks you do.

188
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,600
- He wants me to talk about my mom.
- Sometimes it helps.

189
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,400
I can handle it.

190
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,800
- You can?
- I have to.

191
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,300
Why?

192
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,100
Because when you make a promise...

193
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,800
...when something's your fault...

194
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What did you do?

195
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
I let someone die.

196
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
Mom?

197
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Mom?

198
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Mark?

199
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,900
Honey...

200
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,000
...what's the matter?

201
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,600
It is you.

202
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
You came back.

203
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,700
I knew you'd come back.

204
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,200
Oh, sweetheart. I'm right here.

205
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
OK, I'm right here.

206
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,400
It's OK.

207
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Shh, it's OK.

208
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,600
It's all right.

209
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm right here. I'm right here.

210
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
I know you miss her.

211
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,400
It's OK. It's gonna be OK.

212
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,000
It's OK.

213
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,900
It's OK.

214
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,000
OK. All right, you got a piece. Now.

215
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,600
- It's got blue on it.
- So it has to be the sky.

216
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,000
Right. And it's got a straight edge.

217
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
So it has to go here.

218
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,700
Hey, you got it. All right!

219
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,300
- Mark.
- Yeah?

220
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,700
- Do you like living in our house?
- Sure.

221
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,800
We're gonna look after you real good,
so you won't be sad.

222
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,000
Mark, 0900 hours. Let's move out.

223
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,100
- Not you.
- Why not? He's my friend, too.

224
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,800
I'll play with you later.

225
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,900
I don't care about your stupid secrets!
I got my own secrets.

226
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,400
I'm not gonna tell you a single one!

227
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,400
Status.

228
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
System armed and ready.

229
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,700
- Try to hit that sign.
- Negative.

230
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Try to hit that light.

231
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,500
Negative.

232
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Targeting.

233
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,800
What are you doing?

234
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,300
What are you doing?!

235
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Oh, my God.

236
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,100
I was only trying to scare him.

237
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,000
Hey, Mark. Where's your sense of humour?

238
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,800
Mark?

239
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,600
- I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter. They always fall down.

240
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,000
Isn't she beautiful?

241
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,400
Did you like her?

242
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Yeah. Everybody did.

243
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,300
She was a wonderful person.

244
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,500
And she loved you very much, Mark.

245
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,800
The last time I saw her...
she said she'd always be with me.

246
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
It's true.

247
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,700
Your mother's alive in you.
She'll always be part of you.

248
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
And you.

249
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,200
Yeah.

250
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,700
Is that Richard?

251
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,800
Yeah.

252
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,100
- I bet you miss him.
- Yeah, I sure do.

253
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,400
- Hi.
- Hi, Henry.

254
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,400
Mark, I have something
to show you in the shed.

255
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,600
You want to? Go ahead.
I'll put these away, OK?

256
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,500
So what are you guys up to out there?

257
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,600
Sorry, Mom. Top secret.

258
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,700
Look, I'm sorry about the dog.
It was an accident.

259
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,200
You don't think I'd do a thing
like that on purpose now, do you?

260
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,400
- So what d'you wanna show me?
- I want you to meet somebody very special.

261
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,100
- Who is he?
- Mr Highway.

262
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,100
Wow. What are you gonna do with him?

263
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
It depends.

264
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,800
- On what?
- On you.

265
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,200
- Whether or not you'll help me.
- Help you?

266
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,000
I promise you something amazing...

267
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,500
...something you'll never forget.

268
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,600
Are you in?

269
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,700
Where are we goin'?

270
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
We're here.

271
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Here. Help me rest him up here.

272
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
OK.

273
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,100
Come on, Mr Highway. Take a look.

274
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Poor Mr Highway.

275
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,400
He's thinking about the end.
He's had enough of this terrible life.

276
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,800
- What?
- Say goodbye.

277
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,500
No!

278
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,700
Come on. Let's go.

279
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,100
I didn't know. I didn't know.

280
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,900
- You didn't tell me. How could you do that?
- Shh. Just be quiet.

281
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,500
Do you know what you did?

282
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,600
Hey, come on. We did it together.

283
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,700
You could have killed people.

284
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,900
- With your help.
- Hey, I didn't know you were gonna do that.

285
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,000
I feel sorry for you, Mark.
You just don't know how to have fun.

286
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,000
- What?
- It's because you're scared all the time.

287
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,400
I know. I used to be scared, too.

288
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,600
- But that was before I found out.
- Found out what?

289
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,100
That once you realise
you can do anything, you're free.

290
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,500
You could fly.

291
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,700
Nobody can touch you.

292
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,900
Nobody.

293
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
Mark...

294
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,400
...don't be afraid to fly.

295
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,900
You're sick.

296
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,000
Hey, I promised you something amazing,
something you'll never forget.

297
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,600
Where's the gratitude?

298
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,300
- The largest one.
- The largest one? Ready?

299
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,000
Can you catch this?

300
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,700
Where'd it go?

301
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,700
Hey, hey, hey.

302
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,800
I'm here at Route 233 on
the outskirts of Rock Harbor...

303
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,600
...where today there was a ten-car accident.

304
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,200
Lieutenant Holman of the Rock Harbor
police said it was a miracle...

305
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,500
...no one was seriously injured. Four people
were taken to the hospital for minor injuries.

306
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,800
They have since been released. This is
Andrea Hall reporting. Back to you, Bob.

307
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,600
Go ahead, tell him. Or better yet,
why don't we tell him together?

308
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,300
"It was Mark, Dad. He talked me into it."

309
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,700
"We were just playing a game. I had no idea
he was gonna do something like that."

310
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:17,800
"Please, go easy on him. It's not his fault
he's all screwed up cos he misses his mom."

311
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,900
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

312
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,600
Dad, Mark has something to tell ya.

313
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,400
- What is it? What's wrong with Mark?
- I don't know. He's been acting pretty weird.

314
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,800
I better go see if he's OK.

315
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,900
I told my dad I'd see if you were OK.

316
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,900
Well, are you OK, Mark?

317
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,100
Leave me alone.

318
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,500
Leave you alone? This is my room.

319
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,400
Guess what? Mom says
we can go skating tomorrow.

320
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,700
Connie, what did I tell you
about coming into my room?

321
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,200
But you guys weren't working or anything.

322
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,500
You didn't answer my question,
so I'm gonna have to do it for you.

323
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,400
You're not allowed to come into my room.
Not now, not ever. Never!

324
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,200
You're wrong about that.
This is my room, too.
And I say she can stay.

325
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,700
Mom, they're fighting!

326
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,400
You like my sister, don't you?
Such a sweet little girl.

327
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,700
It'd be too bad if something were
to happen to her, if she got hurt.

328
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,200
You'd be sad, wouldn't you, Mark?

329
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,700
But, hey, accidents will happen.

330
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,100
Just ask my mom about Richard.

331
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,400
Boys, boys! Henry!

332
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,600
What's going on?

333
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,100
I'm sorry, Mom. We were playing
this really dumb game.

334
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,600
We weren't fighting.
We were just playing. Weren't we, Mark?

335
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Yeah. Playing.

336
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,600
Well, all right,
but just not so rough, OK?

337
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,400
You two looked like you were
trying to kill each other.

338
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Susan told me you were here.

339
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,400
I guess you forgot our appointment.

340
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,000
I just didn't feel like talking.

341
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,800
Talking helps.
It helped the last time, didn't it?

342
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,800
You're a doctor.

343
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,900
You know things.

344
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,700
Well, some things.

345
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
What do you think? What makes people evil?

346
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,000
Evil's a word people use when they've
given up trying to understand someone.

347
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,400
There's a reason for everything
if we could just find it.

348
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,000
What if there isn't a reason?

349
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,300
What if something just is?

350
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,400
Why, Mark? Do you think you're evil?

351
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,700
Cos you let your mother die?

352
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,900
You know that's not true.

353
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,300
What if there was this boy...

354
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,100
...and he did these terrible things
because he liked doing them?

355
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,400
Wouldn't you say he was evil?

356
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,000
I don't believe in evil.

357
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,300
You should.

358
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,300
Connie, come on! It's time for lunch.

359
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,700
- Evans' residence. Henry speaking.
- Hey, it's Uncle Jack.

360
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,600
- Oh. Hi, Uncle Jack.
- Is Mark around?

361
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:02,100
Mark? No. Mark's not here right now.

362
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,700
- Do you know where he is?
- No, I don't know where he is.

363
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,100
- Are you boys having fun?
- We're having lots of fun.

364
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,600
Mark really likes it here. You know
something? We really like him, too.

365
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,700
Great. Well, would you tell him I called?

366
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,700
- OK, Uncle Jack. Bye.
- Bye.

367
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,900
So what are you guys up to this afternoon?

368
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,300
I don't know. Not much.

369
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,400
Well, I'm taking your mother
out to dinner tonight.

370
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:37,200
Can you characters baby-sit yourselves
and not get into too much trouble?

371
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,700
Sure, Dad.

372
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,900
Dad, can I stay up and watch
Monster Theater tonight?

373
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,900
No. It might warp
your impressionable brain.

374
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,700
- You're not the boss.
- Yes, I am, vermin.

375
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,400
Henry. That's enough.

376
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,900
What's a vermin?

377
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,500
Mom, Dad, guess what? Mark's been saying
he'd like to move into Richard's room.

378
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,200
- That's not true.
- He seems to like it in there.

379
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,500
- You know, that's not a bad idea.
- Wallace.

380
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,500
We've been through this before. I just...

381
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,100
- I don't wanna move in there.
- Mark, don't lie.

382
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,400
Honey, give it some thought.
We can't keep it like that for ever.

383
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,200
- It's turning into a museum.
- I know, but I didn't say for ever.

384
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,800
That room'll change when I'm ready.

385
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
If Mark wants to move,
there's a nice room on the third floor.

386
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,200
- But Henry's making it up.
- Honey, if Mark moved in, it could help.

387
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,400
It needs to be lived in.
I'm not saying throw out the toys.

388
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,500
Let's... I... I just don't wanna
talk about it right now.

389
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,800
I know you don't, but we've gotta face it.

390
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I do face it.

391
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,600
I face it every day.

392
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,100
- You're the one who's forgetting.
- Susan.

393
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,900
- Oh, Wallace.
- Susan.

394
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,900
Henry!

395
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,000
Hi, Mom.

396
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,800
Don't cry, Mom.

397
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,900
Don't cry, Mom.

398
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,900
- You look fantastic.
- Do you really have to go out?

399
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,600
Yeah, Mark. We've been planning this
for weeks. You guys'll have fun.

400
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,600
Listen, honey. Restaurant number's
by the phone if you need us, OK?

401
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,800
All right, guys, good night!

402
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,800
Night, Mom and Dad!

403
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,900
We won't be late.

404
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,400
Mark! Guess what we're gonna play?
Hide-and-seek, and I'm hiding first.

405
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,300
No, Connie, wait! I've got a better idea.

406
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,400
I bet I find her first.

407
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,700
Connie, where are you?

408
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,200
Connie!

409
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,700
Connie!

410
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
Aagh!

411
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,400
Hey, no fair.

412
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,700
"No fair"?

413
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,300
What do you think this is? A game?

414
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
Connie, where are you?

415
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,300
Connie!

416
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,800
Connie!

417
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
What's going on?

418
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
This is fun. Let's do it again.

419
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,700
No, Connie. It's bedtime.

420
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,600
You heard her. She wants to play again.

421
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,500
Connie, what if I read you
a bedtime story instead?

422
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,900
Connie doesn't wanna read stories.
Do you, Connie?

423
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,600
I do too, vermin!

424
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
(hums "Camptown Races')

425
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:41,500
"And all the girls cried 'Boohoo!
We want to have our appendix out too."'

426
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,200
"Good night, little girls.
Thank the Lord you are well."

427
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,300
"'And now go to sleep' said Miss Clavell.
She turned out the light and closed the door."

428
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,600
"And that's all there is.
There isn't any more."

429
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,700
That was a darling story, Mark.

430
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,800
- What are you doing?
- I wanna tuck in my kid sister.

431
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,500
Such a sweet little thing.

432
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,200
Do you really think I'd hurt her?

433
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,600
Yes.

434
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,000
What are you gonna do?

435
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,200
Watch her all night?

436
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,400
Wallace, I'm sorry, but...

437
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,600
You've gotta stop
blaming yourself about Richard.

438
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,100
I can't. I just can't.

439
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:17,600
I left him alone. Less than six inches of water
in the tub and I left him to answer the phone.

440
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,900
Susan, it wasn't your fault.

441
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,100
You better get to the hospital.

442
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,100
Do you want me to drop
Connie off at the Andersons'?

443
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,200
No, she, uh...

444
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,200
She went skating with Henry in Miller's pond.

445
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,800
- Hey, where's your skates?
- Connie!

446
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,300
Connie!

447
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,700
Connie!

448
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,200
- Connie!
- Don't go with him!

449
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,300
Thin ice!

450
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,900
Henry!

451
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,900
Look out! Look out! Look out! No!

452
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,600
Help me, Henry. Help me.

453
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,200
Connie! Connie!

454
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,100
Henry, help me. Help me.

455
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,200
Help me out!

456
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,800
Let us through. Let us through.

457
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,900
Stay back. Stay back.

458
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,100
Right. All right.

459
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,300
All right, let's get her up.

460
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,400
- Wallace!
- Susan, she's fine.

461
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,200
She's fine. It's OK.

462
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,400
They pulled her out in time.
She's gonna be OK. She's OK.

463
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,000
I just thank God she's all right.

464
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,100
There's something I have to tell you.

465
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,000
- What?
- I'm not sure. I wasn't real close.

466
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,800
At the pond... I don't think what
happened at the pond was an accident.

467
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,400
What do you mean?

468
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,400
The ice was too thin.
Henry was spinning her around.

469
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,100
They were going way too fast.

470
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,000
And he just let go.
He threw her toward the thin ice.

471
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,600
- Mark.
- Henry said he hated her.

472
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,100
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I've told you.

473
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,200
I'm telling you.

474
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,200
Connie didn't just slip.
You don't know what he is.

475
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,600
Henry tried to kill Connie
and he could do it again...

476
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,600
Stop it! Stop it, that's a lie.

477
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,800
Henry's my son.
He's my little boy and I love him.

478
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,100
Don't ever come to me with these lies again.

479
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,200
- Henry.
- Mom.

480
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,300
- I didn't see you.
- Shh. Don't wake her up.

481
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,600
- I thought you were home with Daddy.
- I was worried about Connie.

482
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,300
She's gonna be fine.

483
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,400
- She wake up yet?
- Yeah, for a little while.

484
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,200
- She's still pretty confused, though.
- Yeah.

485
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,800
I don't think she's gonna
remember much of what happened.

486
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:36,600
That's good. It's probably better
for her to forget about the whole thing.

487
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,300
Henry. What did happen on the ice?

488
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,400
I told you, Mom. It was an accident.

489
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,800
Yeah?

490
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I know I've always treated her
like a bratty kid sister...

491
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,500
...but until yesterday I never realised
how much she meant to me.

492
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,900
I know.

493
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,900
I'd better go home now.

494
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,800
- Henry.
- Yeah, Mom?

495
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,700
Never mind. I'll see you at home.

496
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,900
- Tell Connie I was here.
- I will.

497
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,500
- Hello, Dad.
- Mark, how are you, son?

498
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,300
- You've gotta come back here.
- Why? What's wrong?

499
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,200
It's Henry. He's been doing things.
Terrible things.

500
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,600
- What do you mean, terrible things?
- He's got everyone fooled.

501
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,400
Everyone thinks he's this great kid...

502
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,800
...but he's really evil.
- Evil?

503
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,100
He killed this dog with this thing
that he made that fires steel bolts.

504
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,900
Then yesterday... he tried to kill Connie.

505
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,100
Whoa, wait...
Mark, is Wallace there? Or Susan?

506
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:08,900
I tried to tell them,
but they won't believe me. Nobody will.

507
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,200
What about Dr Davenport?

508
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,000
She just thinks
I'm some screwed-up little kid.

509
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,800
Mark, I want you to go to Dr Davenport
and you tell her what you told me.

510
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,400
- All right.
- I'll be there soon.

511
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,600
Please hurry.

512
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,200
What's been going on?
What's troubling you?

513
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,400
Mark! Good.

514
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,400
Hi, Mark.

515
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,100
- What are you doing here?
- He's just here because he wants to help.

516
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,700
He says you two have been
having some problems.

517
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,700
- He's the problem.
- Mark!

518
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,600
You're on his side, aren't you?

519
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:08,000
- I'm on your side, too.
- No, you're not.

520
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,600
He's got you fooled, just like everybody else.

521
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,200
Mark! Wait.

522
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,600
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.

523
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,700
It's not your fault, Henry.
Mark is going through some difficult things.

524
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,100
- Is he OK?
- What do you mean?

525
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,700
Maybe I shouldn't say anything.

526
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,000
But the way he acts when nobody's around...

527
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,900
Dr Davenport, he scares me sometimes.

528
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,900
Why?

529
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,100
What does he do?

530
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Please don't ask me that.

531
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,100
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

532
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,300
Cos Mark's my friend.

533
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,800
You won't be betraying him, I promise you.

534
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,800
Please, Henry. Tell me everything.

535
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,500
Everything?

536
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,300
Sure missed an interesting session.
I like therapy.

537
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:21,200
- What did you tell her?
- Sorry. That's strictly confidential.

538
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,700
But you better stop telling lies about me,
cos no one's gonna believe you.

539
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,600
Sooner or later
they're gonna find out about you.

540
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,500
Who's "they"? My dad? My mom?

541
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,800
- I told your mom.
- Why would she believe you?

542
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:42,900
- She's my mom, not yours.
- You know, you're wrong about that.

543
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,900
- She is my mother.
- Your mom? You crazy?

544
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Your mom's maggot food.

545
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,900
My mom said she'd always be with me.

546
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,700
She chose your mom
as a way of coming back...

547
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,400
...but I guess you wouldn't
understand that. But it's true.

548
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,200
She's my mother now.

549
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,500
Hey, Mark.

550
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Don't fuck with me.

551
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,300
Looking for a midnight snack?

552
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,800
Go ahead. Eat. Drink.

553
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,300
- Don't let me stop you.
- What did you do?

554
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,900
"Do"? Me?

555
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,700
Oh, I get it.

556
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,700
You think I put something
in my family's food.

557
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,700
You think I...

558
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,200
Mark, come on.

559
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,400
Do you really think
I'd do a thing like that?

560
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Mom, Dad, it's Mark! Better come quick.

561
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,900
No, Mark, stop. Stop.

562
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,400
It's all a mistake.
He's trying to poison you!

563
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,300
- Oh, Mark.
- No!

564
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,700
Calm down.

565
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,100
Mark, please stop.

566
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,800
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

567
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,700
- Just stop.
- No! No!

568
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,800
- We'll talk in the morning.
- What for?

569
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,600
- Nobody believes me.
- Mark.

570
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,500
Good night.

571
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,600
- He's OK.
- Oh, Wallace.

572
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,000
He's OK. Now, look,
Jack'll be back in a few days.

573
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,200
Let's just keep it together
until he gets here.

574
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,700
Henry... go to bed.

575
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,800
Mom? What are you doing?

576
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,500
I was... I was just looking around.

577
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,600
Uh-huh.

578
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,900
Henry, if something were wrong...
you would tell me, wouldn't you?

579
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,300
What do you mean?

580
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,100
I mean, sometimes when we're kids,
we do things that, um...

581
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,700
What kind of things?

582
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,300
Things we feel bad about?

583
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,700
I don't feel bad about anything.

584
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,100
Look what I found.

585
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,700
Where did you get that?

586
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,200
You know where I got it.

587
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,800
I couldn't find it after Richard's accident.

588
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,200
Have you had it all this time?

589
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,900
It was mine before it was his.

590
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,900
But you knew I was looking for it.

591
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,400
How did you get it?

592
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,800
Henry?

593
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,900
How did you get this?

594
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,100
I took it. I'm sorry, Mom.

595
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:19,300
I took it because I wanted something
to remember Richard by. That's all.

596
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,400
So can I have it back, please?

597
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,200
No.

598
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,600
No, you can't have it back.

599
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:32,800
- But it's mine.
- Henry!

600
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,200
- Give it to me!
- Henry!

601
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,200
Henry?

602
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,600
- What are you doing?
- Missing someone.

603
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,600
Who?

604
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,400
Mark, did you cry at your mom's funeral?

605
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,500
Why?

606
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:18,900
I don't know. I figure you're expected
to cry at your mom's funeral.

607
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,000
- But I don't know.
- You wouldn't.

608
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,300
- Wouldn't what?
- Hurt her.

609
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,500
Do you really think I'd hurt my own...

610
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,700
- Oh, wait.
- What?

611
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,900
I just remembered.
She's not my mom any more.

612
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,500
She's yours. Isn't that what you said?

613
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,900
- She's your mother now.
- Yeah.

614
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,800
Your mom, my mom. What the hell?
We'll both miss her.

615
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,900
I'll kill you first.

616
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,000
Poor Mark.

617
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,400
So violent, so disturbed.

618
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,900
If you don't watch out,
they're gonna lock you up.

619
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,500
I could kill you now.

620
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,900
Go ahead. Jam it in.

621
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,400
Gotta push pretty hard, though.

622
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,300
The blood'll go right across the room.

623
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,600
Come on. Come on.

624
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,800
- Henry, have you seen...
- Dad, Dad, help me!

625
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,200
Mark! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

626
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,400
- Answer me!
- Don't be mad at Mark. He's not himself.

627
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,100
- You could have hurt him.
- He's the one who wants to hurt people.

628
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,100
Mark, I'm sorry you don't wanna be friends.

629
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,800
He's gonna do something.
He said he's gonna kill her.

630
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,800
We're gonna call
Alice Davenport and have a talk.

631
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,800
- You gotta believe me.
- You have got to calm down.

632
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,700
- Mark. Mark!
- I gotta get outta here.

633
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,900
- If that's the way you want it.
- You don't understand, Uncle Wallace!

634
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,600
You will stay in here
until you are ready to talk.

635
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,500
Uncle Wallace!

636
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,200
Uncle Wallace! Uncle Wallace!

637
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:24,200
Susan! Susan! Susan!

638
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,400
Susan! Susan!

639
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,200
No. No... Susan!

640
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,900
Mom, I decided to clear up the shed.

641
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,700
Henry, stop. Just stop.

642
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,200
We have to talk.

643
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,800
Can we go for a walk, Mom?

644
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,600
You know, like we did when I was little.

645
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,600
No. Susan!

646
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,600
Susan!

647
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,900
Susan! Susan!

648
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:07,800
Susan!

649
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,300
Susan!

650
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,400
Mark! Watch the glass! Take it easy.

651
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,200
Easy. Take it easy.

652
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,400
Mark! Mark!

653
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,000
- Henry?
- Yes, Mom?

654
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,000
You have to tell me the truth now.

655
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,500
- What happened the night Richard died?
- Don't you know?

656
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:02,600
- I'd like to hear it from you.
- I was downstairs playing.

657
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,300
Henry. Don't lie to me, all right?

658
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,200
Just don't lie to me.

659
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,800
Now you tell me...

660
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,300
...did you kill Richard?

661
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,500
What if I did?

662
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,300
Well, um...

663
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,900
- What, Mom?
- We'll get you help.

664
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,100
You don't look too good, Mom.
Looks like you need the help.

665
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,600
- You have to trust me, Henry.
- No.

666
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,800
No, I can't.

667
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:45,100
You just wanna send me away, don't you?

668
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,800
Why, no. No, I don't.

669
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,100
- You wanna put me in one of those places.
- No, Henry.

670
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:54,600
Well, I'd much rather die, you hear me?
I'd much rather be dead.

671
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,300
Henry! Henry, no.

672
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,400
Henry!

673
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,900
Henry! Henry!

674
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,300
Henry! Henry!

675
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,100
Looking for me, Mom?

676
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:27,100
- Oh, Henry.
- You really thought I was gonna jump, huh?

677
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,700
I guess you don't know me very well, Mom.

678
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,300
Henry!

679
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,700
Henry!

680
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,000
Yes, Mom?

681
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,100
Henry, please! No!

682
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,900
I'm gonna kill you.

683
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
- No! No!
- I'm gonna kill you!

684
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,300
Hold on, Henry. Hang on to me.

685
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,500
Come on! Don't let go.

686
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,700
Hold on, Mark.

687
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,200
Hang on to me! Come on!

688
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,600
Come on. Get up. Pull up.

689
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,900
Come on!

690
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,100
Mark! Hang on!

691
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,800
- Mom.
- Henry.

692
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Mom, I love you.

693
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,000
Mom, I need your other hand.

694
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,200
Come on.

695
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:33,500
- Help me.
- Mark! Hang on.

696
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,100
- Help me.
- Hang on, Henry, come on!

697
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,900
Mom, pull me up.

698
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,400
- Help.
- No, Mark. No!

699
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,400
Mom! Mom, I love you.

700
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,100
Help me!

701
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,700
- Hang on.
- Help me.

702
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,800
Mom, help! Help me, please.

703
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,600
Henry.

704
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:06,900
- Mom.
- Henry.

705
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,200
Henry is gone,
and the rest of us are safe.

706
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,900
But sometimes, late at night...

707
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,400
...I find myself thinking,
not about Henry, but about Susan...

708
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,000
...and wondering,
if she had it to do over...

709
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,700
...would she make the same choice?

710
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,100
I guess I'll always wonder.

711
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,200
But I know I'll never ask.

712
