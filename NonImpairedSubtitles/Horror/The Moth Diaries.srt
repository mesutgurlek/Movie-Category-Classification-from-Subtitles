00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,199
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

331
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,952
We're just talking
about CarmiIIa.

332
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,787
Now, with Carmilla,

333
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,414
we are looking at
one of the originators

334
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,957
of the Gothic tale,

335
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,376
20 years before Bram Stoker
wrote Dracula,

336
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,294
and I think it's fair to say,

337
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,963
it influenced him greatly.

338
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,632
All right, let's talk about
the character of Carmilla.

339
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,926
A mysterious stranger
comes from the West

340
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,595
and begins to take over
the narrator, Laura.

341
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,389
- "Sometimes
with gloating eyes,

342
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,640
"she drew me to her,

343
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,975
"and her hot lips

00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,810
"traveled along
my cheeks in kisses,

345
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,605
"and she would whisper,
almost in sobs,

346
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,608
"'You are mine.
You shall be mine.

347
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,610
You and I are one forever.'"

00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,113
- That lavender bath oil
feels so good.

349
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,614
- I know.
I can smell it from here.

350
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,033
- What are you reading?
- CarmiIIa.

351
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,451
It's for Mr. Davies' class.

352
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,452
- What's it about?

355
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,792
- You know,
it's Gothic fiction.

356
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,127
- You're burning red.

357
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,296
How do you stand such hot water
on your skin?

358
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,339
- We always take hot baths
before bedtime.

359
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,050
It's relaxing.

360
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,595
- So I've brought us
a list of verbs to conjugate.

361
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,432
Let's start with baden,
to bathe.

362
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,475
- Baden.

363
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,476
- Mm-hmm.

364
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,480
Beginnen.

365
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,739
- Beginnen.

366
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,658
I'll show you how far I got.

367
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,914
- "The vampire is prone
to be fascinated

368
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,333
"by particular persons.

00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,544
"With an engrossing vehemence

it has satiated its passion

Here you go.

00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,032
Please.

378
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,411
- Um, it's about Carmilla.
- Okay.

379
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,205
- If she's in love with Laura,

380
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,915
then why does she want
to destroy her?

381
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,583
- Well, I don't know
that she wants to destroy her.

382
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,001
She wants to control her.

383
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,295
The vampire's
a very lonely figure.

384
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,464
Carmilla wants a companion
in her existence.

385
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,967
She wants someone
to be all hers, forever.

386
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,637
- But why does Laura want
to be friends with someone

387
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,931
who's so obviously evil?

388
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,058
- I suppose she's been
hypnotized in some way.

389
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,727
Remember, the vampire needs
the consent of the victim.

390
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,397
- The vampire needs
the victim's consent?

391
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,149
- Yes-
well, in a way.

392
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,859
Remember, in Dracula,
he can only enter

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,694
if the victim
leaves the window open.

394
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,321
- It's Lucy's fault
for being such a weak person.

395
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,657
- Lucy?
- No, I mean Laura.

396
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,033
It's Laura's fault.

00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,286
- Mm, in a way.

It's been a big help.

Hey, Lu, do you have
the shoe polish?

401
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,088
Did you get new shoes?

402
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,924
I don't think those are allowed,
are they?

403
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,259
- These are Ernessa's.

404
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,969
- And why are you cleaning them?

405
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,721
- She doesn't know how.

406
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,514
She's never had to polish
her own shoes.

407
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,808
- It's really not that hard.

408
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,019
I'm sure she could do it
if she tried.

409
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,032
She never eats.
Have you noticed?

00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,200
- What?

411
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,160
- Ernessa, she never eats
anything, ever.

412
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,453
- Maybe she's anorexic.

413
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,163
- Remember Annie Patterson
last year?

414
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,665
Her face looked like a skull,
and she still wouldn't eat.

415
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,834
- I just don't think
that'll ever be my problem.

416
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,294
- When you lose
that much weight,

417
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,879
your body can't even
keep itself warm,

418
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,672
and you begin to grow fuzz
all over your arms.

419
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,841
You can see it when they stand
against the light.

420
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,843
They call it "the glow."
Does Ernessa glow?

421
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,137
- No, and I don't think
she's starving herself.

422
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,306
Look at her.
She has a perfect body.

423
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,724
But if you think
she has anorexia,

424
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,768
you could just go up to her
and feel her arms.

425
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,187

- Sorry.
- Whoa.

- She's too sensitive.

- What a way to start a morning.

429

Do you think Ernessa's
hooking up with someone

- A boy?
No way.

00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,500
- She's slipping out at night.

433
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,542
- What do you mean?

434
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,002
- I heard her door open
last night.

435
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,170
And she didn't come back in,

436
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,005
at least not until after
I fell asleep.

- Really?

438

- It's happened before too.

439
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,259
- Weirdo.

440
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,677
Maybe she goes out to score.

441
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,428
- In the middle of the night,
go into town?

- Let's follow her.
