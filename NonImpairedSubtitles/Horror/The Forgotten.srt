1
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,867
Sam.

2
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:12,011
How much time did you spend at
the dresser compared to last week?

3
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:15,183
-Less.
-How much less?

4
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,028
I don't know exactly.

5
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:22,396
You wanna make a guess,
roughly, for the week?

6
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:26,331
Oh, not even an hour a day.

7
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,129
And...

8
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:33,577
...how long has it been now,
since your loss?

9
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:36,068
You're hoping I guess again,
aren't you?

10
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,138
How long?

11
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:41,084
Fourteen months, six days.

12
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:44,781
I can tell you what time it was, down
to the hour and minute if you want.

13
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:47,318
I can't help it.

14
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:51,424
It's all right.
It's just a memory doing its job.

15
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:17,519
-Hello?
-Hey, what are you doing?

16
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:21,284
I'm just running out the door. I'm late
for my appointment with Munce.

17
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,128
Listen, I was thinking maybe
we could go out to dinner tonight.

18
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:29,861
I don't know. I think l'd
rather stay home. I'm sorry.

19
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,101
All right, well, that's fine.

20
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:34,535
I'll cook something fancy.

21
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:36,299
No, no, no.

22
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,937
It's too much for you.

23
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:40,371
No, I want to.

24
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:43,875
Jim, I want to, okay?

25
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:49,653
-Hey, Eliot.
-I miss you, sweetie.

26
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:52,383
-Where have you been?
-I know. I haven't called.

27
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:56,649
Don't be silly. I didn't mean it like that.
We haven't hung out in a while.

28
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,596
-Give me a call, we'll do something.
-I'd love to. Bye.

29
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:10,935
You need some help?

30
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:14,177
I parked my car here.
Right here, last night.

31
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:15,838
What kind of car is it?

32
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,238
Red Volvo.

33
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,688
Thanks.

34
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:26,087
I forget all the time.

35
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:32,184
Jim says I have a death grip
on the past.

36
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:34,527
How are you getting along?

37
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,497
Did you fight at all this week?

38
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:42,035
Jim doesn't fight. He negotiates.

39
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:46,972
Are you comfortable physically?
How's the sex?

40
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:52,841
How would you feel
if I asked you that question?

41
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:55,150
How's the sex with Mrs. Munce?

42
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:56,583
Would you answer?

43
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,348
Yes, but I'd have to
charge you more.

44
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:11,394
-What's wrong?
-l-- I had my coffee.

45
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:12,963
No, not today.

46
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:14,703
No, I just had some.

47
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,933
I offered, but you said no this time.

48
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,504
Last time, you had a cup.

49
00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:22,609
Memory slips.

50
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:25,374
I didn't forget.
I can still taste the coffee.

51
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:28,080
You....

52
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:31,914
You smell my coffee, and you
manufacture a memory, a taste.

53
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:33,745
That's all.

54
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:35,725
You do hang on hard.

55
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:39,991
Sometimes the mind...

56
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:43,391
...needs help in letting a thing go.

57
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:46,361
You expect me to let go of my son?

58
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:54,778
You think you amplify
some of these memories of Sam?

59
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,143
Add to them?

60
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:59,646
No.

61
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:01,216
Why would l?

62
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:11,795
Hey. What's the occasion?

63
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:13,888
You going back to work.

64
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:16,959
-I think it's great.
-It's just a freelance edit job.

65
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,235
-Not even sure I wanna do it.
-I think you should do it.

66
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:23,329
It could be great for you.
What's the book?

67
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:26,435
Psychotic Women and the Men
Who Love Them.

68
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:33,476
No, I'm kidding.
It's a children's book.

69
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:37,412
Sorry. Sorry.

70
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:38,822
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:42,087
Let me get the nice glasses
your mother gave us. Okay?

72
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:45,021
-Speaking of psychotics.
-Yeah.

73
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,163
What kind of a kids' book is it?

74
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:07,043
What have you done, Jim?

75
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,147
-What?
-What have you done?

76
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,013
-Telly.
-Why'd you change the picture?

77
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:14,357
-I didn't change anything.
-Think this helps? Taking him away?

78
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:16,587
-Calm down.
-I want the picture of the three of us.

79
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,762
What did you think, that l
wouldn't notice? I wouldn't care?

80
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:02,428
I come here hoping
to meet other swingers.

81
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:04,634
You're the first one.

82
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:09,776
We know each other. I'm Telly.

83
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:14,316
Remember? Telly Paretta.
Sam's mom?

84
00:09:15,418 --> 00:09:18,751
We're all tired of condolences,
but I miss Lauren too.

85
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:25,190
Well, I'm....

86
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:30,297
I'm done for the night, so I gotta go.

87
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:32,094
You don't remember me.

88
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:36,565
-Sure. You want my swing?
-No.

89
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:40,773
Do you want to come home
with me?

90
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:43,708
-Just live over there.
-Good night, Ash.

91
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:46,279
You do know me.

92
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,318
That's why you won't
come home with me.

93
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:30,288
Jim.

94
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:36,727
Please don't ask me to let go.

95
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:40,902
Jim.

96
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:55,950
Mom, look.

97
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,552
Hurry up, Mom.

98
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:17,472
-There's your plane.
-Yeah, I know.

99
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:25,938
Sam.

100
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:12,053
Jim Paretta, please.

101
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,886
Yeah, I'll take the voice mail.

102
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:22,187
I can't--

103
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:27,296
I can't believe what you did
with the book and....

104
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,639
And I was so good...

105
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:35,337
...with the photos and the lock.

106
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:38,112
You still....

107
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:40,979
Do you want to make me hate you?

108
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:43,948
Do you want to make me hate you?

109
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,109
Please, oh, please.

110
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:11,840
Please. Please.

111
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,416
Telly?

112
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:57,350
Telly.

113
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,166
I can't...

114
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:07,896
...be with you anymore.

115
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,002
I don't wanna see you anymore.

116
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:14,607
-Telly, wait.
-The book....

117
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:17,337
The book, I can lose, but--

118
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,784
You erased our son.

119
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:24,776
You erased my boy.
You made it all blank.

120
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:28,280
-You took him away.
-Stop. They were always blank.

121
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:32,523
-What? What are you saying?
-You're healing. You're coming back.

122
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:35,457
-Dr. Munce is coming.
-Let me go! Let me go!

123
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:38,801
This is good.
God, Telly, this is real.

124
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:41,395
The tapes were always blank.

125
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:45,000
Do you know what he's telling me?

126
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:47,173
Yes.

127
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:50,074
Is he psychotic?

128
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:53,372
No.

129
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:57,649
My child.

130
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:01,085
My Sam.

131
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:03,883
Telly.

132
00:16:04,827 --> 00:16:07,819
There was never a Sam Paretta.

133
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:09,696
You never had a son.

134
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:13,063
-This is insane.
-I'm so sorry.

135
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:15,304
I wanted to help you slowly.

136
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:18,171
-Gently. But I never thought you--
-He erased the tapes.

137
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:20,741
He replaced the book.
How can you believe him?

138
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:22,743
Sam, he grew up. He was 9.

139
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:25,143
Nine. I had nine years of memories.

140
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:27,316
Invented memories, Telly.
It happens.

141
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,353
People do this.
It's called paramnesia.

142
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,685
-You imagined a life--
-Everyone remembers Sam.

143
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:34,288
-Everyone.
-Telly.

144
00:16:34,357 --> 00:16:35,688
You had a miscarriage.

145
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:38,725
Your life was in danger.
The baby was premature.

146
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:43,264
-lt was stillborn. You almost died.
-Stop it.

147
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:45,868
Post-traumatic shock.
It affects everyone differently.

148
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:48,928
Some people actually invent
entire alternate lives...

149
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:51,806
...with imagined friends
and lovers and children.

150
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:55,207
Stop. Why are you doing this?
Why are you trying to take him away?

151
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:58,108
I made him up? I made him up?

152
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:05,718
This is so simple.
There are photographs.

153
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:09,551
People with your condition
look at a photo and see...

154
00:17:09,892 --> 00:17:12,861
...what their mind tells them to see.
You used to see Sam.

155
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,398
-No. Sam took that picture.
-You're recovering.

156
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:17,992
There was a woman.
We asked her to take a picture...

157
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:22,098
...and that's the one that Jim took away.
We have a million photographs.

158
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:24,907
No. No, he took the real book away!

159
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,841
Telly.

160
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:32,142
Telly, I was hoping we could do this
without hospitalizing you.

161
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:45,189
All right, all right.

162
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,795
No, there-- There....

163
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:50,899
There are....

164
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:54,733
There are photos that he didn't take.

165
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:57,701
I'll show you.

166
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,467
And we'll end this. We'll end this.

167
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:27,367
Telly.

168
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,438
Let's just sit down.

169
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:39,948
Telly.

170
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,787
Telly! Telly!

171
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:52,654
Where are you going?
Where are you--? Telly!

172
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,641
I need to see some newspapers.

173
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:15,847
Daily papers from 1 4 months ago.

174
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:25,289
You need to fill this out.

175
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:47,879
What papers do you need?

176
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:53,817
How could--?

177
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:56,524
How could it not be
in any of these?

178
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,084
You sure of the date?

179
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:02,758
What are you trying to find?

180
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:06,592
"Six Brooklyn Children Feared Dead
in Missing Plane."

181
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:10,368
How could it not--?

182
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:12,802
I have to go.

183
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:15,407
I have to go.

184
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:37,088
-Eliot.
-Christ.

185
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:39,260
Telly. What are you doing
in the dark?

186
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:41,035
What's wrong?

187
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:42,570
I had a fight with Jim.

188
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,936
Oh, I'm sorry. Come inside.

189
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:47,098
We fought about Sam.

190
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,838
I'm sorry, about what?

191
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:53,115
Sam.

192
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:54,980
Sam. Who's Sam, sweetie?

193
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:59,053
Eliot, he's my son.

194
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:01,146
Your son?

195
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:03,524
El, please.

196
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:06,629
You knew my son.
You babysat him a thousand times.

197
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:09,598
-I don't know what you're trying to say.
-You knew my son.

198
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:12,566
You talked to him,
you took him to a Mets game...

199
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:15,069
...you bought him a hat.
He always wore that hat.

200
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:17,469
You're scaring me.
Tell me what's wrong.

201
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,541
Telly?

202
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:25,670
Telly!

203
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,174
Telly!

204
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:50,900
Who the hell is it?

205
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:54,506
It's Telly Paretta. Ash, please.

206
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:56,304
Are you gonna go away?

207
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,374
No.

208
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:07,587
Remember me?

209
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:09,953
Yeah.

210
00:22:11,193 --> 00:22:13,161
Who am l?

211
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:17,597
You're in worse shape than I am.

212
00:22:34,717 --> 00:22:36,207
What the hell are you doing?

213
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:40,086
I was here once before,
with my son.

214
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:43,157
-Do you remember?
-You an old fan, is that it?

215
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:46,729
Oh, yeah. That's--
That's right. You--

216
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:48,492
You were a hockey player.

217
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:51,928
Ex-Ranger.
Lauren was very proud of that.

218
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:55,431
-Well, tell Lauren I appreciate it.
-I don't follow hockey.

219
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:57,729
My son, Sam, was a baseball fan.

220
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,105
Oh, baseball.

221
00:23:00,743 --> 00:23:02,768
It's a great game.

222
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:06,373
The only sport you can play
while taking a nap.

223
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:10,252
-You drinking?
-No, I just wanted to talk to you.

224
00:23:10,252 --> 00:23:11,480
About what?

225
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:15,587
-Your daughter.
-I don't have a daughter.

226
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:17,782
Do you get drunk every night?

227
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:24,528
No. Sometimes I'm drunk by noon.

228
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:28,965
-What do you want?
-I had a son.

229
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:31,273
My son and your daughter
were friends...

230
00:23:31,273 --> 00:23:34,606
...and I'd come here sometimes
to drop Sam off or pick Lauren up.

231
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,041
Can we talk about this after?

232
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,304
After what?

233
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:41,841
After I sleep.

234
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:49,417
Somebody else has a daughter,
you know.

235
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:53,353
Somebody else knows your son.

236
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:57,459
It's not me.

237
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:07,935
That's nice.

238
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:16,336
Did we get married?

239
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,168
It's not me.

240
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:21,306
It's you. It's Jim.

241
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:24,446
I don't know who else or what else.

242
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:26,209
I don't know anything.

243
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:29,349
I don't know why
it's not in the papers.

244
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:30,975
I don't know anything.

245
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:34,718
But it's not me. I'm not insane.

246
00:26:34,957 --> 00:26:38,120
Go look in your office.
It used to be your daughter's room.

247
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:45,331
You let her draw on it.
These are her drawings.

248
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:48,129
-What did you do?
-She was showing Sam her room.

249
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,665
I was there. Her bed was here.

250
00:26:50,973 --> 00:26:53,976
Her desk was here, with pictures
from magazines, collaged.

251
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:56,911
-You're out of your mind.
-This was her room.

252
00:26:57,479 --> 00:27:00,983
Somebody lived here before me.
They papered over their kid's room.

253
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:04,510
-I'm calling the cops.
-We were there, at the awful funerals.

254
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:06,989
-You and me and your ex-wife.
-Get out!

255
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:09,583
You seemed much more
upset than your wife.

256
00:27:09,992 --> 00:27:11,983
She was like my husband,
she held it in.

257
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:14,622
-But you and l--
-Listen, listen, listen!

258
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:18,000
We have never met at a funeral.
I do not know you.

259
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,663
Lauren and Sam were friends.
We put them on a plane together...

260
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:25,007
...to go to camp, and we lost them.
They died over a year ago.

261
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:26,838
-Come on.
-You weren't drinking then.

262
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:32,913
-How do you know that?
-I met you.

263
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:35,040
You weren't like this.

264
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:39,146
It was about 1 4 months ago
you started drinking, wasn't it?

265
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:43,013
Wasn't it?

266
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:45,152
That's when Lauren died.

267
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:48,792
-I never had a kid.
-You remembered her before this.

268
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:51,829
Everybody remembered our children.
Something happened...

269
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:55,970
...in the last weeks or days, I don't know,
but our children have been forgotten.

270
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:59,405
-That's it. Let's go. Come on!
-No, no! Say her name, and I'll go!

271
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:01,270
I say his name every day!

272
00:28:01,543 --> 00:28:04,034
Just say it.

273
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:07,072
So you can hear it. Lauren.

274
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:09,346
Say it.

275
00:28:11,553 --> 00:28:13,316
Lauren.

276
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:16,115
Now look around again.

277
00:28:20,062 --> 00:28:21,859
She was here.

278
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:24,896
She lived here.

279
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,072
-I need a minute.
-Tell me if--

280
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:31,562
I need a minute.

281
00:28:52,094 --> 00:28:55,222
-Do you want some coffee?
-No, thanks.

282
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:03,333
I know this is difficult.

283
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:06,767
How much do you remember?

284
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:18,051
I-- I called the police.

285
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:23,114
Look, you need some help.
I never had a kid.

286
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:26,560
You gotta get some help. I'm--

287
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:29,097
I'm real sorry.

288
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:38,230
Yeah.

289
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:45,120
One second, okay?

290
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:51,001
It's the best thing.

291
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:53,663
They say I dreamed it all.

292
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:55,664
Do you think I dreamed it?

293
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:58,236
We have to go.

294
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:29,438
Hi. Carl Dayton,
National Security Agency.

295
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:32,076
Telly Paretta? We're taking custody.

296
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,012
-Can I see some lD?
-Check with Captain Mills. He'll verify.

297
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,892
Hi, Dad.

298
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:01,435
Sorry, Dad.

299
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:09,341
Which one do you think
I should wear, Daddy?

300
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:20,818
Wait! Wait!

301
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,457
-Where is she?
-The feds have her.

302
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:31,760
Stop.

303
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,504
-You gotta let her go.
-Mr. Correll, step back.

304
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,404
You don't understand.

305
00:31:38,677 --> 00:31:40,474
Telly. Get off--

306
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,683
-I remember. I remember.
-Get off.

307
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,617
I remember.

308
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:49,381
-Get him off the car!
-I remember.

309
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,986
Get off me. She's right!

310
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:00,528
-Grab his hands!
-Run!

311
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:05,260
Run!

312
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:09,640
Run!

313
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:50,639
-T-E-L-L...?
-Y. Telly.

314
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:53,675
They told me there was
a complaint against her.

315
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:56,007
She trashed an apartment
and wouldn't leave.

316
00:33:56,314 --> 00:34:00,318
-Who? Whose apartment?
-Mr. Ashley Correll. Do you know him?

317
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:01,945
-No.
-Ex-New York Ranger.

318
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,788
-Pretty good.
-What does he have to do--?

319
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:07,121
She was claiming her son
was missing and dead.

320
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:08,690
We never had a son.

321
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:11,056
Why would she say that?

322
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:14,332
My wife is delusional.
She needs help.

323
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:16,266
Where is she?

324
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:18,700
She was turned over
to federal agents.

325
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:21,840
And she fled custody.
Now, Mr. Paretta...

326
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,832
...why would the NSA
be interested in your wife?

327
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:28,346
You're asking me?
This is crazy.

328
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:30,439
They don't care about
anybody's apartment.

329
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:35,752
-And they don't trace missing children.
-There was never a child.

330
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:16,394
Do what they say, all right?

331
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:18,225
Okay. I love you.

332
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:23,129
I'm gonna miss you so much.

333
00:35:24,402 --> 00:35:26,165
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

334
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,396
Have fun.

335
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:31,068
I love you, Mommy.

336
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:33,001
-Sam.
-Yeah?

337
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:36,812
-See you.
-See you.

338
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,078
I was hoping you'd come here.

339
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:16,818
Me too.

340
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:27,454
I don't understand it.

341
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:33,164
I keep thinking I'm crazy, you know?

342
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:35,234
How could I forget her?

343
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:37,737
My little girl.

344
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:40,979
How--?

345
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,378
I can't do this.

346
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:44,846
You have to.

347
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:47,781
Because I can't do this alone.

348
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,549
Come on, we shouldn't
hang around here.

349
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:03,092
First, I thought it had to do
with the plane crash.

350
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:06,004
Remember when that flight
crashed over Long lsland...

351
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,404
...and everybody thought
it was friendly fire...

352
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:09,939
...some government cover-up?

353
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:13,011
-Yeah, I remember that.
-But then I thought...

354
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,878
...how could the government
erase our memories?

355
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:18,881
It's just not possible. It's so--

356
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:20,541
-What?
-Please don't think...

357
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:23,783
-...I'm out of my mind.
-I don't anymore.

358
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:27,719
Do you ever feel like somebody--?

359
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,551
Something's watching you?

360
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:32,496
Like surveillance?

361
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,694
No, I mean that sometimes
people are...

362
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:39,595
...taken. We hear that.

363
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,065
-What are you talking about?
-Abduction.

364
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,641
You're freaking me out.
I'm having a National Enquirer moment.

365
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,847
No, listen to me.
What do we know?

366
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:56,554
I had a son, you had a daughter,
they had lives...

367
00:37:56,554 --> 00:37:59,990
...they died, and everyone besides us
believes they never existed.

368
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:02,458
What could do something like that?

369
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:05,063
No. There's gotta be
another explanation.

370
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:08,566
Who could erase our kids?
Every-- Every picture of them gone.

371
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:12,434
Every newspaper article gone.
Every memory gone.

372
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,970
No agents. No government.
Who could do that?

373
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:18,633
I don't know.

374
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,677
We need to find a hotel.
You got any cash?

375
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:30,213
No, not much.
I have some credit cards.

376
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:33,887
Forget it. Clerk runs your card,
and they got us.

377
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,593
Don't you watch TV?

378
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:37,026
I read.

379
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:40,996
Goddamn snob.

380
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,696
No. Goddamn editor.
Why are you so pissed at me?

381
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:52,770
-You okay?
-Yeah.

382
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:55,306
My door.

383
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:58,116
-NSA! We need to talk to you!
-Just stay by the car!

384
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,209
Stay by the car!

385
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:31,945
This way!

386
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:41,591
-Where did they go?
-ln here!

387
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:02,236
In here!

388
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:13,486
Get down.

389
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:19,856
Goddamn it, we've lost them.

390
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,897
All right, search the fields.
We'll check the streets.

391
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:28,297
All right. Come on.

392
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,970
I got left side.

393
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,776
-Petalis, come in.
-Go for Petalis.

394
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:19,586
What do you see? Nothing there?

395
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:22,521
-Yeah, the field's clear.
-Okay, hook up with us.

396
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,318
Okay. I'm coming back to you.

397
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:26,525
What's your 20?

398
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:59,627
-Hello?
-Dr. Munce, it's Telly.

399
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:03,699
Telly. Where are you?
Are you all right?

400
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:06,201
No.

401
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:11,298
I mean, I'm not hurt,
but there are people after us.

402
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:12,537
What? What do you mean?

403
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,710
I found someone else.

404
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:17,838
His daughter was on the same flight.
He didn't remember her.

405
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,783
But now he does.

406
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,614
How do you explain that?

407
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:24,287
How do you explain
the people chasing us?

408
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:28,815
Telly, this is a panic attack.
You just hold on, all right?

409
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:33,696
Now, tell me where you are,
I'll leave right away. You need help.

410
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:38,199
No, I need you to start believing me.

411
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:57,446
Found an all-night place.

412
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:01,825
Didn't have much.

413
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:09,890
You should eat something.

414
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:14,372
Just deciding whether I want
too much salt or too much sugar.

415
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:16,306
Sugar.

416
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:30,547
Wish you wouldn't do that.

417
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,618
Don't worry about it.

418
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:44,367
Think I'm just gonna go to bed.

419
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:12,122
-You held out.
-What?

420
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,831
You held out and I didn't.
I forgot her.

421
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:18,367
-How'd you do that?
-I don't know.

422
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:22,372
What's so important about us?
Or our kids?

423
00:44:24,942 --> 00:44:26,739
I mean, the kids are dead.

424
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:28,878
Why try to erase our memories?

425
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:31,779
It's not like we're gonna
go look for them.

426
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:58,669
Sam.

427
00:45:29,507 --> 00:45:31,372
Ash.

428
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:34,273
Ash. Wake up.

429
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:37,140
Come on.

430
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:40,211
Come on, wake up. Wake up.

431
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:44,317
Wake up, wake up.
Come on. Wake up.

432
00:45:44,522 --> 00:45:46,023
Wake up.

433
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:47,786
Wake up!

434
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:55,623
Ash.

435
00:45:56,534 --> 00:45:58,297
Ash.

436
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:00,436
Wake up.

437
00:46:00,538 --> 00:46:02,733
-Listen to me.
-What the hell are you doing?

438
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,905
-You nutjob!
-Listen to me.

439
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:07,272
You didn't know it,
but you were right.

440
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:09,945
If the children were dead,
they would leave it.

441
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:13,073
If we all thought they were dead,
why would they erase them?

442
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:15,553
Why would they need
to make us forget them?

443
00:46:15,553 --> 00:46:17,350
I think the children are alive.

444
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:21,514
That's why I can still feel him, why
I can't let go. The children are alive.

445
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:24,459
Don't you feel that
Lauren's alive out there?

446
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:26,086
I don't know, maybe.

447
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:34,799
Yes.

448
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:41,067
Jim usually leaves the office
by 1 2:1 5.

449
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,581
We need to get Jim alone.

450
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:47,108
-What's he like?
-We had our problems.

451
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:49,950
He loved Sam.

452
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:52,681
Make him say Sam's name.

453
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,682
Like you made me say "Lauren."

454
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:13,099
-Watch out!
-Get out of the way!

455
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:23,644
Behind you!

456
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:28,853
Get out of the way!

457
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,120
Oh, my God!

458
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:36,395
-ls he--? Did we--?
-I don't know.

459
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:40,638
I've seen him before.

460
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:42,435
Don't answer it.

461
00:47:44,642 --> 00:47:47,577
-Hello?
-Hello, is this Telly Paretta?

462
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:51,478
-Who is this?
-Telly, this is Detective Anne Pope.

463
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:53,150
We didn't mean to hurt anybody.

464
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,017
The man in front of our car
wouldn't get out of the way.

465
00:47:56,153 --> 00:47:58,621
-What?
-We're just trying to find our children.

466
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:00,351
-Hang up.
-Yes, I know.

467
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:02,785
-You know?
-I know about your case.

468
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,593
Hang up.

469
00:48:04,662 --> 00:48:06,152
Is that Ashley Correll?

470
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:07,528
They took our kids.

471
00:48:07,665 --> 00:48:09,997
They made us think
they died in a plane crash.

472
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,965
Anne. Look, I know this doesn't
make any sense...

473
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:16,731
...but my son, Sam Paretta,
and Ash's daughter, Lauren Correll...

474
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:19,039
...they were on the same plane.

475
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:20,678
Now, how could two people...

476
00:48:20,678 --> 00:48:24,205
...remember two different children
if they never existed?

477
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,200
Jim.

478
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:56,839
Hi. I....

479
00:48:57,715 --> 00:48:59,046
I'm sorry, do I know you?

480
00:48:59,216 --> 00:49:01,013
What's the matter? It's me.

481
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,517
I'm lost. Can you help me out here?

482
00:49:06,223 --> 00:49:08,748
Oh, God, what did they do to you?

483
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:12,286
It's me. It's Telly.

484
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:15,528
I'm sorry. We know each other?

485
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:18,963
I know your wife.

486
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:24,333
Right. Got it. Not married.
Wrong Jim.

487
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:26,937
James William Paretta.

488
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:29,473
Who are you?

489
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:37,084
Do you know a Sam Paretta?

490
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:39,222
-No relation.
-Maybe it would help...

491
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:41,247
...if you said the name. Sam.

492
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,387
You lost me.

493
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:56,933
What about Jim?

494
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:07,307
It's them.

495
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:41,842
We gotta get out of here.
Out of the city, at least for tonight.

496
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:46,187
I know someplace far enough.

497
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:51,727
-Telly.
-He didn't even know me.

498
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:53,558
He forgot me.

499
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:02,089
Swear to God. They hit the guy,
he crashes into the pump. Look.

500
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:05,149
Swear to God. They hit the guy,
he crashes into the pump. Look.

501
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:09,676
Look at that. Then he gets right up.
I didn't just see it, I heard it. Bang.

502
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:12,349
This guy bounces off
the gas pump, gets right up.

503
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:13,577
There's no blood.

504
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:16,444
There's gotta be.

505
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:20,152
-Feds wanna talk to you.
-What?

506
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:21,949
Detective Pope.

507
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:24,793
Okay, wait right here, all right?

508
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:28,297
I'm Carl Dayton, NSA.

509
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:31,858
-So you're here to rent a car?
-Pardon?

510
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,997
What are you doing
in my crime scene, Carl?

511
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:37,875
What's so national security
about this?

512
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,866
-I'm not at liberty to say.
-Liberty to say.

513
00:51:39,877 --> 00:51:41,674
You guys need new material.

514
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,608
We've been on this case.

515
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:49,376
So any new information
that you get on Paretta or Correll...

516
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,151
...you give me a call any time,
day or night.

517
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:53,981
You like this part, don't you?

518
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:56,825
The part where you get
to take away my case.

519
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:58,521
I'd rather be sailing.

520
00:51:59,396 --> 00:52:01,364
I'm conducting
an investigation here.

521
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:03,992
And until I know differently,
Paretta and Correll...

522
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:06,801
...have been breaking only
the laws of New York.

523
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:09,702
I am the city of New York,
and I'm on it.

524
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:13,410
Your involvement wouldn't have to do
with the plane crash...

525
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:17,005
-...they claim killed their two children?
-Children?

526
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,405
There are no children.

527
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:23,921
But there was a plane crash.

528
00:52:23,921 --> 00:52:25,149
No.

529
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:27,617
We know nothing about
a plane crash.

530
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:30,928
You don't know very much.

531
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:33,123
National security, huh?

532
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:35,625
Better buy better locks.

533
00:53:00,908 --> 00:53:02,899
Put your eyes back
in your head, warden.

534
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,877
I'm not looking at you.

535
00:53:05,913 --> 00:53:07,244
I had a wife.

536
00:53:07,414 --> 00:53:10,713
Could feel a woman's eyes judging me
if I was in a coma.

537
00:53:12,419 --> 00:53:13,647
Ash, please don't drink.

538
00:53:15,422 --> 00:53:17,583
See, I told you
you were watching me.

539
00:53:18,425 --> 00:53:19,722
You know what?

540
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:22,429
-I wish I didn't have to.
-Then don't. I'm sick of hearing it.

541
00:53:22,429 --> 00:53:24,954
Sorry to interrupt your
feeling sorry for yourself.

542
00:53:25,432 --> 00:53:27,593
Well, not all of us
can be heroes, lady.

543
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:31,928
You think I wouldn't drink that entire
bottle for a few seconds of peace?

544
00:53:31,939 --> 00:53:34,339
You're in this. You don't get
to drink your way out.

545
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:37,035
What makes you so fucking special?

546
00:53:39,947 --> 00:53:41,881
I let her go.

547
00:53:44,451 --> 00:53:45,679
My little girl.

548
00:53:46,453 --> 00:53:49,217
They took her away from me,
but I let her go.

549
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:53,153
What kind of father does that?

550
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:02,401
I need you to stay clear.

551
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:33,899
-I'm not doing this for you, you know.
-I know.

552
00:54:35,002 --> 00:54:37,334
I'll never forget her again.

553
00:54:38,005 --> 00:54:39,836
I know you won't.

554
00:54:40,507 --> 00:54:42,202
You know everything, right?

555
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:47,674
I don't know how
to get my son back.

556
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:56,318
We'll figure something out.

557
00:55:06,033 --> 00:55:08,695
-And?
-Dayton? He is NSA, but it's tagged.

558
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:12,199
He's got special clearance.
Some unit within the NSA.

559
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:14,769
-These people are down deep.
-Doing what?

560
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:18,500
I'd say God only knows,
but I don't think he's in the loop.

561
00:55:18,545 --> 00:55:22,413
I gotta pick up my sister's kid.
Get some sleep.

562
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:25,052
Good night. I need you
to get that on my desk--

563
00:55:25,052 --> 00:55:27,782
-Excuse me, Lieutenant Pope?
-No, I'm gone, in my car.

564
00:55:28,055 --> 00:55:29,989
-I'm almost home.
-I'm Dr. Jack Munce.

565
00:55:30,057 --> 00:55:31,922
Telly Paretta's my patient.

566
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,959
I'd like to help.
Telly's contacted me.

567
00:55:35,062 --> 00:55:38,065
What can you tell me about Telly
that might help me find her?

568
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:41,660
I used to think that she was
purely delusional.

569
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:45,436
I'm not sure anymore.

570
00:55:46,573 --> 00:55:50,805
So how is it that she and Mr. Correll
are having the same delusion...

571
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:54,912
...making up imaginary children
from the same plane crash?

572
00:55:55,082 --> 00:55:57,550
Well, I don't-- I don't know Correll.

573
00:55:58,085 --> 00:56:00,246
He could be saying anything
to be with her.

574
00:56:00,587 --> 00:56:02,316
Well, if she calls again, call me.

575
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:05,581
I think it's important
that I'm there when you find her.

576
00:56:06,093 --> 00:56:08,425
You'll be dealing with
a possible psychotic break.

577
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:10,097
You don't wanna do more damage.

578
00:56:10,097 --> 00:56:14,056
-I'll call you, Dr. Munce.
-No, that's not what I mean.

579
00:56:15,602 --> 00:56:18,332
It's.... It's my fault she's out there.

580
00:56:18,605 --> 00:56:20,107
Why?

581
00:56:20,107 --> 00:56:21,699
She was in my care.

582
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:25,043
She still trusts me,
or she wouldn't have called.

583
00:56:25,112 --> 00:56:30,744
She'll call again, and when she does,
you'll know because I'll be with you.

584
00:56:31,118 --> 00:56:34,110
You're gonna need me to find her.

585
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:42,416
Oh, shit.

586
00:57:42,689 --> 00:57:44,281
"A. Petalis."

587
00:57:44,691 --> 00:57:47,057
What's the A stand for?

588
00:57:50,697 --> 00:57:52,062
What?

589
00:57:55,202 --> 00:57:57,102
-You don't have to do that.
-This?

590
00:57:57,204 --> 00:57:58,603
Just stop it!

591
00:58:00,207 --> 00:58:01,708
Al.

592
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:03,938
Al Petalis.

593
00:58:06,213 --> 00:58:10,217
You don't want this kind of trouble,
so just drop it right now. Right now!

594
00:58:10,217 --> 00:58:14,415
Tell him to stop, Miss Paretta,
before this goes any further. Tell him!

595
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:16,518
We just want our children.

596
00:58:17,224 --> 00:58:21,388
There are no children.
Forget the children.

597
00:58:22,729 --> 00:58:25,391
What did you say?
Did you say to forget the children?

598
00:58:25,732 --> 00:58:28,064
-Who are you?
-Where are the children?

599
00:58:28,235 --> 00:58:31,363
Why were they taken?
Why were the children taken?

600
00:58:34,741 --> 00:58:37,676
If I swing this thing again,
I'm gonna break your kneecap.

601
00:58:38,245 --> 00:58:39,746
I swear it.

602
00:58:39,746 --> 00:58:41,441
Where are the children?

603
00:58:41,748 --> 00:58:44,842
No! No, l--

604
00:58:45,252 --> 00:58:47,413
It's not me, it's....

605
00:58:48,255 --> 00:58:51,782
It's not us. We.... We....

606
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:54,750
We cooperate.

607
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:56,729
Cooperate with who?

608
00:58:57,264 --> 00:58:58,663
With who?

609
00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:00,630
Why do you cooperate with them?

610
00:59:02,269 --> 00:59:04,794
-Survival.
-Who, yours?

611
00:59:05,272 --> 00:59:06,500
Yours too.

612
00:59:09,276 --> 00:59:10,504
You were right.

613
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:15,282
Where are they from? Who are they?
Why do they want the children?

614
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:17,182
Tell us the truth.

615
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:21,584
The truth.

616
00:59:21,788 --> 00:59:25,417
The goddamn truth
won't fit in your brain.

617
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:27,794
It won't fit in anybody's brain.

618
00:59:27,794 --> 00:59:30,058
Just tell us how to get
the children back.

619
00:59:31,298 --> 00:59:35,029
I don't know. I don't know
anything about that.

620
00:59:35,302 --> 00:59:39,796
All I know is that you were supposed
to forget like everybody else did.

621
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:42,172
This was not part of it.

622
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:44,572
Part of what?

623
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:46,938
Part of what?

624
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:51,818
Part of...

625
00:59:51,818 --> 00:59:55,276
...this particular experiment.

626
00:59:57,324 --> 00:59:58,655
-Go on.
-I can't.

627
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:00,190
-Yes, you can!
-No, I won't.

628
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:02,989
-Yes, you can! Yes, you--!
-No! No!

629
01:00:08,835 --> 01:00:10,325
Do you have children?

630
01:00:16,843 --> 01:00:18,640
Please.

631
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:22,042
Please tell me.

632
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:25,477
No one will know that you told us.

633
01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:27,319
Just--

634
01:00:28,855 --> 01:00:30,720
Just tell us...

635
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:34,361
...how to get the children back.

636
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:36,386
No one will blame you.

637
01:00:36,863 --> 01:00:40,560
I swear to you. I swear to you.

638
01:00:45,872 --> 01:00:47,703
They're listening.

639
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:31,077
You okay?

640
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:36,355
-Why didn't they take us?
-I don't know.

641
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:43,541
Our best guess is a gas leak.

642
01:01:43,814 --> 01:01:46,806
But nothing's burned.
There's no sign of fire.

643
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:49,148
There's no sign of blood.

644
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,981
Just this.

645
01:01:53,824 --> 01:01:57,521
"Anne Pope, our children are alive.
We believe they were abducted.

646
01:01:57,828 --> 01:02:02,458
We know we couldn't sound crazier
if we tried. Please help us."

647
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:04,766
Abducted.

648
01:02:04,835 --> 01:02:06,496
That's an interesting word.

649
01:02:06,837 --> 01:02:09,135
Most people say kidnapped.

650
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:14,401
-Troopers found this.
-Excuse us, Dr. Munce.

651
01:02:18,348 --> 01:02:20,373
Witnesses only saw
Paretta and Correll...

652
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:23,149
...running from the cabin
after the explosion.

653
01:02:23,353 --> 01:02:26,322
And there's no sign
of another body inside.

654
01:02:27,357 --> 01:02:29,450
Where did this come from?

655
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:35,092
Brasher, how old's Cassidy?

656
01:02:35,365 --> 01:02:37,367
She's 7, why?

657
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:40,962
What if I told you your daughter
never existed? That you made her up?

658
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:42,770
Why would you do that?

659
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:47,070
Yeah. Why?

660
01:03:11,902 --> 01:03:14,962
QuestAir. The name of the airline,
the small airline.

661
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:17,873
It was QuestAir. Remember?

662
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:20,410
QuestAir. So....

663
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:24,506
So we're saying that
it never crashed at sea.

664
01:03:24,915 --> 01:03:27,782
We're saying that they
somehow took the kids...

665
01:03:27,918 --> 01:03:31,081
...and that the--
The plane and the pilot...

666
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:34,584
...that all of it,
all of it is part of them.

667
01:03:35,425 --> 01:03:37,222
QuestAir.

668
01:04:36,987 --> 01:04:39,421
Oh, my God. Who are you?
What are you doing here?

669
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:42,424
Sorry, we didn't think there'd be
anyone here. I'm Claire.

670
01:04:42,993 --> 01:04:46,156
I'm Mr. Shineer's assistant.
And you are?

671
01:04:46,496 --> 01:04:49,693
Eileen, the accountant the court
appointed for the bankruptcy.

672
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,460
-Oh, of course. I'm so sorry.
-That's all right.

673
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:57,473
I was told that QuestAir employees
are not allowed here.

674
01:04:57,507 --> 01:05:00,476
That's okay. Mr. Shineer needs
some items from his office.

675
01:05:01,011 --> 01:05:03,775
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Nothing is allowed to leave.

676
01:05:04,514 --> 01:05:06,038
They're just personal letters.

677
01:05:06,516 --> 01:05:09,519
Yes, well, if anything turns up,
I'd be happy to have them...

678
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:11,077
...sent to Mr. Shineer's home.

679
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:13,250
Gonna have to go by court procedure.

680
01:05:13,523 --> 01:05:18,153
That's fine. The West Side address
isn't good anymore, though, the co-op.

681
01:05:18,528 --> 01:05:19,756
Which one do you have?

682
01:05:22,032 --> 01:05:24,000
Where would I have that?

683
01:05:27,037 --> 01:05:29,938
Let's see what I've got here.

684
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,338
Okay, Robert Shineer.
I've got the one on Long lsland.

685
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:36,740
1 65 Colony Way.

686
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:18,645
Nobody lives here.

687
01:06:19,089 --> 01:06:21,455
Yeah, that's strange.

688
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:24,526
They didn't move out, they just left.

689
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:34,824
-Go ahead, you should sleep.
-What about you?

690
01:07:35,165 --> 01:07:37,292
I'm finally awake.

691
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:06,457
-Hey, get in.
-Where are we going?

692
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:10,757
They've been lD'd. They scammed an
accountant for an address. Long lsland.

693
01:08:54,244 --> 01:08:55,472
Ash.

694
01:09:02,252 --> 01:09:04,379
-Shineer.
-Ash?

695
01:09:08,258 --> 01:09:09,782
Telly.

696
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,127
-Look. It's the guy from the car rental.
-I know.

697
01:09:14,264 --> 01:09:17,722
We have to get to the airport,
the one the kids left from.

698
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:26,401
They're in the house with us.

699
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:29,506
Come on, let's go.

700
01:09:42,792 --> 01:09:44,419
It's jammed.

701
01:10:04,814 --> 01:10:07,317
-Meet me at my apartment.
-What are you doing?

702
01:10:07,317 --> 01:10:10,650
One of us has gotta get out of here.
Go. Go on. Go!

703
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:20,352
Stay here.

704
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:23,696
Stay inside.

705
01:10:35,845 --> 01:10:38,245
Freeze. Right there.
Hands on your head.

706
01:10:38,848 --> 01:10:41,783
I want you on your knees. Now.

707
01:10:42,352 --> 01:10:43,649
I will shoot.

708
01:10:44,354 --> 01:10:45,685
Now.

709
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,021
Halt!

710
01:10:55,865 --> 01:10:57,560
Halt!

711
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:12,382
-Are you Munce?
-Yes, what happened in there?

712
01:11:12,382 --> 01:11:15,078
-Where's Telly?
-Telly left. We gotta get out of here.

713
01:11:15,385 --> 01:11:17,580
-What about Pope?
-You wanna help Telly? Drive.

714
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:19,354
Drive!

715
01:11:19,889 --> 01:11:21,379
Come on.

716
01:11:35,405 --> 01:11:38,033
Telly! Telly, wait.

717
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:41,036
Telly, I'm Anne. Anne Pope.

718
01:11:41,411 --> 01:11:42,708
No, wait. Please listen.

719
01:11:42,912 --> 01:11:45,073
I know. I know.

720
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:49,442
I believe you, Telly.
I believe you about everything.

721
01:11:49,919 --> 01:11:53,184
I've seen it.
It's not human. Jesus Christ.

722
01:11:53,423 --> 01:11:55,925
-And the children?
-Yes, everything.

723
01:11:55,925 --> 01:12:00,055
We'll find them. I promise you that.
Do you hear me? We will find them.

724
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,830
We will find your son--

725
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:23,350
Telly?

726
01:12:33,463 --> 01:12:34,760
Ash?

727
01:12:35,465 --> 01:12:37,057
Ash.

728
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:42,631
They took Anne Pope
right in front of me.

729
01:12:45,475 --> 01:12:46,476
Munce is downstairs.

730
01:12:46,476 --> 01:12:48,876
-He'll take us to that airport.
-Beautiful view.

731
01:12:51,981 --> 01:12:54,108
What have you done with our kids?

732
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:02,390
Ash.

733
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:04,187
-No, Telly. Stay back!
-Ash.

734
01:13:04,494 --> 01:13:06,257
No!

735
01:13:06,996 --> 01:13:08,224
Ash!

736
01:13:09,499 --> 01:13:11,057
No!

737
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:13,628
Ash!

738
01:13:27,517 --> 01:13:28,779
Telly.

739
01:13:30,019 --> 01:13:31,680
Come with me.

740
01:13:41,531 --> 01:13:44,967
-We have to go to the police.
-No, we have to go to the airport.

741
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:47,400
Please, Telly. We need help.

742
01:13:55,044 --> 01:13:56,272
Get out.

743
01:14:02,552 --> 01:14:04,076
No, I'll take you.

744
01:14:57,106 --> 01:15:01,167
He's one of them.
You have my son. Where is he?

745
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:10,779
You know this is getting
out of control.

746
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,951
It's finished now, end it.

747
01:15:13,623 --> 01:15:15,488
Make it right.

748
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:21,221
Where is my son?

749
01:15:27,136 --> 01:15:28,899
It's not over.

750
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,777
You're one of those agents.

751
01:15:44,654 --> 01:15:47,350
No, I'm just...

752
01:15:48,157 --> 01:15:50,489
...one of the few who knows.

753
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,718
So you help them?

754
01:15:53,162 --> 01:15:57,428
They don't need help. They run their
experiments with or without our help.

755
01:15:58,167 --> 01:16:01,534
They've been doing it for years.
Maybe forever.

756
01:16:01,671 --> 01:16:03,969
And you just let them do
whatever they want.

757
01:16:04,674 --> 01:16:06,164
Let them?

758
01:16:07,176 --> 01:16:08,803
I don't have a choice.

759
01:16:09,178 --> 01:16:11,976
We just try to minimize the damage.

760
01:16:12,181 --> 01:16:14,411
I just want my son.

761
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:19,518
Telly, you'll never get Sam back.

762
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:24,285
You've held on, and they don't
know why. You're just a lab rat to them.

763
01:16:24,694 --> 01:16:28,460
I don't believe that. He said
it's not over. I can still get him back.

764
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:33,362
You know them. Help me.

765
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:39,231
If you go any further,
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

766
01:17:03,015 --> 01:17:04,812
Is my son in here?

767
01:17:05,518 --> 01:17:07,486
You never doubted.

768
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:09,647
Not for a second, did you?

769
01:17:10,523 --> 01:17:11,956
He's here.

770
01:17:12,024 --> 01:17:14,254
He's now just a memory, Telly.

771
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:44,523
Can you picture him here?

772
01:17:46,058 --> 01:17:47,548
Now?

773
01:17:59,071 --> 01:18:00,698
Sam!

774
01:18:01,574 --> 01:18:04,668
Honey! Wait!

775
01:18:15,087 --> 01:18:17,078
Sam!

776
01:18:20,593 --> 01:18:22,390
Sam!

777
01:18:32,104 --> 01:18:35,540
What have you done with him? Why
did you take him? What do you want?

778
01:18:35,608 --> 01:18:36,836
It's an experiment.

779
01:18:37,109 --> 01:18:43,139
He's just a little boy. What could
you possibly learn from him?

780
01:18:43,616 --> 01:18:45,083
Nothing.

781
01:18:46,619 --> 01:18:48,985
This wasn't about Sam.

782
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,386
This wasn't about the children.

783
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,923
It was never about the children.

784
01:18:55,628 --> 01:18:57,118
We were the experiment.

785
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:01,133
Your connection, mother to child.

786
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:05,069
Like an invisible tissue.
We can even measure its energy.

787
01:19:05,137 --> 01:19:08,595
But we don't fully understand it,
so I posed the question:

788
01:19:09,141 --> 01:19:12,645
"Can it be dissolved?"
And it can.

789
01:19:12,645 --> 01:19:14,169
Except for you.

790
01:19:15,147 --> 01:19:17,650
Give me back my son...

791
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,652
...and I'll do whatever you want.

792
01:19:19,652 --> 01:19:24,089
What I want, Telly,
is for you to forget your son.

793
01:19:24,657 --> 01:19:26,921
-To forget Sam.
-No.

794
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:30,390
If you don't, this experiment will fail.

795
01:19:30,663 --> 01:19:32,563
I'm accountable.

796
01:19:32,665 --> 01:19:34,667
I can't let that happen.

797
01:19:34,667 --> 01:19:36,498
And time is running out.

798
01:19:37,169 --> 01:19:38,500
I won't help you.

799
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:41,537
There are worse things
than forgetting.

800
01:19:42,174 --> 01:19:44,176
No, there aren't.

801
01:19:44,176 --> 01:19:49,443
You need to forget.

802
01:20:37,229 --> 01:20:39,993
You're different from the others.

803
01:20:40,733 --> 01:20:42,530
Why?

804
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:48,240
It's better this way.

805
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,538
You won't be haunted
by his memory.

806
01:20:50,743 --> 01:20:52,973
You could have a life again.

807
01:20:54,246 --> 01:20:59,707
Now, I want you to go back
to that first day in the hospital.

808
01:20:59,752 --> 01:21:04,382
To the first time you ever saw Sam.

809
01:21:11,764 --> 01:21:13,925
I need that first memory.

810
01:21:18,771 --> 01:21:21,831
Give me that first memory.

811
01:21:36,789 --> 01:21:40,225
That boy. What was his name?

812
01:21:44,296 --> 01:21:46,059
What boy?

813
01:22:19,331 --> 01:22:22,198
I had life inside of me.

814
01:22:25,838 --> 01:22:29,934
I had life.

815
01:22:33,345 --> 01:22:36,371
I have a child.

816
01:22:39,351 --> 01:22:42,081
I have a son.

817
01:22:43,355 --> 01:22:45,414
I...

818
01:22:45,858 --> 01:22:48,019
...have a son.

819
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:53,354
His name is Sam,
you son of a bitch.

820
01:23:00,873 --> 01:23:02,636
I need more time.

821
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:30,596
Sam!

822
01:23:34,907 --> 01:23:36,169
Sam!

823
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:50,911
Sam! Sam!

824
01:23:53,926 --> 01:23:56,156
Sam Paretta, do you know him?

825
01:23:56,428 --> 01:23:58,191
Sam!

826
01:24:09,942 --> 01:24:11,933
Hey, Mom.

827
01:24:13,445 --> 01:24:15,106
It's not time to go yet, is it?

828
01:24:34,466 --> 01:24:36,457
Mom, I can't breathe.

829
01:24:39,471 --> 01:24:42,736
I'm sorry. I just....

830
01:24:43,475 --> 01:24:47,104
-I just wanted you to button up.
-Can I play till 5:30?

831
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,811
-Yeah.
-Okay.

832
01:24:49,982 --> 01:24:52,985
-Yeah, 5:30's okay.
-Okay. Thanks.

833
01:24:52,985 --> 01:24:54,384
See you.

834
01:24:55,988 --> 01:24:57,216
See you.

835
01:25:03,996 --> 01:25:06,829
Hi, Lauren.

836
01:25:30,522 --> 01:25:32,456
Hi.

837
01:25:32,524 --> 01:25:34,219
Hi.

838
01:25:39,531 --> 01:25:41,362
I guess they....

839
01:25:42,534 --> 01:25:45,867
-They don't want parents around.
-No.

840
01:25:50,542 --> 01:25:52,669
You keep watching him.

841
01:25:53,045 --> 01:25:54,979
It's hard not to.

842
01:25:57,049 --> 01:25:58,277
They're okay.

843
01:26:02,054 --> 01:26:03,612
I know.

844
01:26:06,558 --> 01:26:10,426
I'm Telly. Sam's mom.

845
01:26:11,563 --> 01:26:14,828
I'm Ash. I think we met before.
