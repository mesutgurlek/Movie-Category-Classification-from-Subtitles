1
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:52,813
- What can I get for you?
- Just a burger and a drink, please.

2
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,386
How do you want that burger done?

3
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,251
It doesn't matter.

4
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,690
Okay, that'll be 4 bucks.

5
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,365
- You want that for here?
- No.

6
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,272
Okay, we'll bring that right out to you.

7
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,003
Mommy, why does that girI's face
look like that?

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,071
You eat your food, honey.

9
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,982
- Did she get into an accident?
- Yes. Eat your food.

10
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,940
Stop looking at me! Stop looking at me!

11
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,245
I know what I look like.

12
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,911
You think I chose to look like this?
You think I chose this?

13
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:57,839
The Han dynasty, during their rule,
would sometimes leave their enemies alive,

14
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,981
disfiguring them
in a most grotesque manner.

15
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,377
It was a message to all those
who would oppose their rule

16
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:11,255
that you would die,
or carry the scars of your defiance.

17
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,526
They understood the psychologicaI effect
this would have on the masses.

18
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,730
There was a price to pay for your actions.

19
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:26,531
By the time they were through with you,
death would be a welcome friend.

20
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,534
Have your daddy pick me up a slushy
when he gets off work, okay?

21
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,710
Make it a cherry one.

22
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:41,445
Bradley, I've told you a million times,
leave Ravi alone and find another seat.

23
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:46,592
Well, as I entered the classroom,
this was the only seat available.

24
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,985
Then switch with Bernard.

25
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:05,603
Continuing on, talking about the
importance of the Chinese ancient mindset

26
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,547
that they were into this whole idea
of cosmic retribution.

27
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,720
I got us the hottest costumes for the party.

28
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:18,154
They scream,
"We love sex, but not with you. "

29
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,057
- We're so vain.
- I'm totally okay with that.

30
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,892
- So, who's throwing this party anyways?
- Probably Stephanie.

31
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,956
She keeps trying to win us over
so that we'll be her friend.

32
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,432
She's such a loser.

33
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:33,302
Awesome, so we'll drink her booze,
trash her place and still ignore her ass.

34
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,807
You realize
we're all going to hell someday, right?

35
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,811
And we'll be the hottest bitches there, too.

36
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,374
That's the plan.

37
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,946
Oh, my God.

38
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,887
There's that little bitch, Emily.
Let's fuck with her.

39
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,480
Hey, sexy girI.

40
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,785
- So, going to the costume party next week?
- No.

41
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,158
Come on, it'll be so much fun.

42
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,221
Maybe you can even
get your cherry popped.

43
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,531
- Yeah, some guys like freaks.
- Yeah, Emily, don't you want to have fun?

44
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,528
- I wasn't invited.
- What?

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,573
You mean,
we were invited and you were not?

46
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,748
I don't understand. I mean, look at you.
How could that be?

47
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,476
Why are you always so mean to me?
I've never done anything to you.

48
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,351
We're not being mean. We're being honest.

49
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,992
You know, I think you'd actually like me
if you just gave me a chance.

50
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,795
I doubt it.

51
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,466
Oh, my God, you're not gonna cry, are you?

52
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,066
- Oh, my God.
- Don't go. Be our friend.

53
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,003
Howdy.

54
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,646
Hey, is Workley around?

55
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,042
Passed away about eight months ago.

56
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,416
I'm his nephew.
He left me the house in his will.

57
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,187
Well, I'm sorry for your loss, son.

58
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,723
My name's Parker.

59
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,494
- I'm Dane.
- Dane. Nice to meet you.

60
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,000
Eight months. Don't that beat all?

61
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,010
You know, he and I were both in Vietnam.

62
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,144
We shared a lot of stories.

63
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:07,287
So, you and your friends doing some work
around the grounds?

64
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,020
Yeah.

65
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,365
Yeah, just getting the place ready.

66
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,059
It's a mighty fine picking.

67
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, if you need anything,
I'm just a mile or so down here.

68
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,872
Thanks. Appreciate it.

69
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,077
You know,
I don't mean to stick my nose in it,

70
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,143
but that plan of yours,
it's never gonna work.

71
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,750
- Sorry?
- Trap.

72
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,626
The tops are too sturdy.
They'll walk right over it.

73
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,960
What you need are cage traps.
I got plenty of them.

74
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,460
Yeah.

75
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,700
Yeah, maybe. Thanks.

76
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,898
Just offering.

77
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,755
Hey, Ravi.

78
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,253
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

79
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,891
I think it's...

80
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,536
Gruesome, disgusting.

81
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,736
It's perfect.

82
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,376
We'll pick up the partiers in the truck
and bring them to the house.

83
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,217
Triplets will be on ATVs in the woods
wearing the same costumes as us.

84
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,121
- Nobody escapes.
- I think it's brilliant.

85
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,590
I mean,
all the years of watching horror films,

86
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,924
what can be better than
to put it all to use?

87
00:08:56,803 --> 00:09:00,432
I think I know the perfect way
to use Jack's banjo skills.

88
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:06,007
Dude, what? Can you smell it?
Can you smell it?

89
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,880
You're killing me.

90
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,457
- Dude.
- He's fucking coming over here, man.

91
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,193
- Dude.
- Trying to come over here?

92
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,030
Go back to India, bitch.

93
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,502
Bernard, I believe this is yours.

94
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,171
Thank you, come again.

95
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,708
- Sorry.
- Go back to your seat.

96
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,386
We have no hummus here for you.

97
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,517
Don't worry about it, man.

98
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,332
- Yo, my peoples, what's up?
- Hey, Kurtis.

99
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,562
Check it.
I just got my first commerciaI TV gig.

100
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,763
You're looking at the new face
of Yums shoes.

101
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,740
Video shoot over at their spot on Friday.
I want you guys to come check it out.

102
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,243
- That's great news.
- Hey, you never know.

103
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,802
Next time you guys see me,

104
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,441
I'll be at the Oscars
accepting my award for best actor.

105
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,451
Ravi, I remember you got that sweet camera
for your birthday.

106
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,818
Can I get you to, you know, shoot
some behind-the-scenes stuff for me?

107
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,050
- Help me out?
- Yeah, sure.

108
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,426
Nice. All right, so I'll see you guys there?

109
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,962
CooI. All right, y'all.

110
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,033
- I like Kurtis.
- Me, too.

111
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,363
- Make sure he doesn't make the party.
- Yeah.

112
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,771
He's not one of them.

113
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,609
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

114
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,238
What's up? Hey, look, I want you guys
to come out. I'm doing a video shoot.

115
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,959
Look.

116
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,737
Oh, my God.

117
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,475
I cannot wait untiI the party next week.

118
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:25,314
- What?
- You're fucking Tommy.

119
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,883
- Who told you that?
- It's in your cell phone, stupid.

120
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,389
"I can't wait to taste you again. "

121
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,860
You bitch. Give me that.

122
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,561
- That is so shitty.
- Take it easy.

123
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,600
We've been besties since grade schooI.
Can't believe you didn't tell us.

124
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:45,399
He made me promise not to tell anybody,
and you can't either.

125
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:49,464
You know, we have to keep it quiet
since he's still dating Nadya.

126
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:54,537
- I'm gonna go see him tonight.
- We're just playing. We won't tell.

127
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,743
Besides, Tommy's kind of hot.

128
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,746
I hate that Russian bitch anyways.
I'm glad you're fucking her man.

129
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,255
AII's fair in sex and high schooI.

130
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,761
"I find that I am quite content.

131
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,091
"I have peace in my life,

132
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,532
"and I am not afraid.

133
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,040
"For the first time, I am not afraid. "

134
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,310
Yeah, Mom?

135
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,542
What's with the boxes?
I noticed you packed up some things.

136
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,517
Just cleaning up a bit.

137
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,822
Is everything okay?
You've been very quiet lately.

138
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,916
- Yes, everything's fine.
- Okay.

139
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,135
"One night.

140
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,335
"One finaI night. "

141
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:06,014
I just... Look, I really appreciate
you guys coming, man. It means a lot.

142
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,347
- Anytime, man.
- Man.

143
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,115
Now, let me clean the lens off reaI quick.

144
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,849
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

145
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,891
You must be pretty nervous, huh?

146
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,351
A little bit. I'll find the courage, though.

147
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,092
Snap!

148
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,100
What do we have here, son, huh?
If it isn't the Slumdog Millionaire.

149
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,968
What's up, bin Laden?

150
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,037
- I'm Indian, not Arab.
- My bad. I'm sorry.

151
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,703
- No, it's a dot.
- Like it fucking even matters.

152
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,209
- What do you got there, sunshine, huh?
- Technology.

153
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,181
Give it. Give it.

154
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,777
Sunni's doing a little recon
for his terrorist cell. What you think?

155
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,877
- Joke's over.
- Joke's not over.

156
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:42,943
Just give it back.

157
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,014
- Looks like we got ourselves a terrorist.
- I caught me a terrorist, Bill.

158
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,117
- I got him. I got him.
- How'd you get him?

159
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,821
Well, he was looking
at my lockstock funny.

160
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,228
- You remember state?
- Fuck, yeah.

161
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,560
So close.

162
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,428
Bradley's at the 30! The 20!

163
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,397
- The 10!
- Go, go, go!

164
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:03,102
- Touchdown, Bradley.
- And the crowd goes wild.

165
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,175
- Why'd you do that?
- Easy, missy.

166
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,206
- 'Cause I felt like it.
- These things happen.

167
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,115
- Don't be so down.
- Ravi, they're starting.

168
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,918
- What's going on?
- Three peas in a pod.

169
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,287
- Just telling stories and hanging out.
- What happened to your camera?

170
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,286
- What happened?
- Did you guys break his camera?

171
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,328
- Is it busted? Did it bust?
- Hate to think, yeah.

172
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,693
- I remember.
- No, you...

173
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,856
Yeah, I did. I busted it.

174
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,025
The question is, what the fuck
are you gonna do about it, huh?

175
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,830
What the fuck are you gonna do about it?

176
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,933
I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what.

177
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:38,033
You kick my ass, I'll buy him a new camera.
How's that sound?

178
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,841
I can't beat you.

179
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,181
You can't beat me?
I know you can't beat me.

180
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,255
You know why?

181
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,992
'Cause you're a coward.

182
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,193
That's why.

183
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,058
You know why it is
that I do what I do to you?

184
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:08,203
Do you know? I do it because I know
that you can't stop me.

185
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,542
Get the fuck out of here.

186
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,448
- Let's leave these pussies.
- I believe this is yours.

187
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,502
Soon.

188
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,584
Individually, these chemicals are harmless,
but mixed together

189
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,653
form a compound which is caustic

190
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,352
and can eat through metaI.
It is actually quite dangerous.

191
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:08,029
So, your homework assignment is to find
two chemicals that share that property.

192
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,365
Man, I'm sorry.
I could not get the camera to work.

193
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,601
Man, don't trip, all right? It's not your fault.
You didn't do nothing.

194
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,674
It's about time somebody
put them fools on notice.

195
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,740
The time is now.

196
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,512
Yo, Bradley, let me holler at you.

197
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,260
- What's up?
- Look, man, you better leave my boy alone.

198
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,891
You better watch it.

199
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,845
You will not be afraid.

200
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,981
You will not be afraid.

201
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,882
When the time comes,

202
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,955
you will not be afraid.

203
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,472
Can I help you, Dad?

204
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,748
Dad, I left a letter in my room
explaining everything.

205
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,883
You don't have to worry about me.
I'll be okay.

206
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,597
I know you'll be mad,
but I did what I thought was right.

207
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:03,869
Anyway, I know you'll be fine,
and Mom, she'll be okay with you there.

208
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,037
Okay, then. Bye.

209
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,591
- How's this?
- Perfect.

210
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,527
- How many RSVP'd to the party?
- Everyone.

211
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,397
I knew we could use their egos
to our advantage.

212
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,375
It's gonna be a night they'll never forget.

213
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,577
- We'll be Internet legends.
- Yeah.

214
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,073
Hey, come check this out.

215
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,460
- Sweet mother of Jesus.
- Check this.

216
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,564
That is hard core.

217
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,407
I think I know what hell is.

218
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,842
Hell is waking up every day

219
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,788
believing that the suffering
you're doing in life has meaning.

220
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,925
That somehow, if you endure it,

221
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,630
you gain valuable lessons.

222
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,797
The truth is, sometimes you just suffer.

223
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,901
There is no meaning.

224
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,369
We're just pawns

225
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,112
in a sick game of random chance.

226
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,577
Chaos.

227
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,090
My hell, silence.

228
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,653
The kind of silence
that makes your ears ring.

229
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,223
Be glad for it.

230
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:15,674
Mine's listening to my mom and dad
fight day after day.

231
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,102
Crashing plates.

232
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,808
Screeching tires.

233
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,479
Crying.

234
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,953
I fucking hate the crying.
I could use some silence.

235
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,618
Think we're going to hell?

236
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,521
No.

237
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,698
We've suffered enough.

238
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,129
We're doing God's work,
as far as I'm concerned.

239
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,406
Bring some justice into the world.

240
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,677
I can't wait.

241
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,981
I've been more at peace
ever since we first talked about this.

242
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,620
We'll all be at peace tomorrow.

243
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,018
Amongst other things.

244
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,567
- I'm not gonna go.
- Why?

245
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,432
Because I don't feeI good and I feeI fat.

246
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,101
Heather, you're such a drama queen.
You look great.

247
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,475
Well, yeah, but I really don't feeI good.

248
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,440
- And my stomach hurts.
- I told you not to eat that burger.

249
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:35,920
Red meat is for people who don't care
how they look, not hot chicks like us.

250
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,854
I think I'm gonna die.

251
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,654
If you don't go, we don't go.

252
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:47,595
Come on, you'll feeI way better
after a night of drinking and hot sex.

253
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,934
Okay, but if the party's lame,
we can leave early, right?

254
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:55,235
Honey, that's what the dream police do.
We break up bad parties.

255
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,776
Come on, let's go turn some heads.

256
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,329
Crap, I don't see anybody.
I know we're at the right place.

257
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,466
It's Edgar and Matty.

258
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,134
Hey, Nadya.

259
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,805
- What's up, guys?
- Tommy, what's up?

260
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,537
How's it going? Pirates, huh?

261
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,070
Lord,

262
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,574
we understand what we're about to do.

263
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,315
And with one sign from you, right now,

264
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,882
we will call off our plans.

265
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,891
We offer you this finaI chance.

266
00:23:56,101 --> 00:24:01,038
So now you know, Lord, the fate of
those who are about to come here tonight.

267
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,370
And we leave their lives in your hands.

268
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,846
Man, it's too bad Riggs couldn't make it.

269
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,944
Man, that boy's got his priorities
all jacked up, all right.

270
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:20,481
First of all, if it was me, I'd quit that shit job
a hell of a long time ago, all right?

271
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,995
Tonight is what? It's time to party, right?

272
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,295
- It's time to party, baby!
- Hell, yeah!

273
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,833
Party our asses off.
You know what I'm saying.

274
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,737
- Fuck.
- Shit.

275
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,334
Fuck. Roll down the window, man.

276
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:43,211
- Shit, man, we are going to fucking jaiI.
- Shut up, all right?

277
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:47,412
- Roll them the fuck down.
- Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

278
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,111
Oh, my God, dude.

279
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,986
- Get the fucking window down.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

280
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,857
- All right. He's getting out, he's getting out.
- Hey, hey, hey, calm down, calm down.

281
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,691
- I got this.
- Shut up.

282
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:02,325
- Just let me do all the talking, all right?
- Shut up. Shut your damn mouth.

283
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:08,365
Friends, Roman and countrymen,
how we doing this evening?

284
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,166
Just fine, Officer. How about yourself?

285
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,041
Well, I'm doing pretty good.
Thanks for asking.

286
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,271
Now I'll tell you why I pulled you over.

287
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,781
You was going about 15 miles per hour
over the speed limit.

288
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,879
Now that was why I pulled you over.

289
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,262
But why you're in trouble,
that's a whole other matter.

290
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:37,725
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

291
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:41,102
You don't understand... You don't
understand what I'm talking about?

292
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,435
No, I...

293
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,176
Don't bullshit me, boy.

294
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,439
What, you think I wasn't young once?

295
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,983
I know what it's like to chase the puss
and get high.

296
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,382
- What are you looking at?
- Sorry.

297
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,889
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we try a little honesty?

298
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:05,288
All right. Honestly, this is my brother's car.
He smokes a lot of pot.

299
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:09,028
We don't smoke that...
We don't smoke pot at all, do we?

300
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,261
- Do we, boys?
- No, sir.

301
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,666
- There's no pot.
- Never.

302
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,864
- No pot-smoking in this car.
- No, sir.

303
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,137
- You expect me to believe that?
- Yeah, I was kind of hoping so.

304
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:23,513
Well, I don't. So I tell you what.
I'm gonna give you one chance.

305
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,143
If I hear anything but
the truth, you boys...

306
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,814
You're gonna be in for a long night.

307
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,493
Yes, Officer, we've been smoking.

308
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:42,531
That wasn't so bad now, was it?
So I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

309
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,894
You're gonna hand over all the weed
right now.

310
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,277
Who's got the weed?

311
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,475
- Now.
- Give it to him, dude!

312
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,211
We got the weed, okay.

313
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,549
There's all of it.

314
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,328
Today's your lucky day.

315
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,024
You know why?
'Cause I'm feeling Christ-like,

316
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:20,468
and I think that I am gonna forgive
all of your sins on this fine evening.

317
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:24,441
- Thank you, Officer. We appreciate it.
- But I'll tell you what.

318
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,245
Next time you boys
come through Rocky Branch,

319
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,510
- know whose town you're in.
- Yes, sir, we will.

320
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,026
- Dude, that was so fucking close.
- Oh, my God, dude.

321
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,995
- Can you believe that?
- I am freaking bugging out, man.

322
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:49,295
- You kidding me?
- Luck has got everything to do with it.

323
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,062
He didn't get all the weed, bitches.

324
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,702
- Shit.
- Yeah, this is gonna be our lucky night.

325
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,580
Come on, let's go!

326
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:40,084
- Get that party started up.
- Yeah.

327
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,643
- Fuck, yeah!
- There she goes.

328
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:27,960
- Give me an "O." Give me an "O."
- All right.

329
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:32,800
Look at those breasts bouncing over there.
Those are beautifuI to me, to my eyes.

330
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,170
Is that... Is that a stripper? Riggs!

331
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,738
You son of a bitch.

332
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,446
- Hey, I thought you were at work.
- I was working.

333
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,450
But the truck we were supposed to load
never showed up,

334
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,419
so my boss said, "There's nothing to do,
go home. " What did I do?

335
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:52,116
- Came to party with my boys!
- Came to party with the boys!

336
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,488
Hey, hey, hey, boys, boys, boys.

337
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,892
- Drinks. Let's get them in him.
- Let's get them in him!

338
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,623
Party!

339
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,532
So, look, basically, after that,
I've made it, right?

340
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,634
Shit, man. Kurtis is here.

341
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,904
- How'd he get in?
- I didn't see him get into the truck.

342
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,881
We can't let him leave.

343
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,947
- But he wasn't invited.
- Well, then, fate brought him here.

344
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,289
- Let me go talk to him...
- No.

345
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,485
Okay, he's here and he stays.

346
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,455
Fine.

347
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,764
It's time.

348
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,326
You know what to do. Nobody leaves.

349
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,364
- Let's take some shots, B!
- Fuck, yeah, yeah.

350
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,534
What the... Why the fuck am I tied up?

351
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,641
Get up, sleepyheads.

352
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:48,014
What kind of bullshit is this?

353
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,249
Take a moment and clear your heads.

354
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,188
What is this?
Some kind of haunted house thing?

355
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,496
There's actually a good explanation
for all this.

356
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,435
Man, this is kinky.

357
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,439
Now that everybody is awake, let's begin.

358
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:22,010
There's some good news
and there's some bad news.

359
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,886
The good news is, we don't plan to kill you.

360
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:32,261
The bad news is, you will wish we had.

361
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,961
Some of you will be spared,

362
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:45,342
but you will all bear witness to the horror,
just as you did in the hallways,

363
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:50,938
just as you sat idly by
as pain was inflicted upon us.

364
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:58,280
What you fail to understand with reason,
you will with wrath.

365
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,993
Dude, what the fuck are you talking about?

366
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,965
I'll tell you what I'm talking about, Miles.

367
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,630
This is about what you are due.

368
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:19,201
When we are done,
you'll have a new perspective on life.

369
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:25,178
And no one, no one will ever look upon you
the same again.

370
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,678
You will forever be changed.

371
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,014
Yeah.
That's what I said to your mom last night.

372
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,726
What my friend has there is a cattle gun.

373
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:44,592
It's used to kill cattle
by blasting a spike into their brain.

374
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,634
It's considered humane,
but I'll let you decide.

375
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,680
Dude, get that shit out of my face.

376
00:36:56,748 --> 00:37:00,206
Look, who the fuck are you people?
This shit is stupid.

377
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:20,600
- Do I have your attention now?
- Why us?

378
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,799
Why us?

379
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:31,142
You know, that's the same question
we've been asking ourselves for years.

380
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,478
"Why us?"

381
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,883
Why us, always on the receiving end
of your taunts,

382
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,286
your laughter and your childish cruelty?

383
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:46,394
Now it's your turn to ask, "Why us?"

384
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,032
Who are you?

385
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:55,666
It's a little late
for you to get to know us now.

386
00:37:55,907 --> 00:38:01,846
But if you must know,
we are the rejected, the humiliated.

387
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,511
We are the outcasts.

388
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,447
And tonight is our night, so relax.

389
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,556
It's the only thing you can do.

390
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,440
Anybody want to leave?

391
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,979
Come on. Anyone?

392
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,846
Anyone feeling heroic?

393
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,883
Tommy, you want to leave?

394
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,485
Yeah.

395
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,424
I want to take Nadya with me.

396
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,501
You are in no position to bargain.

397
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,767
And you should be worrying
about yourself, not her.

398
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,277
Release him.

399
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,310
Listen, I'm gonna get help.
I'm gonna get help.

400
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:22,558
I'll get help, okay? You'll be okay.
You're gonna be okay...

401
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,843
In front of you, Tommy, is a door.

402
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:46,474
Outside that door is two miles of woods
that lead to a highway right into town.

403
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,512
Good luck, because you will be hunted.

404
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,961
I'll go get help for you guys.

405
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,065
Go get it, then. That's the spirit, Tommy.
Go get them.

406
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,668
Love you, Nadya.

407
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:26,256
Pathetic, isn't it?
So sweet and so much love.

408
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:31,258
Not when you consider
he was cheating on you, Nadya.

409
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,959
With Heather.

410
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,298
Yeah. Yeah. Everybody knew about it,

411
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,868
but they decided to laugh at you
behind your back,

412
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:46,909
taking joy in your ignorance.

413
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,541
Interesting friends.

414
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,481
I want you to think real hard
and ask yourselves,

415
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,781
"Where did all this evil come from?

416
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:50,364
"What did I do to make someone hate me
so much to go to these lengths?"

417
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:57,065
Think of this as the final,

418
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,937
and there's only one question.

419
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,915
"What did I do to deserve this?"

420
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:18,591
This is messed up, man. This is messed up!
This ain't right.

421
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,291
I want these chains off of me!

422
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:31,305
What gives you the right to judge us, huh?

423
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,038
What gives you the right to play God?

424
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:41,718
You know, Bradley,
that's real funny coming from you.

425
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:47,183
But to answer your question,

426
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:51,392
God gave us the right.

427
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,230
We gave him a chance to stop this.

428
00:43:57,168 --> 00:44:01,036
We gave him a chance to save all of you.

429
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:04,303
But he chose to remain silent.

430
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,242
Go to hell.

431
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:11,412
I'm already there.

432
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:18,649
While you ponder your little situation,

433
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:23,282
I have a little treat for you. Enjoy.

434
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,163
Fuck you. Get that shit out of my face, man.

435
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,001
Come on, fucker!
I'm not scared of you, bitch! Come on!

436
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,763
You want to fucking kill me, huh?

437
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,737
You fucking kill me, you motherfucker!

438
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,113
Bernard!

439
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,500
You killed him.

440
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:02,617
What did you give him?
What'd you put in him?

441
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:07,128
I didn't know you cared
so much about him, Bradley.

442
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,191
You know,
for a person who cares so deeply,

443
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,862
you really talk a lot of
shit behind his back.

444
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,809
But that's not what's important.

445
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:25,547
What is important is that he's alive.

446
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:30,645
He can't move, but he can feel,

447
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:35,052
so I'm sure he appreciates
your love and concern.

448
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,689
Don't do it.

449
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:24,134
Deeper, deeper, deeper.

450
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,256
Please. Please, stop.

451
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:37,203
Enough! Please. Please.

452
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:29,932
I have to admit,
that was a stellar performance.

453
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,987
You! You gave him the key.

454
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:39,224
He's the only one who ever stood up for me.
We agreed not to hurt him.

455
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,690
Wrong.

456
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:47,096
We were the only ones
who stood up for you. You betrayed us.

457
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:13,954
What did you do?

458
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,334
Consequences.

459
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:22,838
None of us are free from them.

460
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,672
- Help! Help!
- What the fuck?

461
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,105
Help, help!

462
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,237
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey.
Stay back. Stay back!

463
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,176
- Look, man, they're killing people.
- Who's killing people?

464
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:04,578
- What're you talking about?
- Just get some help!

465
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,809
- Get some help for what?
- They're killing people back there.

466
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,784
Who is killing people?

467
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:36,746
Emily, it's time.

468
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,754
He didn't have a right to do this.

469
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:52,193
Ravi should have made his choice.

470
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:03,472
We have to finish what we started.

471
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,906
It's what Ravi would have wanted.

472
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:41,303
Please. Please let her go.
We'll do whatever you want. Just please...

473
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,372
What are you doing to her?

474
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,309
It's a special compound we made up.

475
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,848
At first, she won't feel anything
but a cool sensation,

476
00:54:56,393 --> 00:55:00,090
then a slight tingle, then a mild burn.

477
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:06,360
Soon enough,
it will begin to eat away at her flesh,

478
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:10,465
dissolving it ever so slowly

479
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:15,100
in the most painful way imaginable.

480
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:21,216
And she will become outside
what she is on the inside.

481
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,518
Disgusting.

482
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:45,402
You will all be happy to know
that Kurtis was able to get some help.

483
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:53,739
But the bad news is, the cop won't be
busting through the door, guns blazing.

484
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,782
He apparently took a bullet to the head.

485
00:55:58,422 --> 00:55:59,616
Coward!

486
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,923
You coward.

487
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:11,624
You're a coward,
standing up there hiding behind that mask.

488
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:18,237
I'm not hiding behind this mask.

489
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:24,170
This is a reflection
of what you turned me into.

490
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,976
This is what I am on the inside.

491
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,650
I am a monster that you created.

492
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,466
Take off that mask.

493
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,468
Show me your face.

494
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,243
Fair enough.

495
00:56:56,446 --> 00:57:00,246
You should know who's about to alter
the course of your life.

496
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,027
You?

497
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,308
You know, the irony of all this,

498
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,542
you actually empowered me.

499
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:47,054
I would have lived my life
all alone in the shadows, unassuming.

500
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:57,206
But you, you wouldn't allow me to do that.

501
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,102
You had to torture me.

502
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:08,518
You have nobody to blame for this
but yourself.

503
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,934
Open up, please. Open up.
I need some help.

504
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:29,997
Open up, please.

505
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,936
What the hell are you doing
banging on my door?

506
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,341
- Please, sir, I just need some help.
- Drop your gun.

507
00:58:35,412 --> 00:58:37,243
- Look, they're killing everybody.
- Shut up, punk.

508
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:38,713
- Look, please just...
- I said shut up.

509
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:41,148
Now turn around.
Put your hands above your head.

510
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:45,086
- Man, there's still time to save everybody.
- I told you once, I told you too often.

511
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,879
Don't do this.

512
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:28,695
Don't hurt me, please.

513
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,290
Don't hurt me, please.

514
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,407
Don't beg. Don't give them the pleasure.

515
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:41,440
Please don't hurt me.

516
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,443
I know who you are.

517
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,916
You're that girI from schooI, Emily.

518
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,777
Now I'm Emily.

519
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,096
I'm Andy.

520
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,606
And I'm Jack.

521
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:58,448
Are you doing this to get even with us?

522
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:02,624
For how we treated you?

523
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:08,129
Can you think of a better reason?

524
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,557
I'm sorry for what we did.

525
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,001
You didn't deserve it.

526
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,401
I didn't.

527
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:24,111
Hurting us won't make you feeI better.
It won't fix anything.

528
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:30,079
Please, just end it now.

529
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,245
Let us all go.

530
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,221
Since you apologized,

531
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:47,396
I won't hurt you.

532
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,538
Thank you.

533
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:57,876
But for my generosity,
you must do me a favor.

534
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:04,046
I'm gonna need you
to cut all of Bradley's fingers off.

535
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,185
I can't.

536
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:19,932
Either way, he gets what is due him.

537
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,902
You do it,

538
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,269
or we do it.

539
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,149
It's the only way you can save yourself.

540
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,957
I can't do this. I can't hurt anyone.

541
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,801
Sure you can.

542
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:55,402
You hurt me.

543
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:02,707
Without even blinking an eye.

544
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:06,348
I can't, I just can't.

545
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,849
That's really a shame.

546
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:18,694
I bet Bradley would cut your fingers off
to save himself.

547
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,403
Wouldn't you?

548
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,667
What do you say, Bradley?

549
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:41,611
Save yourself from unimaginable pain

550
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,717
by inflicting it.

551
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,458
No.

552
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:59,330
Bradley, please don't. Please.

553
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:06,804
Bradley, it's you or her.

554
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,045
I know you'll need those fingers
to play football.

555
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:24,417
What would your life be
without people cheering you on?

556
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:40,534
Hey, wake up.

557
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:50,717
Sir, we could still save them.

558
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:54,223
Only person we need to think about saving
is yourself.

559
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:58,291
- Please, just call the police.
- No. You gotta understand something.

560
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:02,024
Anytime you show up on my property
with a gun in your hand and try to rob me,

561
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:04,225
- there are consequences.
- Sir, I was not trying to rob you.

562
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,928
- I was just trying to get some help.
- Sure.

563
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:10,163
You came here in the middle of the night
with a gun in your hand to ask for help.

564
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,969
Happens all the time.

565
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,475
You know what those military medals
are for, boy?

566
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:18,878
For not being stupid.
I was a fine, fine soldier.

567
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:23,515
If it weren't for those politicians
without any backbone,

568
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,714
we would have won that war
and I'd be a generaI by now.

569
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:31,351
- Look, just let me go and I can help them.
- Imagine.

570
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:37,092
Fighting a war, bleeding for your country,

571
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:43,866
only to be treated like a maggot by the very
nation that sent you there in the first place.

572
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,000
You understand what I'm saying?
I was a hero.

573
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,434
I saved lives.

574
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:53,273
Look, and you can be a hero again.
Just call the police.

575
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:54,745
In time.

576
01:05:55,752 --> 01:05:58,380
First we gotta figure out who you are.

577
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,469
Pick them up.

578
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,874
Bradley. Bradley!

579
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,074
Please.

580
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:32,254
Please, please, no!

581
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:42,492
- I have to.
- No. No!

582
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:45,933
They're gonna hurt me if I don't.

583
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,135
They're gonna hurt me.

584
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,905
Bradley.

585
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,145
Show some fortitude.

586
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:12,116
- No!
- Get started, man. I'm waiting on you.

587
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,791
Attaboy, Bradley.

588
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:52,427
I knew you could do it.
I knew you could hurt someone else.

589
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,733
One down,

590
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,042
nine more fingers to go.

591
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,948
Ain't got all night.

592
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,609
Do you want him to stop?

593
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:43,175
All you have to do is find it in yourself
to inflict pain.

594
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,014
Can you do that?

595
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,290
See?

596
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:03,198
We all have a point
when we can do the unimaginable.

597
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:19,148
Look, if you'll just call the police,
I'll confess to them.

598
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,121
All in good time, boy.

599
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,596
You know, my grandfather was in Vietnam.

600
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,937
My dad was two
when he was gunned down in the jungle.

601
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,495
Is that right?

602
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:41,398
You're not the only one
who's made sacrifices for his country.

603
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:43,570
My dad was in Desert Storm.

604
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:48,948
He came back with that Gulf strain.
He was never the same since.

605
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,385
How do I know you're telling the truth?

606
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,494
I don't know how to prove it to you, sir,
but I'm telling you the truth.

607
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,756
And I'm telling you the truth when I say

608
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:01,888
there's some kids that need your help.

609
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,489
Look, we were at this party down the road.
They drugged us.

610
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:08,367
- We don't know...
- You mean the Workley place. Yeah.

611
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:13,568
I met that kid. Dane. He's a nice kid.

612
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,236
Dane.

613
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,645
Now for a little mood music.

614
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,481
Jack, lights, please.

615
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,561
Emily.

616
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:19,235
I think she needs a little bit of inspiration.
Don't you?

617
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,711
I don't want to hurt him.

618
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:36,081
He deserves it.

619
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:43,054
- This can't be happening.
- It is.

620
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:52,840
You have about two minutes
before your skin begins to dissolve.

621
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:58,545
Cut off his fingers
and I'll remove the compound. Hurry.

622
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:03,850
Just do it.

623
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:13,686
No.

624
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:16,990
No!

625
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,191
I won't do it.

626
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:26,969
I don't care how much you hurt me,
I won't hurt my friends.

627
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:36,378
I appreciate your loyalty,
but you'll have to suffer for it.

628
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,400
Yes, please send some officers down to
the Workley residence. We got some hot...

629
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,338
There are some niggers
robbing the Workley place.

630
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,706
They got guns and all kinds of shit.
Send everybody.

631
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,636
Do you know my name?

632
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:50,903
Do you know my name?

633
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,542
You don't even know my name, do you?

634
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,656
My name is Dane,

635
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:13,199
and you've tortured me since we were kids.

636
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,364
Please.

637
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,835
Please don't hurt me anymore.

638
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,175
Don't hurt me anymore.

639
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,278
You're a reaI coward, huh? You know that?

640
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:33,588
And do you know why I'm gonna hurt you?

641
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:39,324
'Cause you can't stop me.

642
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,327
Any of that ring a bell, Brad?

643
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:49,528
Please don't cut off my fingers.
Don't you cut off my fingers.

644
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:58,209
Please, don't you cut off my fingers!
Don't you cut off my fingers!

645
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:03,011
Please, don't cut them off,
don't cut them off, don't cut them off!

646
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,813
Bradley, Bradley. Okay.

647
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:13,484
Okay, I won't cut off your fingers.

648
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:25,766
But here's the thing. I think that this world
will be better off without you.

649
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,274
But since I promised that I won't kill you,

650
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:36,785
I'll just make sure
that you can't do harm ever again.

651
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,024
I'm sorry.

652
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,224
- What?
- I'm sorry.

653
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:52,430
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

654
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:56,835
- You're sorry?
- I am sorry. I'm sorry. I am sorry.

655
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:59,169
- Oh, are you sorry, Brad?
- I'm sorry.

656
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:03,405
You're only sorry
because you have no choice but to be sorry.

657
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:06,342
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

658
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:09,350
And that means, Brad, that you're not sorry.

659
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:20,927
I spent a great deaI of time thinking about
how I'd like to get even with you,

660
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,627
and no matter what I came up with,

661
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:32,267
I just didn't feeI satisfied.

662
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:38,241
The anger and the hatred
that you poured into me for years

663
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,309
made it impossible.

664
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,355
But I came up with a way, Bradley.

665
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:56,522
I came up with a way to take everything
that you love away from you.

666
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:07,273
You will never, ever enjoy sex again.

667
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:13,641
You'll never, ever play football again.

668
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:20,052
And you,

669
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:29,894
you will spend the rest
of your little pathetic life

670
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:37,867
confined to a wheelchair!

671
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,704
Remember biology, Bradley?

672
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:49,016
Remember we learned that if somebody
severed the human spinaI cord,

673
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,575
they'll become instantly paralyzed?

674
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,080
No. No, you probably
don't remember that lesson

675
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:01,790
'cause you were too busy
devising ways to fuck me and my friends!

676
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,664
Well, guess what, Brad? Guess what?

677
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:14,604
I did some devising of my own.

678
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:32,292
Every time you hoist yourself into
that wheelchair, I want you to think of me.

679
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:35,024
Smiling.

680
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,534
In a short time,

681
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:00,105
the sun will come up
and this will all be over.

682
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:05,714
You don't know it just yet,
but you have all been a part of history.

683
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:08,688
The events of tonight will live on forever.

684
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,193
We gave meaning to all your lives tonight.

685
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:18,399
No thank you necessary.

686
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:20,494
Sicko.

687
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:24,930
You're all going to jaiI.

688
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:29,067
No.

689
01:22:32,214 --> 01:22:33,704
No, we're not.

690
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:39,610
Do you remember
when we were sophomores, Riggs,

691
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,851
and you offered me a ride home
because it started to rain?

692
01:22:42,925 --> 01:22:44,790
What does that matter?

693
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,954
Well, that's just it, Riggs.

694
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:52,155
That one act of kindness

695
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:55,993
is a reason why I considered
letting you go,

696
01:22:56,171 --> 01:23:00,301
- why I hadn't cut out your tongue.
- I don't care what you do to me!

697
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:02,867
Fuck you, Dane!

698
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:05,577
Fuck all you bastards!

699
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:16,388
You really do have a big mouth,
huh, Riggs?

700
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:25,725
I appreciate your courage
in the face of danger.

701
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:29,771
There is something to be said
about defiance.

702
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,639
There's nobility to it.

703
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,607
And there's a price to pay.

704
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:50,120
Shouldn't have opened your big fat mouth.

705
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,999
I got two of them.

706
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:07,873
You're crazy, old man.

707
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,013
Hey, kid, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

708
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:15,947
It's cooI.

709
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:19,245
You come banging on my door at 5:00 in
the morning with a gun in your hand,

710
01:24:19,321 --> 01:24:21,289
I might not believe you, either.

711
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:28,626
Let me ask you something.
Is it all true about your pa?

712
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:32,062
About being in the military
and everything?

713
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:35,200
No, I made all that bullshit up.

714
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:39,272
My dad works for a steeI mill.
His dad worked for a steeI mill.

715
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:43,739
I just don't want to end up
doing the same thing, you know?

716
01:24:44,613 --> 01:24:48,913
Yeah. Well, it's all the same.

717
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:55,720
But you gotta save those kids.
If you don't, you'll live to regret it.

718
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:58,657
Like I did.

719
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,127
I didn't save anybody.

720
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:04,658
I hid.

721
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:10,235
Just tried to save myself.
I watched my friends die.

722
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,973
I was just too scared.

723
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:18,646
Just hang in there, man.

724
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,240
Yeah.

725
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,385
Riggs, this is really gonna hurt you.

726
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:36,797
Good news is,
this can only happen once in a lifetime.

727
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,798
Let him go. Don't make me kill you, Dane.

728
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:48,307
I suggest you turn around and leave, Kurtis.
We have no issue with you.

729
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:51,675
Yeah, well, I got an issue with you.
I don't like being shot at.

730
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:55,444
You weren't invited to this party.
You shouldn't have come.

731
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:58,218
Fate brought me here, to stop you.

732
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:01,989
- Cut off his tongue.
- Do it and I'll kill both of you.

733
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:09,126
Fine. Kill us. We had no plans of living
after today, anyway.

734
01:26:10,232 --> 01:26:12,462
We only do what we plan to do.

735
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,402
I'm serious.

736
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:20,397
I don't know if you've noticed,
but so are we.

737
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:27,370
Dane, you've been my friend a long time,
but I can't let you do this.

738
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,316
You know,
I wish there was more people like you.

739
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:35,985
Then we wouldn't be here.

740
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:40,618
Come on, man, I know Riggs is a prick,
but he don't deserve this.

741
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:45,123
You're wrong. He does. Andy, do it.

742
01:27:00,115 --> 01:27:03,050
You should have left
when you had the chance.

743
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:23,161
I've had enough.

744
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,267
Me, too.

745
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,464
We're all responsible.

746
01:27:56,872 --> 01:28:00,672
Kelli, I think you're wrong.

747
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:06,571
I really do think
you would've come to like me.

748
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,712
I just wanted to be friends.

749
01:28:35,577 --> 01:28:38,375
Police! Freeze! Drop the weapon!

750
01:28:40,749 --> 01:28:42,580
There are more like us out there.

751
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:46,781
I said drop it! Just drop the weapon!
It's not worth it. We can work it out!

752
01:28:46,855 --> 01:28:48,447
You're too late.

753
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:53,991
How do I look?

754
01:28:55,597 --> 01:28:58,361
Okay. On three, two, one.

755
01:28:59,134 --> 01:29:02,763
Police have identified the killers
as disgruntled students

756
01:29:02,938 --> 01:29:07,671
who kidnapped, drugged and dismembered
fellow students without cause.

757
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:11,577
Certainly, it will be a long time
in the healing process,

758
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:15,446
and all we can do is pray
for the families of the victims.

759
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:17,137
Think of this as the final,

760
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:23,247
and there's only one question.

761
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:28,249
"What did I do to deserve this?"

762
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:40,726
Mommy, why does that girl's face
look like that?
