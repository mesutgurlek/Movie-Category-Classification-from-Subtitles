1
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,880
Clara was my babysitter.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,320
I was only 12 years old,
naive and somewhat trusting.

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,480
But all that
was about to change.

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,800
Some babysitters
take you to the movies,

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,400
or roller-blading
in the park.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,000
Mine brought me on a date
with a serial killer.

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,480
Patrick Bateman.

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,200
Not my idea
of a romantic evening.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,800
God, look at her.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,880
All drugged up
and tied to a chair.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,200
I knew we should have
gone to the movies.

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,000
At first, I was scared.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,400
I wanted to get out of there
as fast as I could.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,200
But then...

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,200
something came over me.

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,000
As soon as
I was free, I got really pissed.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,080
He was about to make
a real mess of my babysitter.

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,320
So, I did what many of you
would have done,

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,200
I took matters
into my own hands.

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,800
And it changed
my life forever.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,720
Is everything
all right in there?

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,600
- I thought I heard a crash.
- Yes, everything’s fine. Thanks.

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,800
They found Bateman
and his final victim a few days later.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,400
The FBI quickly
uncovered a psychopath,

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,400
and a few extra
unsolved murders,

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,000
and he became an instant celebrity,
an overnight sensation.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,800
They even
wrote a book about him.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,000
Only in America.
As for me?

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,320
I was never tied
to the scene.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,880
And rather
than self-destruct,

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,600
or spend the rest of my life
on some shrink’s coach,

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,800
I told no one
of what had happened.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,720
I silently vowed
to devote my life

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
to stopping
other psycho killers.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,600
I couldn’t wait
to grow up.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,800
The next six years
of my life were a blur.

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,880
My parents
wrote me off emotionally.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
My mom became
a raging alcoholic,

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,320
and my dad was busy
fucking the secretary.

40
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
Pretty cliché, huh?

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,400
So, here I am today,

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,400
attending the most renowned behavioral
studies program in the nation.

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,800
Here they focus
on profiling,

44
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,200
the art, craft and science
of tracking serial killers.

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,400
The subject matter itself
attracts some weirdoes.

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,200
Hey, Rachael.

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,600
But then again,
maybe it’s just me...

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,080
The problem is,
I don’t have time for games.

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,400
I’ve got to focus
on my work.

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,200
- You can do better than that.
- That’s what your mama said.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
And what can I say?

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,000
Studying murder often
brings out the best in people.

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,200
Thought you quit!

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,720
Getting into
West Washington wasn’t easy.

55
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
I busted my ass
in high school

56
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,480
and maintained a perfect
4.0 grade point average.

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,480
All this, so I could study
with the best mind in the field,

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,400
Pr. Robert Starkman.

59
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Possibly the most revered
hunter of serial killers

60
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,400
the FBI ever produced.

61
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,600
After solving every high profile
crime ever thrown at him,

62
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,320
he suddenly made a startling
life change and became a teacher.

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,320
Some say it was
his last case,

64
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,800
the mysterious death
of serial killer Patrick Bateman.

65
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,080
Good morning.

66
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,080
Funny how life works, isn’t it?

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,080
Good morning.

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,080
Starkman never discusses
the Bateman case...

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Never.

70
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,200
Congratulations on getting through
the first half of the semester...

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,800
- alive.
- { students laugh }

72
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,720
I have here...

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,600
the official application form

74
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,400
for the teacher’s assistant
position for next year.

75
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,400
This is my golden
ticket to Quantico,

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,320
the FBI’s elite
training program.

77
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,720
Unfortunately, everyone else
is here for the same reason.

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,400
They know that nine out
of Starkman’s last 10 assistants,

79
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,000
- were accepted into the FBI.
- ...Announcing my new assistant

80
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,800
by the end of the week, just before
we head off for Spring Break.

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,080
And, talking about
Spring Break,

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,480
don’t forget the party
at the Dean’s mansion.

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,200
We’ll have the opportunity
to say goodbye to Miss McGuire

84
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,800
who’s leaving us for bigger
and better things.

85
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Well, after weeks of grueling,
if not gruesome work,

86
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,000
let’s have some fun,
shall we?

87
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,800
Today we’ll be looking
at the unique aliases

88
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,600
the FBI, the press
and the general public

89
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,000
have nicknamed
serial killers, and why.

90
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,200
His present TA
is Elizabeth McGuire.

91
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,000
She’s already been
accepted to Quantico...

92
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,000
Early admissions.

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,720
I’m the front runner
to replace her.

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,400
Nobody comes close
to my rock solid GPA.

95
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,400
Dr. H.H. Holmes was
once vilified, in a biography,

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,000
as the „Arch Fiend.”

97
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,320
I’d like to say
none of them have a chance,

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,000
but grades
aren’t everything.

99
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,400
And I do have
some competition.

100
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,000
Contender number one:
Brian Leads.

101
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,720
A GPA as low as his
wouldn’t normally pose a threat.

102
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
But his family’s fortune,

103
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,720
easily numbering in hundreds
of millions, can open a lot of doors.

104
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,400
How do you think
he got into the school?

105
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,400
Can you spell „donation”?

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
He can’t.

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,000
Albert Fish,
AKA „The Moon Maniac”...

108
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,600
AKA „The Werewolf
of Wisteria.”

109
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,000
Contender two: Cassandra Blaire.

110
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
They say she and Starkman
have been going at it

111
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,000
since the beginning
of the semester.

112
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,600
But my guess: No way.

113
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,720
He’s old enough
to be her grandfather.

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Nannie Doss...

115
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,720
„The Black Widow”
who murdered four of her husbands.

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,000
Contender three: Keith Lawson.

117
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,080
He poses the biggest
threat of the three.

118
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,000
He and I have been sparring
all year in this class.

119
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,600
But, I’ve yet to lose
a single round.

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,600
The fact is,
none of them have a chance.

121
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, Bobby.

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,880
Red lips, red leaves
fall on my knees like autumn

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,400
I miss cigarettes
every single day of my life

124
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,480
When you make love
to me

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,000
I close my eyes
and pray you say goodbye

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,880
Damn

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,320
She’s dawning on me

128
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,200
She’s beautiful

129
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,600
She’s beautiful

130
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,600
And I bet you don’t know
what love means

131
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,200
It’s just that
you do not love me.

132
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,800
The application is a mere formality.

133
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,720
Come Friday, I will be Starkman’s
new teaching assistant.

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
The position is mine.

135
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,400
I deserve it
and I’m going to get it.

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,200
Yes, there maybe a few more hoops
I have to jump through,

137
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,200
but I can handle them.

138
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,000
Besides,
failure is not an option.

139
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
Why don’t we just
start over here,

140
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
because I suggest you reconsider
your position on this.

141
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,480
WoI’m sorry, Mr. Leads.
I can’t make any exceptions.

142
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,800
our GPA is simply
not high enough.

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,480
Are you saying no to me?
Do you know who my father is?

144
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,480
Mr. Leads...

145
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,200
I am well aware
of your family’s legacy.

146
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,200
Heed my advice. A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.

147
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,200
That’s your fucking advice?

148
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,200
I have some advice for you.
Get ready to take a long vacation.

149
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,400
WoGo with God,
dear heart. Next!

150
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,080
Can you believe
this shit?

151
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,000
Wait till she sees my GPA after
my cousin hacks into their mainframe.

152
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh!

153
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Do they give these things up
for bitch of the month?

154
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,480
That hag could be
the reigning champion.

155
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
She’s lucky I don’t bash
her brains in.

156
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,000
Next!

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hi.

158
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,400
I was told to drop off
my application here.

159
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,800
Looks like everything’s
in order here.

160
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,200
Thank you.

161
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,400
Wait a second.

162
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,080
- What’s this?
- What?

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,480
It says here
that you’re a freshman.

164
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
Yeah, so what?

165
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,800
We don’t usually allow freshmen
or sophomores to become TAs.

166
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,480
You have to be
a Junior or above.

167
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,080
This isn’t
your usual situation.

168
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,800
Pr. Starkman
told me I could apply.

169
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,000
Shouldn’t this decision
be left up to the professor?

170
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,320
‘Fraid not.

171
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,320
I’ll run this up the flagpole
and see who salutes.

172
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,600
I’ll have to speak
with your teacher.

173
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,600
I have a schedule to keep.
It’s all worked out.

174
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,200
We do this
for your own good.

175
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,400
Freshmen can be extremely
overwhelmed, being at college,

176
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,400
and away from home
for the first time in their lives.

177
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
Here, take this.

178
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,080
„Beat common freshmen fears
in 10 easy steps.”

179
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,080
So many new experiences.

180
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
It’s so exciting.

181
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,600
Look,
the only experience I want

182
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
is to be Pr. Starkman’s
TA next semester.

183
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,320
‘Fraid not!
It just wouldn’t be right.

184
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,600
I’m sure he will put in
a good word for you,

185
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,200
but I don’t see how I can make
any exceptions at this point

186
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,600
without setting a dangerous
precedent in school policy.

187
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,480
I’ll be informing
the Dean of the situation.

188
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
I’m sorry, Miss Newman.
You’ll just have to wait.

189
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,400
Have a nice day.

190
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,080
- { door slams }
- Hmm.

191
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,720
Ricky Martin?

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
Ricky?

193
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Ricky?
Come to mama.

194
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,000
Ricky?

195
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,800
Ricky Martin?
Ricky?

196
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Ricky?

197
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Oh!

198
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,080
Ricky, you got
some explaining to do.

199
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,880
Ricky?

200
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,600
{ meowing }

201
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
{ meowing }

202
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,600
- Oh, thank God.
- { meowing }

203
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,320
What happened to you?

204
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,000
{ screaming }

205
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,800
Bad things

206
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,800
Dead things

207
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,000
Sad things have to happen

208
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,720
Bad things

209
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,080
Dead things

210
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,320
Sad things have to happen.

211
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,320
{ knocking }

212
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
Hey, Miss Newman.

213
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,400
Wow, Brian.
Are you stalking me now?

214
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,800
No, Rachael. If I was
stalking you, you’d know it.

215
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,600
I mean-- you wouldn’t know it.
You know?

216
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,400
I thought we should
get together and...

217
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,200
discuss the state of the union
and life in general.

218
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,000
Get to the point, Brian.

219
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,720
My inside source says
he has narrowed it down.

220
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
Guess who’s still
in the running?

221
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,600
Keith, Cassandra
and me.

222
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,400
Unless you can raise
your GPA.

223
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,000
That problem’s
already solved.

224
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,720
Do you want to catch
a bite to eat tomorrow night,

225
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,000
maybe some dinner
and discuss it?

226
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,200
What’s to discuss?
It’s no big news.

227
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
We were always
the front runners.

228
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,800
We could get together
and form an alliance,

229
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,000
eliminate our competition.

230
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,000
That sounds
intriguing but...

231
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,800
- I have a paper to write.
- A paper?

232
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,800
We should get to know
each other better.

233
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,080
Is it just me or is there unspoken
sexual tension between us?

234
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,600
We should bring it to the surface
and stop lying to each other.

235
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,800
Are you on crack?

236
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,400
I don’t know. It was white,
it was in a pipe--

237
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,080
- So, what do you say?
- I have a paper to write.

238
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,200
No, no, no...

239
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,720
I won’t take no for an answer
twice in one day.

240
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,600
You have to eat, right?
I have to eat. We both have to eat.

241
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,400
Let’s just eat together.
It’s no big deal.

242
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,080
I was just fucking around
with this sexual tension stuff.

243
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,720
I just throw stuff
out there.

244
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000
I’m crazy, I’m like a volcano,
just waiting to erupt--

245
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Okay!

246
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,880
Okay, fine.
Pick me up at 8:00.

247
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
- Eight? Like 8:00pm?
- Yeah.

248
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,800
- Between 7:00 and 9:00?
- Yeah!

249
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,080
Okay.

250
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,480
‘Cause
it’s great for me--

251
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
- I’ll see you at 8:00.
- Whatever.

252
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,720
Maybe I’ll be there
five minutes later.

253
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,400
So... what are you doing
for Spring Break?

254
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,000
I’m just gonna hang around
and get some work done.

255
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
What do you mean "hang around?"
You mean stay on campus?

256
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,200
Yeah.

257
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
You’re not going home?

258
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,000
Why?

259
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,880
Because
I have work to do.

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,200
My family’s coming
for my mom’s birthday

261
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
to see how
the other half lives.

262
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,480
- Okay, that sounds terrible.
- I know.

263
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,080
What are you doing?

264
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,320
Bobby’s taking me up to his cabin
in the Northern Cascade--

265
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,720
Cassandra, please don’t call him
"Bobby" in front of me.

266
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,600
I’m sorry.

267
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,400
Pr. Starkman
is taking me up to his cabin.

268
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,200
When do you guys leave?

269
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,480
He’s got to go upstate first,
to meet Diane and Louisa.

270
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,400
You mean, his wife
and his baby daughter?

271
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,000
Whatever!
Yes, them.

272
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,480
He’s meeting them
at his in-laws’ for the long weekend.

273
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
I can’t stand how much
of his time they take up.

274
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,000
Cass,
they’re his family!

275
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,320
Whatever.

276
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,080
I’m late for a study session.
I should just go.

277
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
I can’t believe you’re
actually going out with Brian.

278
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,720
How did that happen?

279
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,320
Okay...

280
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,200
the other day, our eyes met
across a crowded room,

281
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,320
and there was this--
this spark,

282
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,800
the sign I’ve been waiting for
my whole life.

283
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,000
It was then that I knew
that Brian was my soul mate.

284
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,320
- Oh my God.
- I know.

285
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,720
- Really?
- No, not really.

286
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
It’s great
to be with you tonight.

287
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,600
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hi.

288
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,080
Hi. Can I get you
something to drink?

289
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes. I’ll have a Kettle One
martini, straight up,

290
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,880
very dry.
Very, very dry.

291
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,320
And the lady will have...

292
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,200
- I’ll have a glass of house red.
- House red.

293
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,800
Good.
I’ll be right back.

294
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,720
- So, you look great.
- Thanks.

295
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,800
our hair is different.
It looks good.

296
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,000
- Thanks.
- No problem.

297
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,600
It’s great that we finally have
some „us” time.

298
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,600
- You and I hanging out.
- I agree.

299
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah. Listen, Rach,

300
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,200
before we embark
on our evening,

301
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,200
I have a confession
to make.

302
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,800
Can you wait
until we get our drinks

303
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,000
before you start
making your confessions?

304
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,200
- Oh yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

305
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,200
Look. Our drinks.

306
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
Thank you.

307
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
- There you go.
- Thank you.

308
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,600
It’s my first day.

309
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
So, ready to order?

310
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,600
Can you just
give us a minute here?

311
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,000
Sure.

312
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,880
Take your time.

313
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Thank you.

314
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,480
Okay. What would you like
to confess?

315
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,600
This is difficult for me,

316
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,320
because I really want us
to remain friends after--

317
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,200
regardless of who Starkman picks
for the TA position.

318
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,400
Wow, I’m touched.
Brian, I really am.

319
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,400
You should know I’m determined
to get the position.

320
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,800
Over the last few months,

321
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,400
I’ve been doing a little research
on Cassandra Blair.

322
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,600
What kind of research?

323
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,080
Let’s just say that
if she gets the position,

324
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,480
the Dean’s office is going
to receive an anonymous letter

325
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,800
regarding her and Starkman’s
relationship,

326
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,880
accompanied by some
very revealing photographs.

327
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,600
- How Christian of you.
- Thanks.

328
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
I guess that narrows it down
to three.

329
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Yeah.

330
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
You know
who my father is, right?

331
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,200
Yes, we’re all in awe
of your family’s money.

332
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,600
You know, you and Keith
are very smart.

333
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,000
So I’ve had to go
to great lengths

334
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,800
to ensure that my bright future
in the FBI goes without a hitch.

335
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,080
What are you
smiling at?

336
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,880
This.

337
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,200
That is the press release

338
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,320
for the new Carson-Leads
Behavioral Sciences Building.

339
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,800
It’s just one of my dad’s
new pet projects.

340
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,080
So...

341
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,400
I have an offer
you can’t refuse.

342
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
Drop out of the race
for the TA position,

343
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,600
and I’ll ensure you have seven
digits of my family’s gratitude.

344
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,400
Brian?

345
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,200
Are you bribing me now?

346
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,880
Bribe?
Did I say bribe?

347
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,600
Just think of it
as a business opportunity.

348
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,800
Trust me,

349
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,400
the alternative wouldn’t be
too pleasant.

350
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,720
„I’ll let you be in my dreams
if I can be in yours.”

351
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,600
- What?
- It’s a quote.

352
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Bob Dylan,
maybe you’ve heard of him?

353
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,800
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, Brian,

354
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,600
you should
get out more.

355
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,800
Maybe I will.

356
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,200
The night’s young.

357
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,600
That it is.

358
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,080
Cheers.

359
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Don’t!

360
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,080
- { mimicking trumpet }
- Shh!

361
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,600
We’re home, we’re home.

362
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,480
Wow!

363
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
This is like... a room.

364
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,480
Do you want
to be my girl?

365
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,000
Do you want
to be my friend?

366
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,480
Do you want
to start it all?

367
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,800
We can stop if you want.

368
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,720
- No, no... I just don’t--
- What, you don’t have any?

369
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,480
Don’t worry, I’ll take care
of everything when the time comes.

370
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
Oh, the old
"pull out and pray" trick.

371
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,880
Great,
a Renaissance man.

372
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,200
Wait a second!

373
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,320
The convenience store,
down the street--

374
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
I’ll just go down there,
it’s right around the corner.

375
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,400
It’s really convenient
and I’ll get some, I’ll get tons.

376
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,320
Wait a minute,
what am I saying?

377
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,600
My roommate’s got tons of them,
drawers full of them.

378
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,080
A real
prophylactic factory.

379
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Are we done here?

380
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,200
No,
we’re not done.

381
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,800
I’ll walk down the hall,
and get some from a friend.

382
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,480
- Oh, great.
- Make yourself comfortable.

383
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,000
Sure, great.

384
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,000
I’ll be here.

385
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,480
Jeez. A piss-sheet.

386
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,200
Jesus.

387
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,480
What the fuck.

388
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,800
{ choking }

389
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,800
Ribbed,
for her pleasure.

390
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,000
Yep, I just killed Brian.

391
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,800
But you’ve got to look
at the positive side...

392
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,200
I’m killing
for a better tomorrow.

393
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,200
Once I get into the FBI,

394
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,200
I’ll be able
to stop dozens,

395
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,400
maybe even hundreds
of serial killers every year.

396
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,200
Okay, think about it...

397
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,320
I’m killing the few
to save the many.

398
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,000
Sort of like Robin Hood,
you know?

399
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,800
God, I think I need
some professional help.

400
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,000
Rachael, have you ever been
to a psychiatrist before?

401
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,320
No.

402
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,800
- No, how does it work?
- I works like this.

403
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,600
You want answers,
so we get together weekly,

404
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,800
and we ask the questions
that will lead you to your answers.

405
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
All right?

406
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,480
I could tell you anything,
and you’d still never know me.

407
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,000
You could,
and that’s your choice.

408
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,600
But why would you
lie to me?

409
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,400
Because I don’t expose
my Achilles’ heel to anyone.

410
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
- Why do you say that?
- I just need to be on watch.

411
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,600
If I’m not looking out
for number one, then who is?

412
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,720
It’s a dog-eat-dog-world
out there,

413
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,400
and my future depends on
not getting eaten by the other dogs.

414
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,080
I have schedules,
appointments and dreams

415
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,800
that only I can fulfill.

416
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,320
No one is going
to do that for me.

417
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,320
Who do you think is keeping you
from achieving these goals?

418
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,880
- Other people.
- What people?

419
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,600
Anyone who gets
in my way.

420
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,320
If you could be anyone
in the world, except yourself,

421
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,200
who would that be?

422
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,400
Elizabeth McGuire.

423
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,000
Elizabeth McGuire?
Who’s she?

424
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,800
She’s Pr. Starkman’s
present TA.

425
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,080
And the next in line
to go to Quantico.

426
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
- And Quantico is?
- My goal.

427
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,800
- My destiny.
- I see.

428
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,400
Have you ever wanted
something so bad

429
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,600
that you’d do
anything to get it?

430
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,000
Sure.

431
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,720
Go on.

432
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,600
And that’s why I went
to West Washington.

433
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,720
I’ve always known that,
really,

434
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,480
there were
only three other people

435
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,880
who could steal the TA position
away from me.

436
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,720
What happens
if you don’t get the position?

437
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,000
I can’t even consider that.

438
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,000
Failure is not an option.
I’ll get the position.

439
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,200
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I am.

440
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,400
- Why don’t we stop there?
- Okay.

441
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,000
My secretary will get
your billing info.

442
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,320
Okay.

443
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,720
So, same time next week?

444
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,320
- You bet.
- Okay.

445
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,880
{ dialing }

446
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,800
- { phone rings }
- Starkman.

447
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,400
Hey, Bobby.
It’s Eric.

448
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Hey, Eric.
What’s up?

449
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,720
I just had a first time session
with one of your students.

450
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,720
Wow, wow, wow...

451
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,400
Aren’t we violating
some sort of privacy code here?

452
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,800
Yes and no.
I’ll tell you what...

453
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,720
I won’t tell you the name,

454
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,400
if you promise not to say it
once you’ve figured it out.

455
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,880
- Is that a deal?
- Okay. Fire away.

456
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,800
All right.

457
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,800
I think I’ve identified this person
as a textbook sociopath.

458
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,600
It’s a prerequisite for getting
into college in the first place.

459
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,320
Tell me about it. Still, this girl
has no concept of reality

460
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,800
or the difference
between right or wrong.

461
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,480
A girl.

462
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
Mmm, the plot thickens.

463
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,400
She’s obsessed with becoming
your assistant next semester.

464
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,200
If that’s her obsession,
it’s no big deal.

465
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
These kids think
I’m their ticket to the FBI.

466
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,000
Just keep
your eyes open.

467
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,200
This girl--

468
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,720
she scared me.

469
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,080
Jesus, if she’s that dangerous,
tell me her name

470
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
before she turns up
in class with an AK47.

471
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,600
I can’t do that. I’ve already broken
the law by placing this call.

472
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,800
Just be aware this student’s
in your class.

473
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,200
What exactly do you mean,
"be aware?"

474
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,880
25 years in the FBI...
turn your radar on.

475
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,720
Just make sure
she doesn’t get out of hand.

476
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,720
- She’s identified three of her peers--
- Dr. Daniels?

477
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,600
- Okay, okay, Mother.
- Mom?

478
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,600
I’ve got to go,
I’ve got an appointment.

479
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,400
I love you. I do.

480
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,200
Okay, I’ll see you
this weekend. Bye.

481
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,400
Rachael?

482
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,800
I am so sorry
to disturb you.

483
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,800
I didn’t realize
you were on the phone

484
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,200
- and your secretary wasn’t there.
- It’s okay.

485
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,600
I just left my keys here.

486
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,200
I am such a textbook
nut case sometimes.

487
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,400
I’d probably lose my head
if it wasn’t screwed on.

488
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,000
Oh, there they are.

489
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,600
It’s so nice that you stay
in touch with your mom.

490
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,880
- How old is she?
- 72.

491
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Wow.

492
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,200
72,
that’s a great age.

493
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,080
So many new and exciting things,
the golden years.

494
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Grandchildren?

495
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,600
No. I’m--

496
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,880
My wife and I
never had children.

497
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,080
Was she not able to?

498
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,400
Actually,
we’re divorced.

499
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I have another patient
coming in soon.

500
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,000
I have
to prepare for him.

501
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,880
So I’ll have
to ask you to leave.

502
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Which is it, Eric?

503
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,480
An appointment downtown
or a patient in your office?

504
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,600
It’s not nice to lie
to your dear old mom.

505
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,600
See you next week.

506
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,200
After my session with
Eric, I really needed some therapy.

507
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,600
That guy just about
drove me nuts.

508
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,320
So, I went back to something
my dad always said,

509
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,080
"Nothing like a change of scenery
to clear your head,

510
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,480
to ease the burden
of a busy schedule.”

511
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Besides,

512
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,720
tonight’s the Behavioral Sciences
party at the Dean’s.

513
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,080
I have to look good.
I wanna be dressed to kill.

514
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,720
<i><Sometimes
she feels so sad></i>

515
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,480
<i><And other times
feels twice as bad></i>

516
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,800
<i><When the tears
are in her eyes></i>

517
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,400
<i><She never cries></i>

518
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,200
<i><Ordinary girl></i>

519
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,000
<i><I know...></i>

520
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,400
<i><We’re different></i>

521
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,800
<i><But I’m stranger
in the world></i>

522
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,600
<i><Ordinary girl></i>

523
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,400
<i><Ordinary.></i>

524
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,200
- Excuse me?
- Bite me, Barbie.

525
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,200
The Anthony Perkins character
in Psycho was modeled on Ed Gein.

526
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,000
My heart rate
nearly triples when I get there

527
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,320
and see the vultures
have descended upon Starkman.

528
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,400
He broke the mold because he only
killed two people in his entire career.

529
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,600
I must have
lost track of time running.

530
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,600
I had planned
to get here early to get

531
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
as much time
with Starkman as possible.

532
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,080
And now I’m late.
This is a disaster.

533
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Bitch!

534
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,400
...for Leatherface
in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre--

535
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,720
- Hello, Miss Brown.
- I’ll be right back.

536
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,600
It’s good to see you.

537
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,600
- Hey, how is it going?
- Hey!

538
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,200
How was your date
with Brian?

539
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Fine. Short.
I don’t know.

540
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,400
Short?
How short was he?

541
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,200
I mean, „it.”

542
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,600
We didn’t get that far.
He went home after dinner.

543
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,800
What do you mean?
Why did you come to borrow a rubber,

544
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,080
- if he went home after dinner?
- What’s up with the third degree?

545
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,080
I’m just confused.
Did you guys get it on or not?

546
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
It’s none
of your business.

547
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,200
- Can we drop this, please?
- Whatever.

548
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,000
Sometimes
I don’t understand you.

549
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
It’s like
you’re not even here.

550
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,000
What did you do
last night?

551
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,320
- Bobby came over for--
- Cassandra!

552
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,400
I’m sorry. Pr. Starkman
came over for a study session.

553
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,320
And let me assure you,
it was definitely not short.

554
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,200
I’m gonna vomit.

555
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,200
What are you smiling at,
freak?

556
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,200
Come here.

557
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,320
Bob--
I mean the professor,

558
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,320
said I’m a shoe-in
for the TA position.

559
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,600
I wasn’t supposed
to tell anyone,

560
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
but since
we are so close...

561
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,400
I was gonna burst.

562
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,600
Now I get to spend
all this time with my sweetie.

563
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,400
And his wife’ll think
we’re working.

564
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,000
Wait, maybe
I’ll go to Quantico.

565
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,800
How great would that be?

566
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,720
Just don’t tell
anyone, okay?

567
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,880
- Not even Brian.
- Don’t worry.

568
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,800
our secret’s
safe with me.

569
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,800
This party’s such a dud.

570
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,400
Let’s blow it off
and you give me the details.

571
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,200
Perfect.
Let me talk to Starkman,

572
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,880
and we’ll go
to Jittery Joes for coffee.

573
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,200
No! It’s way
too crowded.

574
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,000
You don’t want anyone
to know about you and Bobby.

575
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Let’s grab some wine
and go to your room.

576
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,800
That sounds great!

577
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,320
Just make sure
you don’t tell anyone, okay?

578
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,800
- Don’t let me down.
- Don’t worry,

579
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,320
I would never
let you down.

580
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,400
Like I said, Cassie,

581
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,800
student-teacher relationships
just never work out.

582
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,480
{ phone rings }

583
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,080
Hi It’s Cassandra,
I can’t get to the phone,

584
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,880
so leave a quickie
and I’ll get back to you.

585
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,400
Hello Cassandra.
Pr. Starkman here.

586
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,600
Listen, it’s 11:25 and
you missed your study session.

587
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,400
Call me back to reschedule.

588
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,800
Doctor Daniels?

589
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I’m sorry to drop in
without an appointment,

590
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,400
but there is something
on my mind.

591
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,720
Sure.

592
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,720
Sure, Rachael.

593
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,000
- How are things with you?
- They couldn’t be better.

594
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,000
Really?

595
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,000
Any word
on that TA job yet?

596
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,200
He won’t announce it
until before Spring Break.

597
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,320
When does that start
for you guys?

598
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,000
- End of the week.
- Really?

599
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,480
- Two days?
- Yeah.

600
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,480
- And how do you feel about that?
- Pretty confident.

601
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,480
- You think you’ll get the job?
- I don’t think. I know.

602
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,800
Okay, Rachael.

603
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,720
Worst case scenario:

604
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,320
you don’t get the job.
What then?

605
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,800
What are you talking about,
Dr. Daniels?

606
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,600
It’s mine.

607
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,800
You want me to come up with some idea
of what’s wrong with me,

608
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,000
but I’ll be honest.
I came here

609
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,000
to tell you I’m not
coming back next week.

610
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,880
Don’t worry, I have every intention
to pay for your time.

611
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,600
However, I feel the problem we have
connecting lies mostly with you.

612
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,800
Look,
this is a small town.

613
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,080
My guess is you know
almost everyone here.

614
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,200
You were born here,
right?

615
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,800
It must be so disappointing
to see all these college kids

616
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,600
come in and out
of your town every year,

617
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,400
moving on to bigger
and better opportunities,

618
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,200
while you stay here, year after year,
getting older and older.

619
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,400
And all while taking care
of your dear old mom.

620
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,880
And on top of this,
you’re divorced?

621
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,880
God! The female population
in this town,

622
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,720
aside from the sexy little
college girls running around,

623
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,000
must be pretty weak.

624
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,320
This alone
would cripple any man.

625
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,720
our level of frustration
must be through the roof.

626
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,720
A dead-end job
with no love life,

627
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,480
all while taking care
of your sick mom.

628
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Just the other day,

629
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,880
I noticed
you were judging me.

630
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,600
Is that fair?
I mean really, is that?

631
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,800
I don’t think so.

632
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,800
our life is very similar
to Ed Gein’s.

633
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,080
Ed Gein?

634
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,720
Yes, Ed Gein.
Very famous serial killer.

635
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,080
A bachelor, raised
by his domineering mother,

636
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,600
until she died
when he was roughly your age.

637
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,400
God, he went nuts!
He couldn’t handle the loss.

638
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,720
What would you do
without your mother?

639
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,480
Okay Rachael,
that’s enough.

640
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,320
You don’t know me,
and I don’t know you.

641
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,880
We were getting
to know each other.

642
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,400
These sessions
are a process.

643
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,800
So don’t go
jumping to conclusions.

644
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,400
No. I’m not jumping
to any conclusions here.

645
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,600
If you just open up your eyes,
you’d see I’m already there.

646
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,880
Have a good day, Doctor.

647
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,000
Let’s talk about Ted Bundy
for a minute, shall we?

648
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,800
What kind
of a killer was he?

649
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,720
How was he perceived?

650
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,720
Mr. Lawson wishes to participate.
Please, let’s hear it.

651
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,080
He was perceived
as a very organized killer.

652
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,720
- Very calculated.
- Hmphf!

653
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,000
You don’t agree,
Miss Newman?

654
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,400
Yes and no.

655
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,720
Come on, this guy planned
each and every detail in advance.

656
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,320
He chose his victims with extreme
accuracy, stalked them meticulously,

657
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,320
and waited for the precise
moment to attack.

658
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
All while maintaining
an air of patience

659
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,600
not even the FBI’s
greatest could penetrate.

660
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,320
- No offense, sir.
- None taken.

661
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,600
- But I still don’t agree.
- And he picked all his dumping sites

662
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,080
with the outmost
caution.

663
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,400
He was unquestionably
an organized killer.

664
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,720
- Premeditated, with a capital "P."
- Capital "P?"

665
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,080
- It’s a letter in the alphabet.
- { students giggle }

666
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,400
Between
"O" and "Q."

667
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,000
You have something to say,
Miss Newman?

668
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,800
He started out organized,

669
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,720
but spiraled down late
in his so-called career.

670
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,000
He began to keep bodies for days,
washing their hair

671
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,600
and even applying make-up
before disposing of them.

672
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,080
And he littered the dumping sites with
evidence, using the outmost caution.

673
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,480
However, his last victim,
and his youngest girl ever,

674
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,200
fell out of his typical
victim selection.

675
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,720
She was chosen out
of sheer availability.

676
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,000
The sheer need to kill.

677
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,800
He was both,

678
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,400
an organized killer
and off-the-charts lunatic.

679
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,200
- With a capital "L.”
- { class laughs }

680
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,880
You’re right.
He was both.

681
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,800
Very impressive,
Miss Newman.

682
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,600
Now, Pr. Starkman,
how would you classify a killer

683
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,800
whose downward spiral was actually
calculated into their grand scheme?

684
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,800
That’s a very interesting
hypothesis, Miss Newman.

685
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,400
Unfortunately, in this class,
we stick to the facts.

686
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,320
And there’s no known
case-study of that nature.

687
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,600
Keith’s
little display of brainpower

688
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,320
was totally unacceptable.

689
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,720
It’s a day before Starkman
announces his new TA.

690
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,400
This could be catastrophic.

691
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,480
I wasn’t about to watch years
of hard work go down the drain.

692
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,320
It was time
to pick Keith’s brain.

693
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,080
You know
that feeling you get

694
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,320
when you realize that there are
people out there just like you?

695
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,400
It almost makes you
feel normal.

696
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,320
All this time,
I thought he was taking notes.

697
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,800
But no. Look at his work,
his sketches.

698
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,600
They’re absolutely brilliant.

699
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,880
This may be a waste
of a rare mind.

700
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,720
But, a girl’s gotta do
what a girl’s gotta do.

701
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Hi, Pr. Starkman.

702
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,800
- Hey!
- Miss Brown.

703
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,800
- How are you?
- Good.

704
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,800
So, the big day’s tomorrow,
right?

705
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,480
- What do you mean?
- For the TA position.

706
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,320
- You’re announcing it tomorrow?
- Yes, of course.

707
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,800
- At noon, in my classroom.
- I can’t wait.

708
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,720
My chances are much better this year
than they were last.

709
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,080
I would think so.
It’s a very tight race this year.

710
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,720
Mmm-hmm.

711
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,080
Were you looking for Cassandra?
She wasn’t in class.

712
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,800
She probably left
for Spring Break.

713
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:46,720
- Well, actually, the--
- It’s Cassandra, isn’t it?

714
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
She got the position.

715
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,480
Good for her, but--

716
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,480
I can’t say
I’m not disappointed,

717
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,880
but „what doesn’t kill you
makes you stronger.”

718
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I’ll see you.

719
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,400
{ gasp }

720
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,720
{ phone rings }

721
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,200
{ rings again }

722
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,400
It’s Cassandra.
I can’t get to the phone,

723
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,720
so leave a quickie and
I’ll get back to you.

724
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,600
{ beep }

725
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,200
{ phone rings }

726
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,600
- Hello?
- Eric, for God’s sakes!

727
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,800
She’s dead!

728
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,800
- Who is?
- She is!

729
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,480
The „she” whose name
we agreed not to say aloud.

730
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,080
My patient? Dead? How?

731
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,600
She hung herself.

732
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,400
You didn’t say
she was suicidal.

733
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,880
She had suicidal
tendencies,

734
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,880
but I was more concerned
for the sociopathic

735
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,880
and homicidal patterns
that were emerging.

736
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,320
Spare me your psychobabble
bullshit.

737
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,000
This girl...

738
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,600
she may have been a little forward,
but she wasn’t crazy!

739
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,600
I’m sorry,
but you didn’t see what I saw.

740
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,600
- She was not a pretty picture.
- Listen, Eric,

741
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,400
I spent a lot of time
with her,

742
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,480
and I have to say
I don’t agree on this one.

743
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,320
There are tons of kids
in your classes.

744
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,720
How could you know her as well
as you think you did?

745
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,480
We’re bound
by the guidelines

746
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,480
of doctor-patient
privilege, right?

747
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,480
You didn’t, Bob?
You weren’t sleeping with her?

748
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,320
No wonder
she was obsessing over you.

749
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,720
- How could you do this to Diane?
- None of your business.

750
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,200
Fine. Why did you
call me, then?

751
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,800
‘Cause you’re
my fucking shrink!

752
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,600
I’m sorry. I just needed
someone to talk to.

753
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,000
I loved her.

754
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,080
Can you get me
some Valium?

755
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,200
Yeah. I’ll call it
in to the pharmacy.

756
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,480
- Can I give you some advice?
- { phone beeps }

757
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,720
- { dial tone }
- Hello?

758
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,600
So, here we are. The big day.

759
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,600
In moments, I’ll be crowned
Starkman’s new TA,

760
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,800
and be one step closer
to the FBI.

761
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,600
Too bad Brian, Cassie and Keith
couldn’t be here to watch me.

762
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,200
But wherever they are,

763
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,000
I’m sure they’ll realize
they didn’t give up their lives in vain.

764
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,200
I will make them proud.

765
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,320
Guys, can I have
your attention, please?

766
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,400
Pr. Starkman
told me to tell you

767
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,400
that unfortunately he’s decided
that his sabbatical,

768
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,400
which was scheduled
for next year,

769
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,800
is now effective
immediately.

770
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,600
In other words, there’ll be
no TA position for next semester.

771
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,320
Sorry.

772
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,000
Have a great Spring Break.

773
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,320
This is an obsession

774
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,080
A kind of aggression
with himself

775
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,000
It’s the way
he’ll always be

776
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,800
He loves to rebel

777
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,400
To go against
his Ten Commandments

778
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,000
For him

779
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,400
That’s just being free

780
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,800
And over there

781
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,000
Stands my angry angel

782
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,880
And he’s shaking his head

783
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,400
In disgrace with me

784
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,880
Over there

785
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,320
Stands my angry angel

786
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,880
And he’s frowning
like hell

787
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,800
But I’m not
feeling guilty.

788
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,720
Pr. Starkman?

789
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,880
Pr. Starkman?

790
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,800
Rachael.

791
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,200
Why--

792
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,400
why haven’t you
gone home?

793
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,800
I’ll just hang around here
during the break.

794
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,880
Why?

795
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,880
Don’t you have family
waiting at home for you?

796
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,200
No.

797
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,880
Actually, they’ll come
visit me here.

798
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,400
Are you okay,
Professor?

799
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,320
I heard about
the change in plans.

800
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,400
Is that
why you’re here?

801
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,800
Is that all you people
ever think about?

802
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,800
The goddamn
teaching assistant job?

803
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,400
Quantico?

804
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,320
Don’t you kids get it?
It’s not that important.

805
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,480
It’s important to me.

806
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,000
I have a schedule,
a plan, a dream. I need it!

807
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,000
What makes you think
you’ll get it?

808
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,200
Other students
have applied too.

809
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,000
- Some more qualified than you.
- I beg your pardon?

810
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,480
I believe I am the most qualified
for this position.

811
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,880
Name someone who’s more
dedicated or intelligent,

812
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,720
that’s had more experience
than me.

813
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,000
You don’t know
what you’re talking about.

814
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,320
Go home.

815
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,880
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

816
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Just relax, Bobby.

817
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,080
Where did you get that?

818
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,080
And the dress?

819
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,400
- What’s going on here?
- Bobby, what’s wrong?

820
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,600
Don’t fuck with me.

821
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,400
That necklace...

822
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,400
And Cassandra’s dress.

823
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,600
It was a present.

824
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,000
Bobby,
don’t you remember?

825
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,200
You gave it to me.

826
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,400
Stop it...

827
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,800
this instant!

828
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,200
I said, go home.

829
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,720
I mean it.

830
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I have a confession
to make.

831
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,880
I’ve had feelings for you
for a long time,

832
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,600
longer than
you can imagine.

833
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,400
I’ve always wanted something
to happen between us.

834
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,600
Something beautiful.

835
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,800
I love you, Bobby.

836
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,800
- What?!
- Please, don’t be upset, Bobby.

837
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,720
Stop calling me Bobby!

838
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,800
Okay.
I’m a little confused.

839
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,400
You are?
How do you think I feel?

840
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,080
Rachael-- Ms. Newman...

841
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,000
- this is unacceptable.
- It is?

842
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,000
But it was okay
for you and Cassandra?

843
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,600
How did--

844
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,000
I don’t know what
you’re talking about. Leave.

845
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,080
I’ve always loved you.

846
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,800
Ever since
I first saw you.

847
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,000
Before Diane ever loved you.
Before Cassandra.

848
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,200
Before Clara even ever loved you.
It was always me.

849
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,000
Don’t you get it?

850
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,080
How did you know
about Clara?

851
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,400
That was six years ago.

852
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,880
I was there, Bobby.

853
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
- Clara was babysitting me that night.
- Clara.

854
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,000
He’s here! Do something.

855
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,600
I was in Bateman’s
apartment.

856
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,200
Clara used to baby-sit me
all the time.

857
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,480
She’d tell me about
your relationship with her.

858
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,400
She’d show me
pictures of you.

859
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,400
You were my first crush.

860
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,480
You were in Patrick Bateman’s
apartment

861
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,800
the night
he killed Clara?

862
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,400
Yeah.

863
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,080
I know you quit the FBI
because of what happened.

864
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,000
I think you blame yourself
for her death.

865
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,080
Bobby, all work, no play.

866
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,400
- You want to play?
- Uh-huh.

867
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,480
Okay.

868
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,000
She was the one who looked through
your stuff and found Bateman’s file.

869
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,720
She’s tracked him down.

870
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,600
And she went to his apartment
that night and dragged me along.

871
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,080
Rich and good-looking.
Why are we together again?

872
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,880
You shouldn’t
blame yourself.

873
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,400
She went over there
to cheat on you.

874
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,720
- She was a slut.
- Shut up!

875
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,800
It’s the truth.
She got what she deserved.

876
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,320
And so did Cassandra. She thought
you didn’t love her enough.

877
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,880
It’s my turn now.
I’ve waited six years.

878
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,600
I won’t let anyone stop me,
not even Diane and your baby.

879
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,000
Don’t you threaten
my family.

880
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,720
So now you care
about your family?

881
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,200
You just can’t hold
a relationship together.

882
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,720
- Please.
- You think you’re a catch.

883
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,720
But you’re just the opportunity
of a lifetime.

884
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,320
- Stop.
- After you can’t break anymore hearts,

885
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,400
you’ll still break one more...
your baby daughter’s.

886
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,400
Please, no more.

887
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,800
Goodbye, Bobby.

888
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,200
The sun is shining

889
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:41,720
We should be making haste

890
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,320
I hope you had a safe trip.

891
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,080
Hey, nice mop!

892
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,800
Sweet dreams.

893
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,600
We are sleeping
on our feet

894
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,000
We stole the songs
from birds in trees

895
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,400
But it’s time
on easy street

896
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,880
Now it’s past,
and it’s not me.

897
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,600
Hey!

898
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,400
Hey, stop!

899
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,400
Yeah, that’s it.
Bring it back.

900
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,080
Yeah,
bring it-- yeah.

901
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,000
Back it up.
That’s it. You got it.

902
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,880
Bring it in here.
Thank you very much.

903
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Driving around
like goddamn maniacs.

904
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,400
That’s good. Perfect.
Thank you very much.

905
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,720
I sure do hope
you’ve got--

906
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,720
Holy shit.

907
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,720
{ car door closes }

908
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,720
- What the hell’s going on?
- Oh, that?

909
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,600
That’s Pr. Starkman.
He’s out of it tonight.

910
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,080
{ groan }

911
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,000
{ dialing }

912
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,400
{ ringing }

913
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,400
You’ve reached Pr. Starkman,
in the Behavioral Sciences Department.

914
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,080
Please, leave a message.

915
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,800
Hey, Bobby,
it’s Eric.

916
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,800
I felt bad about the other day.
I wanted to say I’m sorry.

917
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,800
I hope you got
that prescription filled okay.

918
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,080
Call me
if you need anything. Bye.

919
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,480
{ phone rings }

920
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,200
- Dr. Daniels’ office.
- Mary, if that’s Bobby Starkman,

921
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,600
- I’ll take it.
- He’ll take you at 3:00. All right.

922
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,320
It was for an appointment,
not the professor.

923
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,000
Okay.

924
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,480
I put her in at 3:00,
Rachael Newman.

925
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,400
She wanted
to come in today.

926
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,200
What?

927
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,600
Rachael Newman?
Are you sure?

928
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,480
Yeah.
Are you okay?

929
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,600
I can reschedule
if you want.

930
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,200
I’m--

931
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,320
no, I’m-- I’m fine.

932
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,400
It’s just--
it’s been a long day.

933
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,200
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Sure.

934
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,600
Bye.

935
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,720
Bye, Mary.

936
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,880
- { ringing }
- Come on.

937
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,880
You’ve reached Pr. Starkman
in the Behavioral Sciences Department.

938
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,720
Please,
leave a message.

939
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,000
It’s Eric again.
Call me when you get this.

940
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,880
I’m really confused
about something.

941
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
If you don’t reach me
by 3:00,

942
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,880
I’ll drop by your office
between 4:00 and 4:30.

943
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,600
Bye.

{ knocking on door }

945
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,400
- Hi, honey!
- Mom!

946
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,600
- Dad?
- We made it!

947
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,080
Hello, princess.

948
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,400
Won’t you invite us in?

949
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,880
Jeez, I’m sorry.
Please, come in.

950
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,080
Wow!
Hi, happy birthday!

951
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,400
Thank you, sweetie.

952
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,000
We’ve been
planning this for months.

953
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,400
Sweet Jesus! It smells
like somebody died in here.

954
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,000
The toilet’s clogged up and
maintenance isn’t up and running,

955
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,200
- so there’s nothing I can do.
- That’s wretched.

956
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:11,080
Sweetheart, you are
such a clothes-horse.

957
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,600
- What will I do with you?
- Don’t open the closet.

958
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,880
- our present’s in there.
- Oh, I’m sorry, sweetie.

959
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,480
Look at me,
always spoiling the surprise.

960
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,480
What will we eat?
I’m hungry.

961
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,720
Good. I made reservations
for 5:30.

962
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,000
I’m going out of town
later tonight.

963
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,600
Is this restaurant
reasonably priced?

964
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,800
Yes.

965
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,000
Is there
an early bird special?

966
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,720
- I don’t think so.
- That’s too bad.

967
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,080
- What’s it called?
- Chez Gerard’s.

968
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,320
Is that Italian? our father
cannot digest Italian food.

969
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,200
- It’s too spicy.
- Mother, it’s French.

970
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,200
French!

971
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,200
- How sophisticated!
- Yeah, okay.

972
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,080
I’ve got to finish packing
and finish writing some papers.

973
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,880
So why don’t you
go back to the motel

974
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,320
and we’ll meet
at the restaurant at 5:30?

975
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,200
Sounds good to me.
I’ve got to use the head.

976
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,080
Get maintenance
up here.

977
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,000
Daddy, I called.

978
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,600
How will we ever
find this place?

979
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,600
We’ll be back at 5:15
to pick you up.

980
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,800
- Okay.
- Bye, princess.

981
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,200
I love you, guys.

982
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,200
- { ringing }
- You’ve reached Pr. Starkman

983
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,400
in the Behavioral
Sciences Department.

984
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,400
- Please, leave a message.
- { beep }

985
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,400
Bobby, it’s Eric. I know
you’re going through tough times,

986
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,800
but she--
the she who hung herself--

987
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,000
she made an appointment to see me.
I don’t know if it’s a joke,

988
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,800
but something’s off.
Call me, all right?

989
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,400
Roses are red,
violets are blue,

990
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,000
the Daniels will soon
be calling back you.

991
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,200
Mom, you’ve got to change
that message.

992
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,600
I’ll come by around 5:30
to pick you up for our big date.

993
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,000
And I’ll get you back in time
for Murder She Wrote. Bye.

994
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,080
- Bon appetit.
- Happy birthday, Mom.

995
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,800
{ gasp }
Oh, it’s gorgeous.

996
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,400
This is the most
beautiful thing

997
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,000
I have ever received in my life.
How did you afford it?

998
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:07,720
- Stainless steel.
- It’s silver, you old lump.

999
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,200
Stainless steel.
Silver has...

1000
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,080
that distinguished
look about it.

1001
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,880
Anyway,
as I was saying before,

1002
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,800
I said to Leora she ought
to have it looked at immediately.

1003
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,000
So what does she do?
She waits an entire month.

1004
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,880
And when she sees
the doctor,

1005
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,480
he orders a biopsy
and it comes back positive.

1006
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,080
Well,
could you just die?

1007
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,480
If she had taken
my advice,

1008
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,480
she could have avoided
this mess!

1009
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,600
I know we’ll eat dinner
at some point.

1010
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,800
- The question is, when?
- I’ll go use the restroom.

1011
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,720
Don’t forget
to wash your hands.

1012
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,200
Now, where is
my steak knife?

1013
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,080
My mother drives me crazy.

1014
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,720
That sounds cliché,
but how many people envision

1015
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,800
carving into their mother’s neck
and yanking out her vocal cords?

1016
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,800
Or ripping her tongue out and serving
it to her as an early-bird special?

1017
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,000
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir. Daniels. Table for two.

1018
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,200
I’ve got a table
right here for you.

1019
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,600
After you.

1020
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,720
Why don’t you sit
on the other side?

1021
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,600
Get a view
of the whole thing.

1022
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,200
Excusez-moi, garcon.

1023
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,400
Could I have
un autre, uh...

1024
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,480
steak knife,
s’il-vous-plait?

1025
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,000
Oh.

1026
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,800
- Of course. Voila, madame.
- Merci.

1027
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,720
How about a table
closer to the window?

1028
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,800
- That would be very nice.
- Okay, I’ll ask.

1029
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,400
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1030
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:46,320
I was wondering if we could get
a table closer to the window.

1031
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,720
That section is closed
for Spring Break.

1032
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,400
Sorry.

1033
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,400
No problem. I understand.
This table is fine.

1034
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,600
Good. Can I get you
something to drink?

1035
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,720
I’ll have
a whiskey sour. Mom?

1036
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,200
I’ll need some water
to take my pills.

1037
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,480
As I stare at myself in the mirror,

1038
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,720
I realize I can’t let my mother
get the best of me.

1039
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,720
I’m Robert Starkman’s
next TA.

1040
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,800
And that’s where
I’ll focus my energies.

1041
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,600
I should set up a meeting with Bobby
when I get back.

1042
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,200
Maybe we can brainstorm
at his cabin tonight.

1043
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,880
I’ll make him my special eggs.

1044
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,800
Sorry.

1045
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,800
Ready to order?

1046
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,800
Maybe you’d give us
some more time?

1047
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,080
Sure. Of course.

1048
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,000
I’ll be just over there.

1049
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,200
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

1050
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,800
- Cheers.
- Cheers, my dear.

1051
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,320
Oh my God.

1052
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,880
Hello, Dr. Daniels.
It’s great to see you.

1053
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,000
And this must be
your mother.

1054
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,600
Hello, Mrs. Daniels.
How are you doing?

1055
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,480
I’m fine, dear.

1056
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,800
Oh my God.

1057
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,400
I just love that hat.

1058
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,480
I’d kill
for a hat like that.

1059
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,880
It is just so cute!

1060
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,000
I have to be getting back
to my table.

1061
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,600
- It was great meeting you.
- It was nice meeting you too.

1062
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,400
See you later, Eric.

1063
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,200
Who is that pretty girl?
A new girlfriend, I hope.

1064
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,400
No.

1065
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,600
She’s a patient.

1066
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,320
A very sick patient.

1067
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,080
- Excuse me for a second.
- Of course.

1068
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,000
- I’ll be right back.
- Yes.

1069
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,000
Excuse me. Sorry
to interrupt your dinner.

1070
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,200
I’m a friend of your daughter’s.
Ms. Newman,

1071
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,600
could I have a word
with you for a moment?

1072
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,800
Sure.

1073
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,800
Mom, Dad,
I’ll be just a minute.

1074
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Excuse me.

1075
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,400
That’s it. I’m eating.

1076
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,320
Didn’t he call her
a different name?

1077
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,600
You have
some explaining to do.

1078
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,800
First of all,
you insult me.

1079
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,600
Then you threaten my mother.
You’re seeing a married man.

1080
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,800
Then I hear you’ve hung yourself.
And you act like nothing happened.

1081
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,400
- What’s going on?
- You heard I hung myself?

1082
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,400
Yes.

1083
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,880
Eric, why would you
say that?

1084
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,880
Let’s say a mutual friend
told me he found you.

1085
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,480
Dead.

1086
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,720
- Is this some sort of sick joke?
- He never found me. He found her.

1087
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,200
Her who?

1088
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:09,000
It doesn’t even matter anymore.
It’s not important.

1089
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,200
What’s important is my mom’s
birthday, and she’s here.

1090
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,320
I’ll catch up with you later.
Goodbye.

1091
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,720
Honey, why did he call you
Ms. Newman?

1092
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,600
I don’t know.
Could we just eat?

1093
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,720
- I have to go home and pack.
- Can’t you cancel?

1094
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,080
We never get a chance
to see you.

1095
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,200
I wish I could,
but I can’t.

1096
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,600
- They’re very special plans.
- A boy?

1097
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,800
- Yes, it’s a boy.
- What’s his name?

1098
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,800
Bobby Starkman.

1099
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,200
Bobby?

1100
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,800
- Hey, Jim.
- Dr. Daniels.

1101
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,400
A cup of
apricot-peppermint blend?

1102
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,880
Thank. We might have
a bit of trouble.

1103
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,080
- Is Harv in?
- He’s in the back.

1104
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,720
If it’s not
Sigmund Freud himself!

1105
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,480
- What’s the good word?
- Not much.

1106
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,200
I want to file a missing person’s
report on Robert Starkman.

1107
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,400
- You’re kidding?
- I wish I were.

1108
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,000
His wife called 20 minutes ago
to do the same thing.

1109
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,400
He didn’t show up at his in-laws’
upstate like he was supposed to.

1110
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,800
- You’re kidding?
- I wish I were.

1111
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,400
- It’s been a crazy year.
- What do you mean?

1112
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,800
It’s the third MPR we’ve filed
this year. Right, Jimmy?

1113
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,400
- That’s a record around here.
- Who else was there?

1114
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,200
Let’s have a look.

1115
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,480
I’ve got a brand new one here.
A woman, Gerty Fleck,

1116
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,800
from Student Services.
Just up and disappeared.

1117
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,400
And of course,
that Newman girl.

1118
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,480
A student, Rachael Newman,
disappeared.

1119
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,400
The first day
of the semester.

1120
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,080
Jimmy and I toddled up
on campus to check it out.

1121
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,000
And guess what?

1122
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,800
I’m Sheriff Winslow,
and this is Deputy Duncan.

1123
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,080
Just looking for a--

1124
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,080
- Are you Rachael Newman?
- Yeah. What’s wrong?

1125
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,000
We’re checking
on a MPR on yourself.

1126
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,320
You’re not missing,
are you?

1127
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,800
No, I’m okay.

1128
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,720
She was there,
unharmed.

1129
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,600
Are you sure
I can’t offer you some tea?

1130
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,400
No, thanks, Jim.

1131
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,480
I actually know
this Rachael Newman girl.

1132
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,480
To be honest,
I don’t trust her.

1133
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,880
Are you telling me the parents
just dropped the report?

1134
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I never said nothing
about parents.

1135
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,400
The Newman girl,
she was an orphan.

1136
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,800
The report was filed by
some student friends of hers.

1137
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,480
- But it was a false alarm.
- How do you know it was her?

1138
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,800
There’s only one Rachael Newman
registered at school.

1139
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,200
Can I convince you guys
to come to the campus with me

1140
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,800
to make sure
everything’s okay?

1141
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,400
Yeah, no problem, Doc.

1142
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,600
- Should I get in here?
- That’s fine.

1143
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,000
{ phone ringing }

1144
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,800
You’re reached Pr. Starkman
in the Behavioral Sciences Department.

1145
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,000
Please,
leave a message.

1146
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,320
Hey, it’s me.
I’m almost done packing.

1147
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,800
I’ll be there soon.
I hope you’re as excited as I am.

1148
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,720
If you need me
to go to the store,

1149
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,080
I’ll be here another five minutes.
Otherwise, see you soon.

1150
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,800
I love you. Bye.

1151
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,400
God, you stink.

1152
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,400
Now, how did you get open?

1153
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,600
Trying
to sneak out on me?

1154
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,880
I just brought you up and
you’re already causing problems.

1155
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,320
Don’t fall apart
on me now, Rach.

1156
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,880
Wow! I like your room.

1157
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,600
Actually,

1158
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,600
I like your name too.

1159
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,600
Rachael.

1160
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,880
You don’t mind
if I borrow it?

1161
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,480
Well, this is a wild-goose
chase, I guess.

1162
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,200
- Have a good day.
- You too. Thank you, Officers.

1163
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,600
Hey, Mom, I know
I’ve been out of touch,

1164
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,480
but I got accepted
to West Washington.

1165
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,080
I know.
Can you believe it?

1166
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,320
It’s so sad
about your parents.

1167
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,600
That car accident thing and all.
So tragic.

1168
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,200
Must have been hard
growing up an orphan.

1169
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,800
But, I’m glad
you shared it with me.

1170
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Oh, Bobby.

1171
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,800
I told you to get
your beauty sleep.

1172
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,080
We have a long night
ahead of us.

1173
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,480
You’re disgusting.

1174
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,320
So, I’m two cans of gas
and a brick away from Quantico.

1175
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:40,320
I just have to dot the Is
and cross the Ts, and I’m home free.

1176
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,800
Look out!

1177
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,320
- Jesus!
- That was the Newman girl!

1178
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,400
We’re on the move!
Hang on!

1179
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,400
Not now, Bobby.

1180
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,480
Wait till we get
to the cabin.

1181
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,600
I’ll make you a fire.
I’ll heat you up real good.

1182
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,080
This qualifies as breaking
the speed limit.

1183
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,800
- Don’t you think?
- Doing?

1184
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,480
60...

1185
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,600
- in a 35.
- Yeah.

1186
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,600
She’s coming up on Old Mill Bend.
She’ll slow down for the curve.

1187
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,600
- We’ll take her there.
- Take it easy.

1188
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,480
- We don’t want anyone getting hurt.
- It’s all under control.

1189
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,800
That’s 275 bucks.

1190
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,720
- Can you pull up next to her?
- Yeah, for a bit.

1191
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,200
Jesus!

1192
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,800
- Can you do something?
- Yeah. Take the wheel.

1193
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,200
She’s slowing down.
That did the trick.

1194
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,480
Doc, you stay here.

1195
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,000
Just be careful.
She’s a loose cannon.

1196
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,080
It’s all part
of the job, right?

1197
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,080
Ma’am.

1198
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,880
Ma’am, open the door.

1199
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,080
Come on!

1200
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,200
Come on, guys.
Don’t let her get away!

1201
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,600
This don’t look good.

1202
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,000
Jesus.

1203
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,800
- What the hell?
- Don’t let it be Bobby.

1204
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,480
Christ!

1205
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,000
Bobby.

1206
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,400
How the hell...

1207
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,720
Starkman.

1208
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,800
- Where the heck is our lady friend?
- { tires screeching }

1209
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,880
Come on.

1210
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,800
Bobby.

1211
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,600
{ explosion }

1212
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,480
Jesus!

1213
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,080
Bobby.

1214
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,200
A bizarre killing spree
came to an end last night

1215
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,880
when 18-year-old West Washington student
Rachael Newman, now identified...

1216
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,600
Rachael Newman’s killing
spree is believed to have begun

1217
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,800
Wednesday evening with
the murder of Gertrude Fleck...

1218
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,720
The body
of Cassandra Blair was found

1219
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,200
- hanging in her...
- Brian Leeds’ body,

1220
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:05,200
- from the Leeds family...
- Keith Lawson was...

1221
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,600
The bodies
of a West Washington security guards

1222
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,200
- were found within hours...
- Once a typical girl,

1223
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:14,200
Rachael Newman’s death
leaves many questions unanswered.

1224
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,320
The most burning question
of all: Why?

1225
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,320
As a case-study,

1226
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,080
Rachael Newman
was as rare as they come.

1227
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,600
She was more obsessed
than Dahmer,

1228
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,600
she was more calculating
than Bundy,

1229
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,800
and certainly more faceless
than Bateman.

1230
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,600
In a perfect world,
she’d still be alive.

1231
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:45,080
But for her,
it all ended...

1232
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,080
in a blaze of fire

1233
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,720
in which she
and her final victim,

1234
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,880
a friend of mine,
Robert Starkman--

1235
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,480
they burned to death.

1236
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:03,200
I wish I had a chance
to study her mind more,

1237
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,800
but all we ended up
with were dental records.

1238
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,800
All in all,
she killed eight people.

1239
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,320
Eight people
which we know of.

1240
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:16,600
Rachael Newman
is one in a billion.

1241
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,000
One in a billion.

1242
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,320
She’s in a league
of her own.

1243
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:26,480
But she will remain
a constant and strong reminder

1244
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:29,080
that people aren’t always
what they seem to be.

1245
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,600
Thanks for taking the time
to come out.

1246
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,200
- Thank you for coming, Doctor.
- It’s a pleasure.

1247
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:54,200
- Who should I make it out to?
- Louis Okon.

1248
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,320
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1249
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,000
- Can I have a different pen?
- Here you go.

1250
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,400
- Who should I make it out to?
- Elizabeth...

1251
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:10,600
- Elizabeth McGuire.
- McGuire.

1252
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,400
your work
is so inspiring.

1253
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,880
It’s a huge honor
to meet you.

1254
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
If you could be
anyone in the world,

1255
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,400
- who would that be?
- Elizabeth McGuire,

1256
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,800
Pr. Starkman’s present TA,
and the next in line for Quantico.

1257
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,400
- You can’t be?
- What, Eric?

1258
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,080
One in a billion?

1259
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,200
Hello, Dr. Daniels--

1260
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:50,400
- Do you know that girl?
- Who?

1261
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:54,200
- Elizabeth McGuire.
- You mean, Agent McGuire.

1262
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,600
She’s the first Quantico
student in history

1263
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,480
to be drafted into the Bureau
in her sophomore year.

1264
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,000
Are you all right, Doctor?

1265
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:21,480
It’s like they say...

1266
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,000
„The brightest futures
are based on forgotten pasts.”

1267
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,200
In the end, I did put Dr. Daniels
in a bit of a pickle.

1268
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,400
But you’ve got
to give to take.

1269
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:35,400
He gets his national best-seller,
which is ever so flawed...

1270
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,600
I wonder how he sleeps at night,
knowing I still walk the streets.

1271
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:40,800
Me?

1272
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,880
I need
for him to know.

1273
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,320
What’s the point of pulling off
the perfect set of murders,

1274
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,200
to realize my dream, if there isn’t
someone alive who knows?

1275
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,320
It would be as if
I’d done nothing at all.

1276
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:07,200
I remember her

1277
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:11,200
The girl
that wouldn’t die

1278
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:15,400
She said
it wasn’t true

1279
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:19,480
I knew
it was a lie

1280
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,480
People on the street

1281
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,880
Would cry out
if they knew

1282
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,800
The things
that I have done

1283
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,720
To make the dream
come true

1284
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,800
When she blew
my mind away

1285
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:44,000
All the feelings
were betrayed

1286
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,080
Heaven would
squeeze her

1287
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,880
Hell would
release her

1288
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,800
Into my brain

1289
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,480
La la la la la

1290
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,880
La la la la la la

1291
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,080
La la la la la

1292
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,600
La la la la la

1293
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,720
And I swear
she looked surprised

1294
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,600
When I joined
the freak show guys

1295
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,720
Under the Big Top

1296
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,800
I was a Cyclops

1297
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:48,600
With two eyes

1298
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,600
Morning
turned to night

1299
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:56,800
And she said
it was a hoax

1300
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,000
And when she came
with me

1301
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:05,480
She said it was a joke

1302
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,000
I still hear the beat

1303
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:13,480
And it makes me
want to fly

1304
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,400
For I cannot complete

1305
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,400
The girl
who wouldn’t die

1306
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:25,600
In a million
little years

1307
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:29,400
All the waiting
to be here

1308
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,480
Hell couldn’t crush me

1309
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,600
Heaven would brush me

1310
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,880
Out of the tear

1311
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:15,800
La la la la la

1312
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,080
La la la la la la

1313
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:24,200
La la la la la

1314
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,880
La la la la la.

1315
01:26:28,881 --> 01:26:32,581
