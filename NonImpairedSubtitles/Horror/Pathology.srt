1
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,680
It's possible.

2
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,580
Get outta here.

3
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,880
Why, most women at one time or
another faked it.

4
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:40,880
Well, they haven't faked it with me.

5
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,880
Ohh, right right, I forgot,
you're a man.

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
You don't think that I could tell
the difference?

7
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:56,080
Oh, Ohh, Ohh...

8
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,680
Hey, you ok?

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:09,880
Oh, Ohh, Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, Ohh...
Ohh, right there! Yes! Yes!

10
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,080
Ohh, Ohhh...

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,680
I want what she's having.
Yeah, we're going to hell.

12
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,380
Fuck me, please.

13
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,680
You're bad.
I'm gonna be late for my flight.

14
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,280
I don't care.

15
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,180
- I can not see you for three whole months.
- Don't be a baby.

16
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:04,980
- I love you.
- Careful, I may just marry you and ruin your life.

17
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,480
You better...

18
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,280
Fine, go be with your...

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,780
dead people, Doctor.

20
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:20,680
Figuring out how they die is gonna help people.

21
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:23,180
Your hands are so cold.

22
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,980
Time's gonna feel like nothing ok.

23
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:32,280
I miss you already.

24
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,080
- Love you.
- And I love you.

25
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,580
T..Ted Gray?

26
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,680
- Ben Stravinsky.
- I am. Ben Stravinsky.

27
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:58,680
- Take it you'll be showing me around?
- Ted Gray, I'm all over it.

28
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,680
Here we are.

29
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:05,680
County morgue. Ze real banana.

30
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,080
If you check out from any unnatural or

31
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,080
unexplained cause within the city limits
will end up here.

32
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,680
As resident we get full access.

33
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,780
Ah right. This it Pathology Room No. 1.

34
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:30,280
It's been pretty slow lately, but holiday season's
around the corner, it should hopefully pick up.

35
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,580
Certain people around here couldn't
possibly be anymore annoying.

36
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,780
Beg your pardon?

37
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
- Oh no.
- What?

38
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:49,980
Some of these guys last year,
they decided that...

39
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:53,480
...they were gonna be God's
gift to this place.

40
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,580
Hey, you have a girlfriend?

41
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,180
As pathologists, we'll learn
the nature of disease and its causes...

42
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,980
its processes, development, consequences.

43
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:14,280
But far from more than that. I'd like to think that
the pathologists has offered a window to God if you will.

44
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,080
Now, it maybe said...

45
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:22,580
the pathology is a study in all things
human, save for the soul of course.

46
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:26,380
But it is in that particular branch of
pathology known as forensics

47
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:30,080
that we will delve into what it means
to be inhuman.

48
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,880
You will see the perversion...

49
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,880
and the corruption of the flesh
by all means unnatural.

50
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,580
By violence.

51
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:39,880
By toxins.

52
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:41,280
By madness.

53
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:45,280
And then we will work backwards,
always back...

54
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,180
To that original pristine design
to determine the offending cause of death.

55
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,280
Dr. Morris?

56
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,180
- Oh, you're...
- Hi.

57
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,380
Dr. Stravinsky, I want you
to hunt down Jake Gallo.

58
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:08,880
Tell him, I want to see him chop-chop.

59
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,780
Yes sir.

60
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,480
Ahh... quite a pleasure.
I've heard a great deal about you.

61
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:17,080
How was Africa?

62
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:19,980
Was a challenge. Quite humbling though.

63
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:23,580
- A very privileged year.
- Indeed.

64
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:27,580
I spoke to your future father-in-law this morning,
he's quite proud of you, you know.

65
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,080
And Gwendolyn.

66
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Have had the chance to see her
since you've been home?

67
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:38,280
- Only briefly.
- Oh, that's a pity.

68
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,880
I have known that girl since she was
barely out of braces.

69
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,580
She's become quite a woman.

70
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:48,780
You are indeed privileged
and evidently quite talented.

71
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:50,980
Dr. Morris.

72
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:52,880
Dr. Gallo.

73
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,380
I would like you to meet Dr. Gray.

74
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:01,180
Hello Doctor Gray.

75
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,480
Ted comes to us top of his class from Harvard.

76
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:08,380
- Eighteen weeks at Bellview in New York city.
- Ohh, patient?

77
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:14,080
Before being accepted in the UNICEF program in Legos,
where he has been for the past four months.

78
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:18,080
Bleeding heart. I cut one of those
in half this morning.

79
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Jake is our young... star in residents.

80
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,580
Single-handedly solved the Hordon family murders.

81
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:30,980
If it weren't for a little student intership,
I think the FBI would still be fingering around.

82
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:32,880
Damn.

83
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
I expect you two would get along quite well.

84
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,080
Doctors, this is a simple case of kidney failure.

85
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:46,580
Blood in the urine, general swelling.

86
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,980
Hey, look at his skin.
Looks like cheddar cheese.

87
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,180
- Excuse me. Pardon my interject.
- By all means.

88
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,880
- He may interject?
- Given the boy's medical history, I believe
he died during a state of hypoxia and asthma attack.

89
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:02,380
Fresh out of medical books.

90
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:06,980
Oh forgive me, that seems more like a hypercondural
conclusion than an answer for the deceased.

91
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:08,880
11 year old boy, overweight.

92
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:12,780
This last report, Daniel stated he's
been ridiculed at school for his weight.

93
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:18,280
The weight he started gaining when he began
taking Pediapred to treat an acute asthma condition.

94
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:21,880
You'll gonna notice there's no trace
of the steroid in blood or bladder.

95
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:25,880
- Blah blah blah blah blah.
- Is there a problem?

96
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:29,880
- Doctor please, continue.
- He stop taking the steroid.

97
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:34,980
In his mind the abuse he suffered from his peers
for being fat was worse than the asthma itself.

98
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:40,980
Finally during a field-trip to the zoo,
he died from a severe attack.

99
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:44,980
One can't disregard psychology
when forming a diagnosis.

100
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,380
Ted Gray! Home Run!
No question about it. Acute asthma.

101
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:01,180
Uhh... no.
I think it's coagulated nasal mucus.

102
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:04,980
Death by booger.

103
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,180
Sorry man, I didn't see you there.

104
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,480
You wanted to know if there was a problem?

105
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:22,480
- There is one. We don't like you.
- That's not a problem.

106
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,580
Yeah, so I met Dr. Morris today.

107
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,080
I think the guy still has a crush on you

108
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:36,180
or me.

109
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:39,180
Can't be too sure.

110
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,480
Yeah, yeah I'm st.. of course I'm still excited.
The place is beautiful.

111
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,980
The school's beautiful, everything's beautiful.

112
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:49,380
You're beautiful.

113
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,580
Hey, I gotta get up in four hours,
you're corrupting me.

114
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,380
Yeah, I love you too.
Bye.

115
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,980
Alright everybody, gather around.

116
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:22,080
I want you to meet my friend Carl.

117
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:24,480
- Hello Carl.
- Hey Carl.

118
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:28,180
Now several weeks back, his doctors
recorded that Carl

119
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:30,780
was experiencing frequent nauseous,

120
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:36,180
discomfort while urinating, dizziness.
- You're describing my weekend.

121
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:40,180
His symptoms increased in severity until
Carl decided it's was time to pay us a visit.

122
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,280
Jesus. You killed him.

123
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,980
Oh ohh Jesus!

124
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,480
Dr. Gray has quite nicely severed
the parametral tract.

125
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:57,480
Disconnecting Carl's nerve from his brain,

126
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,180
which had momentarily forgotten it was dead.

127
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:08,080
A decidedly entertaining although unnecessary
display of skill. Thank you, young man.

128
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,480
- Dr. Gray. Dr. Gray.
- Ted.

129
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,580
- Ted Gray
- Ben Stravinsky.

130
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:19,680
That was pretty over the top today huh?

131
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,480
Yeah.

132
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,180
- I'm sorry, you were saying?
- Oh... no... the whole...

133
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,180
- Take care.
- No, yeah.. of course, of course.
It's just like pap... it's pretty cool.

134
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,280
This is what we like to call the food stand.

135
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,680
You guys haven't even got that cage open yet?

136
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,680
Why are we here?

137
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:34,380
All of us. In here instead of out there.

138
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,480
Why?

139
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,280
Because we prefer the company.

140
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:42,280
This kind of company.

141
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,180
Am I right?

142
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:46,580
Vernish.

143
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:50,580
When I think about them, you know, out there...

144
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:58,480
...in their rooms, on the streets,
utilising public transportation...

145
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,680
...downloading pornography,
ordering their lives out of catalogs...

146
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,180
...shitting out processed foods,
cashing welfare checks...

147
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:13,180
...opining, bitching, moaning, consuming, copulating...

148
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,280
...and multiplying.
It makes me sick.

149
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,580
What we need, brothers and sisters,
is less of them

150
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,180
and more of this.

151
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:28,380
Don't you agree, Dr. Gray?

152
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,480
I can see your point,
not sure I agree.

153
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,080
Ah well, nobody's perfect.

154
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:43,080
Not even you, Dr. Gallo.

155
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,880
- Ohh God!
- You don't wanna be cutting into the poop pipe, kid.

156
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,880
That stuff will kill you.

157
00:13:56,915 --> 00:13:59,480
Well, we gotta go at some point right?

158
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:05,480
In that case, wanna come and join us?
We're heading to Thirteen Stones.

159
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Ohh... doctors' in.

160
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,180
Mother fucker...
Fucking hurts man!

161
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,880
Alright.

162
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,380
Ah ahh...

163
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,980
- To the dead!
- To the dead!

164
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,080
Ok. Guys, let's play tell the truth.
Question.

165
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:56,980
If you could kill anyone and get away with it,
who would you kill?

166
00:14:57,015 --> 00:14:59,880
The guy who invented condoms.

167
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,480
Fuck that guy.

168
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:05,080
- Griffin.
- I don't know.

169
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:07,780
C'mon it's an easy quesiton, Griff.

170
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:11,780
- You maybe.
- Oh I'm sorry, did you want to fuck me that bad?

171
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,680
Just your skull.

172
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:18,680
Trust me Dr. Cavenaugh,
it's not as good as it looks.

173
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,580
I am interested in what Dr. Gray has to say.

174
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:29,180
Yeah, c'mon Teddy.

175
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,180
You guys want the truth or something clever?

176
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:39,180
- The truth.
- Just something clever.

177
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,180
Truth is ya'll full of shit.

178
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:45,180
Well go on, elaborate.

179
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:49,480
I mean, who needs motif, who needs a reason to kill.

180
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,980
Just today, Jake, you opened a 16 year old boy

181
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:55,080
who was shot in the stomach
because somebody wanted his fucking Ipod.

182
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,380
What kind of reason is that?

183
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:02,580
We're animals. It's in our nature to kill.
Basic, simple.

184
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:05,080
You should've all figured that out by now.

185
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:09,180
And of course, if we were civilized or socialized,
we'll be seating around talking about it over a beer,

186
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,180
we don't actually do it.

187
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:14,380
But could we really get away with it?

188
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:19,380
To kill anyone? Anyone at all?

189
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:25,380
Would you kill anyone? Anyone at all?

190
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,380
Good show! Now that's a man after my own heart.

191
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Griff, waddaya say we get some shots?

192
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,480
I wonder about you.

193
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,580
Quit flirting with Teddy, we have to go soon.

194
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:51,680
Go play with the boys.

195
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,680
So, where're you from?

196
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:02,680
Where am I from?
Maybe we should just get past that.

197
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,780
Ok.

198
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,280
Drink up. We're outta here.

199
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,480
Where're we goin?

200
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:18,080
Oh no, not we.

201
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:22,380
- We. You can take a cab.
- Cool.

202
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,380
I'm sorry man.

203
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Aww, don't be hurt.
Have another beer.

204
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,880
Tomorrow night, just you and me.

205
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:46,380
Oh yeah? Doing what?

206
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:49,780
Nothing too exciting.

207
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,180
- W..Watch out!
- Whoaa!

208
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:03,280
- What the f...?
- That guy was in my fucking lane.

209
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,180
Hello!
It's dead.

210
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,980
C'mon, I want you to see something.

211
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,180
- Fuck!
- Shhh...

212
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,280
How many?

213
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,880
How many do you see?

214
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,480
- One fitty.
- Fitty?

215
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:43,080
One fitty!

216
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:52,980
Look bro, here's 80 bucks.
Last in to walk and talk.

217
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Watch your step!

218
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,380
Hey, how's the herb?

219
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,180
You nervous?

220
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,380
No, but I think it's staying in my pants.

221
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:30,980
You sure about that?

222
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,080
Hey sport!

223
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:35,780
Shit!

224
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:38,280
Is this for real?

225
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,280
Hey sexy!

226
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
Fuck!

227
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,880
This is an illustration Dr. Gray
of why I hate doing it.

228
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,680
- This is fucked up man.
- Yeah, you think?

229
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:56,480
Ok, get me the fuck outta here!

230
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:59,480
- You sure? I mean we're already paid up.

231
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:01,880
Ok, let's go!

232
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,980
I want you all to work closely
with me on this one.

233
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:27,880
Sorry.

234
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,080
You smell like a liquor cabinet.

235
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:35,780
Doctor Bentwood, will you do the honour?

236
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:38,180
Harper Johnson, 40.

237
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:42,180
Convicted murderer, recently paroled,
subject was found...

238
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,280
One fitty!

239
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,980
I have to go out.

240
00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:55,980
Forget to use the little boy's room, Dr. Gray?

241
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,380
All the blood tests are negative.

242
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:31,380
Alright, we have four scenarios running.
We have to narrow this down.

243
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,980
You want to present first?

244
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:36,180
Sure!

245
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:40,180
Simple assignment.
The subject was stabbed, excessively.

246
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
A minor struggle ensued, and he was shot
at the back of the head.

247
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,180
Cause of the death,
a gunshot wound to the brain.

248
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:53,080
The lack of blood from the head and the gradations of color
from the toraxic cavity of the neck, would tell us otherwise.

249
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,180
He would've lost too much blood to live
by the time he was shot in the head.

250
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:00,480
I think it was a mark, like a gang sign.

251
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:03,780
They probably watched him die
and then shot him.

252
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:05,580
Exsanguination via stab wounds.

253
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:09,280
Alright, let's discuss the trauma
on the left side of the head.

254
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:10,780
Any information of the meninges?

255
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:13,780
It's a domino effect in a trauma
of a gunshot wound.

256
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:16,580
I don't think so.

257
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:20,880
You wouldn't find any information
after a fatal wound like this.

258
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:23,880
The subject was obviously struck in the head
on the left side with a bat or kick

259
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:26,280
or one hell of a hard punch.

260
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:31,880
Look, there's a left epidural hematoma which caused injury
to the right temporal lobe from shifting in the skull.

261
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,180
This could've happened in the original confrontation.

262
00:22:36,215 --> 00:22:40,180
What concerns me more, is this discoloration.

263
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:42,280
Well the blood tests did negative.

264
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:44,980
Well, a solution of potassium cyanide,
will leave no trace in the blood

265
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:48,980
or organ tissue sample detectable by standard tests.

266
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:53,180
Besides the stains on Harper's clothes were 70% plasma.

267
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:57,180
Most of the blood began coagulation
before exsanguination.

268
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,580
So whether he was moved or not...

269
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:03,580
majority of the blood remains in the body.

270
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,680
I say we run a post-mortem Chem-7 on his major organs

271
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:09,380
to evaluate his potassium levels.

272
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:10,880
You really think he was poisoned?

273
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:17,180
Six to seven hours before cuts were made to his body
the gunshot, followed shortly after.

274
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:22,180
You know there was actually gunpowder in the stab wounds.
Didn't anyone else notice?

275
00:23:22,215 --> 00:23:25,180
I agree with Ted.

276
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:28,880
Signs of livor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis,
in the percede external wounds.

277
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:34,180
It's possible that the poison was injected directly
into the heart, be it the left axle or subscapular regions

278
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,780
or the lungs, be it the intercostal spaces...
enabling the killer to use less of a solution.

279
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,880
This will allow it to go undetected while
still getting the job done.

280
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,380
Lemme get this straight...
Are you proposing

281
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:53,680
that the man was poisoned with
potassium cyanide

282
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:57,680
then the killer waited 7 hours,
stabbed him 18 times

283
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:00,180
and then shot him in the back of the head?

284
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:04,880
- I realise this is highly improbable.
- That's an understatement.

285
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:10,280
However, we will explore it.
I will order Chem-7 and we will re-convene.

286
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,680
Ladies, gentlemen.

287
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:16,080
Nicely done. Might be onto something here.

288
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:20,080
Hey, meet me here tonight, 9pm.

289
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,380
You truly have a gift Ted.

290
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Wh..What? You gonna bum-poke me?

291
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,780
- Let's go.
- You're late.

292
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,480
This's where you bring all your dates?

293
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Now this wing is over a 100 years old. Obsolete.
If I'd, I'll tear it out and re-built it someday.

294
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,380
So, impress me.

295
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
You killed him.

296
00:26:20,715 --> 00:26:22,480
Maybe.

297
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,180
The point is, how?

298
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,780
That is this? A game?

299
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:30,680
Exactly!
It's a game.

300
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,880
I don't fucking believe this.

301
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:35,680
- C'mon get over it, will you.
- Get over it?

302
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:39,480
There are 6.5 million people
in this city, Ted, trust me

303
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,780
this asshole will not be missed.

304
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:43,680
Really?

305
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:47,880
You can't say he didn't have it coming.
Right?

306
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,980
Yeah, he was not exactly a boy scout.
Is that what you want me to say?

307
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:56,580
Not exactly a boy scout Ted,
he was irredeemable filth.

308
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,080
That was his grandmother, by the way.

309
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,780
But really, who needs a reason.

310
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:15,380
We're animals. It's our nature to kill.

311
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,280
Remember?

312
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,780
Why show me this?

313
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,980
I don't know, Ted.

314
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:28,780
I thought the intellectual challenge
might be of interest to you.

315
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:32,780
- Was I wrong?
- No. No, I find it extremely fucking interesting.

316
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,280
Good. So, what's your theory?

317
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:38,380
I stay to my case.

318
00:27:38,415 --> 00:27:40,580
Potassium Cyanide?

319
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:44,580
What are you? Some kind of serial killer?

320
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,680
Oh...

321
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,980
I obviously misjudged you.

322
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,680
Maybe you should just

323
00:27:56,715 --> 00:28:00,680
run along home before the others get here.

324
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,080
The others?

325
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:07,080
Seriously man, get the fuck outta here.

326
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,180
- Yes?
- How do you know I won't tell?

327
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,180
Because there so happens to exist,

328
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:37,780
distinct physical evidence putting you
at the crime scene at the time of death.

329
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,680
I know because I placed it there.

330
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:46,680
And if I was amind to it I could prove with mathematical certainty
and beyond reasonable doubt that you were the one that did it.

331
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,780
But none of that really matters if
you're the boy I think you are.

332
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,080
You won't tell because
that would mean the game is over.

333
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,480
And you never got to play.

334
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,180
I don't know if you've heard but we got
the results back on our black male. Negative.

335
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,180
I heard. I'm sorry sir.

336
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:17,980
No, no, no, priviledged from time to time.

337
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:22,180
- Interesting theory.
- Thank you.
- Well, carry on.

338
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,180
Teddy!

339
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,480
What're you doin here?

340
00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:41,280
It wasn't potassium cyanide because there was no ragged stippling
in the red blood cells. The blood was hypo or smaller.

341
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,080
It was nitric acid.

342
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:46,580
You brought him a bottle. A gift.

343
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:48,280
You shared a drink with him,
but you didn't drink.

344
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:52,180
You mixed athenol and nitric acid with the alcohol.
Probably a flavor to alcohol

345
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:55,180
to mask the bitter taste.

346
00:30:55,215 --> 00:31:00,380
Using a needle would've been too dangerous because any first
year fucking med student would know to look for the mark.

347
00:31:00,415 --> 00:31:04,080
You cut him up when he was still alive
but unconscious.

348
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:05,780
So there was no struggle.

349
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:07,380
Then you put him in the back of your truck,
drove him to fourth avenue

350
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:11,880
and shot him in the back of the head.

351
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:19,480
Mother fucker. Ah, you are good.

352
00:31:19,515 --> 00:31:25,980
Hey, you wanna play the game, you gotta bring
something to the table. Comprendo?

353
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
So Jake told you about the game?

354
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,380
It's alright, you can say it.

355
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,280
So, are you in?

356
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
I don't know.

357
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,280
- You know what you have to do, right?
- Yeah.

358
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:39,380
I get the idea.

359
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,180
It's an interesting case.

360
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,180
You know it's always me that ends up with the dirt.
It's a waste of a goddamn ICU.

361
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,980
Mother fucker shoots his wife
and two kids, execution style

362
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,980
then he shoots himself in the throat

363
00:33:26,015 --> 00:33:29,180
two more in the stomach and
he still couldn't get it done.

364
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:33,380
Double his morphine.
I'll check back in a couple of days.

365
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,280
- He's strapped in.
- Lot of pain.

366
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,880
He tried to pull out his wires.
He see devil soon I think.

367
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,680
- Oh my God, stop the bus. We need a doctor.
- Someone call 911.

368
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:09,980
- Is anybody a doctor?
- Is she breathing?

369
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,280
- Teddy?
- Hey baby.
- You alright?

370
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:35,580
Yeah, I'm great. I'm good.

371
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,580
- I got your message.
- You sounded like someone else.

372
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,980
Anyway, do you miss me?

373
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,280
Of course.

374
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,880
How's the work load goin?

375
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:57,880
Actually that's one of the things
I wanted to talk to you about.

376
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,680
- It looks like next weekend...
- You're fucked?

377
00:35:01,715 --> 00:35:05,680
I'm sorry. There's this mob trial and...

378
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,980
I understand.

379
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:11,980
Don't be rational, I'm gonna start crying
right here in the middle of the street.

380
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,280
Baby, to be honest, I have expected it.

381
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,180
Atleast there's Thanksgiving.

382
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:30,380
Absolutely.

383
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,880
My parents are still expecting
us to stay with them.

384
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,980
Of course.

385
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,580
Are you sure it's alright?
Because it's not too late to change your mind.

386
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,480
It's too late.

387
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
How so?

388
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:53,980
Yeah, no...

389
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,680
your parents are great.
It's beautiful there.

390
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:02,380
We're gonna have the back house
to ourselves, right?

391
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:04,380
That's true.

392
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:14,480
- Then it's settled.
- Ok then. I can't wait.

393
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,880
I'll call you tomorrow.

394
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:23,480
I love you.

395
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,780
You too.

396
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,780
I know exactly what you're thinking.

397
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:40,780
You think you feel guilty but it's not that.
There's not such thing as guilt.

398
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,080
There's just the fear of getting caught.

399
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,580
It's the first day after,
so that fear's still fresh.

400
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Your brain is all sick and twisted up.
You're paranoid everyone knows.

401
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,280
You fucked up, you're gonna lose everything.

402
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,980
You wanna throw-up but
there's nothing in your stomach.

403
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,980
You're not gonna sleep tonight.

404
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:13,180
You'll hit the bottom, you'll watch some TV, and look for
any news that they're on you, but there won't be any.

405
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Tomorrow morning, you're gonna wake up and it's gonna
be the same world. Nothing has changed.

406
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,880
That fear, it will start to creep away and after a few days

407
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,280
you're gonna realise no one knows shit.

408
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:32,280
That this whole bloody thing,
disadvantage to you, so cataclysmic

409
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,080
has somehow

410
00:37:34,115 --> 00:37:37,380
slipped beneath the notice of the world.

411
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:38,980
And then...

412
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,280
you'll be a new man.

413
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,480
That sheet

414
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:04,180
on which she embroiled fantails once

415
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:08,180
spread it so as to cover her face

416
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,680
If her horny feet protrude,
they come to show how cold she is

417
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,480
and dumb.

418
00:38:15,515 --> 00:38:19,080
Let the lamp affix its beam.

419
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:23,080
The only emperor, is the emperor of ice-cream.

420
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,580
How did you do it?

421
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:30,080
Later.

422
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,680
Welcome.

423
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
I knew you had it in you.

424
00:40:28,915 --> 00:40:31,080
Had what in me?

425
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,680
C'mon, he was gonna die anyway.

426
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:38,380
Yeah, we're all gonna die anyway.

427
00:40:38,415 --> 00:40:40,380
Fuck you!

428
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,280
So who is he?

429
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:17,180
Sort of this great man once. He never might know. He built
'em saved up from nothing. At one point he owned seven stores.

430
00:41:17,215 --> 00:41:24,280
He married his highschool sweetheart.
Started a family.

431
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,080
Didn't last long though.

432
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,180
She left him, took the kids.
His business ran down,

433
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:35,480
he pissed away most of his money.

434
00:41:35,515 --> 00:41:37,780
Why did she leave?

435
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:41,480
- The highschool sweetheart?
- Yeah.

436
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,380
I forgot to mention, he likes little girls.

437
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,080
In the worse way.
You wouldn't believe what he does to them.

438
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,180
He should've gone to jail but

439
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:06,680
you know how it goes, right?
It's easier for everyone to say nothing.

440
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:09,680
How do you know all this?

441
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Because you never forget your first fuck.

442
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,580
He's my father.

443
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,580
I want you to help me.

444
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,880
Because it's my turn for the game.

445
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,480
- Doesn't seem like your type.
- No?

446
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:47,080
Clearly not like the usual lost cause
from the tournament award.

447
00:42:47,115 --> 00:42:51,080
Oh he may had a few issues with
alcohol and tobacco.

448
00:42:51,115 --> 00:42:52,580
Don't we all.

449
00:42:52,615 --> 00:42:58,180
But for the most part, he seems to have been in
relatively good health for a man of his age.

450
00:42:58,215 --> 00:43:00,580
That is until you came along.

451
00:43:00,615 --> 00:43:04,580
Could you be anymore hot right now?

452
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,380
I wonder what came over you?

453
00:43:07,415 --> 00:43:10,780
It's as if he dropped his lungs
off the side of a building.

454
00:43:10,815 --> 00:43:13,380
Yet the rest of his organs are pristine.

455
00:43:13,415 --> 00:43:16,180
Donor material.

456
00:43:16,215 --> 00:43:18,680
- No signs of asphyxia.
- He didn't asphyxiate.

457
00:43:18,715 --> 00:43:20,380
How can you be so sure?

458
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:27,680
Because I know what asphyxiation looks like, dummy!
And it don't turn your lungs to jelly.

459
00:43:27,715 --> 00:43:29,780
No.

460
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,780
I was thinking more along the lines of frostbite.

461
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:34,580
You're kidding.

462
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:38,580
The epidermis is healthy,
save for a few batches of sun damage.

463
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,580
Are you suggesting that Juliette
locked him in a freezer?

464
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:43,880
Because, I do not see it.

465
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:47,880
You don't?
Well, I see it all quite clearly.

466
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:50,780
This is some kind of bud baby.

467
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,080
This is really medical marijuana for free?

468
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,280
Well, I am in favor.

469
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,080
It's been proven to naturally alleviate pain.

470
00:44:04,115 --> 00:44:07,180
Why should anyone have to suffer, right daddy?

471
00:44:07,215 --> 00:44:09,780
Ain't that the truth.

472
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,280
That's your boyfriend huh?

473
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,380
What was it you said you was again?

474
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:27,080
A General Practitioner.

475
00:44:27,115 --> 00:44:31,080
So you can prescribe this shit for me, legal?

476
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,580
Yeah, that's right.
Legal, beagle.

477
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,280
Where do I sign?

478
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,380
- No, let's do some whippets first.
- No shit!

479
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,580
You got a prescription for that too?

480
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,680
Who's first?

481
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,280
Thank you.

482
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,780
Med school has its perks huh?

483
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,780
Liquid Nitrogen.

484
00:45:42,815 --> 00:45:46,780
A mixture of chlorofluoro carbons,
nitrogen and a bit of free on my boy.

485
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,880
He died of anoxia.

486
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,980
It wasn't just that he couldn't breathe,

487
00:45:54,015 --> 00:45:57,680
he couldn't adsorb the oxygen.

488
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,180
More challenging mystery is
how Miss Bath here

489
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:48,180
forced a 340 pound man

490
00:46:48,215 --> 00:46:52,180
to ingest a canister of -75 degree air

491
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:53,380
all by herself.

492
00:46:53,415 --> 00:46:57,080
She is a very charming girl.

493
00:46:57,115 --> 00:47:00,180
That's true.
She could convince almost anyone

494
00:47:00,215 --> 00:47:03,580
to do what she wanted them to.

495
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:08,580
You know, one could almost see a
resemblance between the two of you.

496
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,780
But maybe that's just the temperature.

497
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,180
Question.

498
00:47:35,215 --> 00:47:37,180
Are you playing fair?

499
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,180
Is there such a thing?

500
00:47:40,215 --> 00:47:41,580
No.

501
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,280
But don't you wanna know who's the best?

502
00:47:45,315 --> 00:47:47,980
Aren't you a bit curious?

503
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,980
- That was pretty good last night.
- No idea what you're talking about.

504
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:52,745
Oh c'mon.

505
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,180
You don't expect me to believe that

506
00:47:55,215 --> 00:47:57,480
our little Juliette,
came up with that one on her own, do you?

507
00:47:57,515 --> 00:47:58,945
I've seen her work.

508
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,145
Oh no, maybe there's more to her
than you thought.

509
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,580
Mmm... No, I don't think so.
But maybe there's more to you.

510
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:05,545
Me?

511
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,680
I'm an open book, Jake.

512
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,030
Priceless.

513
00:48:13,065 --> 00:48:15,680
I'll catch you later, Dr. Gray.

514
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:17,580
Oh Teddy?

515
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,245
She didn't give you that whole routine

516
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,780
about how her father raped her
when she was a little lass, did she?

517
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,545
Oh... what an imagination.

518
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,280
No, her father is alive and well.

519
00:48:30,315 --> 00:48:32,945
Paid a visit just last month in fact.

520
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,980
Chairman of an obscenely profitable
banking institution.

521
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:40,080
And a hell of a guy I might add.

522
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:42,480
A hell of a guy.

523
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,380
Hey...

524
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,580
Who was he?

525
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,980
Who was he?!

526
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,180
Anyone.

527
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,680
Don't fuck with me.

528
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,445
Doctors?

529
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,480
Let's have a look inside.

530
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,345
Cyanide Pill.

531
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,980
I love that band.

532
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,080
Thanks so much.

533
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:47,345
Thank you.

534
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,980
You want a smoke?

535
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,480
As he inhales, he'd activates the vapors.

536
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,580
Ohh, genius!

537
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,180
It was genius!

538
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,180
You've been doing alot of urine work lately.
Good work.

539
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,480
My bad.

540
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,545
You switched his blood.

541
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,545
You found another patient

542
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,180
with an S.H.N.
Then you switched his blood to John Doe.

543
00:51:06,215 --> 00:51:08,680
Am I right?

544
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,280
Fuck you!

545
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,130
Dr. Gray?

546
00:51:14,165 --> 00:51:15,680
Sir.

547
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,780
Is there anything that you would
like to share with me?

548
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,380
I'm sorry. I don't quite follow, sir.

549
00:51:31,415 --> 00:51:33,245
No doubt.

550
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,880
Look, your work has been beyond
reproach exemplary.

551
00:51:36,915 --> 00:51:39,445
- But what concerns me...
- Thank you, sir.

552
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,480
What concerns me is your
extracurricular life.

553
00:51:43,515 --> 00:51:45,147
I'm sorry?

554
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:46,745
C'mon!

555
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,645
It is obvious that you are using.

556
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,230
One can experiment from time to time,

557
00:51:51,265 --> 00:51:56,022
I mean, God knows I have done my share.

558
00:51:56,057 --> 00:51:59,380
You should know that I planned on
giving you my highest recommendation.

559
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:01,880
I appreciate it, sir.

560
00:52:01,915 --> 00:52:03,780
No doubt.

561
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,745
What're gonna be doing for the holidays?

562
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,180
Actually I plan on spending it with
Gwen's family.

563
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:12,245
That's good.

564
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,880
Opportunity to re-think your priorities.

565
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:16,745
Yes, sir.

566
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,980
And a little time away from Dr. Gallo
wouldn't hurt either.

567
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,680
No, it wouldn't.

568
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,545
Look...

569
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,180
I know you got it all worked out.

570
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,780
The money, the family with means,

571
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:37,445
pussy...

572
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,480
It would really be a shame if
you fucked it up.

573
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,380
Sir.

574
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,280
What's up with Morris?

575
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,680
Lonely.

576
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:01,980
C'mon, let's get the fuck outta here
and get a beer. C'mon.

577
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,480
- Hey, it's me. How are you?
- Hello.

578
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:20,645
Oh Jesus!

579
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,645
- What're you doing here?
- Are you going somewhere?

580
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,680
I told you. I'm leaving town for the holiday.

581
00:53:27,715 --> 00:53:29,645
Right.

582
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,245
The fiancée.

583
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,480
So you're going through with that?

584
00:53:33,515 --> 00:53:35,645
Why wouldn't I?

585
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,580
What about you and Jake?
Don't you have some sort of arrangement?

586
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:43,380
Nobody owns anybody.

587
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,580
- Hey.
- Hi. How are you?

588
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,680
- You missed me.
- Of course. How could I go on s'long without you.

589
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,845
Look at you.

590
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,280
Baby, you're working too hard.

591
00:54:26,315 --> 00:54:27,445
Oh I'm ok.

592
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,480
Everything's ok now.

593
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,745
So?

594
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,680
I hear you're kicking ass
with the residency.

595
00:54:46,715 --> 00:54:48,647
It has been an experience.

596
00:54:48,682 --> 00:54:50,481
Quentin Morris is a good man.

597
00:54:50,516 --> 00:54:52,348
I never liked that fruitcake.

598
00:54:52,383 --> 00:54:53,631
He speaks pretty highly of you.

599
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:56,880
Of course. Why wouldn't he?

600
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:02,045
Look Ted. Bottom line, this program is the right thing
for you right now. Let's me sell you to the brass.

601
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,480
Working for Acxicom D.C.

602
00:55:04,515 --> 00:55:07,280
it's as good as it gets.

603
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,845
Listen Ted.

604
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,880
This job withstand, whether you
and I liked it or not

605
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,980
- is what you have it.
- Thank you.

606
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,345
So what about Africa?

607
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,845
- Enjoy hunting yet?
- Hunting?

608
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,380
I would say hunting is alot better than the city.

609
00:55:26,415 --> 00:55:29,480
Attaboy, I think.

610
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,245
- Daddy.
- Hey honey.

611
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,380
- I'm stealing my fiancée back now.
- Uh oh.

612
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,430
So I have an early Christmas
present for you.

613
00:57:19,465 --> 00:57:22,380
Hey, can you just get it?

614
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,045
No.

615
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,530
It's better.

616
00:57:26,565 --> 00:57:28,945
Impossible.

617
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,480
I'm gonna come back with you.

618
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:36,380
Not in two months from now.
But now.

619
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:43,280
I finished all my work and
I can fly back up to take the bar exam.

620
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,180
Hey, only if it's ok with you?

621
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,780
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

622
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,980
Sounds incredible.

623
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,080
You don't mind?

624
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,480
Wow look at this place.

625
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,980
I didn't know you were coming or
I would've cleaned up a bit.

626
00:58:36,015 --> 00:58:39,280
Baby, it's perfect.

627
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:53,180
Hey, so what're you gonna wear tonight?

628
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,780
Gwen?

629
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,280
What the fuck is this?

630
00:59:05,315 --> 00:59:07,345
Don't freak out.

631
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,930
I holding it for someone.
A resident.

632
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:12,445
He's trying to kick it.
I'm helping him out.

633
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,180
- A resident?
- Baby, do I look like a twigger to you?

634
00:59:16,215 --> 00:59:20,480
- Why don't you throw it away?
- Because I ran out here in a flash to see you.

635
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,580
If you need help

636
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,230
now is the time to ask for it.

637
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:31,980
I'm sorry you had to see this.

638
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,080
That is not mine.

639
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,480
- Look.
- I love you.

640
00:59:41,515 --> 00:59:44,480
I love you too.
Look... Hey, look at me.

641
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,380
I know that this is not the world
that we're used to, ok.

642
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:56,080
If we're gonna to that party,
we should probably get ready.

643
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,645
- Ben.
- Hey, how are ya?

644
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,680
- I want to introduce you to my fiancée, Gwen.
- Wow, the one and only huh.

645
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:32,980
Well it's a pleasure. Yeah, I've been hearing
all about you from day one.

646
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,430
Oh well, you too. It's nice to meet you, Ben.

647
01:00:37,465 --> 01:00:40,680
- He's great huh?
- Yeah, he's a cute one.

648
01:00:40,715 --> 01:00:42,345
- Oh, this is Donnna.
- Hi!

649
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,880
- Hi, Donna. Oh I love your dress.
- Thank you.

650
01:00:45,915 --> 01:00:47,145
Oh look at this.

651
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,645
The prodigal son returns.

652
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,180
Ok, ok, we can go now.
It's ok.

653
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:58,580
Stravinsky.
Stravinsky, you little turd.

654
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,845
Gwen, I'd like you to meet some
fellow residents of mine.

655
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,680
This is Dr. Jake Gallo and
Dr. Juliette Bath. Gwen Williamson.

656
01:01:05,715 --> 01:01:07,445
- Hi!
- Hi!

657
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,280
Has Ted told you about all
the people he's killed?

658
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:14,447
Yes. I hear he cuts 'em up quite well.

659
01:01:14,482 --> 01:01:17,245
- Well, he's learning.
- Yes, he's learning.

660
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,180
Practice makes perfect.
The wonderful thing about the death business

661
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:25,845
- Never shortage of cliental?
- Yes Gwen, exactly. Exactly.

662
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,580
Blessful immunity from the sicklecal,
economic avenflow.

663
01:01:29,615 --> 01:01:31,145
You know, people just keep dying
and dying.

664
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:36,180
You mind if I straighten this a little tighter?
I cant...

665
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:38,245
Are you a school teacher?

666
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,980
Eh, no, I'm doing my bar exams in February.

667
01:01:41,015 --> 01:01:44,245
Wow that's impressive.

668
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,145
You haven't killed any lawyers yet,
have you Ted?

669
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,380
Well, there's still so many.
It's hard to keep track.

670
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:53,580
You know, I might've ended up a lawyer
if I hadn't passed my M-CATs.

671
01:01:53,615 --> 01:01:57,445
Oh that's too bad.
We might've been room-mates.

672
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,245
Oh if you'll excuse us,
Dr. Morris would wanna see Gwen.

673
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,980
Oh yeah. You two have a great time.
I mean this is a party.

674
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:06,980
You two enjoy yourselves. We'll be at
the trough assembling our meat plates!

675
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,380
Sorry about that.

676
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:12,980
Was it him?

677
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,380
Very perceptive, counsellor.

678
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:23,980
- I love you.
- Love you too. C'mon.

679
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,180
Dr. Morris.

680
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,580
- Hi!
- Hi!

681
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,180
Well, you look very sexual.

682
01:02:35,215 --> 01:02:38,180
I mean alluring.

683
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,745
Are you fucking kidding me?
Huh?

684
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:53,080
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Oh what? Huh? You wanna fuck that guy?
You wanna fuck that guy? Go fuck that guy.

685
01:02:53,115 --> 01:02:54,245
Hey we got a fucking whore in the room!

686
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,180
Go fuck him.
Just remember your ass belongs to me.

687
01:02:57,215 --> 01:02:59,247
You don't fucking own me.

688
01:02:59,282 --> 01:03:02,380
Oh, I fucking do!

689
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,980
Fuck this!

690
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,680
Shit! I gotta take this.

691
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,380
Yeah?

692
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,980
What's goin on? Where're ya?
Ok, be right there.

693
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,945
I gotta go.

694
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,480
It's him, isn't it?

695
01:03:44,515 --> 01:03:46,580
I'm sorry.

696
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,580
I know. Becareful.

697
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,380
Teddy-boy!

698
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,780
Hello Jake.

699
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,980
Oh fuck!

700
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,245
Where're the others?

701
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:32,080
Those sick-pants! Fuck 'em!

702
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:33,980
What happened?

703
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:39,780
Eh, simple transaction Teddy. I paid my money.
I got my money's worth.

704
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:42,447
I got stabbed too.

705
01:04:42,482 --> 01:04:45,045
Good thing you're a doctor.

706
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,980
- We gotta clean this up!
- Clean this up?

707
01:04:48,015 --> 01:04:51,980
What? This? You wanna clean... like what?
Like this? Like this?

708
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:56,280
You're losing it, Dr. Gallo.

709
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:02,345
Losing it? Teddy!

710
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:06,380
Teddy, I just fucking found it!

711
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:13,980
This is it.
This... this is it.

712
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,445
Uh oh, who's that?

713
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:22,480
That's you. That's me. That's me.
Me. You. Me. You. Me. You're me.

714
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:26,580
You're fucking killer.

715
01:05:26,615 --> 01:05:29,380
You're fucking enemy.

716
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:38,245
Huh?
You fucking, fucking golden boy.

717
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,480
Playing ramsey with your
fucking eye-pleat cunt!

718
01:05:41,515 --> 01:05:43,880
She doesn't know you!

719
01:05:43,915 --> 01:05:45,980
I know you.

720
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,880
What about the game?

721
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,245
What about it?

722
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,080
Is that why you called me here?
C'mon, let's play.

723
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,980
This woman here...

724
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,180
By the bubbles in her mouth,
I could see the subdued dire blood lost.

725
01:06:10,215 --> 01:06:12,845
She died of suffocation.

726
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,880
Precisely.
She choked on her own blood.

727
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:27,580
So you pocked this one bloodygade in the
temple with that pipe right there?

728
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,045
- A near fatal aneurism?
- What?

729
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,180
Of course you need to crack her head open
to know with mathematical certainty.

730
01:06:34,215 --> 01:06:38,580
Ermm, waddaya mean near fatal?

731
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,680
You disemboweled...
Probably while she's still alive.

732
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,180
There's blood on her right hand and
her wrist is broken.

733
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:50,180
So I guess I know who stabbed you,
probably while gutting.

734
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,980
Bravo!

735
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,780
I failed to see the genius here.

736
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:11,580
You failed to see?

737
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,980
You failed to see?

738
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,580
Buzzkill.

739
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,280
Let's go to the incinerator.

740
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,680
Hey!

741
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,680
What the fuck are you doing here?

742
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,445
'Coz I missed you.

743
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,280
Do you know where I just was?

744
01:08:04,315 --> 01:08:07,045
With Jake in the dungeon.

745
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,645
He went ape-shit and thrill
killed three women.

746
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,780
I'm done with Jake.

747
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,230
I think you should leave.

748
01:08:15,265 --> 01:08:18,380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

749
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,180
Your fiancée was really beautiful.

750
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,880
You must be very happy.

751
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:52,780
This is taken directly from
the center of the seminiferus tubulus.

752
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:55,380
The mature sperm is showing
definite signs

753
01:09:55,415 --> 01:09:58,245
of structural abnormalities.

754
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,680
Dr. Gallo?
You have a moment?

755
01:10:01,715 --> 01:10:06,780
Certainly Dr. Gray.
Excuse me.

756
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,345
I'm done. I'm out.

757
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:18,280
The words you're saying right now
are very dangerous.

758
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:20,645
You should probably be more careful.

759
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,745
- Nobody gets out.
- Don't be so fucking dramatic, ok?

760
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,180
It's not like I can
say anything to anybody.

761
01:10:25,215 --> 01:10:26,697
I'm up to my eyeballs in this shit.

762
01:10:26,732 --> 01:10:30,145
Yes you are, Ted.

763
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:34,180
- I've got my fiancée.
- Oh yeah, your fiancée. That's right. Gwen?

764
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,445
Hey, maybe she should come down some night.

765
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,480
Hey, how about you don't mention her name again.

766
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,080
I'm sorry. It's just...

767
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:56,230
You took me off guard last night.

768
01:10:56,265 --> 01:11:01,280
- Yeah, that was some crazy shit huh?
- Yeah.

769
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,245
You good then?

770
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:13,380
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.

771
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:22,780
Hey, ermm, we have a meeting tomorrow night.

772
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:26,045
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

773
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,945
That's right. You busy?

774
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:32,980
Good 'coz you won't wanna miss this one.

775
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,880
So I need to take off for a few hours flat.

776
01:12:41,915 --> 01:12:43,680
I know but

777
01:12:43,715 --> 01:12:45,880
I have to.

778
01:12:45,915 --> 01:12:52,180
- You don't have to.
- It'll be the last time, ok? I promise.

779
01:12:53,880 --> 01:13:00,680
- I believe you.
- You want one of these?

780
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:19,080
Here you are.

781
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:29,780
Whoa, we're contiguously short this evening.

782
01:13:29,815 --> 01:13:32,080
She's with him.

783
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,480
No.

784
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,580
I don't think so.

785
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:41,780
I think it's time we get
rid of that cocksucker.

786
01:13:41,815 --> 01:13:45,080
- I concur.
- And her.

787
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,780
Yeah. Fuck yes, and her.

788
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:52,980
Well, if we're all in agreement,
let the lamp affix its beam.

789
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,080
- What the fuck.
- What the fuck?

790
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:27,380
Alright, let's do this.

791
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:33,780
Doctors, let's have a look inside.

792
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:44,380
Oh I get it.

793
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,080
- What happened?
- Oh my God, you haven't heard?

794
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,445
Heard what?

795
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,680
There was a fire here last night,
on the lower level.

796
01:15:57,715 --> 01:16:00,480
Some of our residents were killed.

797
01:16:00,515 --> 01:16:02,845
Who?

798
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,845
Juliette Bath and Griffin Cavenaugh

799
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,880
and there's two bodies yet to be identified.

800
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:14,080
Wait, you said two bodies?

801
01:16:14,115 --> 01:16:16,045
Unidentified.

802
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,280
- Plus Julieth Bath. Plus Griffin Cavenaugh.
- Right. That's right.

803
01:16:19,315 --> 01:16:21,547
Then there were four.

804
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:23,780
Correct. Four.

805
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,580
- Look, I know that you're upset.
- Excuse me. I'm just gonna step outside.

806
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,580
Fuck!

807
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,280
Hi, you remember me from the party?

808
01:17:18,315 --> 01:17:21,180
- It's Jake Gallo, isn't it?
- Yeah.

809
01:17:21,215 --> 01:17:24,097
Um, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

810
01:17:24,132 --> 01:17:27,980
- Ted already left.
- I know.

811
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:15,680
I just spoke to Inspector Vincent
from the homicide division.

812
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:19,980
He finds Jake Gallo's absence
to be quite suspicious.

813
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,880
He also asked me if there was anyone who
might be able to offer any insight or clues

814
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,030
as to why one of my top doctors

815
01:19:27,065 --> 01:19:30,180
would have committed such an atrocity.

816
01:19:30,215 --> 01:19:32,247
I could think of no one.

817
01:19:32,282 --> 01:19:34,881
Can you think of anyone doctor?

818
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:38,445
Several names come to mind
but since they're all individuals

819
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,180
who were killed in the fire

820
01:19:40,215 --> 01:19:45,680
I suspect that questioning them
would prove fruitless.

821
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,245
Concerning Gwendolyn.

822
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,680
I can't tell you how devastated I was
when I got the news,

823
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:56,780
compounding what is already a tragedy
for the hospital.

824
01:19:56,815 --> 01:20:02,080
- I know that you loved her a great deal and I'm truly sorry.
- Thank you.

825
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:08,380
As for the cause of her death, I haven't been able
to come up with a firm conclusion.

826
01:20:08,415 --> 01:20:12,780
Based on my initial examination,
a full autopsy is gonna be necessary.

827
01:20:12,815 --> 01:20:14,147
I'm doing it.

828
01:20:14,182 --> 01:20:15,445
Excuse me?

829
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,145
I don't want anyone else to touch her but me.

830
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:25,380
- You would have to get the parents' permission.
- I've already spoken to the Williamsons.
They gave me their full blessing.

831
01:20:25,415 --> 01:20:27,645
- I vehemently disapprove.
- Dr. Morris.

832
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:32,680
I urge you not to stand in the way of
the parents' wishes and my own.

833
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,280
Alright then. She's yours.

834
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,080
- Dr. Gray, good night.
- Good night, David. Rajeeve.

835
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,680
Well?

836
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,245
Well?

837
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:18,880
I read something wildly amusing today.
Thought I'd share.

838
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,380
Patient Name: Gwendolyn Marie Williamson.

839
01:24:21,415 --> 01:24:25,180
Age 28, eyes brown, blah blah blah blah blah.

840
01:24:25,215 --> 01:24:27,345
Ahh haha!

841
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:30,180
Conducting pathologist determines
cause of the death to be due to

842
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:33,180
an arrhythmia of the heart!

843
01:24:33,215 --> 01:24:37,780
A direct consequence of
mitral valve prolapse?

844
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:42,580
- That's great shit huh?
- That's right. What the fuck do you care?

845
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,345
Because...

846
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:52,180
I have composed a poem sublime and you are my critic,
you are my only critic, Teddy.

847
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,745
And have you read carefully
your review of my work,

848
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:59,280
my conclusion is that it sucks!
- Maybe it's just your clothes.

849
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,780
You know that this one was well above average.

850
01:25:09,815 --> 01:25:13,780
This one was fucking meticulous.

851
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:21,280
Oh shit...

852
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,680
She never really knew you, did she?

853
01:25:26,715 --> 01:25:28,697
- My fiancée?
- Yeah, her.

854
01:25:28,732 --> 01:25:30,245
Just the good side.

855
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,145
No, I didn't think so.

856
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:38,480
And there you were... oh boy!
Good little soldier

857
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:40,230
ready to march down the aisle.

858
01:25:40,265 --> 01:25:45,280
Fuck man. Fuck.
I did you a fucking favor huh?

859
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,280
You owe me.

860
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:50,745
By the way

861
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,730
Props to you for killing everyone.

862
01:25:52,765 --> 01:25:54,645
Oh yeah, sorry about that.

863
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:58,680
No, no, no, no, my bad.
I should've seen it coming.

864
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:03,180
It's in the past.
The important thing is, Teddy

865
01:26:03,215 --> 01:26:06,980
That in the end... in the end

866
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,380
I won!

867
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:10,745
How so?

868
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:14,780
Because I did one that you couldn't figure out.

869
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:17,980
I win!

870
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,745
You like that?

871
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,280
I don't think so.

872
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,980
I think so.

873
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:35,445
Mitral valve prolapse bullshit!

874
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:39,480
It's what I told the parents
so that they won't freak out.

875
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,580
Aha?

876
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:45,080
- I actually do have a theory.
- You have a theory?

877
01:26:45,115 --> 01:26:49,680
Alright. Impress me.

878
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,045
Gwen made a fatal mistake

879
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:57,080
trying to get back on you and when she did,
you covered her mouth with any of your soaked cloth.

880
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:05,580
You were careful not to
let her lose consciousness though.

881
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,445
After that

882
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:11,480
you injected the potassium into the
basilica vein under her armpit

883
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:15,245
to help preserve the body

884
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:19,080
before dripping nitroglycerin
on her tongue.

885
01:27:19,115 --> 01:27:24,580
And then, you slowly let her fade
into the after life.

886
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:33,280
She took approximately 7 minutes,

887
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:39,280
about the same amount of time it takes
for an average person to fall asleep.

888
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:44,780
She could hear everything
that you said to her.

889
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:49,880
The last thing she saw on this earth

890
01:27:49,915 --> 01:27:54,180
was your delightful face.

891
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,480
Time?

892
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:03,580
Six minutes, thirty seconds.

893
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:06,180
29... 28...

894
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:10,380
Dr. Stravinsky?

895
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:15,780
Let's have a look inside.
