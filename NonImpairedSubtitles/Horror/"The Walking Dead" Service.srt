1
00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:03,459
Previously, on
AMC's "The Walking Dead"...

2
00:00:03,561 --> 00:00:05,461
You are mine.

3
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:08,097
The people back there...

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,899
they are mine.

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,801
You failed.

6
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:15,204
Your life was about to
get so much cooler.

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,239
Screw it.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,409
You answer to me!

9
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:21,977
You provide for me!

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,646
I provide for you.

11
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:26,148
You belong to me!

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,250
Right?

13
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,086
Right.

14
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:12,468
Good morning.

15
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,174
Tch-tch-tch.

16
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,343
Oh, here, look at that.

17
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,311
Shh.

18
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,924
Could you open the gate?

19
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:37,593
Eugene.

20
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:39,262
Yeah?

21
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:42,532
Open the gate.

22
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:49,505
Goin' out to see if we can find
anything for when they come.

23
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,541
You want to help?

24
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:56,445
I don't believe I'd be up to that.

25
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:58,347
Yeah, sounds about right.

26
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:03,119
I'm repairin' this portable
audio system for them.

27
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:05,284
We'll have a perfectly
respectable music player

28
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:06,467
when they arrive.

29
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,517
I'm dealing in certainties,

30
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,120
and I'm doing my part to give
them what they want.

31
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:41,350
? Dun-dun-dun dun ?

32
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:51,760
Little pig, little pig, let me in!

33
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,250
Well?

34
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:20,756
Um, who are you?

35
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:23,759
Oh, you better be jokin'.

36
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,894
Negan, Lucille.

37
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:29,097
I know I had to make a pretty
strong first impression.

38
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:38,440
Well, hello, there.

39
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:45,948
Do not make me have to ask.

40
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:49,952
You said a week.

41
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,920
You're early.

42
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:02,598
I missed you.

43
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:09,705
Oh, Rick, come on out here.

44
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:11,273
Watch this.

45
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:13,342
Calling it!

46
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,917
Ha ha ha!

47
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,254
Easy peasy lemon squeezy!

48
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:26,955
All right, everybody.

49
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:29,424
Let's get started.

50
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:34,463
Big day.

51
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:44,840
Hey, Rick, you see that,
what I just did?

52
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:48,410
That is some service!

53
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:51,947
I mean, we almost get turned
away at the gate.

54
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,349
"Who is that guy, anyway?"

55
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,618
Do I get mad?
Do I throw a fit?

56
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,521
Do I bash some ginger's dome in?

57
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,156
Nope.

58
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:03,258
I just take care of one
of these dead pricks

59
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,960
that could've killed one of y'all.

60
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:08,997
Service.

61
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,867
??

62
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:13,769
Hold this.

63
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:24,279
??

64
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:58,895

65
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,923
Hot diggity dog!

66
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:05,992
This place is magnificent!

67
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:09,763
An embarrassment of riches,
as they say.

68
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:14,334
Yes, sir, I do believe you are
gonna have plenty

69
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:16,036
to offer up.

70
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,173
Daryl, hey --

71
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,942
No.

72
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:23,176
Nope.

73
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:28,048
He's the help.

74
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,083
You don't look at him,

75
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,484
you don't talk to him,

76
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:34,487
and I don't make you chop
anything off of him.

77
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:48,668
? Same goes for everyone ?

78
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:54,574
Right?

79
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,695
A lot of suspense there.

80
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:19,866
I don't think she even knew how much.

81
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:22,869
All right, let's get this show
on the road.

82
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:25,038
See what kind of goodies you got
in the cupboard.

83
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,606
We put aside half the supplies.

84
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,075
No, Rick.

85
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:32,545
No.

86
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:37,350
You don't decide what we take.

87
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:39,286
I do.

88
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:41,955
Arat.

89
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:46,192
You heard the man.

90
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,528
Move out!

91
00:09:59,274 --> 00:10:03,143
They're just gonna search
the houses a bit,

92
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,278
keep the process movin'.

93
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:12,752
All right.

94
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:14,654
You gonna show me around or not?

95
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:20,627
Well?

96
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,273
Rosita!

97
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:36,276
Where you going
with your friend here?

98
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:37,711
We were just
heading back to --

99
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:40,647
You know what?
I don't care.

100
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,323
Now that that's all settled,

101
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,158
I got a job for ya.

102
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:29,129
Go get me Daryl's bike.

103
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:31,064
It ain't here.

104
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,499
Well, if it ain't here,

105
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,667
then you know where it is, right?

106
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,739
We both know you know where it is.

107
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,179
Uh...

108
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:58,224
Now you're good to go.

109
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,564
So go.

110
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,369
Oh, oh.

111
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:10,537
Oh.

112
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,918
Don't take too long.

113
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:52,805
Damn it.

114
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:55,089
You see this?

115
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:59,264
This is the kind of thing
that just tickles my balls.

116
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,866
A little cooperation

117
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,735
and everything is pleasant as punch.

118
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,705
You see, we really are
reasonable people

119
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,940
once you get to know us.

120
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,709
Honest.

121
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:15,714
Ohh.

122
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:16,748
Man.

123
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,557
Ahh!

124
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,526
Damn, I love this place!

125
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:28,593
Negan.

126
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,765
Somethin' you might wanna see.

127
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,303
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

128
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:42,808
I got my fingers crossed
for a little freaky-deaky.

129
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,977
...know me.

130
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,746
I've killed people.

131
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:51,383
I don't even know how many by now.
Jee-hee-sus!

132
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,052
But I know why they're all dead.

133
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,221
Is that you, Rick,
underneath all that man-bush?

134
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,090
They're dead so my family,

135
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:00,525
all those people out there, can be alive.
Shee-ot.

136
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:04,629
I would not have messed
with that guy.

137
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,937
But that's not you anymore...

138
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,339
is it?

139
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,143
Nope.

140
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,313
I really gotta shave this shit.

141
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:28,353
Whatever happened to that sick girl?

142
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:32,924
That seemed like a hell of
a stressful night for her.

143
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,693
The way she was carrying on,

144
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,195
she was married to number two, right?

145
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,997
Careful.

146
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:44,102
Careful how you're lookin'
at me, Rick.

147
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:49,141
Widows, especially ones
that look like that...

148
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,412
...they...are special.

149
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:55,580
I love 'em.

150
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,249
Right after their husbands go,

151
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:01,787
they are just...
empty side.

152
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,389
But usually not for long.

153
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,361
Ahh.
Where is she?

154
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,062
I would love to see her.

155
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,731
Do you care to pay your respects?

156
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,734
Ho-ly crap!

157
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:18,904
You are creepy as shit,

158
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:20,405
sneaking up on me,

159
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:23,241
wearin' that collar
with that freaky-ass smile.

160
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,445
My apologies.

161
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:28,580
I'm Father Gabriel.

162
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,556
She didn't make it?

163
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,798
Damn tragedy.

164
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,801
That's what this is.

165
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,940
Well, this must really suck
for you guys.

166
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:57,876
Number one?

167
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:00,412
That was on me.
No choice there.

168
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,647
Lessons had to be learned.

169
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,449
But number two?

170
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:07,118
That didn't need to happen.

171
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,455
Daryl, there, he forced my hand.

172
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:14,926
Probably put her
right on her back, huh?

173
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,628
Damn.

174
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,164
I was gonna ask her
to come back with me.

175
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,667
Oh, I know what you're thinkin'.

176
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,069
How could I have a shot,

177
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:26,338
guy that just bashed
her husband's head in?

178
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,441
You'd be surprised.

179
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,842
Boy, people, they --

180
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,995
Put some back or the next one
goes in you.

181
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:52,831
Kid...

182
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,300
what do you think happens next?

183
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,902
You die.

184
00:18:56,904 --> 00:19:00,639
Carl, Carl, put it down.

185
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,508
No. He's taking all
of our medicine.

186
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,610
They said only half our stuff.

187
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,613
Of course.

188
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:12,150
Oh-ho.
Really, kid?

189
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,587
And you should go.

190
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,856
Before you find out
how dangerous we all are.

191
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,826
Well, pardon me, young man.

192
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,664
Excuse the shit out of
my goddamn French, but...

193
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,732
did you just threaten me?

194
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,936
Look, I get threatening Davey here,

195
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,404
but I can't have it.

196
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,838
Not him, not me.

197
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
Carl, just put it down.

198
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,675
Don't be rude, Rick.

199
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,344
We are having a conversation here.

200
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:45,383
Now, boy, where were we?

201
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,785
Oh, yeah.

202
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:50,055
Your giant, man-sized balls.

203
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,657
No threatening us.

204
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,393
Listen, I like you,

205
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,363
so I don't want to go hard
proving a point here.

206
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,864
You don't want that.

207
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,533
I said half your shit,

208
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:03,902
and half is what I say it is.

209
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:07,038
I'm serious.

210
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,009
Do you want me to prove how serious?

211
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,345
Again?

212
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:31,596
You know, Rick,
this whole thing reminds me

213
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,733
that you have a lot of guns.

214
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,569
There's all the guns you took
from my outpost

215
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,537
when you wasted all my people

216
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,740
with a shit-ton
of your own guns,

217
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,509
and I'm bettin' there's even more,

218
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:47,512
which adds up to an absolute...

219
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,748
ass-load of guns,

220
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,350
and as this little emotional outburst

221
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,419
just made crystal clear...

222
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,921
I can't allow that.

223
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:06,898
They're all mine now.

224
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,201
So tell me, Rick --

225
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,804
where are my guns?

226
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,981
I...figured
you were coming.

227
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:34,656
Show him where the guns are, Olivia.

228
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:38,026
The armory's inside.

229
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,963
You run the show in here?

230
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:45,367
I...

231
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:49,070
I just keep track of it all,
the rations, the guns.

232
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:52,007
Good. Smart.

233
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,142
Don't let me stop you.

234
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:57,045
Take her out, boys.
Show 'em the goods.

235
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:05,887
Wait, wait, wait.

236
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:09,991
While they're at it,

237
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:12,127
I just want to point out to you

238
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:14,830
that I'm not taking a scrap
of your food.

239
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:18,233
Slim pickin's in here.

240
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:20,836
And I can't be the only one to notice

241
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:23,205
that you got a fat lady in charge

242
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:25,707
of keeping track of rations, can I?

243
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,910
Either way, you starve to death,

244
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,712
I don't get shit,

245
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:34,382
so for now,
you get to keep all the food.

246
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:38,486
How 'bout that?

247
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:45,727
What do you want me to say?

248
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:47,362
I don't know, Rick.

249
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:49,197
How about a thank you.

250
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,832
You think that might be in order?

251
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:53,335
Or is that too much to ask?!

252
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:02,911
Ohh.

253
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:06,815
I know we started off
on the wrong foot,

254
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:10,785
but what can I say?
You forced my hand, Rick.

255
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:14,089
But it's like I've been
tryin' to tell you --

256
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:17,359
I'm a very reasonable man
as long as you cooperate,

257
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:21,029
so let me ask you a question, Rick.

258
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:26,635
Are you cooperating?

259
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:28,770
What's it look like?

260
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:31,439
Oh-ho-ho.

261
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:35,243
I know what it looks like.

262
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,579
But what I really want to know is

263
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:40,382
if we're gonna find all the guns
back there

264
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:44,653
or if maybe you got a few just
waitin' for their moment...

265
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:47,289
just like my Lucille.

266
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:55,463
They're all in there,
to the best of my knowledge.

267
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:56,665
Mm.

268
00:23:56,667 --> 00:24:00,068
I am countin' on that, Rick.

269
00:24:53,223 --> 00:24:55,156
Still here.

270
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,645
Look, I know this sucks,
but you saw what happened.

271
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:20,749
You saw how many of them
are there today.

272
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:23,585
That's it. It's over.

273
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:25,687
This is our life now.

274
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:28,256
This is where Rick got us.

275
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:38,400
Maybe if Rick thought it through,

276
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:41,102
it would've been different.

277
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,511
People might still be with us.

278
00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:58,453
This is where we are.

279
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:00,955
We just got to learn to live with it.

280
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:06,327
Rosita!

281
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:13,301
You know what today is, Rick?
Today is a banner day.

282
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:14,636
Yes, it is.

283
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:16,404
I think this little arrangement

284
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:18,406
we have is gonna work out just fine.

285
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:21,276
Hold up.

286
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:27,615
Let's see if you've been
taking care of my guns.

287
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,470
Feels good.

288
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,605
Sounds good!

289
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:55,643
Oh, I do believe Lucille's
gettin' a little jealous.

290
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:59,280
Well, ho-ly smokes!

291
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:04,586
Look at this!

292
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:07,021
It was you guys that took out
Little Timmy

293
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:08,356
and the Dick Brigade?

294
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:10,391
Wow, Rick.

295
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:13,795
Gettin' in your last licks.

296
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:16,498
Ooh, man, I'm gonna have
some fun with this.

297
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,800
Please,
I-I don't know for --

298
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:24,839
Arat, we don't do that

299
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:28,076
unless they do somethin'
to deserve it.

300
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:30,278
Yeah, we went through the inventory.

301
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,813
Guns in the armory,

302
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:34,182
guns they had around the walls,
they're short.

303
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:36,885
Glock 9 and a .22 Bobcat.

304
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:45,293
Is that true?

305
00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:48,897
We had some people leave town.

306
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:50,231
Those guns probably went with them.

307
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:52,400
So Olivia sucks at her job.

308
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:53,701
Is that what you're sayin'?

309
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:55,236
No.
No, I'm not sayin' that.

310
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:57,705
There should be a full
accounting here, right?

311
00:27:57,707 --> 00:28:00,575
Top to bottom.

312
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:03,077
Am I right?
No.

313
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,547
I mean, yes.

314
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:08,349
The inventory is correct.

315
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:09,584
Good.

316
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:13,254
But not so good, too.

317
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:16,658
You see, what's in here...

318
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,228
isn't in there.
You're two handguns short.

319
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,730
Do you know where they are?

320
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:25,466
No. I...

321
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:31,472
That's disappointing, Rick.

322
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:33,741
I thought that we had
an understanding.

323
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:39,080
But this -- well, this shows
that someone's not on board,

324
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:41,382
and I can't have that.

325
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,824
I don't enjoy killing women.

326
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:54,929
Men -- I can waste them
all the live long.

327
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:57,665
But at the end of the day,
Olivia, my dear,

328
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,667
this was your responsibility.

329
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,570
-Look, we can work this out.
-Oh, yes, we can.

330
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:06,241
And I'm going to --
right now.

331
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:15,149
This was your job,
and you screwed up.

332
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:19,153
Keeping track of guns?

333
00:29:21,658 --> 00:29:23,992
That shit...

334
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:26,594
is life and death.

335
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,239
I thought about
hiding some of the guns.

336
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:43,308
I did it before.

337
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:47,513
I figured I could bury
some out there.

338
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:50,382
Maybe we don't touch them for years.

339
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:51,917
Years?

340
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,220
Yeah. That's right.

341
00:29:55,222 --> 00:30:00,325
But what if the Saviors
find those guns?

342
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:04,029
What if we run into them
when we have those guns on us?

343
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:06,198
One of us dies.

344
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,135
Maybe more than that.
Maybe a lot more.

345
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:14,373
Doesn't matter how many bullets
we have.

346
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:18,243
It isn't enough.

347
00:30:21,248 --> 00:30:24,283
They win.
It's that black-and-white.

348
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:29,855
Hiding a couple of guns isn't
the answer, not anymore.

349
00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:32,758
We don't have to like it,

350
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,563
but we need to give them over.

351
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:41,567
A Glock 9 and a .22.

352
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:45,337
That's what they're looking for.

353
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:47,906
Who has it?

354
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,476
Someone knows where they are

355
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:54,646
or they know who does.

356
00:30:54,648 --> 00:31:00,118
If we don't find them,
they're gonna kill Olivia.

357
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,422
They'll do it.

358
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,459
Why do they care?

359
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:11,096
Two guns aren't a threat to them.

360
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:12,965
But those guns could help protect us

361
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:14,666
from whatever else is out there.

362
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,971
Do you have 'em?

363
00:31:18,973 --> 00:31:20,339
Wish I did.

364
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:25,110
Most of you weren't there.

365
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:27,679
You didn't have to watch.

366
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:30,816
But you can look away now
when someone else dies,

367
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:33,652
or you can help solve this.

368
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:39,424
We give them what they want,
and we live in peace.

369
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:42,327
Don't.

370
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:44,596
Now is not the time.

371
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:46,598
It is.

372
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:52,337
Say we find the guns.

373
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:55,507
How are we gonna get out
of this, Rick?

374
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:59,611
There is no way out of this.

375
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:05,284
Let me put this to all of you
as clearly as I can.

376
00:32:05,286 --> 00:32:07,886
I'm not in charge anymore.

377
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,859
Negan is.

378
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:17,496
Now, who has the guns?

379
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:33,045
Not everyone's here.

380
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:00,372
Rosita!

381
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:02,140
Where are you?!

382
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:57,829
Rosita!

383
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:03,902
So that's why you're out here?

384
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,904
They killed Denise.

385
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:09,941
It's empty.

386
00:34:09,943 --> 00:34:12,344
So what if it was full?

387
00:34:12,346 --> 00:34:13,779
What could you do with it?

388
00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:15,914
Don't you get it?

389
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:18,016
That asshole back there took our guns

390
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:20,252
because he's gonna take all our guns.

391
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:23,288
What?

392
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,990
What are you gonna do, tell them?

393
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:36,034
This is not our life.

394
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:17,947
Nothing.

395
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:20,636
Still.

396
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:23,539
I just...

397
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:27,376
I feel like...

398
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:30,880
I know this is going to work out.

399
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:33,249
How?

400
00:35:33,251 --> 00:35:36,385
We'll find the guns.

401
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:38,087
We'll get through today.

402
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:40,623
Then we'll find a way to go forward,

403
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,024
how to beat this.

404
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:43,192
There is no beating this.

405
00:35:43,194 --> 00:35:46,428
Yes, there is, somehow.

406
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,231
I have faith in us.

407
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:52,368
I have faith in you.

408
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,837
Things change.

409
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,772
You're my friend.

410
00:35:56,774 --> 00:35:59,108
It...

411
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,110
wasn't always that way.

412
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,217
Where's Michonne?
Could she possibly have --

413
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:10,553
She doesn't have anything
they're lookin' for.

414
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,859
What you did with the graves,
it was quick thinkin'.

415
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:18,460
Thank you.

416
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:21,697
It was nice digging a grave
I knew would stay empty.

417
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:23,599
No luck?

418
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:30,306
We searched the house, Rosita's.

419
00:36:30,308 --> 00:36:32,174
There's nothing.

420
00:36:32,176 --> 00:36:34,476
So what do we do now?

421
00:36:34,478 --> 00:36:38,480
If they were anywhere,
they'd be here.

422
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:41,483
Spencer's done this kind
of thing before.

423
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:44,153
We keep looking.

424
00:36:44,155 --> 00:36:47,156
Maybe today works out.

425
00:36:47,158 --> 00:36:48,424
I'll check the garage.

426
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:50,159
I'll look in Deanna's office again.

427
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:18,520
??

428
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:58,694
Balloons?

429
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:01,864
You going to a party, little girl?

430
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:04,033
Can I keep them, please?

431
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:09,238
It's just...

432
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,140
Let me keep them.

433
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:15,577
Say please again, little girl.

434
00:38:17,648 --> 00:38:19,315
Please.

435
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:22,651
Yeah.
One more time.

436
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:26,822
Please.

437
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:33,062
Be careful, little girl.

438
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:40,369
They'll be gone soon.

439
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:50,012
What you got for me, Rick?

440
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:57,419
Well, would you look at that?

441
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,822
They were here after all.

442
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:03,592
Funny how a little "Holy shit!
Somebody's gonna die!"

443
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:06,261
lights a fire under everybody's ass!

444
00:39:07,698 --> 00:39:11,600
So, tell me, Rick --
which one of your fine folks

445
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:14,370
almost cost Olivia
the rest of her days?

446
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:18,040
-It doesn't matter anymore.
-No, it matters.

447
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:21,910
See, you need to get
everybody on board.

448
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:24,546
Everybody. Or...

449
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:28,317
we just go right back to square one.

450
00:40:18,314 --> 00:40:21,515
Hell of a place you got here, Rick.

451
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:31,792
Give me a second.

452
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,601
No.

453
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:46,673
Please, can you just...

454
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:49,843
give me a second?

455
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:22,209
He had me hold it.

456
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:27,547
I need the rifle.

457
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:29,249
What?

458
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:36,089
I know it's in the bag.

459
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:38,358
I know what you're doing out there.

460
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,027
What am I doing out there?

461
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:43,163
You're practicing.

462
00:41:43,165 --> 00:41:47,000
We have to give up our guns,
all of them.

463
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:48,568
We can't.

464
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,071
If you keep it, and they find it,

465
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:53,674
someone dies.

466
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:56,443
I'm not losing you or Carl
or anyone else.

467
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:59,179
I'm not losing anyone else!

468
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:08,622
Now I'm giving it to them.
Are you gonna let me?

469
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:26,540
Look at this!

470
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:30,610
I thought she was scavenging.

471
00:42:30,612 --> 00:42:32,312
She was hunting.

472
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:36,550
This one never came inside.
We kept it near the line.

473
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:39,753
Look at this.

474
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:44,758
This is something to build
a relationship on.

475
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,427
Good for you, Rick.

476
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:51,832
This is readin' the room
and gettin' the message.

477
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:54,468
I've said it before,
I'm gonna say it again.

478
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,071
You, sir...are special.

479
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:02,542
Now that you know we can
follow your rules...

480
00:43:02,544 --> 00:43:04,511
Yes?

481
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:10,283
...I'd like to ask you
if Daryl can stay.

482
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:12,152
Not happenin'.

483
00:43:14,923 --> 00:43:19,493
You know what?
I don't know.

484
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:22,362
Maybe Daryl can plead his case.

485
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:26,833
Maybe Daryl can sway me.

486
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:34,541
Daryl?

487
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:44,284
Well, you tried.

488
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:46,686
Now what you got to do

489
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:49,656
is get over that tall wall of yours

490
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:52,025
and try harder out there.

491
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:54,027
Earn for me.

492
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:57,564
Because we're coming back soon,
and when we do,

493
00:43:57,566 --> 00:44:00,467
you better have something
interesting for us,

494
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:04,004
or Lucille, she's gonna have her way.

495
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:07,574
I want you to hear that again.

496
00:44:07,576 --> 00:44:12,846
If you don't have something
interesting for us...

497
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:15,882
somebody's gonna die.

498
00:44:15,884 --> 00:44:20,086
And no more magic guns.

499
00:44:20,088 --> 00:44:24,090
Arat, grab that deer.
It's getting late.

500
00:44:24,092 --> 00:44:25,559
Let's go home.

501
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:34,034
Man, I love a gal that buys me dinner

502
00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:36,703
and doesn't expect me to put out.

503
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:45,779
I'll take that.

504
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:50,851
Rosita!

505
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:53,019
Got a little thank-you.

506
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:58,974
That's all you're getting back.

507
00:44:59,382 --> 00:45:03,084
Took all your guns,
most of your beds.

508
00:45:05,188 --> 00:45:08,890
I hope you find a place to lay
your pretty little head.

509
00:45:11,194 --> 00:45:15,430
Did you find anything else out there?

510
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:17,565
Just your dead friends.

511
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:41,923
You can have it back.

512
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:44,125
Just say the word.

513
00:45:56,439 --> 00:45:59,374
So, nobody died.

514
00:45:59,376 --> 00:46:01,943
And you know what I think?

515
00:46:01,945 --> 00:46:06,981
I think you and I,
we've refined our understanding.

516
00:46:06,983 --> 00:46:10,518
Let me ask you something, Rick.

517
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,487
Do you want me to go?

518
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:19,827
I think that'd be good.

519
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:24,599
Then just say those two
magical words.

520
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,007
Thank you.

521
00:46:35,478 --> 00:46:38,980
Don't be ridiculous.
Thank you.

522
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:48,222
Another one.

523
00:46:49,592 --> 00:46:51,959
You need our help.

524
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:56,931
Davey, hand me that candlestick
over there.

525
00:46:56,933 --> 00:46:59,300
You know what I think, Rick?

526
00:46:59,302 --> 00:47:04,072
I think we're both gonna
come out of this winners.

527
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:05,840
Watch my form!

528
00:47:25,528 --> 00:47:27,762
Ahh.

529
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:37,872
Yep.

530
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:42,910
Win-win.

531
00:47:45,014 --> 00:47:47,982
You should clean that up for me
for next time.

532
00:47:47,984 --> 00:47:50,685
Let's move out!

533
00:47:53,923 --> 00:47:56,691
Oh, wait.

534
00:47:59,662 --> 00:48:03,064
How careless of me.

535
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:06,400
You didn't think I was gonna
leave Lucille, did ya?

536
00:48:06,402 --> 00:48:10,705
I mean, after what she did,

537
00:48:10,707 --> 00:48:12,874
why would you want 'er?

538
00:48:12,876 --> 00:48:17,278
Thank you for being
so accommodating, friend.

539
00:48:21,017 --> 00:48:24,118
In case you haven't caught on...

540
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,122
I just slipped my dick
down your throat,

541
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:30,958
and you thanked me for it.

542
00:49:55,685 --> 00:49:57,217
Spencer.

543
00:49:57,219 --> 00:50:01,021
We took the guns you had
in your house.

544
00:50:01,023 --> 00:50:04,825
The Saviors wanted ours, all of them.

545
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:07,761
There were two missing
from the inventory.

546
00:50:07,763 --> 00:50:12,066
They were gonna kill Olivia.

547
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:17,438
Spencer.

548
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,274
You went into my house?

549
00:50:20,276 --> 00:50:24,144
They were gonna kill Olivia.

550
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:27,348
Look, I'm not faulting you
for having the guns.

551
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:31,185
I did it myself.
But the food and liquor?

552
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:35,656
That's 'cause you're small, Spencer.

553
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,291
You're weak.

554
00:50:37,293 --> 00:50:39,560
You got lucky with the walls.

555
00:50:39,562 --> 00:50:41,128
You got lucky with us.

556
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,134
We should've made a deal
with them when we could've.

557
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,505
Oh, yeah, we're so lucky.

558
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,273
You've led us all
to the Promised Land!

559
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:54,475
Isn't that right, Rick?!

560
00:50:54,477 --> 00:50:56,643
Here we are!

561
00:50:56,645 --> 00:51:01,281
I guess Glenn and Abraham
were lucky, too?

562
00:51:06,756 --> 00:51:10,657
You say anything
like that again to me,

563
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:13,260
I'll break your jaw,
knock your teeth out.

564
00:51:13,262 --> 00:51:17,264
You understand?

565
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:19,867
Say yes.

566
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:22,269
Yes.

567
00:51:36,986 --> 00:51:38,552
You had guns?

568
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,187
Uh-huh.

569
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:43,123
Why didn't you tell me
after I --

570
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:46,360
You saw what I did to get one,

571
00:51:46,362 --> 00:51:47,694
that I need bullets.

572
00:51:47,696 --> 00:51:49,263
I had them for a while

573
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:51,465
because I didn't trust Rick.

574
00:51:53,803 --> 00:51:57,638
'Cause I was worried about him
being in charge.

575
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,940
You know what?
You were right.

576
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:03,177
This doesn't have to be our life.

577
00:52:56,632 --> 00:53:00,834
They took our mattresses --
most of them.

578
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,675
That rifle

579
00:53:08,677 --> 00:53:11,178
was one of theirs from the outpost.

580
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,846
They didn't have a list?

581
00:53:14,283 --> 00:53:16,550
Unh-unh.

582
00:53:16,552 --> 00:53:18,452
Could've hidden more.

583
00:53:18,454 --> 00:53:21,355
Did you?

584
00:53:27,897 --> 00:53:29,897
No.

585
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:46,747
Everything we have,
we got from fighting.

586
00:53:46,749 --> 00:53:49,383
I made the choice.

587
00:53:49,385 --> 00:53:52,419
There aren't enough of us.
It's about numbers.

588
00:53:52,421 --> 00:53:53,620
There's the Hilltop.

589
00:53:53,622 --> 00:53:57,024
They'd still have the numbers.

590
00:53:59,228 --> 00:54:03,263
We play by their rules,
and we get some kind of life.

591
00:54:03,265 --> 00:54:05,232
What kind of a life?

592
00:54:10,172 --> 00:54:12,406
You know, I had a friend.

593
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:19,780
I don't talk about him.

594
00:54:19,782 --> 00:54:22,215
He was my partner.

595
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:27,287
He got Lori and Carl to safety
right after it all started.

596
00:54:30,459 --> 00:54:32,926
I couldn't.
I was in the hospital.

597
00:54:32,928 --> 00:54:35,629
I-I didn't know...
what was happenin'.

598
00:54:37,633 --> 00:54:40,067
My friend...

599
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,469
His name was Shane.

600
00:54:45,774 --> 00:54:49,843
Well, him and Lori...

601
00:54:49,845 --> 00:54:53,513
they were together.

602
00:54:53,515 --> 00:54:58,085
They thought I was dead.

603
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:01,054
I know Judith isn't mine.

604
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:06,193
I know it.

605
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,163
I love her.

606
00:55:10,165 --> 00:55:13,200
She's my daughter.

607
00:55:13,202 --> 00:55:16,336
But she isn't mine.

608
00:55:16,338 --> 00:55:19,473
I had to accept that.

609
00:55:19,475 --> 00:55:21,608
I did.

610
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,378
So I could keep her alive.

611
00:55:28,183 --> 00:55:30,651
I'll die before she does,

612
00:55:30,653 --> 00:55:32,819
and I hope that's
a long time from now

613
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:34,621
so I can...

614
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:38,525
raise her and protect her
and teach her how to survive.

615
00:55:42,264 --> 00:55:45,732
This is how we live now.

616
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:47,300
I had to accept that, too,

617
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,503
so I could keep everyone else alive.

618
00:55:49,505 --> 00:55:52,305
It's not your fault when people die.

619
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:55,976
Not always, but sometimes --
sometimes it is.

620
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:02,516
You have to accept this --

621
00:56:02,518 --> 00:56:04,117
all of us do --

622
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:06,453
or it won't work.

623
00:56:30,979 --> 00:56:33,313
I'm gonna try.

624
00:56:51,398 --> 00:57:02,166
