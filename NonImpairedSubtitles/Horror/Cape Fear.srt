1
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,246
Hey, daddy,
where does Sam Bowden hang out?

2
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:14,171
In there, sir.
Court is about over, I think.

3
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,230
Oh, no, Your Honor.

4
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,556
But this would make the third
adjournment of this case...

5
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,651
always due to the illness
of some defense witness.

6
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,025
Granted that this witness is ill.

7
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:38,281
The defense still has 11
important witnesses able to testify...

8
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,941
while the plaintiff has but one.

9
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,706
I submit that 11 against 1
should be enough...

10
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,787
no matter how sickly and decrepit
those 11 happen to be.

11
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:52,619
Opposing counsel will please
come closer to the bench...

12
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,633
so that we can discuss this
more privately.

13
00:02:57,429 --> 00:03:00,513
Sam, you know this courtroom
gets like an oven.

14
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,472
You want a hostile jury
on your hands?

15
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,343
Let's put it over till fall.
Everybody'll be happy.

16
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:10,229
Everybody except my client. He has money
due him, and he's badly in need of it.

17
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:13,234
More important, my chief witness
is quite an old man.

18
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,277
He might not be alive
next fall.

19
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,440
Motion for adjournment
is denied.

20
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:22,116
As it is now after 4:00,
this trial will resume Monday morning.

21
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:23,615
Thank you.

22
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:59,693
Hello, Counselor.
You remember me?

23
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:04,281
Baltimore. Eight years,
four months and thirteen days ago.

24
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:07,491
It comin' in clear now,
Counselor?

25
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,328
Cady. Max Cady.

26
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:16,835
Good. I wouldn't want to think
you'd forgotten me.

27
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:18,670
What do you want?

28
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:21,965
You didn't remember me right off,
did you?

29
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:24,180
Well, I guess
I've changed a little.

30
00:04:24,268 --> 00:04:27,767
Where I've been, if you don't change,
they're real disappointed.

31
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:29,598
You haven't changed a bit.

32
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,604
You know somethin'?
That's just the way I wanted it.

33
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:36,980
I wanted you to be just the way you were
the last time I saw you.

34
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:40,483
All right, you've seen me.
What's the rest?

35
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,035
No rest.

36
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:45,120
Just wanted to give you the word.
Just wanted you to get the picture.

37
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:47,163
- Give me the keys.
- Why not?

38
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:50,827
Now, let me get this straight.

39
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:55,790
You're not still blaming me
for what you did.

40
00:04:57,343 --> 00:04:59,383
You still don't get the picture.

41
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:05,009
Well, I can see this
is gonna take a lot of time.

42
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,764
Hey, look at that, would ya?
Look at that wiggle.

43
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,184
Maybe she thinks we don't know
that's on purpose...

44
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:16,519
but we've seen a thing or two,
haven't we, Counselor?

45
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,522
You oughta be
an expert on such things.

46
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:22,115
I hear you got a good-lookin' wife
and a daughter gonna be just like her.

47
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:27,370
Give my love to the family, Counselor.
I'll be seein' ya.

48
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:50,560
Well, anyway,
you're ten minutes late.

49
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:53,851
It's a mistake to teach women to tell
time. They always use it against you.

50
00:05:53,943 --> 00:05:57,644
Please don't be long, Dad.
I asked Betty to bowl with us.

51
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,198
Betty?

52
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:04,028
That rancid little thing that you detest
with every fiber of your being?

53
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,572
That was last week.
This week, they're inseparable.

54
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:22,467
Think I'll just sit here
and keep score.

55
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,801
Cheat.

56
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,572
- Beer.
- Okay.

57
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:14,315
Here you go.

58
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,984
- You're kinda fast on your feet.
- You have to be around here.

59
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:26,282
- That ring mean anything?
- Yeah. It means plenty.

60
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:27,996
Does that mean anything?

61
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:17,504
Dad, you're slipping.

62
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:22,885
Usually you would've said
the pin moved.

63
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,881
It did.

64
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,319
Nice shot.

65
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:47,823
Don't mind me, Counselor.

66
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:51,746
I'm just gettin' a gander
at the rest of your family.

67
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,744
You're a lucky man.

68
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,876
Did you see my strike, Daddy?

69
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:02,215
Police department.

70
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:03,846
Chief Dutton, please.

71
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,264
Chief Dutton?
He's probably left, but I'll try.

72
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:13,804
Chief Dutton.

73
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,690
Mark. Sam Bowden.

74
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:17,519
Well, hello, Sam.

75
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:21,312
- Mind if I drop over this evening?
- Not at all. You know the house.

76
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:23,980
Yes, I know it.
Thanks, Mark.

77
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:28,244
What's on your mind, Sam?

78
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,616
There's an ex-convict in town,
name of Max Cady.

79
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,120
Thanks.

80
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:38,754
I think he's starting
a war of nerves with me.

81
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:41,047
I hope it's only that.

82
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,211
Has he threatened you?

83
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,877
No, nothing
that would hold in court.

84
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:47,931
You have to know him
to feel the threat.

85
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:49,974
He stopped me today after court...

86
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:52,932
and showed up this evening
at the bowling centre.

87
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:55,015
He followed me.

88
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,851
Why?

89
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:02,108
I was up in Baltimore
about eight years ago on a case.

90
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:05,449
One night I was walking
back to my hotel quite late.

91
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:08,785
I heard a commotion
in the rear of a dark parking lot.

92
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:10,948
Sounded like someone whimpering.

93
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,532
I ran over.

94
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:16,996
A girl was being attacked,
so I grappled with the man.

95
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,374
She suddenly got her breath back
and started screaming.

96
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:23,133
When he saw the police...

97
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,177
he went completely berserk.

98
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:28,181
Put the girl in the hospital
for over a month.

99
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:31,344
That was Max Cady.

100
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:36,683
Later on, I had to go back up
and appear against him as a witness.

101
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:39,733
You feel sure that
he blames you personally.

102
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,738
That was perfectly clear
at the trial.

103
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:48,658
Thought it was strange
when he showed up here this afternoon.

104
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,205
I wasn't...

105
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:55,040
really worried until I saw him
at the bowling centre.

106
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:01,257
It was the way he looked
at my family.

107
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:08,593
All ex-cons are required
to register on arrival in a new town.

108
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,182
Sergeant, this is Dutton.

109
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:17,681
Has an ex-con named Max Cady...
Hold on.

110
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:20,232
- How do you spell that, Sam?
- C-A-D-Y.

111
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,865
Has he registered here
in the last few days?

112
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,236
Chances are he hasn't done it.
We can run him out of town on that.

113
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,699
Thanks, Sergeant.
Hold on.

114
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,865
He's smart.
Registered yesterday.

115
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,628
What address did he give?

116
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,381
I see.
Switch me to Lieutenant Gervasi.

117
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,955
The address
is over at the dock area.

118
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,506
Sounds like he's short of dough.

119
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:45,503
We can get him on vagrancy.

120
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:48,930
Pete, I want a pick-up
on Max Cady.

121
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:52,473
The registration has the description.

122
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,554
Fine. Call me back.

123
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:56,981
Thanks, Mark.

124
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,142
My family's home alone.

125
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,145
I'd better be going.

126
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:03,563
You have a dog, don't you, Sam?

127
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,574
She couldn't bite through a doughnut,
but she's a good barker.

128
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,744
That's good enough.
I'll call you when they pick him up.

129
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,747
I hope I haven't put you
to all this trouble for nothing.

130
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,787
- Sam, I hope it is for nothing.
- Good night.

131
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:33,874
- You're Max Cady?
- I could be.

132
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,374
- What's your problem?
- We want to talk to you outside.

133
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:41,625
You start reachin' for those,
you'd better call for the riot squad.

134
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:45,760
I don't mind a little talk.
I just don't like bein' pawed.

135
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:48,253
I'll come back
for the change later.

136
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:59,938
I'm gonna give you just one hour
to get rid of your friends.

137
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:02,351
Are you trying to pick me up?

138
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:03,904
Yes.

139
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:20,793
You know I'm not drunk.

140
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:23,170
But I'm a cooperative guy.

141
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:24,503
Here.

142
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:29,089
See that card?
"John W. Moss, MD"

143
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:31,423
You wanna give me
an intoxication test...

144
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,509
bring that gentleman down here.

145
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:36,852
I didn't spend eight years in the can
studyin' law for nothin'.

146
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:40,355
I've got a legal right to be examined
by my own physician.

147
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:42,482
- Or didn't you boys know that?
- Never mind.

148
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,487
You'll be sober enough
when you leave here anyway.

149
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:51,947
Thank you.

150
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,785
Come on in.

151
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:01,586
Well, well, well.

152
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:03,879
We seem to be seeing
quite a bit of each other today.

153
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,292
Strip down to your shorts, Cady.

154
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,797
Right.

155
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:16,969
You thought I was gonna object
to a strip search, didn't you, Chief?

156
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:19,733
No, siree, not me.

157
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:22,224
Like I said,
I'm a cooperative guy.

158
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:26,233
Check that shirt. I got a couple of
jolts of horse stashed under the collar.

159
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:29,408
- Let's make with the pants.
- Comin' up, Chief.

160
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:33,904
What are you doing in our town?

161
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,999
Well, they told me
it was a pleasant climate...

162
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:39,160
plenty of boatin' on the river...

163
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:43,251
a lot of fine, stand-up citizens
like our friend here, the counselor.

164
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:46,258
I figured that'd be
just the place for me.

165
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,253
How much money have you got?

166
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:51,797
Here's my wallet.
Why don't you check for yourself.

167
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,229
Seven dollars.

168
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,850
That's just not enough, Cady.

169
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:05,193
I'm charging you with vagrancy
unless you're 100 miles away by morning.

170
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,197
Would you look just a little harder,
please, Chief, sir?

171
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:11,200
A little black bank book in there.
Read what that says.

172
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,196
- This one?
- That's it.

173
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,992
Fifty-four hundred dollars.
Where'd you get it?

174
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:22,834
It's in the bank right here, deposited
this very day. You saw that, didn't you?

175
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:24,832
I asked you
where you got it, boy.

176
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:27,843
That could be my business,
couldn't it?

177
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:30,336
Would you advise me
to answer a question like that?

178
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:32,507
You'd be wise to answer it.

179
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,811
That's the kind of advice I like.
Like I said, I'm a cooperative guy.

180
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:40,561
Check with the escrow officer of the
1st National Bank, Baltimore, Maryland.

181
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,599
He'll be happy to tell you
exactly where that money come from.

182
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:47,613
- Anything?
- Nothing, Chief.

183
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:49,905
- Come on, Sam.
- "Come on, Sam"?

184
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:53,195
Y'all kind of friendly,
ain't you?

185
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:55,197
Nice, tight little corporation.

186
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,207
"Mark, old buddy, I don't like that
man's face. Throw him out of town."

187
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:00,748
"Why, certainly, Sam.
Anything to oblige you."

188
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:03,503
I'm gonna tell you somethin',
mister.

189
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,422
You're gonna be old and grey
before I ever leave this town.

190
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:12,675
I'll give you a warning.

191
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:15,720
Stay off my property...

192
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:17,768
day or night.

193
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:47,425
Sorry I couldn't phone you sooner,
but I was out on a case.

194
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,796
<i>I got hold of the escrow officer
at his home earlier.</i>

195
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:55,218
<i>Cady sold the old family farm
for $5,900, net.</i>

196
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,979
<i>He's in the clear, Sam.</i>

197
00:17:58,062 --> 00:17:59,972
When are you going
to release him?

198
00:18:00,064 --> 00:18:03,647
<i>I've already done it.
A couple of hours ago.</i>

199
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:08,063
Hold on, Mark.

200
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:10,065
What's going on with Marilyn?

201
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:13,112
I don't know.
I can't see her in the bushes.

202
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,408
- Where's your mother?
- In the kitchen, I think.

203
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:25,966
<i>- You still there, Sam?
- Yes, Mark.</i>

204
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:29,134
Just remember that there are legal ways
to convince Mr. Cady...

205
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:32,173
that this can be
a pretty poor place to live in.

206
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:35,055
<i>We'll do all we can.</i>

207
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:38,179
<i>I don't have to tell you
to keep your eyes open.</i>

208
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,188
You can bank on that.
Thanks, Mark.

209
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:50,114
Marilyn stopped barking.
Maybe she caught a rabbit.

210
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,275
Marilyn never caught a rabbit
in her life.

211
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:55,903
- If she did, would she eat it?
- She doesn't know rabbits are to eat.

212
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:57,408
Sam! Sam!

213
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,249
Sam, come quick!

214
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:04,744
It's Marilyn!
She's having a fit!

215
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:14,715
Get the car started.

216
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:20,635
Dad, what's the matter with her?

217
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,474
Dad, what's the matter?

218
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,144
What's the matter, Marilyn?

219
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:25,978
Oh, Dad!

220
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,987
Open the door.
I'll get in the back.

221
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:31,817
You get in the front.

222
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,818
Maybe we'd better not take her.

223
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,868
She can't stay here.

224
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:42,494
Ten-to-one
it was strychnine, Sam.

225
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:45,920
You couldn't have saved her
if you'd been twice as quick.

226
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:49,008
To me it's the same
as murdering a human.

227
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:52,011
It's a shame
Nancy had to see it.

228
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:56,341
She was meant to see it.

229
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,849
Thanks, Doctor.

230
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:26,837
Don't let Daddy see you like this.

231
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:29,841
But this is when
I always feed her.

232
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,812
I'd like to speak to both of you.

233
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:45,729
I'm not telling you this
to frighten you...

234
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:47,977
but I want you to be careful.

235
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,608
I think you're old enough
to be told why.

236
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:58,947
Eight years ago I was a witness against
a man, and he was sent to prison.

237
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,365
The thing is, he's out now...

238
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:04,211
and blames me for his conviction.

239
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:06,537
He's the one
that poisoned Marilyn.

240
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:09,881
Maybe,
but there's no proof of that.

241
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,293
But you know he did.

242
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:14,593
Thinking isn't knowing.

243
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:17,765
Just be careful.
This is a big man.

244
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:19,760
He has dark hair.

245
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,522
He smokes cigars
and usually wears a panama hat.

246
00:21:22,606 --> 00:21:25,523
I'll get you
a police photograph of him.

247
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:29,561
Until we have this thing
under control...

248
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,106
I want you never to leave this house
or the school grounds...

249
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,359
except in your mother's car.

250
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,297
There's nothing to worry about
as long as you're careful.

251
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,957
The police are going to keep
a very close watch on the house.

252
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:55,007
The chances are
he's just trying to scare us anyway.

253
00:21:58,393 --> 00:22:01,394
<i>A man like that
doesn't deserve civil rights.</i>

254
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:05,228
<i>Darling, you can't put a man in jail
for what he might do...</i>

255
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:07,772
<i>and thank heaven for that.</i>

256
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:16,317
<i>You think we could go away for a while,
take Nancy out of school?</i>

257
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:19,163
<i>Well, I did think of that.</i>

258
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:22,165
<i>But Cady can afford to go
anyplace we can go.</i>

259
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:29,464
<i>What are we going to do
about that man?</i>

260
00:22:32,428 --> 00:22:34,337
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

261
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,802
<i>I know one thing.</i>

262
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:40,805
<i>Mustn't let him frighten us.
That'd be just playing his game.</i>

263
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,119
Sam?

264
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:22,990
What are you doing down here?

265
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,286
- I was hungry, and I heard Dad.
- Where is he?

266
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,287
He's talking to a policeman.

267
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:34,128
Probably just drove along the alley
and tossed the meat out.

268
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,462
Well, thanks for coming by.

269
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:39,181
Good night.

270
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,487
Don't you ever
do that to me again.

271
00:24:57,285 --> 00:25:00,202
What were your physical findings,
Dr. Pearsall?

272
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:02,957
Physical findings were a one-inch
shortening of the left leg.

273
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,701
And the X ray?

274
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:07,331
The X ray revealed that though
the fracture had healed...

275
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,338
there was marked indication
of degenerative joint disease.

276
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:12,499
By degenerative joint disease,
you mean arthritis?

277
00:25:12,592 --> 00:25:14,751
- Yes.
- And what was your diagnosis?

278
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:18,261
Diagnosis was hip fracture with
destruction of the joint surfaces...

279
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:21,385
which caused the pain
and restriction of motion.

280
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:23,386
You then performed surgery
upon the plaintiff?

281
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:25,186
Yes.

282
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:30,397
This model should make the operation
easy for the jury to understand.

283
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:33,944
- What is it?
- Chief Dutton wants to see you.

284
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:37,446
- Right now?
- Right now.

285
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,453
Your Honor, may I be excused
for a few minutes?

286
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,531
Mr. Garner will continue
the questioning.

287
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:46,294
- Permission granted.
- Thank you.

288
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:49,295
Keep him on as long as you can.
The jury likes him.

289
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:55,131
Oh, yes.
Yes, it is clear to me.

290
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:58,137
That's fine, if you want
to handle it that way.

291
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:01,307
Then you tell the county
it's their case, that's all.

292
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,468
I'm sorry to pull you out like this...

293
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,601
but this could be serious
for both of us.

294
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:09,022
Your friend Cady
turned up with Dave Grafton.

295
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,817
Oh, that's it.

296
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,318
Well, he got himself the right man.

297
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,905
Not for us. You know what he's like.
He's one of these ardent types.

298
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,902
You slap a cigarette
out of some hoodlum's mouth...

299
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,115
five minutes later he's in the mayor's
office yelling "police brutality"...

300
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,199
rallying the bleeding heart squad.

301
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,253
- Hello, Dave.
- Good morning, Sam.

302
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:37,260
I hope you haven't come
to dispute me on any technicalities.

303
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,264
No, I'm here as a citizen,
not as a lawyer.

304
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:43,884
- Don't worry about technicalities.
- Thank you very kindly.

305
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:49,274
First, let me say that my client
does not want to make any trouble.

306
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,858
He merely wants to put an end
to this persecution.

307
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,152
What persecution is this?

308
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:59,403
Well, I believe your records
will show the following:

309
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,819
Detention in jail
last Friday night...

310
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:05,033
I agree that you are,
technically, within your rights.

311
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,458
I merely mention this
as the beginning of a pattern.

312
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,825
What pattern?

313
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:13,124
I intend to establish
this pattern.

314
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:17,296
On Saturday, Mr. Cady's room
was searched, his car was searched.

315
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,427
Did he protest the search?

316
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:23,643
During this time he was made to feel
he was suspected of poisoning a dog...

317
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,645
a truly despicable act, causing
serious damage to his reputation.

318
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,438
Hold on right there.

319
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,809
I can guarantee you none of my officers
mentioned this to anyone but Cady.

320
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:32,981
Perhaps.

321
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,193
But people become curious...

322
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:37,653
when a citizen's room
is searched by police.

323
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,366
On Monday...

324
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,156
my client was picked up
and interrogated by police...

325
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,155
on suspicion of armed robbery.

326
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:48,412
Tuesday, he was forced to stand in a
line-up on suspicion of purse snatching.

327
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:51,037
This constant attention
by the police...

328
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,048
caused his landlady to ask him
to vacate the premises.

329
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:57,502
He was forced to find other,
more expensive lodgings.

330
00:27:57,595 --> 00:27:59,967
All right, what's the point?

331
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:03,092
Don't the police have a right
to interrogate a suspect any more?

332
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:09,230
You know, if anybody
had told me a week ago...

333
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:12,270
that you were capable
of a remark like that...

334
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:16,442
Let me continue with the pattern.

335
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:18,524
On Wednesday,
he was picked up twice...

336
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:22,033
first on suspicion of burglary,
second on suspicion of grand theft auto.

337
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,703
His new landlord became aware of this
in some manner...

338
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,914
and again Mr. Cady
was forced to move.

339
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:30,327
His present lodgings
are squalid and uncomfortable.

340
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:33,422
Today is Thursday.
You must be about finished.

341
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:35,381
For the moment, yes.

342
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:38,552
Then what is this pattern
you're talking about?

343
00:28:38,637 --> 00:28:42,505
I'm sure Mr. Bowden here
is still enough of a lawyer to see it.

344
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:45,677
My client is an ex-convict.

345
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,142
He's been constantly harassed
by the police...

346
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,804
subjected to extreme mental cruelty
and public degradation.

347
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,569
He's even been denied
an adequate place to live!

348
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:56,820
To be very blunt, gentlemen,
my client has been thoroughly rousted.

349
00:28:58,282 --> 00:29:00,359
And isn't it also a fact...

350
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:03,203
that with manpower
as short as you say it is...

351
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:06,039
that officers
are assigned day and night...

352
00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:10,252
to guarding the premises of one private
individual, your personal friend...

353
00:29:10,337 --> 00:29:12,413
this without any evidence
of danger?

354
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:14,083
You're referring to my house?

355
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:15,751
Yes, I am.

356
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:17,799
Then I ask...

357
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:21,045
who furnished you
with that information?

358
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:35,357
Well, I think you will find
that this is a matter of...

359
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:37,522
common knowledge
in the department.

360
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:39,856
Grafton,
I want you to listen to this.

361
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,031
I don't owe Sam Bowden
any special favors, nor do I give any.

362
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:47,905
In each 24 hours, there's been less than
two hours devoted to guarding his house.

363
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,123
I'm prepared to substantiate that.

364
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:52,002
Now, are you finished?

365
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:56,747
That depends, gentlemen.

366
00:29:56,843 --> 00:29:59,334
It depends wholly
on the treatment...

367
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:02,346
that my client receives
from now on.

368
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:06,432
Come, Mr. Cady.

369
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,930
Gentlemen.

370
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:14,522
I'll see you around, Counselor.

371
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:25,620
Now you can see why I wanted you
to hear this, Sam.

372
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:28,623
I can't do anything more
without an overt act.

373
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:30,618
Like a neat little murder?

374
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:33,665
Well, you show me a law
that prevents crime.

375
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:35,997
All we can do
is act after the fact.

376
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:38,049
You remember the Hoffman murder?

377
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:41,053
Before she was killed, Mrs. Hoffman
came up here week after week...

378
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:43,890
telling us that her husband was
going to do it, and I believed it.

379
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:47,343
But I couldn't arrest the man
for something that might be in his mind.

380
00:30:47,436 --> 00:30:48,812
That's dictatorship.

381
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:52,099
Sam, you're a citizen.
Would you want it any other way?

382
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,654
Then what am I supposed to do?

383
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,196
Pull up the drawbridge?

384
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:05,202
Sit home with a loaded gun? Have
the groceries dropped in by airlift?

385
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:08,704
That's kind of an artificial way
to live, wouldn't you say?

386
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:11,543
Sam, I'm going to make
a humiliating suggestion...

387
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,537
and it's humiliating for me.

388
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,248
You hire yourself
a private detective.

389
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,793
That's all you can do.
Get Charlie Sievers.

390
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:24,303
If anyone can dig up
something we can act on, he can.

391
00:31:25,475 --> 00:31:27,551
- Private detective.
- That's right.

392
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:32,891
I'm not going to go into
the "I am a taxpayer" routine...

393
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:34,892
but is that the best
you can do?

394
00:31:34,985 --> 00:31:36,894
You're telling me
to hire protection?

395
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:39,194
It's a hell of a note, isn't it?

396
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:41,855
Either we have too many laws
or not enough.

397
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,550
Why are we going this way?

398
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:03,761
Better scenery.

399
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:07,098
What would you know
about scenery?

400
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:08,644
Or beauty?

401
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:12,678
Or any of the things
that really make life worth living?

402
00:32:13,984 --> 00:32:16,107
You're just an animal.

403
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:20,072
Coarse, lustful...

404
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:21,485
barbaric.

405
00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:25,110
Keep right on talkin', honey.
I like it when you run me down.

406
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,323
Max Cady.

407
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,824
What I like about you is...

408
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,627
you're rock bottom.

409
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,916
I wouldn't expect you
to understand this...

410
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:40,713
but it's a great comfort
for a girl to know...

411
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:44,966
she could not possibly sink
any lower.

412
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:46,516
Yeah.

413
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:50,306
Tell me some more
about that time when you were...

414
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:53,847
queen of
the veiled prophet's ball.

415
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:07,446
Operator,
Police Department.

416
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,449
Give me Sergeant Elkins.

417
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:14,327
Hello, Mike.
This is Charlie Sievers.

418
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:17,505
I'm at the corner
of Sherman and DeSoto.

419
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:20,164
If you want something
on Max Cady...

420
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,546
he's up in a room with a girl
who just blew into town a few days ago...

421
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:25,678
Diane Taylor.

422
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:29,466
He's in the room with her now.
2041 Sherman.

423
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:34,021
She's over 18, but you can
still get him for lewd vagrancy.

424
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,811
That's the room.
Second floor.

425
00:35:15,754 --> 00:35:18,126
Open up! Open up!

426
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:31,641
There's a back door open here
and an outside stairway.

427
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,330
Something kind of weird's
happened to her.

428
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:04,510
I can't get her to spill a thing.

429
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,505
Maybe you can.

430
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,496
Miss Taylor?

431
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:43,592
You're probably hurt
worse than you realize.

432
00:36:43,677 --> 00:36:46,631
Would you like me to get a doctor?

433
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:55,348
My name is Charlie Sievers.
I'm a private detective.

434
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:57,728
I can help you.

435
00:36:57,817 --> 00:37:00,734
No need to take
a beating like this lying down.

436
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,818
A man like that has no right
to walk around free.

437
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:07,825
You've got the law on your side.
Why not use it?

438
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:14,618
No one blames you
for being afraid of Max Cady.

439
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:17,414
This one's different,
and you know it.

440
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:19,378
He beat you up tonight.

441
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:21,836
He'll probably do it again
tomorrow night.

442
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:23,834
He might even kill you.

443
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,687
Let me take you down
to the homicide bureau.

444
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:37,812
I'll show you photographs
of girls...

445
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,976
who got mixed up
with men like Cady...

446
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:43,604
and, Miss Taylor,
it'll make you sick.

447
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:47,149
But you'll realize
how lucky you are to be alive.

448
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:49,200
Why not protect yourself?

449
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:22,729
Hello?

450
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:25,656
Could you send
a taxicab promptly...

451
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:29,608
to the corner
of Sherman and DeSoto?

452
00:38:29,703 --> 00:38:32,276
I want to go to the bus station.

453
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,084
Right.

454
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:37,995
Quick, please.

455
00:38:42,424 --> 00:38:46,256
Leave town if you have to,
and as I said, no one will blame you.

456
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:50,639
But before you go,
help us put this man away.

457
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:56,597
All you have to do is come to police
headquarters and sign a complaint.

458
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:59,358
Won't you do that?

459
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:02,277
If not for your sake,
for somebody else's?

460
00:39:04,364 --> 00:39:06,440
Protect myself?

461
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:14,540
Nobody can protect themselves
against a man like that.

462
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:21,086
I'm scared.

463
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:28,928
- You can't help me.
- But I can.

464
00:39:29,014 --> 00:39:32,465
You file an assault charge,
and Cady will get six months in jail.

465
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,139
Six months.
And after that?

466
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:43,392
When he walked out of this room...

467
00:39:43,487 --> 00:39:45,231
he said...

468
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:48,573
he said to consider this
only a sample.

469
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:52,360
And from my limited knowledge
of human nature...

470
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:56,120
Max Cady isn't a man
who makes idle threats.

471
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:01,371
Anyway, you said
you weren't a policeman.

472
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:03,457
What do you want?

473
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:07,250
I have a client... Mr. Bowden.
Mr. Sam Bowden.

474
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:10,973
Cady has threatened
his wife and his daughter.

475
00:40:11,057 --> 00:40:13,133
Never mind the reasons.

476
00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:15,978
Mr. Bowden is worried,
and I can't blame him.

477
00:40:17,188 --> 00:40:19,146
You know Cady.

478
00:40:23,862 --> 00:40:27,611
You believe that I could ever...

479
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:29,241
ever...

480
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,734
in my whole life...

481
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:34,117
step up and repeat...

482
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:36,115
to another living soul...

483
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,746
what that man...

484
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,745
what he did?

485
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:46,379
What about my family?
I'm someone's daughter too.

486
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:49,304
What about the newspapers
in my home town?

487
00:40:49,388 --> 00:40:52,804
Do you think I could bear
to have them read about...

488
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:10,941
I'm afraid I got you here
for nothing.

489
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,953
She won't talk, and she's
leaving town on the next bus.

490
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:25,498
This is Mr. Bowden.

491
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:29,801
Once more, before it's too late,
would you reconsider?

492
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:48,653
I'm sorry.

493
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:50,650
Really, I'm sorry.

494
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:57,281
So what do we do next?

495
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,292
Drop tailing him.
You're wasting your money.

496
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:02,536
He expected to be covered.

497
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,082
And anytime he wants to shake loose,
he'll figure a way.

498
00:42:08,303 --> 00:42:10,675
Then what do you suggest?

499
00:42:11,306 --> 00:42:13,844
Change his mind.

500
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:17,053
Get in touch
with a guy named Jepson.

501
00:42:17,145 --> 00:42:19,221
Alex Jepson.

502
00:42:19,314 --> 00:42:22,564
He's got some rough friends
along the waterfront...

503
00:42:22,651 --> 00:42:24,608
and for the right price...

504
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:27,730
Are you kidding?

505
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:34,740
- I can't consider that.
- Okay.

506
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:38,662
So you're a lawyer
and you believe in due process.

507
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:41,123
But it's your family,
not mine.

508
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:43,418
A type like that is an animal...

509
00:42:43,505 --> 00:42:47,124
so you've got to fight him
like an animal.

510
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:48,842
That's my advice.

511
00:43:09,157 --> 00:43:11,399
When can we have one like that?

512
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:15,822
It's on our fiscal program
for the year 1980.

513
00:43:15,914 --> 00:43:18,950
- What's "fiscal"?
- That's what we haven't got.

514
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:21,711
I've been looking for an excuse
to quit this... I finally found it.

515
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:25,246
- I forgot to buy paper plates and cups.
- You did that on purpose.

516
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,582
You can't convict me
on mere suspicion.

517
00:43:27,676 --> 00:43:30,593
If one rat can leave the ship,
why not two?

518
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:33,004
- You take over for a minute.
- Where are you going?

519
00:43:33,098 --> 00:43:35,423
I have to get more thinner
from Tony.

520
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:38,008
If we're a family of rats,
I'll leave too.

521
00:43:38,103 --> 00:43:41,307
No. You represent
a giant stride in evolution.

522
00:43:41,398 --> 00:43:44,316
And don't drip any of that
on the deck.

523
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,821
Hey, Nancy! Ahoy!

524
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:01,917
- Going to the picnic?
- Yes, if we ever get started.

525
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:04,576
- We'll go water-skiing. Okay?
- Okay.

526
00:44:41,085 --> 00:44:42,994
What are you doing here?

527
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:44,795
Just drinking this beer,
Counselor.

528
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:46,876
Do it someplace else.

529
00:44:46,966 --> 00:44:49,967
The man sells me a beer,
and I might rent me a boat.

530
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:53,468
How many laws you got
against that, Counselor?

531
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:57,133
Look, Cady...

532
00:44:57,977 --> 00:45:00,550
maybe you can get away
with dog poisoning...

533
00:45:00,646 --> 00:45:03,398
beating up on a little drifter
like Diane Taylor.

534
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:05,938
Don't push your luck with me.

535
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:10,855
Say, she's gettin' to be...

536
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:15,112
gettin' to be almost as juicy
as your wife, ain't she?

537
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:20,622
You rotten...

538
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:32,677
You're not gonna push me
into anything, Counselor.

539
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,384
You just had your innings.

540
00:45:35,474 --> 00:45:37,550
I'll make my stroke later.

541
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,311
I guess you saw that, didn't you?
Never laid a hand on him.

542
00:45:49,405 --> 00:45:53,568
Just minding my own business,
a man walks up and starts beatin' the...

543
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:55,782
How about that?

544
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,701
That's him, isn't it?

545
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,892
She just ran out in front of me.

546
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,271
Nancy, darling, are you all right?

547
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:09,598
I saw him! I saw that man!

548
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:13,311
He chased me into the school,
and I couldn't get away!

549
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,815
It's all right, darling.

550
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:18,322
I tried to get away, but...
He's here. He's here, Mama.

551
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,747
- How is she?
- She's only bruised.

552
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,163
The doctor gave her a sedative.

553
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:36,207
I'm sorry, Sam. I thought the store
would only take a second.

554
00:52:08,711 --> 00:52:11,796
Sam!
Are you out of your mind?

555
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:16,052
But, Sam,
he didn't do anything to her!

556
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:18,377
- He didn't hurt her!
- Fine. I'll wait until he does.

557
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:20,215
Will you please listen!

558
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,548
It'll be murder.
You know that.

559
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:26,972
Do you want to ruin all of us?
Isn't that exactly what he wants?

560
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:29,305
In the name of heaven,
pay him off...

561
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,392
give him some money
and he'll go away...

562
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:33,727
but don't do this to us.

563
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,738
If you get into that car,
I'll call the police.

564
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:40,240
You won't get halfway into town
before they pick you up.

565
00:52:56,344 --> 00:52:58,087
Get me the police.

566
00:52:58,179 --> 00:53:00,302
Please hurry.

567
00:53:06,104 --> 00:53:08,345
Could I speak to Chief Dutton?

568
00:53:10,608 --> 00:53:12,934
Mrs. Bowden.

569
00:53:13,027 --> 00:53:15,518
Bowden.
Mrs. Sam Bowden.

570
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:20,190
Yes, it's urgent.
It's very urgent.

571
00:53:21,494 --> 00:53:23,404
Will you please hurry?

572
00:53:38,303 --> 00:53:41,755
Hello, Mark.
I'm sorry. It's a false alarm.

573
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:43,841
Everything's all right.

574
00:53:46,061 --> 00:53:48,683
I'll talk to you later.
Right. Good-bye.

575
00:54:35,612 --> 00:54:38,447
You're sweatin' a little,
huh, Counselor?

576
00:54:39,283 --> 00:54:43,031
Well, I know how it is.

577
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,576
I sweat too.

578
00:54:45,664 --> 00:54:48,618
For eight solid years I sweat.

579
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:52,667
You gonna buy me a drink?

580
00:54:53,798 --> 00:54:56,917
- Waiter?
- That'll be double, waiter.

581
00:54:57,009 --> 00:54:59,049
Twelve-year-old.

582
00:54:59,136 --> 00:55:02,968
My rich cousin here says
nothing's too good for ol' Max.

583
00:55:03,891 --> 00:55:06,382
- How much do you want, Cady?
- How's that again?

584
00:55:06,477 --> 00:55:09,478
You heard me.
I said, "How much do you want?"

585
00:55:09,564 --> 00:55:13,229
Counselor, you gotta forgive me. I'm a
little slow till after my first drink.

586
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:17,018
- I assume we're talkin' about dough.
- That's right.

587
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,697
Well, that certainly
is heart-warmin'.

588
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:24,200
A poor ex-convict comes to
a new town lookin' for a fresh start...

589
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,909
and one of the leading citizens
steps right up...

590
00:55:26,998 --> 00:55:29,536
and offers him financial help.

591
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,829
That's enough to renew
your faith in human nature.

592
00:55:37,009 --> 00:55:38,966
It sure is.

593
00:55:41,096 --> 00:55:43,053
Hey, buster.

594
00:55:43,557 --> 00:55:46,843
You got some salted peanuts,
salted in the shell?

595
00:55:46,936 --> 00:55:50,305
- Not in the shell.
- Okay, forget it.

596
00:55:50,397 --> 00:55:54,016
- I'm gonna have to educate this town.
- Come on. Let's have the answer.

597
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,359
That takes a little figurin',
Counselor.

598
00:55:59,782 --> 00:56:02,238
What do you reckon
eight lost years is worth?

599
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:04,734
Could a court fix a value on that?

600
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:06,905
Stick to the point.
How much?

601
00:56:06,998 --> 00:56:09,405
That's too simple.

602
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,667
I like to put values on things.

603
00:56:12,754 --> 00:56:15,209
Like the value of eight years...

604
00:56:15,298 --> 00:56:18,050
the value of a family.

605
00:56:18,134 --> 00:56:21,005
Interesting calculations,
wouldn't you say, Counselor?

606
00:56:23,014 --> 00:56:25,849
You're right to pass that stuff up.
A man told me it was bad for you.

607
00:56:25,934 --> 00:56:29,848
Hey, buster, my friend would like
to buy me another drink.

608
00:56:32,733 --> 00:56:35,769
Ten thousand dollars now and another
ten thousand over the next two years...

609
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:38,186
providing you keep out
of the state.

610
00:56:39,448 --> 00:56:41,524
Suppose I come back
after the money runs out?

611
00:56:41,617 --> 00:56:45,531
I'll give you a simple answer
to that one: I'll kill you off.

612
00:56:47,706 --> 00:56:50,992
Well, let me see.
Twenty grand...

613
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:53,955
That's less than 3,000 per
for my eight years.

614
00:56:54,046 --> 00:56:57,047
Counselor, I don't believe you've
heard of the Minimum Wage Act.

615
00:56:59,176 --> 00:57:02,012
Now, just for fun...

616
00:57:02,096 --> 00:57:06,176
let's go back to talkin' about values...
the value of a family.

617
00:57:06,267 --> 00:57:09,304
You probably didn't even know
I had a family, did you?

618
00:57:09,395 --> 00:57:12,764
One wife and one kid.
That's what I had when you sent me up.

619
00:57:12,857 --> 00:57:15,313
She dumped me.
Never even visited.

620
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:18,486
- I signed the divorce papers.
- What did you expect?

621
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:21,489
Oh, no, it wasn't that. It was
the prison rap that she couldn't take.

622
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:23,781
She couldn't stand the disgrace...

623
00:57:23,868 --> 00:57:26,953
and that was your doing,
not my doing!

624
00:57:28,582 --> 00:57:32,330
She married a plumber.
They wound up with a litter of kids.

625
00:57:32,419 --> 00:57:35,503
My own kid doesn't even know me.

626
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:38,673
So when I got out,
I went to visit her.

627
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:42,543
The plumber was off plumbin' someplace
and the kids were all in school.

628
00:57:42,638 --> 00:57:46,007
She picked up a poker, tried
to hit me over the head with it.

629
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,932
I took it away from her and calmed
her down. She crawled in the car.

630
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,520
I took her 50 miles
down the road...

631
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:58,732
- Why tell me all this?
- Because I want to tell you all this.

632
00:57:58,821 --> 00:58:01,905
That night, I made her call up
the plumber and tell him...

633
00:58:01,991 --> 00:58:05,490
she was takin' a little vacation
from him and the kids.

634
00:58:05,578 --> 00:58:08,365
Then I made her sit down
and write me a love note...

635
00:58:08,456 --> 00:58:11,374
askin' me to invite her
on a second honeymoon.

636
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:14,033
She dated it and signed it.

637
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:16,501
I made her write
a lot of dirty words.

638
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:19,080
Then I occupied her time
for three days.

639
00:58:19,175 --> 00:58:22,011
- You beginning to get the picture?
- I'm getting it.

640
00:58:22,095 --> 00:58:23,922
Good.

641
00:58:24,014 --> 00:58:26,849
Then I told her that if she ever
blew the whistle on me...

642
00:58:26,933 --> 00:58:31,061
I was gonna mail a Photostat
of that note to the plumber.

643
00:58:31,146 --> 00:58:33,933
I pumped another quart
of whisky into her...

644
00:58:34,024 --> 00:58:37,025
threw away her dress, threw away her
shoes and gave her a fair chance...

645
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:39,186
to work her way home.

646
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:42,648
Charming story.
What is it supposed to prove?

647
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:47,576
Counselor, for a bright fellow...

648
00:58:47,663 --> 00:58:50,450
you sure are slow
gettin' the picture sometimes.

649
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:55,167
You see, I burned for eight years.

650
00:58:55,254 --> 00:58:57,745
Now I've got what you might call
"peace of mind"...

651
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,833
about my dear, darlin' wife.

652
00:59:03,346 --> 00:59:06,466
So no deal.

653
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:10,092
You're gettin' warm, Counselor.

654
00:59:10,186 --> 00:59:12,760
You know,
when I was in the bucket...

655
00:59:12,855 --> 00:59:17,683
all I could think about was
bustin' out and killin' somebody.

656
00:59:17,777 --> 00:59:22,320
I wanted to kill him
with my bare hands, slow.

657
00:59:23,491 --> 00:59:27,655
Every single night for seven years,
I killed that man.

658
00:59:28,955 --> 00:59:31,114
And on the eighth year,
I said, "Oh, no.

659
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:34,162
That's too easy.
That's too fast."

660
00:59:34,252 --> 00:59:37,170
You know the Chinese death
of a thousand cuts?

661
00:59:38,173 --> 00:59:40,249
They cut off a little toe...

662
00:59:40,342 --> 00:59:42,548
then a piece of your finger,
your ear, your nose.

663
00:59:42,636 --> 00:59:44,795
I liked that better.

664
00:59:46,682 --> 00:59:50,976
By the little toe, I'm to understand
"child." That's it, isn't it?

665
00:59:51,061 --> 00:59:54,181
That's your train of thought,
Counselor, not mine.

666
00:59:54,273 --> 00:59:56,729
My train of thought.

667
00:59:59,695 --> 01:00:01,439
Shocking degenerate.

668
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:05,735
I've seen the worst, the dregs...

669
01:00:05,827 --> 01:00:07,985
but you...

670
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,404
You are the lowest.

671
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:14,871
It makes me sick
to breathe the same air.

672
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:20,085
Hey, buster.

673
01:00:20,175 --> 01:00:23,875
My cousin left me enough
to buy me another blast.

674
01:00:35,273 --> 01:00:38,725
This is no war of nerves.
He won't be bought off.

675
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:44,529
It's Nancy he's after.

676
01:00:46,994 --> 01:00:49,746
And he'll get to her
sooner or later...

677
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,953
unless I change his mind.

678
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:59,042
I just won't believe it.
I just can't.

679
01:00:59,131 --> 01:01:01,836
You said yourself,
he's too clever to take chances.

680
01:01:01,926 --> 01:01:04,298
How could he even touch her
without taking a chance?

681
01:01:07,223 --> 01:01:12,384
What would you do
if she were attacked?

682
01:01:13,396 --> 01:01:15,721
- Have him arrested?
- How can you ask such a thing?

683
01:01:15,815 --> 01:01:18,900
Of course!
What's the matter with you?

684
01:01:18,985 --> 01:01:22,853
Would you have him tried?
Pull him into court?

685
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:26,857
Naturally, he'd deny
the whole thing.

686
01:01:28,328 --> 01:01:31,412
That means that Nancy
would have to testify.

687
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:36,668
You've never watched a child
testify in such a case.

688
01:01:37,713 --> 01:01:40,334
Thank God you haven't.

689
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:49,097
It's the clinical reports...

690
01:01:50,267 --> 01:01:52,474
and the questions...

691
01:01:54,355 --> 01:01:57,190
and the detailed answers
that she'd have to give.

692
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:01,934
She'd have to give them,
all right...

693
01:02:02,029 --> 01:02:05,149
because he'd deny it,
and we'd have to prove his guilt.

694
01:02:06,617 --> 01:02:09,618
A beast like that...
Who'd believe him?

695
01:02:09,704 --> 01:02:11,613
No one.
No one at all!

696
01:02:11,706 --> 01:02:15,075
But that wouldn't
spare her the questions.

697
01:02:15,168 --> 01:02:17,125
And Cady knows that.

698
01:02:17,879 --> 01:02:19,457
He knows...

699
01:02:19,547 --> 01:02:22,121
that we'd never put her
through an ordeal like that.

700
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:30,298
There's got to be something we can do.
There just has to be.

701
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,220
There is.

702
01:02:36,898 --> 01:02:38,606
There is.

703
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:39,705
Well, is this Mrs. Bowden?

704
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:43,415
Yeah, I knew it was.
I just wanted to hear your voice again.

705
01:03:44,426 --> 01:03:45,837
<i>You know something?</i>

706
01:03:45,928 --> 01:03:49,463
For eight years I dreamed about
a chick with a voice like that...

707
01:03:49,556 --> 01:03:53,886
<i>just whisperin' in my ear,
real close...</i>

708
01:03:53,978 --> 01:03:55,935
Don't. Don't.

709
01:03:56,021 --> 01:03:57,681
Sayin', "Baby..."

710
01:03:59,734 --> 01:04:01,144
Sam!

711
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:11,366
Shut up, you!

712
01:04:11,454 --> 01:04:15,072
Counselor, you really stepped
on it this time, didn't you?

713
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:17,075
I don't know what
the Bar Association thinks...

714
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:19,077
about its members
compounding a felony...

715
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:22,420
but I do know
what the law thinks about it.

716
01:04:22,507 --> 01:04:25,080
You just put the law
in my hands...

717
01:04:25,176 --> 01:04:28,380
and I'm gonna break
your heart with it.

718
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:31,971
Ain't nothin' can stop me.
You understand that, don't you?

719
01:04:32,058 --> 01:04:34,300
That house and that car
and that wife and kid...

720
01:04:34,394 --> 01:04:36,636
they ain't worth nothin'
to you now.

721
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:41,107
Now you listen to me.
You asked for this.

722
01:04:41,193 --> 01:04:43,482
You asked for it,
and if you don't get out of...

723
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:47,354
<i>You're wrong, man. I'm gonna
show you what it's like to be wrong.</i>

724
01:04:48,367 --> 01:04:51,783
<i>Speakin' about
your wife and kid...</i>

725
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:54,872
I got a little caper
planned for them.

726
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:57,958
Remember the story
I told you about my old lady?

727
01:04:58,044 --> 01:05:01,662
That was just laughs, Counselor.
That was kid stuff.

728
01:05:01,756 --> 01:05:03,914
I got something planned
for your wife and kid...

729
01:05:04,008 --> 01:05:06,084
they ain't never gonna forget.

730
01:05:06,177 --> 01:05:10,175
They ain't never gonna forget it,
and neither will you, Counselor. Never.

731
01:05:11,182 --> 01:05:13,091
<i>You'll never forget it.</i>

732
01:05:17,355 --> 01:05:19,680
I can't believe we're...

733
01:05:19,774 --> 01:05:22,692
standing here talking about...

734
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:26,359
about killing a man.

735
01:05:26,448 --> 01:05:29,817
There's still a few ifs,
ands and buts about it.

736
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:33,243
I can't go into this alone.
I'll have to have help.

737
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:38,955
Of course, he wouldn't fall for it here.
He knows we're too much on our guard.

738
01:05:40,045 --> 01:05:43,248
But if he got the idea...

739
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:46,009
that we thought she was
safely hidden away someplace...

740
01:05:46,093 --> 01:05:47,552
"She"?

741
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,255
You can't be talking about Nancy.

742
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:53,258
Don't worry.

743
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,972
I won't go into this
until it's airtight.

744
01:05:56,061 --> 01:05:58,184
I won't make a move that
will put her in any danger.

745
01:05:58,272 --> 01:06:02,270
That won't stop the terror of it.
She's only a child.

746
01:06:08,282 --> 01:06:12,114
And what about the terror
if he catches her really alone?

747
01:06:21,171 --> 01:06:23,080
- Sam.
- Good morning, Dave.

748
01:06:23,173 --> 01:06:25,711
Sleep well last night?

749
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,627
Well enough.

750
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:29,759
You needn't bother to open that.

751
01:06:29,846 --> 01:06:31,922
You've tried your last case
in this state.

752
01:06:32,015 --> 01:06:34,387
Your three hired hands landed
in the hospital last night.

753
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:36,884
One of them thought he was gonna die,
and he talked.

754
01:06:36,979 --> 01:06:39,933
- Oh, the judge wants to see you.
- Good. I want to see him too.

755
01:06:40,023 --> 01:06:43,724
He's gonna tell you I'm instituting
disbarment proceedings against you.

756
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:48,362
- You didn't waste much time, did you?
- I'm just getting started.

757
01:06:48,449 --> 01:06:50,940
The committee on ethics is meeting
up at the State Capitol right now.

758
01:06:51,035 --> 01:06:54,902
They work real fast. Better have your
story ready to tell 'em by tomorrow.

759
01:06:54,997 --> 01:06:57,784
You don't think the committee will wait
to see if I'm convicted of anything?

760
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:01,707
The committee is interested in keeping
the legal profession beyond reproach.

761
01:07:01,796 --> 01:07:06,339
After last night, I'm real interested
to see how you answer to that one.

762
01:07:11,597 --> 01:07:13,756
- Good morning, George.
- Good morning, Sam.

763
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:17,468
I only came down to tell you that
I have to turn the case over to you.

764
01:07:17,562 --> 01:07:19,685
I'll break the news
to the judge.

765
01:07:35,288 --> 01:07:37,614
Have you gone out of your mind?

766
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:40,281
You've come to the wrong man.

767
01:07:40,377 --> 01:07:43,828
Dave Grafton was here ten minutes ago.
You haven't got a leg to stand on.

768
01:07:43,922 --> 01:07:46,378
Jepson's in there being interrogated.

769
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:48,874
If he talks, I'm gonna have to arrest
you before you leave the building.

770
01:07:48,969 --> 01:07:51,674
If I'm arrested, who's gonna
protect my family? You?

771
01:07:51,764 --> 01:07:54,551
That's below the belt, Sam.
Grafton's watchin' every move I make.

772
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:57,049
The only answer to Dave Grafton,
the ethics committee...

773
01:07:57,144 --> 01:07:59,600
and all the rest of it
is to show Cady up for what he is.

774
01:07:59,689 --> 01:08:03,936
You can't do it with a stake-out!
Cady's too smart for that!

775
01:08:04,026 --> 01:08:06,482
But I've got it
carefully worked out.

776
01:08:06,571 --> 01:08:09,737
There's a houseboat.
It's up on the Cape Fear River.

777
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:13,442
It has a shore cabin, a telephone.
It's isolated, hard to find.

778
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:16,905
- The perfect place to hide my family.
- No place is perfect!

779
01:08:16,998 --> 01:08:19,999
Do you expect Cady to believe that
you'd leave your family alone anywhere?

780
01:08:20,084 --> 01:08:22,243
That's the one thing
that had me stumped.

781
01:08:22,337 --> 01:08:24,128
And this morning...

782
01:08:24,214 --> 01:08:26,705
Grafton handed me the answer
on a platter.

783
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,923
He's forcing me to fly
to Atlanta tomorrow...

784
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:31,086
to appear before this committee.

785
01:08:31,179 --> 01:08:33,088
You can bet that
his friend, Mr. Cady...

786
01:08:33,181 --> 01:08:35,755
will be tailing me
clear to the airport.

787
01:08:35,851 --> 01:08:37,843
But the moment
I get to Atlanta...

788
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:40,474
I'll hire a car
and cut across to the coast.

789
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:42,473
I'll get a boat
at Hennessey's Landing.

790
01:08:42,566 --> 01:08:46,694
In a few hours, I'll be at
the houseboat with Peggy and Nancy...

791
01:08:46,779 --> 01:08:50,230
and Cady will think that
I'm sweating it out in Atlanta.

792
01:08:51,492 --> 01:08:55,157
The next step is to lure him up there
when we're ready for him.

793
01:08:55,246 --> 01:08:57,203
That's your department too.

794
01:08:57,289 --> 01:08:59,448
He knows you're tied in
with the case.

795
01:08:59,542 --> 01:09:01,867
He'll follow you when you leave town
if you make it look right.

796
01:09:01,961 --> 01:09:05,662
- He steps ashore and you shoot him?
- That's about it.

797
01:09:05,756 --> 01:09:09,042
You can't shoot a man for
simple trespass. Not any more.

798
01:09:09,135 --> 01:09:12,670
- Cady's built a good case against you.
- It'll be more than simple trespass.

799
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:15,681
But I won't wait until he wipes
the blood off his hands either.

800
01:09:15,767 --> 01:09:18,055
Now hold on.
Just hold on.

801
01:09:18,144 --> 01:09:20,718
I've listened.
Now you listen.

802
01:09:20,814 --> 01:09:23,684
You're gonna do a foolish thing without
help, and you're gonna need lots of it.

803
01:09:23,775 --> 01:09:25,851
Now, I can't help you
if I wanted to.

804
01:09:25,944 --> 01:09:28,731
That's county territory.

805
01:09:28,822 --> 01:09:32,689
You know the sheriff. Are you gonna
stand on ceremony at a time like this?

806
01:09:32,784 --> 01:09:34,907
All you have to do
is pick up the telephone!

807
01:09:34,995 --> 01:09:38,446
And do what? Ask for half a dozen
deputies to help a man I should arrest?

808
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,449
I don't want
half a dozen deputies.

809
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:43,413
That would be a sure way
of tipping off Cady and Grafton.

810
01:09:43,504 --> 01:09:46,374
It'd be all over town
in no time.

811
01:09:46,465 --> 01:09:50,545
One is all I can risk.
One is all I'm asking for.

812
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:52,545
Do I get him?

813
01:09:57,435 --> 01:10:01,895
Well, this time next week,
I may be back poundin' a beat.

814
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:38,848
We should've gone to the left
of this island, about a mile back.

815
01:11:05,796 --> 01:11:10,043
Are we gonna be completely marooned?
No visitors at all?

816
01:11:10,134 --> 01:11:13,420
- You didn't say anything to Betty?
- I didn't say anything to a soul.

817
01:11:13,513 --> 01:11:17,593
Have a nice voyage
to nowhere.

818
01:11:17,684 --> 01:11:21,349
- I'll see you in a day or two.
- Don't get lost on the way home.

819
01:11:37,746 --> 01:11:41,910
Do you think she'll be able to stand
all this shattering peace and quiet?

820
01:11:44,211 --> 01:11:46,619
Don't you worry about Nancy.

821
01:11:46,713 --> 01:11:48,623
That's pioneer stock.

822
01:12:07,652 --> 01:12:09,062
Cast off.

823
01:12:29,758 --> 01:12:34,135
<i>Flight 403 for Atlanta
now boarding at gate three.</i>

824
01:12:34,221 --> 01:12:36,463
<i>Attention, please.
Passengers for Atlanta...</i>

825
01:12:36,556 --> 01:12:39,178
<i>flight 403 now boarding
at gate three.</i>

826
01:12:59,371 --> 01:13:03,665
- I have a brief here for Sam Bowden.
- Yes, sir.

827
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:05,909
Was he on that flight 403?

828
01:13:08,005 --> 01:13:10,793
Yes, sir, he was.

829
01:13:10,883 --> 01:13:13,339
Now I don't know whether
to mail it to him or not.

830
01:13:13,428 --> 01:13:16,464
You don't have any idea
when he'll be back, do you?

831
01:13:16,556 --> 01:13:18,548
Let's see.

832
01:13:19,893 --> 01:13:21,969
He did make a return
reservation, sir.

833
01:13:22,061 --> 01:13:27,187
- 6:00 p.m. On Thursday.
- Then I guess special delivery will do.

834
01:13:27,275 --> 01:13:29,232
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

835
01:13:52,718 --> 01:13:57,594
- It's just a log bumping.
- No, not that. Listen.

836
01:14:00,142 --> 01:14:02,016
It's a boat.

837
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:05,346
There are bound to be boats.

838
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,515
We didn't hear any last night.

839
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:11,603
It's coming closer.

840
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:51,456
- Peg! Nancy!
- It's Daddy!

841
01:15:53,175 --> 01:15:55,132
Darling, thank God it's you!

842
01:15:55,219 --> 01:15:57,627
Daddy!

843
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:00,047
This is Mr. Kersek,
of the sheriff's office.

844
01:16:00,141 --> 01:16:02,050
- How do you do?
- Hello. Come on in.

845
01:16:05,688 --> 01:16:08,808
Don't you think it's about time
you were getting ready for bed?

846
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,809
Where am I going to sleep?

847
01:16:10,902 --> 01:16:16,323
Here, with your mother.
Mr. Kersek and I will sleep on shore.

848
01:16:16,407 --> 01:16:19,444
- Won't you have some more coffee?
- Don't mind if I do.

849
01:16:22,038 --> 01:16:25,039
- Will you excuse us for a few minutes?
- Sure thing.

850
01:16:40,724 --> 01:16:43,559
So far so good.

851
01:16:43,644 --> 01:16:45,601
We're all here.

852
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:50,266
Cady thinks I'm in Atlanta.

853
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,117
You can still say no
if you want to, Peg.

854
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:08,410
Nothing will start...

855
01:17:08,502 --> 01:17:10,661
unless I call Charlie Sievers.

856
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:20,924
Call him.

857
01:17:28,314 --> 01:17:31,766
I tailed him
until he spotted me, Mr. Bowden.

858
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,936
Then he checked to see
your car was home...

859
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:36,567
and Mrs. Bowden's car was gone.

860
01:17:36,656 --> 01:17:39,029
Looked at the mail in the box
but didn't take any.

861
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:41,406
<i>Then he tried the boat basin.</i>

862
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,653
<i>Tony told him your boat
hadn't been out all week.</i>

863
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:48,745
But for the rest, well,
I guess we've missed so far.

864
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:51,505
Because if he's been tailing me,
I haven't been able to spot him.

865
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:57,093
I still think he will.
You're the only lead he has.

866
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:02,008
<i>- Start things moving tomorrow.
- Right.</i>

867
01:19:34,778 --> 01:19:38,692
- Yes?
- Looks like we're striking out.

868
01:19:38,782 --> 01:19:41,024
I'm on 257,
halfway to Cross's Landing...

869
01:19:41,118 --> 01:19:43,075
and absolutely no sign of him.

870
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:45,617
<i>Do you want me to keep comin'
or go back and try it again?</i>

871
01:19:45,706 --> 01:19:47,615
Could he have switched cars?

872
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:51,373
Sure, he could have switched cars, but
I've been keeping my eye on the drivers.

873
01:19:51,462 --> 01:19:55,874
<i>- What do you say?
- If he hasn't been following you...</i>

874
01:19:55,966 --> 01:19:58,208
trying it again won't work either.

875
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:02,670
<i>- Come ahead.
- Okay.</i>

876
01:20:07,395 --> 01:20:10,230
- Seven to nothing.
- Temporarily. Only temporarily.

877
01:20:33,296 --> 01:20:37,875
All them islands look alike.
Just follow this and you can't miss it.

878
01:20:37,968 --> 01:20:40,044
Okay. Thanks.

879
01:28:57,731 --> 01:29:01,776
You're gonna die
without a mark on you.

880
01:29:01,861 --> 01:29:04,778
Just got too big
for your pants.

881
01:29:44,738 --> 01:29:46,197
Kersek!

882
01:30:50,097 --> 01:30:52,006
Tell the operator
to call the sheriff's office!

883
01:30:52,099 --> 01:30:54,138
Send some men out here fast!

884
01:31:49,116 --> 01:31:51,025
Aw, now, come on.

885
01:31:52,244 --> 01:31:54,201
You ain't that scared.

886
01:31:55,289 --> 01:31:58,705
You come right down to it,
what is there to be scared of?

887
01:32:00,044 --> 01:32:02,582
Look, you're not a foolish man.
You're very clever.

888
01:32:02,671 --> 01:32:05,423
You never make mistakes.
You don't take chances.

889
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:08,917
If you touch me,
you'll go back to prison for life.

890
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:11,549
- Want to make a bet on that?
- But you will! I'm not like Nancy!

891
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:15,174
I'm not afraid to testify! I swear it!
Believe me! I'm not afraid!

892
01:32:15,268 --> 01:32:17,177
And you're a lawyer's wife?

893
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:19,891
Don't you understand?

894
01:32:23,693 --> 01:32:28,688
With consent,
there ain't no charges against me.

895
01:32:29,908 --> 01:32:31,318
Now, look...

896
01:32:34,496 --> 01:32:37,034
I want you to hear this.

897
01:32:37,123 --> 01:32:40,492
It's gonna save a lot
of messin' around.

898
01:32:40,585 --> 01:32:42,044
Look!

899
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:46,204
I was gonna go for Nancy...

900
01:32:46,299 --> 01:32:48,873
but I can always
make it with Nancy.

901
01:32:48,969 --> 01:32:51,294
You know, next week, next month.

902
01:32:52,389 --> 01:32:54,298
Wait a minute now.

903
01:32:54,391 --> 01:32:56,716
You proposition me.

904
01:32:56,810 --> 01:33:00,594
You, instead of Nancy...

905
01:33:00,689 --> 01:33:03,607
and I'll agree
never to see you again.

906
01:33:03,692 --> 01:33:07,192
Unless of course you want it.

907
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:09,901
And that's how
you give your consent.

908
01:33:09,991 --> 01:33:12,114
That's not consent,
it's blackmail!

909
01:33:16,873 --> 01:33:20,870
Reasons don't make any difference.
You look that up.

910
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,878
And as far as blackmail
is concerned...

911
01:33:23,963 --> 01:33:27,297
you only think
I'm going after Nancy.

912
01:33:28,384 --> 01:33:30,294
Come over here!

913
01:33:32,305 --> 01:33:35,721
You're just playing it safe.

914
01:33:35,809 --> 01:33:39,178
Now, your husband
is gonna appreciate...

915
01:33:39,271 --> 01:33:42,971
your noble gesture.

916
01:33:43,066 --> 01:33:47,111
But he ain't never
gonna forget it!

917
01:33:48,697 --> 01:33:50,737
Please! Please!

918
01:33:55,412 --> 01:33:59,161
So, all in all,
I don't think...

919
01:34:01,377 --> 01:34:03,416
I don't think you're gonna...

920
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:08,335
you're gonna say too much
about this, are ya?

921
01:34:08,426 --> 01:34:10,502
You're not gonna talk about it,
are ya?

922
01:34:10,594 --> 01:34:13,086
Are you?

923
01:35:07,486 --> 01:35:09,313
No! No!

924
01:35:25,296 --> 01:35:28,997
It's Nancy! He only wanted
to get you away from her!

925
01:35:29,092 --> 01:35:31,250
It's Nancy!

926
01:35:33,596 --> 01:35:35,388
Operator!

927
01:35:47,569 --> 01:35:50,689
He's here. He's here!

928
01:39:59,328 --> 01:40:02,163
Nancy, get out of here.
Run and hide.

929
01:40:02,247 --> 01:40:04,370
Run and hide! Run!

930
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:16,466
Hide! Hide! Run! Hide!

931
01:43:28,167 --> 01:43:30,041
Go ahead.

932
01:43:31,671 --> 01:43:33,913
Go ahead.
I just don't give a damn.

933
01:43:42,557 --> 01:43:45,392
No. No!

934
01:43:48,271 --> 01:43:53,230
That would be letting you off
too easy, too fast.

935
01:43:53,318 --> 01:43:55,607
Your words.
Do you remember?

936
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:58,187
Well, I do!

937
01:43:58,282 --> 01:43:59,693
Oh, no.

938
01:44:01,326 --> 01:44:04,114
We're gonna take
good care of you.

939
01:44:05,581 --> 01:44:07,490
We're gonna nurse you
back to health.

940
01:44:07,583 --> 01:44:09,955
And you're strong, Cady.

941
01:44:11,128 --> 01:44:14,747
You're gonna live a long life
in a cage.

942
01:44:15,841 --> 01:44:17,799
That's where you belong.

943
01:44:19,303 --> 01:44:22,138
And that's where you're going.

944
01:44:25,685 --> 01:44:28,556
And this time, for life!

945
01:44:28,646 --> 01:44:30,805
Bang your head
against the walls!

946
01:44:30,899 --> 01:44:36,771
Count the years,
the months, the hours...

947
01:44:36,863 --> 01:44:40,030
until the day you rot.
