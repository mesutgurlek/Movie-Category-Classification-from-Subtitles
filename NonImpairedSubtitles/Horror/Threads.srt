154
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:13,974

155
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:18,854

<i> The unprovoked attack</i>

158
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:28,815
<i>are the actions</i>
<i>of a reckless and warlike power.</i>

159
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:32,419

<i>there is already</i>
<i>a designated wartime controller.</i>

168
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:02,415
<i>He's the city's peacetime chief executive.</i>

169

<i>If it should suddenly become necessary,</i>

170
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:08,100
<i>he can be given</i>
<i>full powers of internal government.</i>

171
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:12,223
<i>When, or if, this happens</i>
<i>depends on the crisis itself.</i>

172
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:24,334
<i> The United States</i>

173

<i>to take action to safeguard</i>

174
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:29,653
<i>what it believes are legitimate</i>
<i>Western interests in the Middle East.</i>

175

<i>This administration</i>
<i>has therefore resolved</i>

176
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:36,497
<i>to send units of its rapid deployment</i>
<i>force, the US Central Command,</i>

177
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,575
<i>into western Iran.</i>

178
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:42,657
<i>We are confident that the Soviet Union</i>
<i>will take note of our resolve</i>

179
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:47,340
<i>and will desist from</i>
<i>its present perilous course of action.</i>

180
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:20,297
<i> There's an important score</i>
<i>from the Hawthorns,</i>

181
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:24,013
<i>where West Brom have taken the lead</i>
<i>over Manchester United.</i>

182
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:26,664
<i>It's West Brom 1, Manchester United 0,</i>

183
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:29,338

You'd think it were Christmas.

198

What have we got?

199
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,700

Anyway, don't make a song and dance

<i>They say it's a temporary step</i>
<i>to help move troops to Europe.</i>

294
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,462
<i>Thousands are stranded</i>
<i>at Heathrow and Gatwick.</i>

295
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,416
<i>And the Royal Navy is to guard</i>
<i>the North Sea oil rigs.</i>

296
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:59,576
<i>The MOD says</i>
<i>it's a prudent precautionary measure.</i>

297
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:11,102
They are playing with, at best,
the destruction of life as we know it,

298
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:14,176
and at worst, total annihilation.

299
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:17,256
You cannot win a nuclear war.

300
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:26,576
Now, just suppose
the Russians win this war.

301
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:29,258
What exactly would they be winning?

302
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,380
What would they have conquered?

303
00:24:31,464 --> 00:24:33,216
Well, I'll tell you.

304
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:38,424
All major centers of population
and industry will have been destroyed.

305
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:41,576
What industry?
We ain't got no industry in Sheffield.

306
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:46,863
Yes, and if the money hadn't...

307
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:50,937
If the money hadn't been spent on
nuclear weapons, you'd have industry.

308
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:54,096
Get back to bloody Russia!

309
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:57,374
Where's your red flag?

310
00:24:57,464 --> 00:25:02,333
We'd have put money into welfare,
found alternative sources of energy.

311
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:04,335
Industry...

312
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:10,096
Industry will have been destroyed,
oil refineries will have been destroyed,

313
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:14,416
all our water will have been polluted,
the soil will have been irradiated,

314
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:17,621
farm stock will be dead,
diseased or dying.

315
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:21,902
The Russians would have conquered
a corpse of a country.

316
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:24,214
Let us pray.

317
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:33,016
Our Father who art in heaven,

318
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:35,095
hallowed be thy name.

319
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:37,140
Thy kingdom come...

320

<i>This morning the Foreign Secretary said</i>
<i>he had no definite news to report</i>

325
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:52,782

<i>speculate without any hard information.</i>

326
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:09,497

<i>sugar and other storable items,</i>

327
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:12,223

332
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,383
40p?! That's scandalous.

333
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:30,420
They were only 26p last week.

334
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:32,938
Shop somewhere else
if you're not satisfied.

335
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:36,414
There's a national emergency
and you're lining your pockets.

336
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:39,655
Nobody's forcing you to buy 'em.
Put 'em back on t'shelves.

337
00:27:39,744 --> 00:27:43,293
Yes, I will. I'd sooner starve first.
Excuse me, love.

- They've started fighting, Mum.
- Who has?

00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:50,374
The Americans and the Russians.
It's just been on the news.

340

My dad says
you've got to come home now.

- Are you all right, love?
- It's noisy.

353

No, we're going to our Jack's in
Lincolnshire while things get sorted out.

359
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:01,699
We should be safer over there.

360
00:30:01,784 --> 00:30:05,857
Carol, stop messing about.
Come inside and do something to help.

361
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:08,174
We'll not be safe anywhere,
as far as I see.

362
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:12,701
I don't know. We've a better chance
of surviving in t'country, haven't we?

363
00:30:12,784 --> 00:30:16,823
Where our Jack lives
there's only a row of houses and a pub.

364
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:18,860
I don't think they're gonna bomb that.

365
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:21,663

- Mum!

- Carol!
- Have you turned that gas off?

- Spot! I'm coming.

I can't find our Spot.

370
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:35,616
He was here a minute ago.
Have you looked inside?

371
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:38,935
I've looked upstairs,
along t'street, next door's garden.

372
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:41,140
It's ridiculous, all this. Spot?

00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:56,859
Sutton here.

439
00:35:56,944 --> 00:35:58,935
<i> Unconfirmed reports...</i>

440
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,980
Yes, in half an hour's time.

441
00:36:01,064 --> 00:36:05,057
I should be going off now, if I were you.
The roads will be getting busy.

442
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:10,138
Well, use your common sense, man.
How should I know?

443
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:12,180
Marjorie, leave that.

444
00:36:13,264 --> 00:36:15,220
I'll ring you later.

445
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,982
What?

446
00:36:20,984 --> 00:36:23,623
Yes. Yes.

447
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:29,494
It is imperative,
while there is still time left,

448
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:32,417
that the TUC call a general strike

449
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:36,656
in protest against this disaster
which faces us all.

450
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:46,053
- That's what'll destroy this country!
- There is still time to avert disaster

451
00:36:46,144 --> 00:36:51,377
if we act resolutely and show
both the Russians and the Americans

452
00:36:51,464 --> 00:36:56,299
that we will have no truck
with their warmongering.

453
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:59,740
- What about the Falklands?
- What about the Falklands?

454
00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:02,179
There's nobody more patriotic than I am.

455
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:04,824
I've been trying to get us
out of the Common Market.

456
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,900
But first...

457
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:17,293
Please do not play into their hands.

458
00:37:17,384 --> 00:37:20,137
This is a peaceful demonstration.

459
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:24,297
We are exercising
our right of free speech.

460
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:29,014
The police have no right
to stop this demonstration.

461
00:37:29,104 --> 00:37:31,777
Do not play into their hands.

462
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:33,980
You have no...

463
00:37:40,704 --> 00:37:45,300
Tin openers! £1.50 a go.
Come on, all of you.

464
00:37:45,384 --> 00:37:47,818
£1.50 could save your life!

465
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,984
- Morning, Clive.
- Morning, Alan. What's it like?

466
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:25,500
- It's a bit primitive. Take a look.
- We'll get it organized.

467
00:38:27,464 --> 00:38:29,420
Where the hell is everybody?

468
00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:32,382
- You know Steve, Information Officer?
- Where are they?

469
00:38:32,464 --> 00:38:35,297
- Jeff's car's broken down.
- That's no good, is it?

470
00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:37,136
- How many missing?
- About ten.

471
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:39,692
Get on the phone.
I want 'em here immediately.

472
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,173
- Which is my desk?
- Straight through.

473
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:44,494
Mind your head.

474
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:46,700
No sign of the Emergency Committee.

475
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,093
You know
what those councilors are like.

476
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:53,143
- They're not getting paid for this.
- This is the best I could do.

477
00:38:53,224 --> 00:38:55,260
Dr. Talbot, Regional Health Authority.

478
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:57,858
- How are things going?
- We're doing our best.

479
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:03,382
<i> Emergency headquarters</i>

489

<i>If you leave your home,</i>

490

<i>and if you move,</i>
<i>the authorities in the new place</i>

492

<i>in polythene, paper, sheets or blankets.</i>

498
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:30,898

<i>in the house for more than five days</i>

499
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:34,181
<i>and if it is safe to go outside,</i>

500
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:37,222

<i>for the time being in a trench</i>

501
00:41:37,304 --> 00:41:41,013
<i>or cover it with earth</i>

502
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,896
<i>Here are some ideas</i>
<i>for making your inner refuge.</i>

503
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:08,301
<i>One: make a lean-to</i>
<i>with sloping doors or strong boards</i>

504
00:42:08,384 --> 00:42:10,340
<i>rested against an inner wall.</i>

505
00:42:10,424 --> 00:42:15,657
- You all right, love?
- I've just been sick again.

506
00:42:17,624 --> 00:42:21,822
Oh, I feel awful.
I think I'll go back to bed.

507
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:25,374
Don't worry about it, love.
It'll only last for a week or two.

508
00:42:25,464 --> 00:42:27,420
No.

509
00:42:31,944 --> 00:42:34,583
I'll ring work and tell them
you're not coming in.

510
00:42:34,664 --> 00:42:37,736
If anybody's there.
There were only one or two yesterday.

511
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:42,500
It's worse than before.
I can't get anything now.

512
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:45,580
The line's dead.

513
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:54,740
We ought to be getting the rest
of the things out of the cellar now.

Hello, County. This is Sheffield District.
Testing, one, two, three, four.

521
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,419
Please report my signal. Over.

522
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:31,577
Whose responsibility is it?
We've all got families.

523
00:43:31,664 --> 00:43:34,895
Look, just get down here.
There's nine other people.

524
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:37,578
I've got a serious public order problem.

525
00:43:37,664 --> 00:43:41,100
I need at least an extra six PSUs.

526
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:43,140
Yeah, but when?

527
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:46,853
Look, I'm using traffic wardens already.

528
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:50,175
<i> Many of these officers</i>

<i>and almost all are unsure</i>

531
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:02,893
I ought to take this one off as well.

532
00:44:02,984 --> 00:44:06,135
It'll get scratched to pieces.
It's only just been painted.

533
00:44:06,224 --> 00:44:10,217
- Better than getting blown to pieces.
- Shall I go to school, Mum?

534
00:44:10,304 --> 00:44:14,343
What did it say on t'telly? I can't
remember if it said schools were closed.

535
00:44:14,424 --> 00:44:17,541
It said on the news we're to stay at home.

536
00:44:17,624 --> 00:44:19,580
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

537
00:44:19,664 --> 00:44:22,132
- They're sending notes out.
- Is there time?

538
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:24,977
Great. I had a history test this morning.

539
00:44:25,064 --> 00:44:28,374
Alison, go to Kirby's
and see if they've got any food left.

540
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:32,139
- Like what?
- Anything. Bring what you can.

541
00:44:32,224 --> 00:44:35,216
- Take my purse.
- Dad, you gonna build one of these?

542
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:36,657
Over my dead body.

543
00:44:36,744 --> 00:44:41,181
I want to know something more definite
before we rip this place to pieces.

544
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:43,698
- Can I help you?
- Here. Hold that.

545
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:47,936
We'll be able to sleep in it.
It'll be like going camping.

546

<i> The most widespread danger</i>
<i>is fall-out.</i>

547
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:56,856
<i>Fall-out is dust that is sucked up</i>
<i>from the ground by the explosion.</i>

548
00:44:58,384 --> 00:45:00,340
<i>Fall-out can kill.</i>

but we've got the warehouses
controlled by the police.

556
00:45:31,704 --> 00:45:36,619
As yet we haven't located all the
root vegetable clumps on local farms,

557
00:45:36,704 --> 00:45:39,502
but stocks of sugar,
wheat, flour and rice...

558

<i> Attack warning. Attack warning.</i>

559
00:45:44,104 --> 00:45:46,618

- It's for bloody real.

560
00:45:46,704 --> 00:45:49,298
Get to your stations.

561
00:45:49,384 --> 00:45:51,295
Get that generator going!

562
00:45:51,384 --> 00:45:53,340
Lock the doors.

563
00:45:53,424 --> 00:45:58,100
As soon as you can, every scrap
of information you've got on casualties.

564
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:05,498
- Get your heads down.
- We can't sell you any timber.

565
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:07,620
It's a joinery, not a timber yard.

566
00:46:07,704 --> 00:46:11,299
You can't just have a piece of that.

567
00:46:14,664 --> 00:46:16,620
Come on, quick. Get down.

568
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:03,180
- These have gone. Everything's dead.
- What about t'tellies?

569
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:07,143
- Why didn't you pull the aerial out?
- Get the standbys working.

570
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,498
Come on.

571
00:47:26,864 --> 00:47:27,899
Bloody hell.

572
00:47:29,144 --> 00:47:31,817
Hold on, Gordon. You're going too fast.

573
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:05,223
Come on! That might just be t'start of it.

574
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:15,214
Jesus Christ, they've done it.

575
00:48:19,184 --> 00:48:21,140
They've done it.

576
00:48:23,264 --> 00:48:27,223
- Where are you going?
- To find Ruth. See if she's all right.

577
00:48:30,224 --> 00:48:32,180
Oh, shit.

578
00:48:41,024 --> 00:48:45,939
- Come on. Move it inside.
- What about all these?

579
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,094
Get the mattress on the bottom.

580
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:50,903
That's right. Put it down there.

581
00:48:50,984 --> 00:48:53,544
Where's our Alison?

582
00:48:53,624 --> 00:48:58,220
- This one's on Finningley.
- A brown burst.

583
00:48:58,304 --> 00:49:01,137
- Four-three.
- What was the other power station?

584
00:49:01,224 --> 00:49:04,614
Hang on.
There's something on the airport, I think.

585
00:49:16,264 --> 00:49:20,223
Shine the torch further down.

586
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:23,341
Ruth, come down here
and give us a hand.

587
00:49:23,424 --> 00:49:26,382
Ruth, come and help
your grandma!

588
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,659
Ruth, please!

589
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:35,975
It'll be all right.

590
00:49:37,064 --> 00:49:39,294
Come on. All this stuff on.

591
00:49:39,384 --> 00:49:42,694
Put that on. Come on, then.

592
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:47,620
Ruth!

593
00:49:49,384 --> 00:49:52,217
Come on.

594
00:50:07,384 --> 00:50:09,340
Michael! Michael!

595
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:20,303
Take it easy. Don't hurry.

596
00:52:22,144 --> 00:52:25,102
Ah, that's the girl. Well done.

597
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,334
It won't be long now.

598
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,334
Well done, Gordon.
How long can you keep that going?

599
00:52:32,424 --> 00:52:36,053
- Two weeks if we're careful.
- First-aid kit, quickly.

600
00:52:36,144 --> 00:52:38,897
We've lost County again, I think.

601
00:52:38,984 --> 00:52:42,738
Aerials must have blown.
They were on the roof.

602
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:44,860
Switch the lights off when you get there.

603
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:47,412
Can we raise any districts? Radio amps?

604
00:52:47,504 --> 00:52:49,620
- Can we improvise an aerial?
- We'll try.

605
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:51,899
Let's do something quick.

606
00:52:53,224 --> 00:52:56,853
- Where's the first-aid kit?
- On this shelf at the back.

607
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:59,663
I've looked out here. I can't shift a thing.

608
00:53:01,824 --> 00:53:04,258
- How is he?
- I can't find the first-aid kit.

609
00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:07,654
Forget the first-aid kit. Bring me
something to cover him up with.

610
00:53:24,584 --> 00:53:27,257
- There.
- No!

611
00:53:27,344 --> 00:53:29,300
Leave me.

612
00:53:47,584 --> 00:53:49,540
Everybody all right?

613
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:53,940
Mother?

614
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:35,454
Jesus Christ, another one.

615
00:54:35,544 --> 00:54:37,739
This could go on for ever.

616
00:54:42,664 --> 00:54:44,620
It's Stocksbridge police.

617
00:54:45,464 --> 00:54:50,379
What about rescue?
Is there anything you can do? Over.

618
00:54:50,464 --> 00:54:54,457
Give me another bin liner.

619
00:54:54,544 --> 00:54:58,617
- What is your RADIAC reading?
- What about the depot?

620
00:54:58,704 --> 00:55:03,095
I repeat, what is your RADIAC reading?
Over.

621
00:55:03,184 --> 00:55:05,903
<i>- 100.</i>
- 100.

622
00:55:05,984 --> 00:55:09,818
It's too high.
You've got to get your men under cover.

623
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:18,102
Can you get us through to
the County Central Headquarters? Over.

624
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:21,620
Can you patch us through? Over.

625
00:55:21,704 --> 00:55:25,014
Stocksbridge, are you receiving me?
Over.

626
00:55:25,104 --> 00:55:28,016
- Green, I think.
- Have you heard anything from them?

627
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:32,700
Ask if they've got casualties.

628
00:55:32,784 --> 00:55:35,093
They've lost them.

629
00:55:36,144 --> 00:55:38,942
What about Hillsborough
and Stocksbridge?

630
00:55:39,024 --> 00:55:42,141
<i>Nothing from Hillsborough,</i>
<i>but Stocksbridge not too bad.</i>

631
00:55:42,224 --> 00:55:48,220
<i>- Windows blown in but not too bad.</i>
- That far out? Jesus Christ!

632
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:52,775
- Ask him where the last one was.
- Switch that thing off, Gordon.

633
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:58,415
<i> The first fall-out dust</i>
<i>settles on Sheffield.</i>

634
00:55:58,504 --> 00:56:01,337
<i>It's an hour and 25 minutes</i>
<i>after the attack.</i>

635
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,380
<i>An explosion on the ground at Crewe</i>

636
00:56:03,464 --> 00:56:06,262
<i>has sucked up this debris</i>
<i>and made it radioactive.</i>

637
00:56:06,344 --> 00:56:08,812
<i>The wind has blown it here.</i>

638
00:56:08,904 --> 00:56:12,579
<i>This level of attack has broken</i>
<i>most of the windows in Britain.</i>

639
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:14,620
<i>Many roofs are open to the sky.</i>

640
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,774
<i>Some of the lethal dust gets in.</i>

641
00:56:19,664 --> 00:56:23,134
<i>In these early stages,</i>
<i>the symptoms of radiation sickness</i>

642
00:56:23,224 --> 00:56:25,897
<i>and the symptoms of panic are identical.</i>

643
00:56:45,584 --> 00:56:47,859
You all right, Ruth?

644
00:56:48,944 --> 00:56:49,899
Ruth?

645
00:56:50,984 --> 00:56:54,533
I couldn't help it. It just came on.

646
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:57,297
Don't worry about it, love.

647
00:56:57,384 --> 00:56:59,375
It's not your fault. We've all got it.

648
00:56:59,464 --> 00:57:04,174
I know, but I'm so ashamed.
Messing the bed at my age.

649
00:57:04,264 --> 00:57:07,540
- It's the shock, isn't it?
- It's like being a little baby again.

650
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,899
Lie down.

651
00:57:09,984 --> 00:57:12,259
Come and help me clean Grandma.

652
00:57:12,344 --> 00:57:15,893
Ruth, be careful with that.
You don't know long it'll have to last us.

653
00:57:15,984 --> 00:57:19,738
Ruth, don't just sit there. Do something.

654
00:57:25,304 --> 00:57:27,818
Oh! Urgh!

655
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:39,178
Michael.
Michael... I've got to find him, Bill.

656
00:57:39,264 --> 00:57:44,054
You stop here
and I'll go and look for him.

657
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:47,773
You stop here.
I'll only be out a few minutes.

658
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:52,813
- Stop here, love.
- No, I've got to come. No.

659
00:57:52,904 --> 00:57:55,213
- Help me.
- All right.

660
00:57:58,664 --> 00:58:00,814
Oh, my God.

661
00:58:04,104 --> 00:58:05,776
Michael?

662
00:58:05,864 --> 00:58:07,820
Michael?

663
00:58:42,744 --> 00:58:45,178
We haven't heard from County HQ
for two days.

664
00:58:45,264 --> 00:58:49,382
Who the hell else have you tried?

665
00:58:49,464 --> 00:58:53,252
<i>- All of them, but nothing back yet.</i>
- Send another motorcycle.

666
00:58:53,344 --> 00:58:57,895
- There are no roads left.
- All the people here will be dead.

667
00:58:57,984 --> 00:59:03,536
Round here 50 per cent will be alive
but here they're as good as dead already.

668
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:05,854
They've probably received a lethal dose.

669
00:59:07,464 --> 00:59:10,183
- What about here?
- It'll be pretty heavy there.

670
00:59:10,264 --> 00:59:16,134
If the wind's still blowing from the
southwest it's in direct line from Crewe.

671
00:59:16,224 --> 00:59:20,581
800 rads, 1,000. Difficult to say.

672
00:59:20,664 --> 00:59:23,132
Depends what sort of cover they've built.

673
00:59:23,224 --> 00:59:26,580
If they've got a decent cellar
we'll get it on the radio.

674
00:59:33,384 --> 00:59:36,899
There's no way of getting anything out.
Listen.

675
00:59:36,984 --> 00:59:39,578
Yeah. Yes, I'll pass the message on.

676
00:59:40,904 --> 00:59:47,582
What am I expected to do?
I can't get anything out, can I?

677
00:59:47,664 --> 00:59:53,102
Listen. I've got a message
from Rivelin Valley police.

678
00:59:53,184 --> 00:59:56,301
They've managed to get through
to the works depot.

679
00:59:56,384 --> 01:00:00,377
They've got some vehicles on the road
but they're nearly out of fuel.

680
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:02,819
What the hell
have they been doing with it all?

681
01:00:02,904 --> 01:00:07,295
They didn't tell me. They want to know
where they can get some more.

682
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:10,581
- And they've got no food.
- Oh, God.

683
01:00:10,664 --> 01:00:12,939
- I've got...
- Let me get on with it, OK?

684
01:00:44,984 --> 01:00:47,862
Here you are, Mother.
Something to eat for you.

685
01:00:49,864 --> 01:00:52,537
Better leave her. The rest'll do her good.

686
01:00:52,624 --> 01:00:55,013
At least it won't go cold.

687
01:00:57,864 --> 01:01:00,537
Ruth.

688
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:02,580
Ruth, love.

689
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:05,736
Come on, love.
You'll have to eat something.

690
01:01:05,824 --> 01:01:08,861
But you'll have to, love.
It's not just you now, you know.

691
01:01:08,944 --> 01:01:11,856
The baby needs some food as well.
Come on.

692
01:01:11,944 --> 01:01:14,219
I don't care about this baby any more.

693
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:16,260
- Oh, Ruth.
- I wish it was dead.

694
01:01:16,344 --> 01:01:20,974
- Don't say things like that.
- There's no point with Jimmy dead.

695
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:24,579
- But you don't know.
- He is. He is. I know he is.

696
01:01:24,664 --> 01:01:26,222
You can't be certain.

697
01:01:26,304 --> 01:01:31,219
We're breathing in all this radiation
all the time.

698
01:01:31,304 --> 01:01:36,822
My baby. It will be ugly and deformed.

699
01:01:45,984 --> 01:01:50,774
Oh, Michael. Alison and Jimmy.

700
01:01:50,864 --> 01:01:54,254
All of them gone.

701
01:01:55,424 --> 01:01:59,258
Alison... Michael...

702
01:02:00,464 --> 01:02:05,174
- All dead.
- No. We don't know that.

703
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:07,778
They might be safe somewhere.

704
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:13,296
I wish I were dead. I wish it were me.

705
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:24,137
I wish I could swap places with him.

706
01:02:29,304 --> 01:02:31,340
Right. Let's get in.

707
01:02:31,424 --> 01:02:33,699
Watch that bloody water.

708
01:02:36,424 --> 01:02:38,460
How far does this go back?

709
01:02:38,544 --> 01:02:42,503
If four floors have come down
it could go back for yards and yards.

710
01:02:46,904 --> 01:02:48,940
Try it again, Gordon.

711
01:02:49,024 --> 01:02:53,176
Still nothing coming through.
It must be blocked further up.

712
01:02:54,384 --> 01:02:57,137
How much stuff
do you think's on top of us?

713
01:02:57,224 --> 01:02:58,577
<i>Most of t'town hall.</i>

714
01:02:58,664 --> 01:03:02,498
- When can you get to us?
<i>- I can't get t'lifting gear through.</i>

715
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:05,542
- What about the army?
<i>- There's no way through.</i>

716
01:03:05,624 --> 01:03:07,580
We've not heard from County.

717
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:10,940
If we don't hear soon,
we'll never get things under control.

718
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:16,098
- You try getting through to them.
- I've got starving mobs everywhere.

719
01:03:16,184 --> 01:03:18,539
It's not our decision anyway.

720
01:03:18,624 --> 01:03:22,776
It's up to Zone to authorize
the release of buffer stocks...

721
01:03:22,864 --> 01:03:27,699
- We can't get through to County.
- Are we going to let them starve?

722
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:31,572
We're on our own. You've got
the authority. Do something with it.

723
01:03:31,664 --> 01:03:34,462
Why waste food
on people who are going to die?

724
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,536
I agree with Clive.
The food stocks won't last long.

725
01:03:37,624 --> 01:03:39,580
A lot of people didn't stock up.

726
01:03:39,664 --> 01:03:41,620
How could they? The shops were empty.

727
01:03:41,704 --> 01:03:46,539
They're coming out of the shelters. We
should hang on to the food we've got.

728
01:03:46,624 --> 01:03:49,616
I need that food to force people to work.

729
01:03:49,704 --> 01:03:53,140
<i> There's about 2,000</i>
<i>outside Roxburgh fire station.</i>

730
01:03:53,224 --> 01:03:57,456
- Make us a cup of tea, Sharon.
- Make it yourself. I'm not your wife.

731
01:03:57,544 --> 01:03:59,500
Anybody got a fag?

732
01:04:04,944 --> 01:04:08,016
- Bad for your health.
<i>- They're pulling the place apart.</i>

733
01:04:08,104 --> 01:04:11,335
I don't care
how much trouble they're causing.

734
01:04:11,424 --> 01:04:14,416
We're not sending our men in there
with that radiation.

735
01:04:14,504 --> 01:04:19,624
What's the point? They're all gonna die
on that patch anyway.

736
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:24,858
Bill, just get me a drink. Please, a drink.

737
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:28,095
I'll see if I can find anything.

738
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:35,654
I won't be long.

739
01:05:23,344 --> 01:05:25,778
Just a minute. Just a minute.

740
01:05:34,624 --> 01:05:39,414
- For God's sake.
- Just a minute, love. That's it.

741
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:46,537
- Oh, God. Look at it.
- Just a minute. Just a minute.

742
01:05:52,424 --> 01:05:56,622
Can you manage? That's it.

743
01:05:56,704 --> 01:06:01,653
All right, put her down here.
Give us one of the blankets.

744
01:06:04,344 --> 01:06:08,019
Come on. Oh, my God.

745
01:06:13,144 --> 01:06:15,942
- Ruth?
- Ruth!

746
01:06:16,904 --> 01:06:18,656
Ruth!

747
01:06:20,984 --> 01:06:22,815
Ruth!

748

749
01:06:30,504 --> 01:06:32,460

Half past two.

Night or day?

766
01:10:12,384 --> 01:10:14,978
Night, I think.

767
01:10:15,064 --> 01:10:18,613
I'm not sure. I'm losing track.

768

- Who are you saving it for?
- This is a warning.

784

One round CS gas, straight at gates.

787

- Can't we get any food from outside?
- Where from?

803
01:16:29,864 --> 01:16:32,742
We've told County.
Everybody's in the same boat.

804

We can't contact Rockley.
God knows what's happened there.

805
01:16:37,184 --> 01:16:39,300
Probably been raided.

What do you think, Doctor?

807
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:44,456
We'll have to cut their rations.
I've worked it out.

808
01:16:44,544 --> 01:16:48,617
1,000 calories for manual workers
and 500 for the rest.

809
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:51,821
500? 500?!

810
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:53,974
That wouldn't keep a flea alive.

811
01:16:54,064 --> 01:16:56,862
Should we be keeping anybody alive
if they can't work?

812
01:16:56,944 --> 01:17:00,334
A lot of people are gonna die anyway.

813
01:17:00,424 --> 01:17:03,257
Back to survival of the fittest, I suppose.

814
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:07,576
What is that in terms of food, then,
500 calories?

815
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:10,815
I don't know... A few slices of bread...

816
01:17:10,904 --> 01:17:12,860
some soup...

817
01:17:12,944 --> 01:17:14,900
a lamb chop...

818
01:17:14,984 --> 01:17:16,940
a treacle tart...

819
01:17:17,024 --> 01:17:18,980
a few pints of beer.

820
01:17:22,864 --> 01:17:24,820
Bastards!

Look, you must have an empty factory
to put them.

822
01:17:29,224 --> 01:17:33,183
No, you look. I've got thousands
of homeless people walking around.

823
01:17:33,264 --> 01:17:36,495
I've got enough on with them
without worrying about criminals.

824
01:17:36,584 --> 01:17:38,654
You'll have to find
somewhere to put 'em.

825
01:17:38,744 --> 01:17:43,101
Well, I don't know.
Look, shoot the buggers. I don't care.

826
01:17:43,184 --> 01:17:48,941
Can we get a water tank
to Broomhill? The standpipe's run dry.

827
01:17:50,224 --> 01:17:53,819
Oh, Christ, Steve. This should have been
sorted out days ago.

828
01:17:53,904 --> 01:17:56,782
Can we not tell them
to make their way to the rest centers?

829
01:17:56,864 --> 01:18:01,619
No, there'll be no point.
They'll be overrun anyway.

830
01:18:01,704 --> 01:18:05,060
What about tents?
Got any tents we could use?

831
01:18:05,144 --> 01:18:08,773
Tents?! How the hell should I know?

832
01:18:08,864 --> 01:18:12,413
If you want to know about tents,
go and phone the Boy Scouts.

833
01:18:12,504 --> 01:18:15,735
Piss off, will you?
You're not the only one under pressure.

834
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:18,975
- I bloody know!
- You sort it!

835
01:18:19,064 --> 01:18:23,103
And what the hell are you doing
about digging us out?

836
01:18:59,304 --> 01:19:03,741
Bloody hell, what a stink.
Let's get out of here. I'm gonna puke.

837
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:19,502
Halt or I'll fire.

838
01:19:19,584 --> 01:19:22,144
Number three,
a round for that man over there.

839
01:19:25,584 --> 01:19:28,576
- Number one, go and search the house.
- Up against the wall.

840
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:31,417
- We weren't doing anything.
- You were looting.

841
01:19:31,504 --> 01:19:34,462
- We were searching empty houses.
- Quiet! Shut up!

842
01:19:34,544 --> 01:19:38,298
- What choice have we got?
- We were hungry.

843
01:19:38,384 --> 01:19:40,898
Two bodies in the cellar.
A man and a woman.

844
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:43,544
Not been dead long.
The man's head's battered in.

845
01:19:43,624 --> 01:19:46,013
It weren't us, it were him.

846
01:19:46,104 --> 01:19:48,060
- Out.
- We ain't done nothing.

847
01:19:48,144 --> 01:19:51,375
Number two, pick up the stolen goods.

848
01:19:59,304 --> 01:20:03,582
- We were only after a bit of food.
- Check the house and search the body.

849
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:11,054
- Bag of crisps.
- What flavor?

850
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:14,295
- Prawn cocktail.
- They fucking would be. I hate them.

851

01:27:22,064 --> 01:27:24,020
Right, down there.

892
01:27:31,184 --> 01:27:33,140
Come on.

893
01:27:43,304 --> 01:27:45,943
- George Langley?
- What do you want?

894
01:27:46,024 --> 01:27:50,097
- You have four temporary residents.
- I'm having no strangers here.

895
01:27:50,184 --> 01:27:53,813
- You've no choice. It's law.
- I don't care what it is.

896
01:27:53,904 --> 01:27:56,418
This is my house
and I'm having no strangers in it.

897
01:27:56,504 --> 01:28:01,259
- You've got four spare rooms...
- Aye, and they're stopping spare.

898
01:28:01,344 --> 01:28:04,939
They can't just walk
into people's houses. It's not right.

899
01:28:05,024 --> 01:28:07,413
We're not here to argue the matter.

900
01:28:07,504 --> 01:28:09,859
- You four...
- It's bloody dangerous.

901
01:28:09,944 --> 01:28:12,538
They might bring
all sorts of diseases with them.

902
01:28:12,624 --> 01:28:15,536
- In you go.
- They might be contaminated.

903
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,615
Well, look at him. Look at him.

904
01:28:17,704 --> 01:28:20,821
- Look at him.
- Go on. In you go.

905
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:26,658
Right, No.19.

906
01:28:30,624 --> 01:28:33,980
Get out, will you?
The whole lot of you.

907
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:37,818
- Go on!
- You've no right!

908
01:28:42,824 --> 01:28:45,213
Get out, the whole lot of you!

909
01:28:45,304 --> 01:28:47,738
Where are we supposed to go?

910
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:02,657
<i> This is a final warning. Residents</i>
<i>and non-residents must register...</i>

911
01:29:02,744 --> 01:29:04,257
Ruth?

912
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:06,539
It is Ruth, isn't it?

913
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:11,620
I'm Bob. Jimmy's mate.

914
01:29:13,744 --> 01:29:17,180
We met once or twice. Remember?

915
01:29:17,264 --> 01:29:20,495
You came to our last Christmas do
at work.

916
01:29:25,864 --> 01:29:28,298
Where is he?

917
01:29:28,384 --> 01:29:30,693
Is he wi' you?

918
01:29:30,784 --> 01:29:32,740
Have you seen him?

919
01:30:00,024 --> 01:30:02,458
Is it safe to eat?
I don't know.

920
01:30:02,544 --> 01:30:07,095
How can you tell?

921
01:30:07,184 --> 01:30:09,903
It's got a thick coat.
That should have protected it.

922
01:30:09,984 --> 01:30:12,498
You breathe it in, though, don't you?

923
01:30:12,584 --> 01:30:14,540
It should be all right.

924
01:30:16,304 --> 01:30:18,374
Sheep don't die of cold.

925
01:30:18,464 --> 01:30:21,058
It must be radiation.

926
01:30:21,144 --> 01:30:24,420
You'd be able to taste it
if it were contaminated.

927
01:30:24,504 --> 01:30:26,460
Oh, I don't know.

928
01:30:26,544 --> 01:30:30,583
We've no choice, have we,
unless we want to starve to death?

929
01:30:32,824 --> 01:30:35,292
Oh.

930
01:30:48,504 --> 01:30:51,621
- I'll take some wi' me.
- Where?

931
01:30:54,464 --> 01:30:56,694
City.

932
01:30:58,624 --> 01:31:00,580
There's nothing there.

933
01:31:06,944 --> 01:31:10,300
North. Dales.

934
01:31:13,984 --> 01:31:15,940
Doesn't really matter, does it?

935
01:31:18,464 --> 01:31:20,420
It's all the same.

936
01:31:25,704 --> 01:31:27,660
I'll try and skin it.

937
01:31:28,784 --> 01:31:30,740
Keep me warm.

938
01:32:35,384 --> 01:32:38,296
<i> If we are to survive</i>

939

940
01:32:41,744 --> 01:32:45,817

No!

<i>Words and pictures.</i>

<i>Skeletons and skulls</i>

963
01:43:35,344 --> 01:43:38,142
<i>There was the skeleton of...</i>

- Coney.
