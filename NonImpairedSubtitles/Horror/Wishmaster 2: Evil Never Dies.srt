<i>LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!</i>

00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,602
GET OUT! GET OUT!

00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:45,138
JUST LEAVE THE DAMN THING!
COME ON!

4
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,240
FREEZE!

5
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,313
COME ON!
JUST LEAVE IT!

6
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:55,482
GO, GO, GO, GO!

7
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,552
STAY BACK!
STAY DOWN!

8
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,901
LET'S GO!
COME ON. LET'S GO!

9
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,507
NOW! MOVE IT!
GO! GO!

10
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,457
STOP! RIGHT THERE!

11
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,865
MORGANA!

12
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,804
ARE YOU OKAY?

13
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:54,474
YEAH, I THINK SO.
EASY, EASY, EASY.

14
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:58,411
OH, GOD!
WHAT?

15
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:02,482
THIS STOPPED THE BULLET.
OH, MY GOD.

16
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:05,652
WH-WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?
IT WAS INSIDE THE STATUE.

17
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:07,487
<i>- - WHAT HAPPENED?</i>

18
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,490
<i>IT BURNED ME!</i>

19
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:12,225
- DROP IT! -
NO! - WATCH OUT!

20
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:14,294
NO!

21
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,940
DON'T DIE. DON'T DIE.
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

22
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:28,308
GET OUT OF HERE.

23
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,648
NO.
I LOVE YOU, MORGANA.

24
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,828
GO.

25
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,666
GET OUTTA HERE.

26
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,528
JESUS.
ERIC.

27
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,665
<i>I CAN HELP YOU.</i>

28
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:01,067
FUCK OFF.

29
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,598
I CAN GIVE YOU LIFE
EVERLASTINGLY, IF YOU WISH IT.

30
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:40,606
I CAN END YOUR PAIN...

31
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,642
IF YOU WISH THAT.

32
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:47,547
I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN.

33
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,884
AS YOU WISH.

34
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,822
DONE.

35
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,765
<i>- COVER THE BACK.
- YES, SIR.</i>

36
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,967
LET'S GO.

37
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,870
FREEZE!

38
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:54,474
DID I HEAR YOU SAY "FREEZE"?

39
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,612
YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE GODDAMN
RIGHT. I SAID, "FREEZE!"

40
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,052
DONE.

41
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,270
THE TIME IS COME.

42
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,209
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.

43
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,543
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

44
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:06,579
NOW, PUT YOUR HANDS UP.

45
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,651
NOW SLOWLY TURN AROUND.

46
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,261
OPEN UP YOUR HANDS.
SLOWLY.

47
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,169
YOU WANNA EXPLAIN THIS
TO ME?

48
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,307
HE NEEDED TO CHILL OUT.

49
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,778
CUFF HIM.
GET HIM OUTTA HERE.

50
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,241
WHY?

51
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,923
YOU SAY YOU ACTED ALONE.

52
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,227
YOU SAY YOU SHOT AND KILLED TWO PRIVATE
SECURITY GUARDS IN THE COMMISSION OF A ROBBERY.

53
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:03,295
THAT IS CORRECT.

54
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,334
WHERE'S THE GUN?
I SAID I DON'T KNOW.

55
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,904
IT JUST DISAPPEARED.

56
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,973
WHAT ABOUT THE SIX PAINTINGS
YOU CUT OUT OF THEIR FRAMES?

57
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:16,042
DID THEY DISAPPEAR TOO?

58
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,682
LOOK. NATHANIEL.

59
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:26,385
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE SHOOTER, SO WHO'RE
YOU TRYING TO PROTECT? A GIRLFRIEND?

60
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,990
<i>IS THAT IT?</i>

61
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:35,428
SHE MUST BE A REAL GOOD FUCK. I MEAN,
YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE INJECTION FOR HER.

62
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,097
HMM?

63
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:40,833
YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND?

64
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:44,136
<i>YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND, YOU SLY
DEVIL. YOU LITTLE FAGGOT, YOU.</i>

65
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:46,972
ACTUALLY, I DON'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS.

66
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,776
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

67
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,112
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
TRYIN' TO PULL HERE?

68
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:57,783
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU'D
LIKE, AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO OBLIGE.

69
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:59,885
THE FUCK YOU WILL,
YOU LYIN' SACK OF SHIT!

70
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,754
<i>YOU GIVE ME NOTHIN'
BUT HORSESHIT!</i>

71
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,461
I'M THE ONE THAT ASKS THE
QUESTIONS HERE, NOT YOU!

72
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,963
- UNDERSTOOD?
- YES.

73
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:14,266
QUESTIONS. ANSWERS.

74
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,337
AS INTELLIGENT A MAN
AS YOU ARE,

75
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,209
DON'T YOU WISH YOUR JOB
WERE A LITTLE MORE EXCITING?

76
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,983
<i>- WILLET!
- YES, SIR.</i>

77
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:33,919
GET THIS ASSHOLE
OUTTA MY FACE.

78
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,389
LET'S GO.

79
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:49,502
GUY GIVES ME THE WILLIES.

80
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:52,138
IN A CASE THAT CONTINUES
TO BAFFLE POLICE OFFICIALS,

81
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,876
NATHANIEL DEMAREST PLEADED GUILTY TO CHARGES
THAT HE ROBBED THE SAROM ART GALLERY...

82
00:12:56,878 --> 00:13:01,180
AND MURDERED TWO SECURITY
GUARDS. THIS IS BULLSHIT.

83
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:05,351
JUDGE EDWARD LAVWITZ REMANDED DEMAREST
TO COUNTY PRISON PENDING SENTENCING.

84
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:09,889
BUT QUESTIONS STILL REMAIN AS TO
HOW DEMAREST COMMITTED THESE CRIMES,

85
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:14,560
SINCE A WEAPON WAS NEVER FOUND NOR HAVE
POLICE DISCOVERED THE MISSING WORKS OF ART.

86
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:18,831
AS FOR THE 3,000-YEAR-OLD
STATUE DAMAGED IN THE ROBBERY,

87
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,433
EXPERTS ARE CONFIDENT
IT CAN BE RESTORED.

88
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:26,906
CALLED AHURA MAZDA, IT DEPICTED AN
ANCIENT PERSIAN DEITY OF THAT NAME.

89
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:29,241
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
MEANWHILE,

90
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:32,344
THE FAMILY OF SLAIN SECURITY GUARD
ARNELL DAWES REMAIN IN SECLUSION.

91
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:37,817
FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FATHER OF TWO WILL
BE HELD ALONG WITH THE OTHER SECURITY GUARD.

92
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:42,588
POLICE CHIEF HOWARD SAID THERE WILL BE A SPECIAL
CEREMONY AT CITY HALL TO HONOR THE OFFICERS.

93
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,424
REPORTING LIVE FROM CITY HALL
- SHUT UP!

94
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:29,468
WHAT'S THE MATTER IN THERE?

95
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,654
<i>IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE? YEAH!</i>

96
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,556
HOW ABOUT YOUR TIGHT
LITTLE YUPPIE ASS?

97
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,058
OH, I'M NO YUPPIE.

98
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,160
DON'T FUCK WITH ME,
BITCH!

99
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:59,164
I'LL FUCK UP YOUR LIFE, YOU
COCKSUCKER. YOU UNDERSTAND?

100
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:03,903
I BELIEVE YOU MEAN YOU'LL DO ME GREAT
BODILY HARM IF I'M DECEIVING YOU.

101
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:07,172
BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT.
MAKE A WISH,

102
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,909
ANY WISH YOU LIKE.
UH-HUH?

103
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:14,179
ALL RIGHT. UH, THOSE ARE NICE SHOES.
WHAT, ARE THEY SOME KIND OF ENGLISH SHIT?

104
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:22,688
- I DON'T KNOW.
- TAKE 'EM OFF.

105
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,157
TAKE THE FUCKIN' SHOES OFF, OR
- I LIKE YOU.

106
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,928
YOU'RE A POWERFUL MAN.

107
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,265
WHY DO YOU WASTE YOUR POWER? I'M GIVING YOU
THE CHANCE TO WISH FOR ANYTHING YOU LIKE.

108
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:37,636
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN
DO BETTER THAN A PAIR OF SHOES.

109
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,240
WHOA! WHOA!

110
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,344
YOU'RE A FUCKIN' GENIE!

111
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,980
HEY, FUCK!
HE'S A FUCKIN' GENIE!

112
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:51,016
WE GOT A FUCKIN' GENIE IN OUR
CELL! HELL, YOU'RE A GENIE, HUH?

113
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:54,286
- YES.
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY. FINE.

114
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,456
FINE, BECAUSE I'M GONNA
MAKE A WISH.

115
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,993
IF THE WISH DON'T COME TRUE, I'M
GONNA OWN YOUR LILY WHITE, YUPPIE,

116
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:03,595
MOTHERFUCKIN',
GOLF PLAYIN' ASS.

117
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:06,065
IF THE WISH COMES TRUE,
I OWN YOU.

118
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:09,702
THE FUCKIN' STATE
OWNS ME!

119
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:12,972
JESUS CHRIST.
ALL RIGHT.

120
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:15,407
OKAY. FINE. GREAT.

121
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,509
YOU SEE THE BARS THERE?

122
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,246
I WANNA WALK RIGHT THROUGH
THE BARS, MAN,

123
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,248
AND WALK RIGHT ON
OUTTA THE JAIL.

124
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,451
COME ON. COME ON, GENIE.

125
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:28,620
DONE.

126
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:16,168
YOU WOKE ME.

127
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,803
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.

128
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,624
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
MORGANA.

129
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,296
HELLO, GREGORY.

130
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,369
FATHER.

131
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,873
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

132
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,444
IT'S STILL A CHURCH.

133
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,247
IT'S WHERE I LIVE.

134
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:39,485
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

135
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,221
I JUST NEEDED TO TALK,
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE-

136
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,458
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

137
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,162
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH YOU, MORGANA. NO.

138
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:52,831
NO. THIS IS DIFFERENT.

139
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,573
YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST
TIME I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE-

140
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,742
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

141
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,651
DO YOU-

142
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,256
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN THE DEVIL?

143
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:18,891
I BELIEVE IN GOD.

144
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,529
YEAH. SO IF, UM,

145
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:27,299
IF GOD EXISTS, THEN SATAN
HAS TO EXIST TOO, RIGHT?

146
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,836
IS THERE A POINT
TO THIS?

147
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,607
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

148
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,792
ERIC'S DEAD.

149
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,834
IS THAT WHAT YOU CAME HERE
TO TELL ME?

150
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,837
NOT REALLY, NO.

151
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,607
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
JUST SAY "I'M SORRY."

152
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,610
I'M SORRY.

153
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,848
BUT HE WASN'T
THE RIGHT MAN FOR YOU.

154
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,619
I LOVED HIM.

155
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:23,889
DO YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT LOVE IS? DO YOU?

156
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,525
YOU COULDN'T LOVE ME,
AND SO YOU CAME HERE.

157
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,798
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT REAL LOVE IS.

158
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:38,403
GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT
HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON-

159
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,306
I DON'T NEED A SERMON,
GREGORY, ALL RIGHT?

160
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,442
WHAT DO YOU NEED,
MORGANA?

161
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:46,311
I NEED ANSWERS.

162
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,682
I JUST DON'T KNOW
THE QUESTIONS YET.

163
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,956
GOOD-BYE.

164
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,643
<i>YO, CHECK THIS OUT.</i>

165
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,645
I'M GETTING IT ON
WITH MY SISTER-IN-LAW.

166
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:22,581
NEXT THING I KNOW THE BITCH
DROPS FUCKING DIME ON ME.

167
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,916
ATTEMPTED RAPE. I GOT THIS
LOSER FOR A FUCKIN' P.D.,

168
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:27,286
AND IT'S MY THIRD
FUCKIN' HIT.

169
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:30,289
THAT'S FUCKED UP, MAN.
CHECK THIS OUT, MAN.

170
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,457
I GET STOPPED AT A LIGHT.
THEY CHECK IN THE TRUNK.

171
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,660
I GET BUSTED
FOR A BOGUS SEARCH.

172
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:37,929
MY LAWYER PLEA BARGAINS THREE-TO-FIVE
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE FUCKING WALKED.

173
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,299
PUCK-ASSED MOTHERFUCKER
SHOULD GO FUCK HIMSELF.

174
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,501
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
WHO'S THIS GUY?

175
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,605
WHO YOU TALKIN' TO,
YOU FUCKIN' FAGGOT?

176
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:48,573
I'M TALKING TO SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T BELONG HERE.

177
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:57,783
I'M GONNA DO YOU A BIG FAVOR BECAUSE
YOU'RE NEW AND YOU'RE IGNORANT,

178
00:21:57,785 --> 00:22:00,519
AND NOT RIP THE FUCKIN' TONGUE OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH FOR TALKIN' TO ME.

179
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,355
<i>I'M GOING TO DO YOU
A FAVOR,</i>

180
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:06,325
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN UNJUSTLY
IMPRISONED MAN.

181
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:09,928
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR LAWYER PAID FOR ALL
THE SUFFERING HE'S PUT YOU THROUGH. YES?

182
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:15,801
MAN, ARE YOU TRIPPING? WHO THE
FUCK ARE YOU? THE WISHMASTER.

183
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:18,036
I MAKE WISHES
COME TRUE.

184
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,506
OH, YEAH? WELL, YOU BETTER WISH
FOR SOME FUCKIN' SENSE REAL QUICK.

185
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,843
I BELIEVE YOU SAID YOU'D LIKE TO
SEE YOUR LAWYER GO FUCK HIMSELF.

186
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,878
I COULD ARRANGE THAT.

187
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,115
YOU AIN'T PLAYIN' FOR REAL,
MY BOY HERE'S-

188
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:32,884
I ONLY PLAY FOR REAL.

189
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,423
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?
YOUR SOUL.

190
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,094
FUCK IT, MAN. MAKE IT HAPPEN. FREEZE.

191
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,430
LET'S GO, MAN.
YOUR LAWYER'S HERE.

192
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:48,433
<i>HE WANTS TO SEE YOU.
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.</i>

193
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:51,370
COME ON.
I SAID COME ON!

194
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:53,004
GET HIM OUTTA HERE,
MAN!

195
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:02,114
WELL, WELL, WELL.
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE, BOYS?

196
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,784
WISHMASTER.

197
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,619
I LIKE TO FLATTER MYSELF.

198
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,827
FLATTER THIS,
MOTHERFUCKER.

199
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:21,533
FUCK OFF.

200
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:24,770
NOW-

201
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:28,740
YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYIN' TO DO ANY
BUSINESS HERE, WOULD YOU, BRO?

202
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,944
JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL.

203
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:35,180
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH, BROTHER?

204
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,048
I'M SURE THERE IS.

205
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,819
I'LL BE WATCHIN' YOU.

206
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:42,854
WISHMASTER.

207
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:47,192
TINKER BELL LOOKIN'
MOTHERFUCKER.

208
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,705
HELLO, ROBERT.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

209
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:06,178
YOU TELL ME. WELL, ACTUALLY, VERY WELL.

210
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,547
OH, YEAH.
HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE.

211
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,718
I THINK THAT I MAY HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YA.

212
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,222
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CASE
DIDN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME.

213
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:21,793
IT WAS THE SEARCH. IT WASN'T
HANDLED PROPERLY. I DID SOME DIGGING.

214
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,795
AND I UNCOVERED
A PROCEDURAL SCREW-UP...

215
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:27,632
THAT'S POTENTIALLY VERY DAMAGING
TO THE D.A.'s OFFICE.

216
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:31,770
I THINK THAT, UH, I CAN GET ALL
THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU DROPPED.

217
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:34,940
BACK UP, MAN, BACK UP.
WHAT ARE YOU TELLIN' ME?

218
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:36,942
YOU CAN GET
ALL THE CHARGES DROPPED?

219
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:40,178
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYIN', MAN? THAT I CAN GO FREE?

220
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,982
THAT'S RIGHT, ROBERT. OF COURSE, WITH MY
CONNECTIONS AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT...

221
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,984
AND THE D.A.'s OFFICE,
I CAN-

222
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:51,556
GODDAMN, WHAT WAS THAT?

223
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,793
- ARE YOU OKAY, MAN?
- YEAH. WHOO!

224
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:57,696
EXCUSE ME. YEAH.
OKAY. UH.

225
00:24:57,698 --> 00:25:00,265
WE WERE-
OOH!

226
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:03,568
YOU OKAY?

227
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,072
- OH, GOD. OKAY.
- WE WERE TALKING-

228
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:10,175
MISTER-
GUARD!

229
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:13,278
- GUARD!
- OHH!

230
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,114
GUARD! HE'S SICK, MAN, HE'S SICK!

231
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:19,651
AGH!

232
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:26,591
WHAT THE FUCK?

233
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,264
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

234
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,305
WHAT ABOUT MY CASE, MAN?

235
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,910
WHAT ABOUT MY CASE, MAN?

236
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,880
DONE.

237
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,004
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.

238
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,155
WHO ARE YOU?

239
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,224
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

240
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,896
GOD, THIS IS BULLSHIT.

241
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,758
<i>AHURA MAZDA.</i>

242
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,827
<i>"THE DEITY OF LIGHT
IN PRE-ISLAMIC PERSIA.</i>

243
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,897
<i>"HIS SHADOW WAS SAID TO CONTAIN
ALL THAT WAS DARK.</i>

244
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,266
HE THUS CAME TO SYMBOLIZE
THE DUALITY OF GOOD AND EVIL."

245
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,173
WHO IS IT?
IT'S GREGORY.

246
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:58,243
COME ON UP.

247
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:03,682
<i>"AHURA MAZDA WAS
ALSO KNOWN AS...</i>

248

KEEPER OF THE STONE
OF THE SECRET FIRE."

249
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:26,771
NEVER SEEN A GIRL
WITHOUT HER MAKEUP BEFORE?

250
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,811
FATHER DMITRI TOLD ME YOU WERE
OUTSIDE THE CHURCH THE OTHER DAY.

251
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:36,214
YEAH. UM-

252
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:40,285
I WAS WALKING BY,
AND I DECIDED, UH-

253
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:42,153
DID YOU WANT TO
TALK TO ME?

254
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:45,290
NOT REALLY, NO.

255
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,094
YOU ALL RIGHT?

256
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:53,031
YEAH. I'M FINE.

257
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,500
FATHER DMITRI SAID
YOU SEEMED ILL OR-

258
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,270
I HAVEN'T BEEN
SLEEPING WELL LATELY.

259
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,474
STILL TRYING TO FIND
THE ANSWERS, HUH?

260
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,477
THE QUESTIONS KEEP
PILING UP.

261
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:09,047
I KEEP HAVING THESE NIGHTMARES
AND THINGS.

262
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,449
PEOPLE DYING. A VOICE KEEPS
SAYING, "FULFILL THE PROPHECY."

263
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,520
"FULFILL THE PROPHECY"?

264
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:18,490
I KEEP THINKING IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH ERIC'S DEATH, YOU KNOW?

265
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,960
WHATEVER.

266
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,166
YEAH. ACTUALLY, THAT'S
WHY I WANTED TO COME BY.

267
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:31,402
I WANTED TO SAY I WAS SORRY.

268
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:34,773
I WAS WRONG, WHAT I SAID TO
YOU THE OTHER DAY ABOUT ERIC.

269
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,409
MY HEART IS TRULY
WITH YOU.

270
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,549
I KNOW.

271
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:51,022
THE WEIRD THING IS
I'M NOT EVEN SURE HE'S DEAD.

272
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:55,160
I MEAN, THERE'S BEEN NO REPORTS.
NOTHING ON THE NEWS.

273
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:57,262
W- W-WAIT A MINUTE.

274
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:59,931
MAYBE HE'S JUST MISSING.
WHY DO YOU PRESUME HE'S DEAD?

275
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:02,467
BECAUSE I SAW HIM SHOT.

276
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,869
WHAT? HAVE YOU BEEN
TO THE POLICE?

277
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,473
IT WAS DURING A ROBBERY.

278
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,911
I WAS PART OF IT.

279
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,546
OH, MY GOD.

280
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,395
I KILLED THE MAN
WHO SHOT HIM.

281
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,365
HE LEFT A WIFE AND TWO KIDS.

282
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:39,604
AND THEN I HEAR ABOUT THIS NATHANIEL
DEMAREST GUY, ARRESTED AT THE SCENE.

283
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:42,941
CONFESSING TO EVERYTHING.
THE MURDERS, EVERYTHING!

284
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:47,178
W- WAIT- YOU HAVE TO
CONFESS. HE'S AN INNOCENT MAN.

285
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,080
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS.

286
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:52,283
I THOUGHT AT FIRST MAYBE HE WAS
A POLICE PLANT OR SOMETHING.

287
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,452
BUT HE KEEPS SHOWING UP
IN MY DREAMS!

288
00:30:54,454 --> 00:30:56,588
OR WHATEVER THEY ARE.
LISTEN TO ME.

289
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:02,193
YOU HAVE TO CONFESS. IT'S
YOUR ONLY WAY TO FIND PEACE.

290
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,630
ALL I KNOW IS...

291
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:08,867
I GOTTA FIND OUT
WHO THIS GUY IS...

292
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,569
AND GET HIM OUTTA MY LIFE.

293
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,522
I'LL NEED SOME I.D.

294
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,270
WE NEED DETERGENT.

295
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,483
MR. DEMAREST.
YES?

296
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:00,952
I'M OSIP KRUTCHKOV.
HOW DO YOU DO?

297
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:03,221
I DO VERY WELL, MR. KRUTCHKOV. AND YOU?

298
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:05,256
OH, CALL ME OSIP.

299
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:10,094
I'M AS WELL AS I CAN BE
IN THIS FUCKING SHIT HOLE.

300
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,497
YOU'D LIKE TO BE OUT OF HERE.
WHO WANTS TO BE IN PRISON...

301
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:15,600
WHEN HE CAN BE
A FREE MAN?

302
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:19,070
PERHAPS I COULD HELP.
SO I AM TOLD.

303
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:21,272
REALLY?

304
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:25,376
WHAT WERE YOU TOLD?
THAT YOU ARE THE DEVIL.

305
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:27,478
THAT YOU TAKE
MEN'S SOULS.

306
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,681
DID YOU BELIEVE THEM?

307
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:33,384
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
IF YOU'RE DEVIL OR NOT.

308
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:38,323
AS LONG AS YOU WILL GIVE ME
WHAT I NEED ON THIS EARTH.

309
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:42,560
IT IS TRULY A PLEASURE TO DO BUSINESS
WITH AN ENLIGHTENED MAN, MR. KRUTCHKOV.

310
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:46,064
NOW, WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

311
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:50,068
FIRST, OBVIOUSLY,
I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

312
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,338
ONLY ONE WISH TO A
CUSTOMER. OH, MR. DEMAREST.

313
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,974
I AM NOT USUAL CUSTOMER.

314
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,210
MAYBE NOT,
BUT THERE ARE RULES.

315
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:01,379
RULES ARE MEANT
TO BE BROKEN.

316
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:03,481
HELP ME,
AND I HELP YOU.

317
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:07,251
NOW, WHY WOULD I NEED
HELP? EVERYBODY NEEDS HELP.

318
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:09,287
EVEN THE DEVIL.

319
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:15,426
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? OH, YES,
SIR. JUST TALKING A LITTLE BIT.

320
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,165
DEMAREST.

321
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,635
LET'S GO.

322
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:30,241
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER,
BABY.

323
00:33:30,243 --> 00:33:32,243
YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

324
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,315
WE MEET AGAIN,
MORGANA.

325
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:17,789
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

326
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:21,225
WHERE, EXACTLY,
DO YOU THINK WE MET?

327
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,628
IN THE ART GALLERY.

328
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,332
THAT'S BULLSHIT.
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

329
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,773
WHY DID YOU CONFESS
TO THE ROBBERY?

330
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:37,775
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO,
MY DEAR.

331
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:42,246
I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.
I THINK YOU DO.

332
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:45,283
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
TOO LOUDLY IN HERE, NOW, WOULD WE?

333
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:53,758
YOU WERE THERE?
INDEED.

334
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:59,397
HIDING? "HIDDEN," I
THINK, IS A BETTER WORD.

335
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:03,701
LOOK, YOU'RE TALKING IN CIRCLES.
I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU. YOU'RE RIGHT.

336
00:35:03,703 --> 00:35:06,337
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME
A QUESTION?

337
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:12,610
WHAT HAPPENED TO ERIC?
THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS SHOT?

338
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:15,413
HE HAD A REGRESSIVE
EXPERIENCE.

339
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:17,849
NO. NO RIDDLES.

340
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:21,853
I'M SORRY.
HE'S NO LONGER WITH US.

341
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,694
- WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THE RAP INSTEAD OF ME?
- ACCESS.

342
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:32,196
HOW COULD YOU HAVE ACCESS
TO ANYBODY? YOU'RE IN PRISON!

343
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:36,267
YOU'RE HERE. BESIDES,
THIS IS ONLY TEMPORARY,

344
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:39,871
AND I'VE MANAGED TO GATHER UP
A FEW LIKE-MINDED SOULS.

345
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:44,742
EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING.
I LOVE THAT PART!

346
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,149
WHAT DOES
"FULFILL THE PROPHECY" MEAN?

347
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,484
YOU'LL LEARN THAT
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

348
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:56,554
WHAT PROPHECY? AND WHY
ME? WHAT IS IT ABOUT ME?

349
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:59,724
YOU SET ME FREE.

350
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:07,565
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MISS?

351
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,901
I'M FINE.

352
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,673
COME ON, ASSHOLE.

353
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:19,644
COME ON.

354
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:27,585
PUT IT OVER THERE.

355
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:32,557
THERE'S THIS GUY.
JACKIE T.

356
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,692
PLAYS IT OFF
LIKE HE'S MY BOY.

357
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:38,663
BE SHARIN' STUFF, TALK SHIT ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WHEN WE GET OUT.

358
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:42,300
I TELL HIM ABOUT MY STASH,
I TELL HIM ABOUT MY GIRL.

359
00:36:42,302 --> 00:36:45,970
HE GETS OUT. NEXT THING I KNOW THIS FUCKIN'
SANCHO IS RUNNIN' AROUND WITH MY BITCH.

360
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:48,806
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ELSE. THAT'S NO GOOD.

361
00:36:48,808 --> 00:36:52,777
NO. WE REALLY MUST DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

362
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,215
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE?
YOUR SOUL.

363
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:02,220
AND A PACK
OF CIGARETTES.

364
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,629
JUST TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS,
ALL RIGHT?

365
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:13,664
DONE.

366
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,868
HELLO, BRO.

367
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,872
SEE YOU BEEN SPREADIN'
YOUR HUSTLE AROUND MY HOUSE.

368
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,810
YES.
THAT'S GOOD.

369
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:28,779
'CAUSE I'M HERE
FOR MY RENT.

370
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:31,449
YOUR RENT?
MY RENT.

371
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:34,285
MY PIECE, MY SLICE,
MY BIG.

372
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:36,287
YOU JUST GOT A NEW PARTNER,
MOTHERFUCKER.

373
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:38,990
NOT. I PREFER
TO WORK ALONE.

374
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,027
I DON'T THINK SO.

375
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:45,997
I AM PREPARED TO OFFER YOU
SOMETHING ELSE, HOWEVER.

376
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:50,835
YOU DON'T OFFER ME SHIT!
I TAKE, AND I TAKE, AND I TAKE!

377
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:55,640
YES, OF COURSE. WHAT I MEANT TO SAY
WAS, YOU CAN TAKE ANYTHING YOU WISH.

378
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:58,576
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'D
TRADE YOUR SOUL FOR?

379
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:02,046
MY SOUL? MAN, BUTZ DON'T HAVE NO SOUL.

380
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:04,448
SHUT UP!

381
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,285
OH, YES, HE DOES.

382
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:10,588
WHAT'LL IT BE, BROTHER?
POWER? MONEY?

383
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,757
SEX?

384
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:16,460
ONE MORE WORD OUTTA YOU,
AND I'M GONNA SHOVE MY FIST...

385
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:19,597
SO FAR DOWN YOUR FUCKIN' THROAT
YOU'RE GONNA SHIT KNUCKLES!

386
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,533
NOBODY DOES BUSINESS
IN MY FUCKIN' HOUSE...

387
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:24,635
UNLESS I GET MY RENT.

388
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:27,805
VERY WELL.

389
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,543
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

390
00:38:32,545 --> 00:38:34,612
HMM.

391
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:43,854
DON'T YOU KNOW THESE'LL
KILL YA? YOUR DRUGS!

392
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:49,093
I WANT YOUR DRUGS. EXACTLY
WHICH DRUGS WOULD YOU LIKE?

393
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,929
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.
I JUST WANNA GET WASTED.

394
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:54,432
WASTED?
WASTED.

395
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:56,934
FUCKED UP.
TORE UP FROM THE FLOOR UP.

396
00:38:56,936 --> 00:38:59,570
STOMPED RIGHT INTO THE GROUND.

397
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:02,740
WASTED.
MMM.

398
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,418
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

399
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,986
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED!

400
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:28,632
WANNA SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT,
MOTHERFUCKERS? COME ON! LET'S ROCK!

401
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:44,081
CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR,
BROTHER.

402
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:53,424
THAT'S HOW HARD YOU CAN
HIT ME? POW, POW!

403
00:39:53,426 --> 00:39:56,460
GET OUTTA HERE!
CAN'T TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF?

404
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,663
GOT TO GIVE YOU
A LITTLE BETTER TEMP, ASS.

405
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:02,933
MMM.

406
00:40:02,935 --> 00:40:04,969
DAMN.

407
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,740
EVERY TIME I HAVE TROUBLE
IN MY HOUSE,

408
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,809
I SEE YOUR UGLY FACE.

409
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:13,577
NOW, WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?

410
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,646
BAD DRUGS.

411
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,150
OH, YOU'RE
A FUNNY GUY, HUH?

412
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:21,085
LET'S SEE HOW FUNNY YOU ARE
WITH A WEEK IN THE HOLE!

413
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,087
A WEEK?

414
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,823
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU'VE GOT?

415
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:28,025
YOU WANT MORE?
YOU GOT IT, MISTER.

416
00:40:28,027 --> 00:40:31,529
I WAS IN A HOLE ONCE
FOR 3,000 YEARS.

417
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:34,432
THIS SHOULD BE
A BREEZE.

418
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:39,170
YOU'RE A FUCKIN' NUT CASE. I'M GONNA TAKE
CARE OF YOU. NOW, GET HIS ASS OUTTA HERE!

419
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:42,039
<i>STUFF HIS ASS
IN THE HOLE!</i>

420
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:45,910
<i>"ACCORDING TO LEGEND,
AN ALL-POWERFUL JINN...</i>

421
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:48,212

OF PERSIA.</i>

422
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:50,214

ENLISTED TO GUARD THE STONE."

430
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:33,624
OH, MAN.

431
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:38,696
"GUARD THE STONE AND KEEP THE JINN TRAPPED
WITHIN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WORLDS."

432
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:59,984
MAN, I FEEL LIKE
I AM LOSING MY MIND.

433
00:41:59,986 --> 00:42:03,187
THE ARTICLE ON THE NET SAYS THERE'S
THIS STONE OF THE SECRET FIRE...

434
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:07,691
WITH THIS JINN THING
LOCKED INSIDE IT.

435
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:12,596
A- AND IT'S GUARDED BY THIS GOD,
AHURA MAZDA.

436
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:16,300
WELL, I FOUND THE JEWEL
INSIDE A STATUE OF AHURA MAZDA.

437
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:19,703
THE JEWEL BROKE
ON MY BODY.

438
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:22,139
IS THAT WHAT DEMAREST MEANT
WHEN HE SAID I WOKE HIM?

439
00:42:22,141 --> 00:42:24,141
I MEAN, FROM WHAT?
FROM INSIDE SOME STONE?

440
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:26,877
AND WHEN I ASKED DEMAREST
WHO HE WAS,

441
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,113
I GOT THIS- THIS FLASH...

442
00:42:29,115 --> 00:42:32,983
OF THIS HELL
AND THIS- THIS THING,

443
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:35,119
THIS JINN,
STARING AT ME.

444
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,592
EITHER THIS IS SOME KIND OF WEIRD DELUSION,
IN WHICH CASE I'M NOT SURE I'M STANDING HERE,

445
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:44,261
OR THIS GUY IS FOR REAL.

446
00:42:44,263 --> 00:42:46,897
WELL, IN THIS FLASH,

447
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:50,067
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS THING
YOU SAW WAS A JINN?

448
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:53,270
- BECAUSE IT LOOKED JUST LIKE THE THING IN THE ARTICLE.
- THE ARTICLE YOU READ?

449
00:42:53,272 --> 00:42:56,574
- WAIT A MINUTE-
- NO, NO. I'M ASKING BECAUSE...

450
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:59,276
YOU'VE BEEN UNDER A LOT
OF STRESS SINCE ERIC'S DEATH.

451
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:03,047
YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS GUY. YOU DIDN'T
SIT ACROSS THE TABLE FROM HIM...

452
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:06,150
AND LOOK IN HIS EYES
AND SEE-

453
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:08,319
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DESCRIBE IT.

454
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:11,789
MAYBE IF YOU'D-

455
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,327
FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.

456
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,631
NO. NO.

457
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,969
MAYBE I SHOULD.

458
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:52,730
OPEN THREE!

459
00:43:54,934 --> 00:43:58,002
TIME'S UP, DEMAREST.
LET'S GO.

460
00:43:58,004 --> 00:44:00,037
FRONT AND CENTER.

461
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:06,877
GET HIM OUTTA HERE.

462
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:48,819
WHO ARE YOU?

463
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,795
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?

464
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:01,465
LEAVE HER ALONE.

465
00:45:01,467 --> 00:45:03,901
IS THAT YOUR WISH?

466
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:07,805
I'M NOT ASKIN' YOU. I'M
TELLIN' YOU. LEAVE HER ALONE.

467
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:10,140
LIKE YOU LEFT HER ALONE,
FATHER?

468
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:12,776
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

469
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:16,413
I'D LIKE TO GET MY HANDS
ON THAT CUTE LITTLE ASS MYSELF.

470
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,386
- YOU WON'T SUCCEED.
- WHO'S GONNA STOP ME?

471
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:25,089
GOD WILL STOP YOU.

472
00:45:25,091 --> 00:45:27,057
GOD HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS.

473
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:29,760
GOD HAS EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

474
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:31,762
BEGONE, SATAN!

475
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:36,033
I THINK YOU HAVE YOUR DEMONS
MIXED UP, FATHER.

476
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:44,475
GREGORY, I WANT YOU. GREGORY.

477
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:51,048
TELL MORGANA
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

478
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:07,297
GREGORY?

479
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:10,033
GREGORY, ARE YOU OKAY?

480
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:11,869
HE'S NOT OF THIS WORLD.

481

ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THIS POWER
HE HAS.

A LOT OF WISHING
GOING ON IN THERE.

502
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:27,004
HE'S JUST BIDING HIS TIME,

00:48:27,006 --> 00:48:29,640
COLLECTING HIS SOULS.

504

ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

506
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,484
MMM.

HERE.

510
00:48:55,701 --> 00:48:58,201
THANKS. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO,

511
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:00,570
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO AVOID
DEMAREST AT ALL COSTS.

512
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:06,376
YEAH, WELL, THAT...
MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE.

513
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:08,412
WELL, WHATEVER YOU DO,

514
00:49:08,414 --> 00:49:11,348
PLEASE DON'T WISH
FOR ANYTHING.

515
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,517
THAT SHOULD BE EASY.

IT'S CALLED FAITH.

518
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,492
NO. NO, I BROUGHT HIM
INTO THIS WORLD,

519
00:49:22,494 --> 00:49:25,128
AND I DAMN WELL
BETTER GET HIM OUT.

BE RETURNED TO HIS OWN REALM...

BY SOMEONE WHO'S... PURE.

522
00:49:31,103 --> 00:49:35,472
ALL RIGHT! SO I GOT A LITTLE
BIT OF A PROBLEM THERE.

523
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:38,642
GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON IT.

524
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:41,745
HMM. WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

525

YOU WORK ON IT
FROM YOUR END,

526
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:48,151
AND I'LL WORK ON IT
FROM MINE.

527
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:16,173
PURIFY MY SOUL.

528
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:06,790
FORGIVE ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

529
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:19,503
WHY ARE YOU SO QUIET
TODAY, MY FRIEND?

530
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:21,705
RUNNING OUT OF
CUSTOMERS?

531
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:24,307
IT APPEARS I'VE EXHAUSTED
MY CONSUMER BASE.

532
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:27,444
OH. SO THE REST
OF THOSE MORONS...

533
00:52:27,446 --> 00:52:29,746
ARE NOT SO STUPID
THAT THEY LOOK.

534
00:52:29,748 --> 00:52:33,850
ON THE CONTRARY, THEY'RE MORE
STUPID THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.

535
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:35,719
CHECKMATE.

536
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:42,159
WELL, TIME TO BLOW
THIS POPSICLE STAND.

537
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:44,694
AMAZING! I WOKE UP
WITH THE SAME IDEA.

538
00:52:44,696 --> 00:52:47,464
SHALL WE GO, THEN?

539
00:52:47,466 --> 00:52:49,699
YES. SURE.
HOW?

540
00:52:49,701 --> 00:52:51,701
WALK OUT THE FRONT GATE.

541
00:52:51,703 --> 00:52:54,704
JUST LIKE THAT?
YES.

542
00:52:54,706 --> 00:52:58,842
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WISH IT.
- YOU SAID I GET TWO WISHES. REMEMBER?

543
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:01,811
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.
YOU MAKE A WISH.

544
00:53:01,813 --> 00:53:05,315
I GET YOUR SOUL.
AFTER THAT, WE'LL SEE.

545
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:09,386
GET YOUR BUTT OUT OF HERE. SORRY, SIR.

546
00:53:09,388 --> 00:53:11,354
YOU'RE A NAUGHTY LITTLE GIRL.

550
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,665
THERE'S BEEN FOUR MURDERS. THERE'S
BEEN AN INCREASE OF CONTRABAND.

551
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:24,634
THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF DISCIPLINE.
YOU'RE NOT FOOLIN' ME, MAN!

552
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:28,905
YOU THINK
THIS SHIT'S FUNNY?

553

THINK YOU'RE A TOUGH GUY.

555

WHEN I CLOSE THEM DOORS, GONNA HAVE YOU
CRYIN' FOR YOUR MAMA LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

SOUNDS GREAT, SIR,

557
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:46,656
BUT I'VE MADE OTHER PLANS.

558

561
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,234
THAT'S MY ORDER.

580
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:57,987
I HAD TO CAST OUT
MY OWN DEVILS FIRST.

581
00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:00,790

- WHAT! WHEN?

582

<i>THIS MORNING. THINK HE HAS ALL
THE SOULS? IS THAT WHY HE GOT OUT?</i>

MAYBE HE NEEDS MORE
AND CAN'T FIND ANY TAKERS.

584
00:56:06,765 --> 00:56:11,368
A THOUSAND'S A PRETTY BIG
NUMBER. WELL, NOT BIG ENOUGH.

585
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:14,537
THE BOOKS SAY THAT WHEN THE APOCALYPSE IS
NEAR, THE NATURE OF THE WORLD WILL CHANGE.

586
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:18,108
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET. I DON'T
THINK ANYTHING THIS GUY DOES IS RANDOM.

587
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,710
TELL ME. HOW DID HE
ESCAPE? THEY DON'T KNOW YET.

588
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:23,780
THIS GUARD WAS KILLED.
HE WAS MUTILATED.

589
00:56:23,782 --> 00:56:26,649
HE LEFT WITH THIS OTHER GUY, THIS RUSSIAN MAN
- WAIT A MINUTE.

590
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:29,085
A RUSSIAN. WHAT WAS
HIS NAME? I DON'T KNOW.

591
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:32,088

KRUTCHKOV. HE MURDERED
TWO MEN IN MY PARISH.

595
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:49,806
HE LIVES HERE? I CAN'T SAY. I
USED TO HANG OUT AT HIS CLUB.

596
00:56:49,808 --> 00:56:52,909
UM, SIBERIA CLUB?
SIBERIA?

597
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:55,678

WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF DEVIL ARE YOU?

602
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:29,078

HUH? YOU WANT IT?
HE CAN GIVE IT TO YOU.

608
00:57:57,475 --> 00:57:59,642
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

609
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:02,111
GET OUT, I TOLD YOU!

610

MISHA, I SAID

611
00:58:04,749 --> 00:58:08,718
THIS FUCKIN' SON OF BITCH!
GET OUT OF HERE!

612
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:18,094
- NOTHING.
- JUST...

613
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:15,218
YOU SPEAK RUSSIAN.

614
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,754
WHY ARE YOU
SO AFRAID OF PUSHKIN?

615
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:23,126
EVERYBODY IS
AFRAID OF PUSHKIN.

616
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,096
HE'S A BIG BOSS.

617
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:33,169
I DESPISE PUSHKIN!

618
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,915
MAKE ME BIG BOSS.

619
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:48,885
GET RID OF THIS
FUCKING PUSHKIN.

620
00:59:48,887 --> 00:59:52,655
I WISH I WANT TO BE
BIG BOSS.

621
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:54,791
YOU'VE ALREADY
HAD YOUR WISH.

622
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:57,226
ONE MORE, PLEASE.

623
00:59:57,228 --> 00:59:59,662
SORRY.

624
00:59:59,664 --> 01:00:02,298
THERE ARE RULES
NOT EVEN I CAN BREAK.

625
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,809
COME WITH ME.

626
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:15,178
PLEASE.
COME.

627
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,748
MMM.

628
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:43,373
IS THIS TRUE?

629
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:48,077
ABSOLUTELY.
JUST ASK.

630
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,750
WHY?
WHAT YOU GET FROM THIS?

631
01:00:53,752 --> 01:00:56,085
THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU
ACHIEVE YOUR END.

632
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:01,724
YOU ARE THE MOST
INTERESTING CHARACTER.

633
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:03,926
YES, I AM.

634
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:10,667
<i>THERE IS NOTHING I NEED. SURELY
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU WANT.</i>

635
01:01:10,669 --> 01:01:14,103
FAME, FORTUNE, POWER.

636
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,808
FORTUNE AND POWER
I ALREADY HAVE.

637
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:20,410
FAME I DON'T NEED.

638
01:01:20,412 --> 01:01:23,079
EXCUSE ME.

639
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:27,116
MAYBE A WOMAN
YOU COULDN'T GET.

640
01:01:27,118 --> 01:01:31,154
SOME OBJECT
OF GREAT VALUE.

641
01:01:31,156 --> 01:01:33,856
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
AN ENEMY TO DISAPPEAR.

642
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:37,827
I DON'T NEED YOU FOR THAT.
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME.

643
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,097
MOUSTAFA!

644
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:46,302
I TOLD YOU! NEVER MENTION
HIS NAME IN MY PRESENCE!

645
01:01:46,304 --> 01:01:50,473
NATHANIEL CAN
GET TO HIM, REALLY.

646
01:01:50,475 --> 01:01:54,110
SOMEBODY WHO'S OFFENDED YOU.
SOMEONE YOU CAN'T TOUCH.

647
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:07,190
MOUSTAFA'S GETTING
OUT OF CHECHNYA.

648
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:11,828
WHAT COULD YOU DO
AGAINST MOUSTAFA?

649
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,230
ANYTHING YOU WISH.

650
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:28,377
I WANT HIS HEAD.

651
01:02:28,379 --> 01:02:30,379
<i>CAN YOU DO THIS?</i>

652
01:02:30,381 --> 01:02:32,348
CONSIDER IT DONE.

653
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:03,212
MOUSTAFA!

654
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:07,216
GET OUT OF HERE!

655
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:11,320
I'LL KILL YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER!

656
01:03:13,258 --> 01:03:16,559
TAKE HIM OUT OF HERE.

657
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:21,030
MOUSTAFA! MOUSTAFA!

658
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:23,299
I DID IT!

659
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:28,037
ON HIS WISH I DID IT!
HA-HA!

660
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:32,575
OH, NOW I AM THE BOSS,
NUMBER ONE!

661
01:03:32,577 --> 01:03:34,844
WHAT?

662
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:39,382
I GOT WHAT I WANT.
YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT.

663
01:03:39,384 --> 01:03:42,585
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE? ONE MORE SOUL.

664
01:03:42,587 --> 01:03:44,921
ONE MORE SOUL?

665
01:03:44,923 --> 01:03:48,591
I NEED 800 MORE SOULS,
AND I'M GROWING IMPATIENT.

666
01:03:48,593 --> 01:03:50,960
WAIT, WAIT.

667
01:03:50,962 --> 01:03:55,298
GO ON THE STREET AND TAKE
THEM. YOU'RE POWERFUL.

668
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,967
I CAN ONLY ACT WHEN
I'M WISHED TO DO SO,

669
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:00,169
BUT THAT WILL CHANGE
VERY SOON.

670
01:04:00,171 --> 01:04:03,039
<i>MY DRUGNATHANIEL, WAIT.</i>

671
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:05,374
YOU NEED SOULS.

672
01:04:05,376 --> 01:04:08,344
I HAVE SUCH A GREAT
PLACE FOR YOU.

673
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:34,937
LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MORGANA.

674
01:04:34,939 --> 01:04:37,306
<i>DID YOU REALLY THINK
YOU COULD KILL ME?</i>

675
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:41,911
EVIL NEVER DIES.

676
01:04:41,913 --> 01:04:43,412
<i>PERHAPS...</i>

677
01:04:43,414 --> 01:04:45,882
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE
YOU DESIRE.

678
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:53,322
YOUR DEAD FRIEND ERIC
ALIVE AGAIN.

679
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:55,591
NO.

680
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:00,663
THERE WILL COME A TIME,
SOON,

681
01:05:00,665 --> 01:05:05,968
WHEN I WILL CALL UPON YOU TO FULFILL THE PROPHECY
- YOU WHO WOKE ME.

682
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,504
THREE WISHES
YOU WILL MAKE.

683
01:05:08,506 --> 01:05:12,508
THEN MY KINGDOM
WILL REIGN ON THIS EARTH.

684
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:15,044
FOR NOW,

685
01:05:15,046 --> 01:05:18,681
THIS WISH
I GIVE YOU FREELY...

686
01:05:18,683 --> 01:05:22,285
SO YOU MAY KNOW ITS JOY.

687
01:05:22,287 --> 01:05:24,687
TELL ME YOUR DESIRE,
CHILD.

688
01:05:24,689 --> 01:05:28,357
I SHALL GRANT IT.

689
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,972
SOULS,
KRUTCHKOV.

690
01:05:42,974 --> 01:05:45,408
I NEED SOULS.

691
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:18,174
GOD, FORGIVE ME.

692
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:24,380
GOD FORGIVES ALL SIN.

693
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:28,417
SOME SINS
ARE TOO GREAT,

694
01:06:28,419 --> 01:06:31,354
EVEN FOR GOD.

695
01:06:31,356 --> 01:06:34,357
NO SIN IS TOO GREAT
FOR HIS FORGIVENESS.

696
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:37,259
I KILLED
AN INNOCENT MAN.

697
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,630
I LEFT TWO CHILDREN
FATHERLESS.

698
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:46,435
I HAVE BLOOD ON MY HANDS
I CAN NEVER WASH OUT.

699
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:50,272
THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB
CAN CLEANSE ALL SINS.

700
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:52,341
NO, NOT MINE!

701
01:06:54,111 --> 01:06:56,445
I BROUGHT HIM
INTO THIS WORLD.

702
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:01,217
AND I'M TOO WEAK.

703
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:03,586
I'M TOO IMPURE
TO GET HIM OUT.

704
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:09,058
I PRAY TO GOD
FOR FORGIVENESS,

705
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,763
BUT I CAN'T
HEAR HIS VOICE.

706
01:07:13,765 --> 01:07:16,565
MORGANA,
LISTEN TO ME.

707
01:07:16,567 --> 01:07:18,601
IT'S IN GOD'S HANDS.

708
01:07:18,603 --> 01:07:21,137
IF IT'S HIS WILL THAT
YOU SERVE HIM, SO BE IT.

709
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:23,572
I SAW HIS TRUE FACE.

710
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,043
THE FACE OF GOD?

711
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:30,146
THE JINN.

712
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:37,386
I FOUND DEMAREST AND...

713
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:41,290
I TRIED TO KILL HIM.

714
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:43,526
MY GOD.

715
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:47,563
AND WHEN I SHOT HIM,

716
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:51,467
HE CHANGED.

717
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:56,072
THOSE PICTURES
OF THE JINN-

718
01:07:57,774 --> 01:08:00,309
THERE'S NO WAY
TO FIGHT HIM.

719
01:08:01,645 --> 01:08:04,313
FOR US, NO.

720
01:08:04,315 --> 01:08:06,682
FOR GOD,
THROUGH US-

721
01:08:33,577 --> 01:08:36,112
HEY!
COME IN.

722
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:40,316
IT'S OKAY.

723
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:45,454
A PRIEST CAN'T DO YOU
ANY GOOD, GIRLIE.

724
01:08:45,456 --> 01:08:48,124
- HE'S GONE.
- WHERE?

725
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,495
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T
TELL YOU THAT, FATHER.

726
01:08:52,497 --> 01:08:54,897
WHY NOT?

727
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:56,732
WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF?

728
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:02,138
I MADE A PLEDGE.
YOU MADE A PLEDGE?

729
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,340
YOU SIT BEFORE GOD, AND YOU
TELL ME YOU MADE A PLEDGE...

730
01:09:04,342 --> 01:09:06,609
WITH THIS-
THIS EVIL?

731
01:09:06,611 --> 01:09:09,512
I DON'T SEE GOD
IN THIS ROOM.

732
01:09:09,514 --> 01:09:12,548
I JUST SEE
A POOR PRIEST...

733
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,583
<i>AND A PATHETIC
LITTLE GIRL.</i>

734
01:09:14,585 --> 01:09:17,586
<i>YOU WANT TO SAVE THE WORLD? I
SHOW YOU HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD!</i>

735
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:21,457
<i>JUST- JUST PUT
THE GUN DOWN.</i>

736
01:09:21,459 --> 01:09:25,761
IF SHE'S DEAD, SHE CAN'T
WISH THIS WORLD INTO HELL.

737
01:09:25,763 --> 01:09:28,230
<i>- HE'S RIGHT.
- NO! PUT THE GUN DOWN.</i>

738
01:09:28,232 --> 01:09:30,499
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP HIM.

739
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:32,568
I CAN'T LET YOU!
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

740
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:34,603
AAH!

741
01:09:36,807 --> 01:09:38,641
NO!

742
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:45,481
THERE'S
NOTHING THERE.

743
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:49,818
OH, HE HAS
OTHER PLANS FOR YOU.

744
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:54,924
HOW MANY SOULS?

745
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:58,594
HOW MANY SOULS DOES HE HAVE?
DID HE SAY?

746
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,465
YOU MADE A WISH, RIGHT?

747
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:05,768
YOU WANT TO SPEND ETERNITY
IN HIS HELL?

748
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:09,471
THEN HELP US!
HELP YOURSELF!

749
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:14,743
HE SAID...

750
01:10:14,745 --> 01:10:16,946
HE NEEDS 800 MORE.

751
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:23,385
THAT GIVES US SOME TIME, RIGHT? YEAH.

752
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:26,355
NOT WHERE HE'S GOING.

753
01:10:30,861 --> 01:10:32,861
I UNDERSTAND YOU'LL BE
REPRESENTING OUR...

754
01:10:32,863 --> 01:10:34,897
EASTERN EUROPEAN PARTNERS
WHILE YOU'RE OUT HERE.

755
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:37,700
YES, INDEED.
QUITE SO.

756
01:10:37,702 --> 01:10:40,636
DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN
THE GAMING INDUSTRY, MR. DEMAREST?

757
01:10:40,638 --> 01:10:42,738
OH, YES.

758
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,441
WHOA!
CONGRATULATIONS, TEX.

759
01:10:45,443 --> 01:10:47,476
THANK YOU,
PARTNER.

760
01:10:47,478 --> 01:10:49,878
YEAH, WE LIKE
FOLKS TO WIN.

761
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,750
ANYTHING THAT ENCOURAGES OUR
OTHER GUESTS TO BET IS GOOD FOR US.

762
01:10:54,752 --> 01:10:56,752
SINCE THE HOUSE
HAS THE ADVANTAGE,

763
01:10:56,754 --> 01:10:58,754
EVENTUALLY
THEY ALL LOSE.

764
01:10:58,756 --> 01:11:02,524
WHAT A WONDERFUL BUSINESS.

765
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:05,728
YEAH, WE LIKE
TO THINK SO.

766
01:11:08,366 --> 01:11:10,366
IN FACT,
YOU MIGHT SAY...

767
01:11:10,368 --> 01:11:12,968
THE CASINO WISHES EVERYONE
THE BEST OF LUCK.

768
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:15,871
THE CASINO WISHES
EVERYONE THE BEST OF LUCK?

769
01:11:15,873 --> 01:11:18,307
MOST ASSUREDLY.
HOW NICE.

770
01:11:18,309 --> 01:11:20,409
MR. AND MRS. LEE.

771
01:11:20,411 --> 01:11:22,511
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW'S THE SUITE?

772
01:11:25,483 --> 01:11:27,683
COME ON, SEVEN.
COME ON, SEVEN!

773
01:11:27,685 --> 01:11:29,785
<i>YEAH!</i>

774
01:11:32,556 --> 01:11:34,690
KA-CHING.

775
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:43,866
HELLO?

776
01:11:43,868 --> 01:11:46,635
THIS IS
OSIP KRUTCHKOV.

777
01:11:46,637 --> 01:11:50,639
I AM SO SORRY.
I MUST TALK TO YOU.

778
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:52,841
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

779
01:11:52,843 --> 01:11:56,078
YOU MUST GO TO HIM BEFORE
HE GETS ALL HIS SOULS.

780
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,614
I HAVE PURCHASED
YOU A TICKET.

781
01:11:58,616 --> 01:12:02,918
PLEASE, I BEG YOU.
YOU MUST GO, NOW.

782
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,087
YEAH, RIGHT.

783
01:12:05,089 --> 01:12:07,690
I ALSO NEED ONE
FOR FATHER GREGORY.

784
01:12:07,692 --> 01:12:11,560
BOTH TICKETS WILL BE
WAITING AT THE AIRPORT.

785
01:12:11,562 --> 01:12:14,730
GOOD-BYE, MORGANA,
AND THANK YOU.

786
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,572
<i>THIS IS IT, GREGORY.</i>

787
01:12:23,574 --> 01:12:26,875
DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE CAN DO THIS? YEAH.

788
01:12:26,877 --> 01:12:29,378
IT SAYS HERE THAT THE KING'S
ALCHEMIST FROM PERSIA...

789
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:32,081
<i>GOT THE JINN BACK INTO THE
GEM THROUGH AN INCANTATION.</i>

790
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:36,018
NOW, WHAT INCANTATION?

791
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,655
"AND AS IT WAS PROPHESIED, THE
ALCHEMIST TOOK THE STONE UNTO HIS HAND,

792
01:12:39,657 --> 01:12:42,391
"AS A WOMAN PURE OF HEART TAKES
THE LIGHT OF GOD UNTO HER SOUL,

793
01:12:42,393 --> 01:12:45,027
<i>"AND SPOKE THE WORDS
NIB SUGAROTH BAHEIM,</i>

794
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:49,031
UPON WHICH THE JINN WAS AGAIN
IMPRISONED WITHIN THE OPAL." THERE IT IS.

795
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:51,867
SO YOU FIGURE IF YOU JUST
SAY THOSE WORDS-

796
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:54,636
<i>NIB SUGAROTH BAHEIM.</i>

797
01:12:54,638 --> 01:12:56,472
THE JINN IS JUST
GONNA DISAPPEAR?

798
01:12:56,474 --> 01:12:58,841
WELL, HE GOES BACK
INSIDE THE OPAL.

799
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:02,077
<i>BUT IF THE KING'S ALCHEMIST CAN DO
IT, THEN SO CAN WE. WHY CAN'T WE?</i>

800
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:05,147
BECAUSE HE KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

801
01:13:07,985 --> 01:13:10,819
AT LEAST
YOU'RE PURE OF HEART.

802
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:15,023
LOOK, GREGORY,

803
01:13:15,025 --> 01:13:17,693
THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT
IS ABOUT TO COME TO AN END,

804
01:13:17,695 --> 01:13:19,962
AND YOU'RE GONNA STOP THE JINN
BY USING A QUOTATION...

805
01:13:19,964 --> 01:13:22,531
FROM A BOOK YOU BOUGHT
AT THE SPELL-CHECKER?

806
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:26,702
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT?

807
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:39,481
MORGANA, I REALLY DON'T THINK
THIS IS THE WAY TO HEAVEN.

808
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:43,152
DON'T BE TOO SURE.

809
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:16,652
MAGIC.

810
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:00,929
WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOIN' ON?

811
01:15:00,931 --> 01:15:03,232
I DON'T KNOW,
MR. FARRALON.

812
01:15:54,552 --> 01:15:58,220
I CLAIM THAT
WHICH IS OWED.

813
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:10,632
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.

814
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,152
MORGANA,
WHAT IS IT?

815
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:54,977
WHAT IS IT?

816
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:02,217
AAH!

817
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:14,096
IT'S OVER.

818
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:19,401
HE HAS ALL THE SOULS.

819
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:28,343
IF YOU STAY CALM,
NO ONE WILL GET HURT.

820
01:17:28,345 --> 01:17:30,846
THEY ALL WANTED
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.

821
01:17:30,848 --> 01:17:33,048
AND THAT'S
WHAT THEY GOT.

822
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:38,220
ALL RIGHT, IT'S SHOW TIME. LET'S GO.

823
01:17:43,694 --> 01:17:46,261
THREE WISHES, MORGANA,

824
01:17:46,263 --> 01:17:49,231
AND I SHALL REIGN.

825
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:04,846
COME IN.

826
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:18,360
<i>I TRUST YOU DIDN'T FIND THE
DISTURBANCE DOWNSTAIRS TOO UPSETTING.</i>

827
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:23,331
IS THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND
IF YOUR KINGDOM COMES?

828
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:26,101
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY, FATHER.

829
01:18:26,103 --> 01:18:28,403
"WHAT GOES AROUND
COMES AROUND."

830
01:18:30,473 --> 01:18:33,041
DO YOU LIKE
TO GAMBLE?

831
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:35,777
DEPENDS ON
WHAT'S AT STAKE.

832
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:37,813
<i>ANYTHING YOU WISH.</i>

833
01:18:37,815 --> 01:18:41,316
THE CASINO WOULD BE HAPPY
TO OFFER YOU UNLIMITED CREDIT...

834
01:18:41,318 --> 01:18:43,285
<i>TO PLAY THE GAME
OF YOUR CHOICE.</i>

835
01:18:43,287 --> 01:18:46,088
I HAVE A FEELING
YOU'LL DO VERY WELL.

836
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:48,123
I CAN FEEL IT.

837
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:52,060
MATTER OF FACT,
I CAN GUARANTEE IT.

838
01:18:52,062 --> 01:18:55,163
SAVE YOUR GAMES FOR
THE PEOPLE DOWNSTAIRS.

839
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:58,166
HMM.

840
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:04,473
<i>SO YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE A WISH?</i>

841
01:19:04,475 --> 01:19:06,308
THREE, TO BE EXACT.

842
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:12,380
ALL RIGHT.

843
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,251
I WISH...

844
01:19:16,253 --> 01:19:19,254
YOU WERE GONE
FOREVER!

845
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:23,425
POOF!

846
01:19:23,427 --> 01:19:25,460
HMM.

847
01:19:25,462 --> 01:19:27,896
STILL HERE.

848
01:19:27,898 --> 01:19:31,867
A WISH CANNOT CHANGE
THAT WHICH IS ETERNAL.

849
01:19:31,869 --> 01:19:33,935
PLEASE WISH AGAIN.

850
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:38,140
YOU CAN DO BETTER.

851
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:44,012
I WISH- I WISH YOU BACK INTO
THE STONE OF THE SECRET FIRE.

852
01:19:44,014 --> 01:19:46,448
I SEE YOU'VE DONE
YOUR HOMEWORK.

853
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:50,185
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

854
01:19:50,187 --> 01:19:52,854
AFTER ALL,
I AM THE WISHMASTER HERE.

855
01:19:52,856 --> 01:19:55,423
SO ANY WISHES
PERTAINING TO ME...

856
01:19:55,425 --> 01:19:57,826
ARE CIRCUMSCRIBED
BY THE PROPHECY.

857
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:06,034
<i>NIB SUGAROTH BAHEIM.</i>

858
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:12,174
SO, WE HAVE
DONE OUR HOMEWORK.

859
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:21,449
DO NOT PLAY WITH FORCES
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,

860
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:24,386
OR YOU WILL SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES.

861
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,457
YOU DON'T
FRIGHTEN US.

862
01:20:29,459 --> 01:20:31,827
GOD'S ALREADY SENT YOU
ONCE BACK TO HELL.

863
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:33,895
OH, PLEASE.

864
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:36,264
NOT THAT
OLD STORY AGAIN.

865
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:39,167
HELL IS YOUR WORLD,
NOT MINE.

866
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:48,844
IN GOD'S NAME, I COMMAND
YOU OUT OF THIS WORLD.

867
01:20:48,846 --> 01:20:51,346
<i>I WISH YOU INTO HELL,
DEMAREST.</i>

868
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:54,349
GOTCHA.

869
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:04,893
WELCOME TO MY WORLD,
MORGANA.

870
01:21:12,335 --> 01:21:14,336
WHERE'S GREGORY?

871
01:21:14,338 --> 01:21:17,305
WHERE HE'S ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE.

872
01:21:17,307 --> 01:21:20,575
BEHOLD, THE MAN.

873
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:31,253
WHAT GOOD
IS YOUR FAITH NOW?

874
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:38,426
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

875
01:21:38,428 --> 01:21:42,898
NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE
UNDONE, CHILD. JUST ASK.

876
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,333
LET HIM GO.

877
01:21:45,335 --> 01:21:47,369
LET HIM GO, PLEASE.

878
01:21:47,371 --> 01:21:49,404
IS THAT YOUR WISH?

879
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:54,109
NO.

880
01:21:54,111 --> 01:21:56,611
THEN WATCH HIM
SUFFER.

881
01:21:56,613 --> 01:21:59,114
AAH!

882
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:06,488
I WISH YOU
TO RELEASE HIM.

883
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:08,490
DONE.

884
01:22:08,492 --> 01:22:10,492
<i>GREGORY!</i>

885
01:22:10,494 --> 01:22:13,695
<i>OH, GOD!
GREGORY!</i>

886
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,500
OH, GOD.

887
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:22,003
YOU SAID
YOU'D RELEASE HIM!

888
01:22:22,005 --> 01:22:23,605
AND SO I SHALL.

889
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:32,247
GREGORY?

890
01:22:35,418 --> 01:22:37,385
YOU BASTARD!

891
01:22:37,387 --> 01:22:40,322
TWO MORE WISHES.

892
01:22:40,324 --> 01:22:42,691
GO FUCK YOURSELF
IN HELL.

893
01:22:42,693 --> 01:22:46,261
MAKE YOUR WISHES.

894
01:22:46,263 --> 01:22:48,363
NEVER.

895
01:22:48,365 --> 01:22:51,533
YOU TAX MY PATIENCE,
CHILD.

896
01:22:57,573 --> 01:23:01,042
I WISH THERE WAS
NO EVIL IN THE WORLD.

897
01:23:01,044 --> 01:23:04,980
EVIL IS THE HALF
OF A PERFECT SPHERE.

898
01:23:04,982 --> 01:23:08,183
TRY AGAIN. TELL ME HOW TO STOP YOU!

899
01:23:08,185 --> 01:23:11,086
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THAT.

900
01:23:11,088 --> 01:23:14,622
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME NOW,
AND YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF!

901
01:23:14,624 --> 01:23:18,159
MAKE YOUR WISH!

902
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:20,095
FULFILL THE PROPHECY.

903
01:23:27,203 --> 01:23:31,573
ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.

904
01:23:35,578 --> 01:23:37,746
YOU'VE HAD A TOUGH DAY.

905
01:23:39,749 --> 01:23:42,717
HMM.

906
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,186
I CAN SEE HOW...

907
01:23:45,188 --> 01:23:47,689
THIS COULD GET A LITTLE
DEPRESSING IN HERE, COULDN'T IT?

908
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:51,693
THIS PLACE ISN'T EXACTLY...

909
01:23:51,695 --> 01:23:54,396
HAPPY.

910
01:23:54,398 --> 01:23:56,598
I KNOW.

911
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,068
WHAT WE NEED IS A MORE
WISH-PROVOKING ENVIRONMENT.

912
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:03,738
ROSS.

913
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,544
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
FIRST A RUN ON THE HOUSE.

914
01:24:09,546 --> 01:24:13,248
NOW 200 PEOPLE DROP DEAD
ALL AT ONCE?

915
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:16,451
WHAT'S NEXT? FROGS
AND LOCUSTS? COULD BE.

916
01:24:16,453 --> 01:24:20,088
<i>WE'RE FINISHED!
NOT YET, ROSS.</i>

917
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:22,424
WHAT WE NEED IS SOME MORE
ACTION. GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

918
01:24:22,426 --> 01:24:24,426
DON'T YOU WISH WE HAD
SOME REAL ACTION?

919
01:24:24,428 --> 01:24:27,429
NO! NO, DON'T!

920
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:31,166
WHO'S SHE?
AN ACQUAINTANCE.

921
01:24:31,168 --> 01:24:34,536
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
HE'S THE DEVIL.

922
01:24:34,538 --> 01:24:36,571
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
ROSS?

923
01:24:36,573 --> 01:24:39,474
NO, DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
IT'S A TRICK.

924
01:24:39,476 --> 01:24:42,444
YOU KNOW, NATHANIEL,

925
01:24:42,446 --> 01:24:44,746
I THINK I'VE HAD ABOUT ALL
THE ACTION THAT I CAN HANDLE.

926
01:24:47,851 --> 01:24:51,719
I JUST WISH I COULD SEE THIS
NIGHTMARE COME TO AN END.

927
01:24:51,721 --> 01:24:54,756
NO!

928
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,475
HURRY UP!
HELP!

929

930
01:25:54,884 --> 01:25:57,252
LOOK OUT!
THIS PLACE IS DAMNED!

931
01:25:57,254 --> 01:25:59,320
EVERYONE OUT!

932
01:26:21,944 --> 01:26:25,580
TOO BAD.
YOU JUST CRAPPED OUT.

933
01:26:45,267 --> 01:26:47,569
AHH.

934
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:51,739
OOH!

935
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,902
DO YOU WISH
TO SEE MORE?

936
01:27:22,504 --> 01:27:26,007
NO.
THEN END IT.

937

MAKE YOUR WISHES.

938
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:33,615
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO ASK FOR.

939
01:27:33,617 --> 01:27:36,517
ASK FOR YOUR
HEART'S DESIRES.

940
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:38,753
A MILLION DOLLARS?

941
01:27:38,755 --> 01:27:40,755
A BIRD'S NEST?

942
01:27:40,757 --> 01:27:44,592
TO SEE YOUR LOVER PRIEST
ONE LAST TIME?

943
01:27:53,302 --> 01:27:56,771
YOU SAID, "FULFILL THE
PROPHECY." WHAT PROPHECY?

944
01:27:56,773 --> 01:27:59,641
I HAVE NO MORE TIME, CHILD.

945
01:27:59,643 --> 01:28:02,477
YOU TOLD ME I'D KNOW THE
ANSWER WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT.

946
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:07,649
IT IS WRITTEN,

947
01:28:07,651 --> 01:28:10,318
