00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:21,464
Correct.

252
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,039
You better check
the bite radius.

253
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:31,139
The what?
The shape
of the mouth.

254
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:34,811
Whale's mouth?
Shark's mouth.

255

The shark
that did this.

know that, do we.

experience with sharks.

261
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:58,672
Oh, have you?
Yeah.
And I think a--

262
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:01,371
I think a great white
might've done this.

263
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:04,415
Carcharodon carcharias?
Right.

264
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:07,748
What makes you think there
might be one in these waters?

265
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:10,014
Well, it's obvious
that, uh--

266
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,852
That a big fish took
a bite out of this big fish.

267
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,825
This is a mammal,
not a fish.

268
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:19,887
Don't quibble with me.
Is it a shark bite or isn't it?
Possibly.

269
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:22,627
Then again, this is
a killer whale.

270
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:25,727
It would have to be a shark
of considerable size.

271
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,872
Look, we know that, that sharks
are attracted by blood.

272
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:35,469
And thrashing about.
And sound.

273
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,014
Sound?

274
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:41,143
Sound like sonar, radar.
They hone in on unusual sounds,

275
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:45,485
irregular sounds,
almost any rhythmic
low-frequency vibration.

276
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:48,788
That means that there
could be one around.
Not necessarily.

277
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,886
These wounds could have
been inflicted 1 5 miles
out to sea or more.

278
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:53,954
None of them were
immediately fatal.

279
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:56,023
Currents could have carried
the body ten miles further.

280
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:58,092
We got a hell of
a tide this month.

Mr. Hendricks, will you
take this down, please?

283
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,804

And I'd like you to
come back with me.

284
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,371
We came out in my boat.
Yeah, but Andy
will take it back.

give me a break here, will ya?

It's either a great white
or another killer whale.

288
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,861
Well, I'd like
to know which.

289
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:31,300
Well, it's impossible for me to
tell when the body's like this.

290
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:35,829
This animal has been ashore
for 1 0 or 1 2 hours and
drifting for a day at least.

291
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:38,933
Every little nibbler
in the sea's taken a bite.

292
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:44,244
I know that
dolphins communicate.
I mean, they send signals.

You don't think that
if a shark was destroyed,

00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:48,746
that another shark could,
could come and--

Sharks don't take things
personally, Mr. Brody.

No.

I'm showing summer rentals.

304
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:50,173
I think we have a hell of
a good season going for us.

305
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:53,911
That's swell, Larry, but I
have to talk to you alone.
We're alone.

306
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:59,447
I think we may have
another shark problem.

307
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:06,456
Are you serious?
You bet I'm serious.

308
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:08,465
I've got a half-eaten
whale on the beach.

309
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,501
I've got two
persons missing.

310
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:13,332
This whale has got a bite
out of it about this big.

311
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:15,873
[ Larry ]
Martin, no one has seen
a shark. Be realistic.

312
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,908
I think the selectmen
should know about it.

313
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:20,877
I know it's just a feeling,
but you've got to understand.

314
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,977
Larry, for Christ sakes,
I not only have this attack,

315
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,711
but I've got, I've got
two water-skiers--

316
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:29,447
A tragedy,
but a boating accident.

317
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:31,421
No fin, no sharks.

318
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:34,014
Nothing but
a boating accident.
Their boat's still missing.

319
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:37,858
We have a lot of deaths in
these waters that never turn up.

320
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,823
Are they all
shark victims?

321
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:44,835
Maybe they are.

322
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:48,134
- Oh, bullshit.
- Bullshit?

323
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,800
Is it bullshit, I got
a whale on the beach
with a bite in it this big?

324
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,400
What am I, an ass?

325
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:58,006
When you called me,
I called Elkins and her bosses.

326
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,779
Nothing she saw
is proof of anything.

327
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:06,183
So that means we're not
gonna do anything, huh?

328
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,422
Martin,
don't press it this time.

329
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:16,528
Well, I've got to
get back to work.

330
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,767
Okay.

331
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,103
Okay, Larry, but you just
remember this conversation.

332
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:25,836
You just
remember it!

333
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:42,342
Aaah!

334
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:51,974
Chief?

335
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,320
Yeah?

336
00:37:57,388 --> 00:37:59,686
Chief?

337
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,987
Hi. Missed you
at the funeral home.

338
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,359
Santos said
you'd be here.

339
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,593
Yeah. Christ,
what a mess.

340
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,065
You didn't miss much.

341
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:12,227
Positive I.D.?

342
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:16,069
Well, we're pretty sure
it was the woman aboard
the boat all right.

343
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:31,320
[ Phone Ringing ]

344
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:34,756
Yeah?

345
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:37,818
Thank you, Operator.
Just keep trying.

346
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:47,067
Anything new on
those two divers?
Nothin'.

347
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:50,164
I think we oughta keep
sightseers away from there.

348
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:52,175
Did you take a look at
that stuff in that box?
No.

349
00:38:52,243 --> 00:38:56,703
How 'bout that camera?
There might be something in it.

350
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:58,976
Yeah, right.

351
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,745
Why don't you take it over to
Fogarty's and get it developed.

352
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:02,183
I'll do it first thing
in the morning.

353
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:05,552
Why not now?
It's too late.

354
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:07,887
Christ, I'm late
for dinner.

355
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:10,587
Listen, I'm expecting
a long-distance call.

356
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:12,789
When it comes through,
have them send it over
to the house, all right?

357
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:15,355
Okay, Chief.

358
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:20,401
Yes. Yes,
I can hear you.

359
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,769
Yes, I will. I'll give him
the message.

360
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,707
- Thank you.
- That for me?

361
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:27,267
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad.

362
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:29,040
Hi, gang.

363
00:39:29,113 --> 00:39:31,308
It was sort of.
Uh, Matt Hooper.

364
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:34,249
He's on the research vessel
Aurora, presently in the
Antarctic Ocean,

365
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:39,187
and he won't be in radio
range till next spring.
Yeah, I gave him a call.

366
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:57,031
[ Ellen ]
Martin?

367
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:59,303
Martin?

368
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:01,868
Yeah?

369
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:06,378
You're a mess.
Where were you?

370
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:09,750
I had to go to Santos'.
I dragged a body out
of the ocean today.

371
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:14,423
Do you have any idea
what happened?

372
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:16,426
No, we don't know.

373
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:19,895
Santos seems to think it
might be one of the victims
from that boat accident.

374
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:22,626
Do you want to
talk about it?

375
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,068
Just routine.

376
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:33,644
Okay.

377
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:35,679
Hey, Mike,
come here a minute.

378
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:38,409
Yeah, what is it?

379
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:42,078
I got something for you
to do tomorrow.
Well, I kinda had plans.

380
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:46,419
Sailing? Forget it.
You're grounded,
beached, that's it.

381
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,618
Come on, Dad.
I talked to Upjohn
down at the beach.

382
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:52,527
He's got a job that's gonna
last till you go back to school.
That's all summer.

383
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:54,827
I know it's all of summer,
but he wanted a job.
Now he's got one.

384
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:57,265
I want that boat
out of the water
by tomorrow night.

385
00:40:57,335 --> 00:40:59,428
Dad, please--
By tomorrow night.

386
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,971
And I mean it!

387
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:38,733
Now,
everybody here?
Just about.

388
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:40,862
Okay. Terrific.

389
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:43,099
Now, folks, this is
the town beach.

390
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:45,404
Now, the development
naturally has its...

391
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:48,377
own private access, but what
I wanted you to really see...

392
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:51,779
was the concession area,
and take a look at the sand.

393
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:55,910
It's like sugar.
It's beautiful.
It really is.

394
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,648
In the summertime,
when the sun sets,

395
00:42:57,722 --> 00:43:01,123
it goes right down there, and
the whole beach looks incredible.

396
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:04,093
[ Len ]
It really is. It can be
absolutely breathtaking.

397
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:06,356
I think you'll find this little
bandstand very interesting.

398
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,364
We take quite a bit
of pride in this.

399
00:43:08,432 --> 00:43:10,559
It was built in about, uh,
oh, I think it was 1 9 1 7.

400
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:12,660
Hello. Selling some more
of the good life?

401
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:15,535
Oh, yeah. Piece o' this,
piece o' that. It all adds up.

402
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:19,906
Your husband's been here
all morning. What's he doing?
His job.

403
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,154
Dad got you
working, huh?

404
00:43:31,222 --> 00:43:32,587
Yeah.
I'm helping.

405
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:34,420
Good.

406
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:38,724
Do you happen to know
where your dad is?
He's up there.

407
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:44,726
Oh, for Christ sake.

408
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:52,034
[ Len ]
Well, if you have any questions,
any questions at all...

409
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:54,270
about recreational
possibilities,

410
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:56,575
our lovely Ellen Brody
here will be only too
happy to answer them.

411
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:59,673
- Len, can I speak to you?
- Sure. Excuse me a moment.

412
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,310
[ Ellen ]
Okay, anybody have
any questions?

413
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:04,650
Larry, I think we've got
a couple of live ones.

414
00:44:04,722 --> 00:44:07,816
Brody's riding
his tower.

415
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:10,785
Oh, shit.

416
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:13,193
[ Girl ]
Let's go faster!

417
00:44:13,264 --> 00:44:17,394
You got it, sweetheart.
Come on!

418
00:44:18,636 --> 00:44:21,332
This fast
enough for you?
No, faster!

419
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:23,373
Faster?
Faster!

420
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:30,241
Hey, look,
there's my dad.

421
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:33,181
Wave to my son.

422
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:39,218
Good.
How the hell do we get
him down from there?

423
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,952
Well, maybe
nobody noticed.

424
00:44:42,026 --> 00:44:45,393
Let's get them all
back in the van, huh?
Yeah, come on.

425
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:50,693
Renee wants to know, what's
that man doing way up there?
What man?

426
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:54,966
Oh, he's watching.
You know, a lookout.
For what?

427
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,202
It's a shark tower.
I saw one in Florida.

428
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:00,266
He's looking
for sharks.

429
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:04,542
Excuse me, dear, it's
an observation platform.

430
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:07,345
That's our chief of police.
He's just checking it.

431
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:10,910
That's right. See, normally,
it's used for bird-watching.

432
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:14,446
You know,
weather measurements...

433
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:17,119
and nature observation,
that sort of thing.

434
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:20,095
Ellen-- Excuse me. Ellen,
we're running a little late.

435
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:23,429
Ellen.
Well, if we can all
get back on the bus,

436
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:27,801
maybe we can show
you the country club.
Right.

437
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:31,424
Out of the water!
Out of the water now!
Everybody, out!

Get out!

Everyone, out!

Out of the water!
Get out of there!
Get out!

446
00:46:56,494 --> 00:46:58,758
Get out of
the water!

447
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:05,092
Get out!
Get out!

448
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:11,100
Get out!

449
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:30,659
It's just bluefish!
Bluefish, geez!

450
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:34,528
It's a school
of bluefish!

451
00:47:34,598 --> 00:47:36,657
It's just bluefish!

Ellen, Ellen, Ellen,
it's all right.

00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,720
Let's not make
it worse. Come on.

454
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:04,192
