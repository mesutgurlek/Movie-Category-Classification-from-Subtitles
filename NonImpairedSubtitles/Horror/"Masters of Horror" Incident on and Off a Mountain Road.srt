Originally aired: Friday October 28, 2005 on Showtime

4
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,959
it's good to hear you voice

5
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,629
it's good to hear you breathing

6
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,472
You're running out of hours

7
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,226
I'm running out reasons

8
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,275
Everytime i turn around

9
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,820
you are gone

10
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:21,660
but, tonight i won't tell anyone

11
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,672
I should call the cops

12
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,259
Or I should call your father

13
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,019
But you're sayin' you don't care

14
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,355
Maybe I won't bother

15
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,032
Everybody notices when you're gone

16
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,663
Everybody wonders what they did wrong

17
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,690
I beieve anything can happen on anyone

18
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,401
anywhere,and anytime

19
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,196
I learned that when I was Kid

20
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,156
I aslo learned how to do at the wildness

21
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,117
you know
to me this world is a pretty fuck up place

22
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,454
sometimes to make me just out of there

23
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,207
shoot all these ass holes

24
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,295
so I guess you don't think

25
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,548
there have good things on the earth

26
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,924
What?this?

27
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,260
They can have it

28
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:03,554
It's not so bad

29
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,681
If you don't think about it

30
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,891
the price of gas and the communal traffic

31
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,852
No,that's the fucked up part

32
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,229
the gas, traffic

33
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,982
people get mad about it too, they are

34
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,735
they ask me
i say the whole things would get blow up

35
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,114
I mean..did you know in Thailand

36
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,243
you can sell your baby,you 5 years kid,to sex-shop

37
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,453
you could do the same thing here

38
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,914
the only difference is you can't advertise for it

39
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,585
Aer you always so charming at the time of a first date, Bruce?

40
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,797
Do I like the girl who is really interested in
what's going on in Thailand?

41
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:39,548
Sorry

42
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,218

64
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,997

65
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,418
my phone doesn't work,I can't call for help

66
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:29,922

Help me!

68
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:01,889
You've always got to expect the unexpected and do the unexpected

69
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,476
see,that would save you if some rascals
want to put on hurt you

70
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,938
you just crazy as they are

71
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:10,998
and they don't know how to fuck do with you

72
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,941
if crazy doesn't work?

73
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,026
oh.crazy always works

74
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,195
what if doesn't?

75
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,987
yeah

76
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,032
you forback,
you fight with whatever is valuable to you

77
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,283
you see it?

78
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:22,618
what?

79
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,160
this

80
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,287
All is wildness

81
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,914
you could always used it as your advantage

82
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,249
-oh yeah.
-yes

83
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,376
You can take a branch of tree and manufacture a sling

84
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,215
Or you can pick up a short stick to get someone's eyes.

85
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,301
my point is

86
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,220
as long as you don't see him coming

87
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,180
you get the advantage, OK

88
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,892
Well,you get to catch me first

89
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:49,645

90
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,941

91
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:54,691

92
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,403

93
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,530

94
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,575

95
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:04,910

96
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:05,619
I don't think so

97
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:07,246
-yes.
-no

98
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,584
Let me up

99
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:16,755

100
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,634
Let me up,Let me up

101
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,772
what?

102
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,526
it's time you do unexpected

103
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,071
you see?

104
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,760
do the unexpected

105
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:34,082
shit!

106
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:56,665
eat that,mother fuck!

107
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,966
when everything fails you

108
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,594
try anything

109
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,522

112
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,531
that exactly the type of behavior which get you hurt

113
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,617
you pull your trigger and you shoot all going awhile

114
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:18,121

00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,203

00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,995
how much i sleep when I woke up

182
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,332

183
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:12,294
hi

184
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,339
I'm Buddy

185
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,966
not too many come up this room

186
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,469
may be one a night
didn't make a turn of thou either, huh

187
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:22,387
one intend, but usually don't

188
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,848
they said it real bad lord, really

189
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,392
Did you bring any candy?

190
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,394
I like when they bring candy

191
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,315
sweet,spice,sometimes it's so much fresh
don't you agree?

192
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:38,904
I take back. it maybe

193
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:41,990
your friend is pretty

194
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:46,328
you must think you both special,
he didn't kill you like the last two

195
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,247
they were bad girls

196
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,873
kind of malicious,, you know

197
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,960
I guess they all deserved it

198
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:55,462
did you know what they did?

199
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:59,132
they want to do sexy things with him

200
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:03,095
they said they did anything he want
if he didn't hurt them

201
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,138
but he doesn't want sexy things

202
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:06,473
those things are bad

203
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,434
You see so many bad things in your life

204
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,895
It comes in through your eyes

205
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:15,315
and sometimes your eyes lie to you

206
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,402
and show you things you don't want to see

207
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,823
so....he makes them go away...

208
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:27,369
where are we?

209
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,621
you've came home

210
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,250
i've been here waiting for you

211
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,045
i always waiting for someone,
I believe, that would be you

212
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,548
it quite be anyone, really?

213
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,885
what is he

214
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,013
his face likes the moon

215
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:47,931
so beautiful

216
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:51,768
I used to call him moonface
but,didn't take long

217
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:53,854
I always making fun

218
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:59,860
that sick bastard dirty,he cuts out their eyes

219
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:05,240
he does on everyone girl,we are clear on that

220
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,952
you have to be on certain terms relate to him,

221
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:14,166
and these eyes,
theirs usual first things have to go

222
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:16,668
guess we are lucky, you and me

223
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:19,671
why he don't kill us?

224
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:21,882
reasons

225
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,760
their must be many reasons

226
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,095
he might be busy

227
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,099
after all,
he must move the cars miles away and dump them

228
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,352
so no one can ever find us

229
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:35,854
oh, he is so smart

230
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:36,730
listen to me, ok

231
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:40,275
I left my cellphone

232
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:42,194
up on the road

233
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,239
I can get you out of here

234
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:47,407
OK¡£did you get me out of this?

235
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,369
I can really go and get the help, OK?

236
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,205
sorry

237
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,876
I wish if I would, but I can't

238
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:03,257
so about these candy

239
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:04,258

240
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:05,676

241
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:06,426
I'm Buddy

242
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,970
did I tell you that already?

243
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:09,847
we will be good friends for a while

244
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,015
I think he really like you

245
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:12,850
shut up!

246
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:13,809
we could say some songs

247
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:15,310
do you know any songs?

248
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,145

249
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:08,674
No

250
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,784
he was sick, fuck!

251
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:59,409
he loves grand

252
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:00,702
would you sing a song about love?

253
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:02,287

255
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,625
sing is good for the soul

256
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,669
His face was sharp as a butcher's cleaver

257
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:11,505
but that did not seem to grieve her

258
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,007
Look away ! Look away !Dixieland !

259
