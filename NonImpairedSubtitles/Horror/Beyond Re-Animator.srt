1
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:31,885
You're not scared, are you?

2
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:36,044
Scared?
Why should I be scared?

3
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:39,125
We're next to a cemetery.

4
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:45,963
So?

5
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,403
If anything were to happen,

6
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,844
no-one would hear a thing.

7
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:53,958
What could possibly happen?

8
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:58,521
Remember the guy they caught,
the one who was killing kids?

9
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:00,046
Yeah. And what?

10
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:01,686
Wanna know the worst?

11
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,644
What's that?
Chocolate milk?

12
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:07,640
He ate them.
Carried parts around in a cooler.

13
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:08,842
Making that up!

14
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:09,962
Am not!

15
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,123
My sister knows a newspaper guy.

16
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:13,762
He told her.

17
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:17,923
When they caught him,
know what was in the cooler?

18
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:20,357
Their fingers?

19
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,162
Oh, gross!

20
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:28,125
It's a sheep's eye.
From the butcher shop.

21
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:32,042
When you die, the last thing you
see is on your retina

22
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:33,801
like a photograph.

23
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,276
Grandma says souls
live in the eyes.

24
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:39,285
The "soul" is an invention
of witch doctors.

25
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,639
There's someone out there!

26
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:09,795
There's no-one here.

27
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,764
There was. I heard him!

28
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:30,283
Howie?

29
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:33,240
Howie, is that you?

30
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,162
Howie, no more games,
you hear me?

31
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:01,843
Howie?

32
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:14,759
You forgot to close it.

33
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:16,758
No. You were the last one.

34
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:58,116
Jesus!

35
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,443
Why you guys sneaking around?

36
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,835
We weren't sneaking!

37
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:02,757
You were.

38
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,759
Like a pair of rats.

39
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,843
No!

40
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:57,801
Let me go.

41
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:03,837
In the house!

42
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:11,322
Halt!

43
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,722
Emily!
Wake up Emily.

44
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:43,643
Come back.

45
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:12,636
Let me go!

46
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,877
- Stay in there.
- Let me go!

47
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:18,397
What did you do to that "thing"?

48
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,159
You have no right!

49
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:10,283
Thirteen years later.

50
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:28,158
West.

51
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:31,841
What you got there?

52
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,405
That some kind of animal?

53
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:35,323
Why, Moncho?

54
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:36,715
Are you hungry?

55
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:38,996
Is that a rat?

56
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:42,763
Your powers of observation
are dubious at best.

57
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:46,236
Dubious?

58
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,042
Dubious.

59
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,596
You wanted me?

60
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:53,643
Yes.

61
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:54,958
Here.

62
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,565
New work assignment?

63
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:02,882
Dubious.

64
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:07,762
Oh, and it's "Sergeant" Moncho.

65
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,162
Ratty?

66
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,403
What did you do to Ratty?

67
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,360
Mother of God,
I ain't seen him, I swear.

68
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,364
I'm sick. Leave me alone.

69
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,085
Where is Ratty?

70
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:38,680
What's wrong, Cabrera?

71
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:40,759
Lose you stinky little pal?

72
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,677
Ask West if he's seen him.

73
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:46,806
West likes animals.

74
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,286
What do you mean?

75
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:51,806
Think about it,

76
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:55,435
"dubious".

77
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,836
Line up!

78
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:15,956
Let's move!

79
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,725
West, you seen my Ratty?

80
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:41,002
Is he missing?

81
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,078
You better tell me, Einstein!

82
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:46,239
Any identifiable characteristics?
Markings...

83
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,875
Who took him is
gonna get markings.

84
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:06,686
You the new doctor?

85
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:07,757
That's right.

86
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:09,280
That way to the Clinic?

87
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:10,960
Warden wants to see you.

88
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,206
In films, this is the Death House.

89
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,039
You wouldn't call it that.

90
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,360
What do you call it?

91
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,085
The Death House.

92
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:40,479
- Prisoners here are?
- Condemned to death.

93
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:48,447
Don't talk until
he talks to you first.

94
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,603
...are sex criminals.

95
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:53,156
As a woman,
that should repulse you.

96
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,637
It's very disturbing,
as a person.

97
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:01,644
But as a reporter it' s
an interesting statistic.

98
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:03,679
Good answer, Laura.

99
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:07,841
- Can I call you Laura?
- Certainly.

100
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:11,404
So, you don't believe
in rehabilitation.

101
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,485
Don't be naive, Laura.

102
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,164
I believe in what works.

103
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:20,480
Two thousand volts
of raw power from

104
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,884
a stand alone generator.

105
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,319
This works.

106
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:28,325
When a man sits in it

107
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,520
and I make every
new prisoner sit in it

108
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,881
they submit to my power.

109
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,361
Fascinating.

110
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,038
You're just saying that.

111
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,038
- Doctor Phillips?
- Yes, sir. Howard Phillips.

112
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,923
It's a pleasure, Warden Brando.

113
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:59,966
You graduated in the top
five per cent of your class.

114
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,957
You could have your pick ofjobs.

115
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:04,401
Why here?

116
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,035
Institutional medicine interests me...

117
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:08,796
Really?

118
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,520
Well. Yeah.

119
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,843
Hi. I'm Laura Olney.

120
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:14,645
I'm with Arkham Record.

121
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:18,402
Anything you say to me
will be quoted out of context.

122
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,207
Well in that case,
let me just say hi.

123
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:22,517
Hi.

124
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,600
We have a fully equipped
medical facility.

125
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,201
I'm sure you do,
but these are mine.

126
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:35,236
Do all doctors have such a
relationship with their tools?

127
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,806
You requested to have
a particular inmate

128
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,685
working in the infirmary.

129
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,362
We're understaffed and he
has a medical background.

130
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,126
Keep an eye on him.

131
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,317
Sir?

132
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:54,206
He thinks he's smarter than
everyone else, but he's not.

133
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:57,921
His attitude could infect others.

134
00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:58,883
"Infect"?

135
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:02,527
An idea can be like a disease.

136
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,565
If you discover a minor anomaly,

137
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:07,435
do you ignore it?

138
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:08,883
Fuck!

139
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:11,197
No, Doctor. No. You cut it.

140
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,959
Some growths are benign.

141
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,038
Not inside these walls.

142
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:18,797
Sir!

143
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:20,999
There's a situation!

144
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:23,522
0ut of the way!

145
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:25,076
It's the doctor!

146
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:30,205
Forgive me Father,
for I have sinned.

147
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:31,876
Hear my confession.

148
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:33,116
Just calm down.

149
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,926
The blood, the flesh,
the beating heart.

150
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,481
I had to eat it.
I had to eat it.

151
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,237
Don't send me to Hell.

152
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,080
Get the drop cloth.

153
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:58,841
Keep his back perfectly straight.

154
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:00,678
Sorry!

155
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,639
Keep your hands off me!

156
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:05,076
On three, okay?

157
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,677
One, two, three, lift!

158
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:10,280
This way, doctor.

159
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:11,763
0ut of the way!

160
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:13,155
Get the case.

161
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:21,039
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

162
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:24,716
I'm fine.

163
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:27,835
Where do we go?

164
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,201
What happened?

165
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,636
Heart attack.

166
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:37,680
Are you the new doctor?
Cute!

167
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,806
Get him on the table!

168
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,685
Nurse, set up the IV.

169
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:51,397
Hurry up!

170
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:52,397
Yes doctor.

171
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,356
Get me amiodarone.

172
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:56,676
- What?
- Amiodarone

173
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:57,882
We have none.

174
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,242
You have none?

175
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:00,476
It didn't come.

176
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,316
What have you got?

177
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:03,882
Try Sotalol.

178
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:05,841
It is similar.

179
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:07,836
Go get it!

180
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:14,916
Come on Nurse!

181
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:15,917
Coming!

182
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:23,803
I can't!

183
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:27,038
Could you help her, please?

184
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:38,719
Nurse, take these guys out of the way.

185
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,198
Everybody out!

186
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:42,635
And stay out there!

187
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:43,557
But...

188
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:44,876
Stay with them!

189
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:46,402
Clear!

190
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:48,965
You're wasting time.

191
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,276
Clear!

192
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:51,916
Come on!

193
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:52,883
Clear!

194
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:56,118
He was dead before he got here.

195
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:57,762
Goddammit!

196
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:05,635
He was my patient.

197
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:07,520
For five minutes.

198
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,599
You're the new doctor?

199
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:20,043
What is the meaning of this?

200
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,685
Doctor Herbert West.

201
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:28,840
I know all about you.

202
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:30,522
Really?

203
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:32,360
I know what you did.

204
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,444
They tried to cover it up.

205
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,206
Your experiments...

206
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,079
Don't believe what you hear.

207
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,600
I didn't hear it.

208
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:43,677
I saw.

209
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:50,762
That night they arrested you.
I was that kid.

210
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:04,199
I want to work with you.

211
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,837
Thirteen years...

212
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,038
There's bound to be
some deterioration.

213
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,245
The reactive base

214
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:33,878
may have destabilized

215
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:39,562
but maybe not.

216
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:45,246
What are you doing?

217
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:47,119
Seeing if it still works.

218
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,197
No!

219
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:51,606
Someone could come in.

220
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,678
We're treating a patient.

221
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,363
The top of the spinal cord!

222
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:02,002
0f course

223
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:05,281
. Hold his head.

224
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,602
Hold it.

225
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:09,396
Quickly.

226
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:24,245
How long will it take?

227
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:26,921
I don't think it's going to take.

228
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,239
We can increase the dosage.

229
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,682
No, no. It's not going to work.

230
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:36,003
It might on something else.

231
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:39,881
Thanks for bringing me
back my Reagent

232
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:41,446
such as it is.

233
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:43,476
Oh well...

234
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:45,956
Wait a minute.

235
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:48,242
Listen.

236
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,645
Think about it. Come on.

237
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:53,801
We can make more.

238
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,041
In here?

239
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:02,879
This place doesn't have basic
first aid, as you just found out.

240
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:07,396
But this is my clinic now.
What do you need?

241
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:14,326
It still works!

242
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:17,600
You're not dying.
How do you feel?

243
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:18,763
You hear me?

244
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:19,843
Stay away!

245
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:21,486
Can you hear me?

246
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:23,676
No!

247
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:29,006
We must sedate him!

248
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:38,315
Get the Thorazine!

249
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,917
50 cc.

250
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:10,681
No! No!

251
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,280
Forgive me, please.

252
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:21,875
Forgive me!

253
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:27,278
Dr. Phillips.

254
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:35,606
What the fuck's going?

255
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,280
He went crazy, sir.

256
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:42,645
Severe cardiac arrhythmia.

257
00:23:42,807 --> 00:23:44,320
A reaction to medication.

258
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,162
What medication?

259
00:23:54,087 --> 00:23:56,920
We administered 10 cc
of Sotalol but it

260
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,443
provoked an unexpected effect.

261
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,881
You call this
"an unexpected effect"?

262
00:24:03,047 --> 00:24:07,325
The patient suffered
arterial fibrillation.

263
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,998
His heart was beating too fast.

264
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,601
Allergic reaction is not unusual.

265
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:21,524
West, you've just added twelve
months to your sentence.

266
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:25,321
It's swollen.

267
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:29,040
Doctor Phillips, one of
my men is hurt.

268
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,560
I'll see to him.

269
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:34,480
Sergeant, that is
an immediate Lock-Down!

270
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:35,404
Yes, Sir!

271
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:46,485
The rest of your visit will be
outside of the security areas.

272
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:47,517
Warden...

273
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:48,324
West,

274
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,564
the lockdown includes you.

275
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:56,558
Doctor Phillips asked me for
a list of the supplies we need.

276
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:58,799
Right. I need that list.

277
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:03,081
Clean him up and
get him to the Hole!

278
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:06,203
Come on.

279
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:07,682
Get up.

280
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:13,046
West, get to your cell!

281
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:25,439
My last partner turned
State's evidence on me.

282
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,439
I expect better of you.

283
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:33,241
And watch out for her.
She's trouble.

284
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:18,323
Hi there.

285
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:24,077
Hi. Just organizing my notes.

286
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:28,236
You were right about my ankle.

287
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,559
I should stay off it.

288
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:32,763
Hard to push in the clutch.

289
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:34,999
How about I drive you home?

290
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:37,156
Are you sure?

291
00:26:40,447 --> 00:26:42,517
I'm putting you to trouble.

292
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,002
On a day like this,
it's no trouble.

293
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:53,116
Had yourself a big day, Moses.

294
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:57,806
Beat the hell out of 4 grown men
while having a heart attack.

295
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,520
How did you do that?

296
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:01,798
They gave you some medication.

297
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:06,800
What was it?

298
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:11,323
- I know why I'm here.
- Yes?

299
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:14,763
I'm dead, and this is Hell.

300
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:18,923
I'll show you what Hell is.

301
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,202
West!

302
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:31,961
You and me
have got to talk, man!

303
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:33,682
West!

304
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:37,042
West!

305
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:40,925
Sorry about the tofu...

306
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:43,436
I should know.

307
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:44,835
This pizza's great.

308
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:47,638
I've had a great time.

309
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:49,121
Great

310
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:52,604
The way you handled that
interview impressed me.

311
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,760
I did such a great job
I was thrown out.

312
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:03,279
State Penitentiary Progressive
Educational is so stupid.

313
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,798
Come on, don't give up.

314
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:07,998
Anything's possible.

315
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:11,199
See the possibilities
and seize the moment.

316
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:12,641
Go for it.

317
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:15,515
- "Go for it"?
- Yeah.

318
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:19,282
Okay, I'll "go for it".

319
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:22,561
What are you really
doing here?

320
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,285
"Institutional medicine".

321
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:32,044
Tell me about your
secret "I.M." research.

322
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:34,916
Of course.

323
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:41,683
I am investigating the effects of
institutionalization on life and death.

324
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:47,357
- Yes.
- Yeah.

325
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:52,605
Why do your residency
in the "joint"?

326
00:28:54,687 --> 00:28:57,406
Really. Why, Howard?

327
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:11,917
As a kid, I saw my sister die.

328
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:15,921
I'm so sorry.

329
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:18,516
I never want to
feel helpless again.

330
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,284
I tried to resuscitate her.

331
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:29,003
I wanted to bring her back.

332
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:32,276
Who was helping you today?

333
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:35,204
Doctor Herbert West.

334
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:39,965
He's a prisoner but, he worked
at a university hospital.

335
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:45,805
He researched death as a disease.

336
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:50,483
One of his reanimation
experiments lost control.

337
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,922
The man went crazy... violent.

338
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,486
Like the man today?

339
00:29:56,727 --> 00:29:58,638
And escaped
from the Morgue.

340
00:29:58,807 --> 00:29:59,762
The morgue?

341
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:01,485
He broke into our house.

342
00:30:10,287 --> 00:30:14,200
That expression
reminds me of Emily.

343
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:16,241
Your sister?

344
00:30:22,007 --> 00:30:23,156
You're going?

345
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:28,119
- It's been a long day.
- Yeah.

346
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,717
Looks like your ankle is better.

347
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,402
Yeah.

348
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,645
Seize the moment?

349
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,446
Go for it.

350
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,559
You got everything.

351
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:16,483
Moses isn't doing so good.

352
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:19,078
We need lab. Space,

353
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:21,165
somewhere private.

354
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,278
He doesn't seem human.

355
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,246
I think this will do.

356
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,006
He's a monster.

357
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,285
He was the freshest
specimen we could find.

358
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:53,961
It's a problem.

359
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:55,685
It is a problem!

360
00:31:56,527 --> 00:32:01,123
I want to help people, not
create mindless freaks!

361
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:03,119
Having second thoughts?

362
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:08,479
All medical research
requires risks.

363
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:11,356
If you don't see,
you shouldn't be here.

364
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:15,759
Soon I'll find a force to bring
order to that chaotic organism.

365
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:19,885
Away to restore
rational behaviour?

366
00:32:21,087 --> 00:32:24,841
I can now accelerate the
testing phase of my current work.

367
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,639
With your help.

368
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:33,443
This work requires commitment

369
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:35,245
and full confidentiality.

370
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,165
You must tell no one.

371
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:39,682
- I'll walk?
- Lipstick on your collar.

372
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:24,283
Doctor Phillips, I'm going
to be leaving now.

373
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:26,160
What's that for?

374
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:45,286
Doctor Phillips.
Do you need anything?

375
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,122
Are you there?

376
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:09,516
I was afraid you weren't coming.

377
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:11,479
I was working late.

378
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:12,716
On what?

379
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:15,123
Nothing. Just clinic stuff.

380
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:20,319
What are you doing,
investigating me?

381
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:21,715
- No.
- Yeah.

382
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:24,606
I was wondering how
the man was doing.

383
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,636
He's fine.

384
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:29,082
Really?

385
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:33,244
Doesn't seem human anymore.

386
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,646
We shouldn't have...

387
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:38,718
You shouldn't have, what?

388
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:44,281
What's the matter?

389
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:52,924
The story I'm on.
I figured out some stuff,

390
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:56,198
but it's just speculation.

391
00:34:57,287 --> 00:35:00,040
- You need hard facts.
- Yeah.

392
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:03,724
But to get them I'll
have to take some risks.

393
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:05,206
What do I do?

394
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:09,238
Play it safe, or "go for it"?

395
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,799
You've got to "go for it".

396
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:14,516
Really?

397
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:16,923
You got to take some chances.

398
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:21,517
That's what you're doing,
isn't it?

399
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:27,043
What's your new story about?

400
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,524
Can't tell you yet.

401
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:33,321
Secrets?

402
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:38,607
Every girl needs a few secrets.

403
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:54,006
It hurts so much.

404
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:55,999
I can't even spit, Doc.

405
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,486
I don't see anything.

406
00:35:57,727 --> 00:36:00,116
Once they gave me
little red pills,

407
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:02,676
Vicodin, made me feel better.

408
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:04,883
Little red pills. Little red

409
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:07,282
tits.

410
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:10,878
- Take two at bedtime.
- How about now?

411
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:14,116
Can I have more?

412
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:31,199
- Today's the day, cabrón.
- Today's the day.

413
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,439
I'll see you in the yard.

414
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:36,802
- You're a dead man.
- Adead man.

415
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,886
Today's the day.
It worked.

416
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:50,763
Reschedule the afternoon.

417
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:53,676
But doctor...

418
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:10,642
Now. To test it.

419
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:12,801
On who?

420
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,956
My story isn't working,
it's too impersonal.

421
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:31,439
Something's missing.
And it's you. You're the key.

422
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:36,882
The key?
To what?

423
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,607
To understanding how
this prison works.

424
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:44,484
Everything is an extension
of your philosophy.

425
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:48,123
I'd like another look around.

426
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:54,686
Afterwards I'll need you for
an in-depth interview.

427
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:59,362
I'd be happy to do the interview

428
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:02,524
- if...
- lf?

429
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:07,682
If we do it over dinner tonight.

430
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:11,445
You get to know
the man behind the office.

431
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:13,840
After my tour?

432
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:18,435
Consider Miss Olney
my personal guest.

433
00:38:18,607 --> 00:38:19,562
Yes, sir.

434
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:21,683
And give her the tour, again.

435
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,204
Why did you come back?

436
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:32,797
To finish a profile on you.

437
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:34,636
Really?

438
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,245
You are a fascinating man.

439
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,205
You're just saying that.

440
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:42,126
Tonight then.

441
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:48,758
Did you know
the human body loses

442
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:52,397
3 to 4 grms. Of weight
at the moment of death?

443
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:56,324
I heard about that.

444
00:38:56,527 --> 00:39:00,156
A rodent loses much less,
but the ratio is the same.

445
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:06,600
The cerebral cortex is the site

446
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:10,316
of an extraordinary
neuro-electric phenomenon.

447
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:11,837
Hold him.

448
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,236
Hold him

449
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:21,402
Tightly.

450
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:25,846
Ratty is not going
to be very happy.

451
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:32,406
This phenomenon,

452
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:36,204
NPE, Nano-Plasmic Energy,

453
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:38,802
is not just in the brain.

454
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:44,684
It moves throughout the nervous system,
and is present in every cell of the body.

455
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:47,886
Hold him a little.

456
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:53,004
Classic post-reanimation.
Confused, violent.

457
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:57,159
Like all my other
subjects to date.

458
00:39:57,887 --> 00:40:01,243
This brought him back
from the dead.

459
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:05,321
But this will give him true life.

460
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:06,278
What is that?

461
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:11,723
The Nanoplasm,
from a living donor rat.

462
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:15,076
Donor rat?

463
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:20,317
Now hold him.
Completely still.

464
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:28,799
This is the catalyst.

465
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:34,797
This is the force that tells
the cells how to grow.

466
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:03,886
It works!

467
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:10,642
Laura.

468
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:13,637
Doctor Phillips, how are you?

469
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,160
Why are you here?

470
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:17,683
Just, "going for it".

471
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:25,840
- That the way to the "hole"?
- Certainly is.

472
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:32,480
I would really like
to talk to him.

473
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:34,681
Not a chance.

474
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:40,125
My Editor gives
expenses for stories.

475
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,444
How much are we talking here?

476
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:54,957
The cell door has to be locked.

477
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:02,717
I'll be back in ten minutes.

478
00:42:03,927 --> 00:42:06,919
What if I need you?

479
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:08,355
Do I call?

480
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:12,083
Not a sound.
No one can know you're in there.

481
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,678
He can't hurt you
in that straight jacket.

482
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:35,445
Look who's coming.

483
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:42,885
She's going to see Moses.
Why else would she do there?

484
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,957
All right, give him to me.

485
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:03,762
Any last words pendejo?

486
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:11,556
Ratty?

487
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:20,160
What happened?

488
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:22,285
I gave him his pet back.

489
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:26,278
Are you gonna let him go?

490
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:28,005
Give Daddy a kiss.

491
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,960
What's wrong, Ratty?

492
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:35,404
Hi. I'm Laura Olney,
I'm a journalist.

493
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,042
I want to talk about what
happened the other day.

494
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,239
Do you remember what
Dr. West did to you?

495
00:43:53,127 --> 00:43:56,881
Did you die from
that heart attack?

496
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:05,762
Can I check your pulse?

497
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:14,523
Mother of God, forgive me.

498
00:44:15,727 --> 00:44:17,080
What happened to you?

499
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:23,560
- Hungry!
- Sergeant Moncho!

500
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,843
Thank God you're here.

501
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:31,521
You must think I'm an idiot.

502
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,277
No I don't. Really.

503
00:44:34,527 --> 00:44:36,643
You're a very intelligent man.

504
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:38,361
Fascinating.

505
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:47,717
- I don't like people lying to me.
- I wasn't lying.

506
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:54,042
Explain!

507
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:19,001
Give me that!

508
00:45:24,207 --> 00:45:25,526
He attacked me.

509
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:32,320
He's dead.

510
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:35,040
You're right.

511
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:37,726
What are you doing?

512
00:45:38,327 --> 00:45:41,956
I murdered him.
That's what they'll say.

513
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,882
You know the cretins out there.

514
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:48,399
It was self-defence.
You had no choice.

515
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,036
I'll swear to it.

516
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:08,002
Get down. You're going
to have to convince me.

517
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:10,683
Lower. Bark.

518
00:46:13,767 --> 00:46:16,440
- What?
- You heard me! Bark!

519
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:30,801
Am I the most fascinating
man you've met?

520
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:32,718
Yes.

521
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:35,124
And you'd do anything for me?

522
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:38,278
Yes, sir.

523
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:39,476
Show me.

524
00:46:44,207 --> 00:46:48,564
You bribed a guard, came in and
freed a dangerous prisoner. He

525
00:46:48,727 --> 00:46:49,557
got excited...

526
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,519
- I wanna get Moses up here.
- Why?

527
00:46:59,007 --> 00:47:00,565
To put this in him.

528
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,240
You've got more?

529
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:06,564
No. This is Ratty's NPE.

530
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:10,083
I gave Ratty the nanoplasm
of a different rodent.

531
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:12,715
- Aren't they different?
- Not at all.

532
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:17,160
Nanoplasm is a completely
neutral energy.

533
00:47:17,327 --> 00:47:20,717
It's the same in rats,
dogs, human beings.

534
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:24,841
- You want to put this in Moses?
- Yes.

535
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,117
Going from rat to rat is okay,

536
00:47:28,287 --> 00:47:31,677
but from species to
species is not right.

537
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:35,798
Not right?

538
00:47:39,807 --> 00:47:43,800
All this is the result of years
and years of painstaking

539
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:47,564
research under
incomprehensible conditions.

540
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:50,036
How dare you say
my work is wrong?

541
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:53,279
- You can't transfer the soul...
- The soul?

542
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:55,961
This is science,
not superstition.

543
00:47:56,127 --> 00:47:58,641
- This is a human being...
- Was human.

544
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:01,082
And will be again, with this.

545
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:03,843
Dr. Phillips?

546
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:05,602
1, 2, 3, up.

547
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:08,442
Dr. Phillips.

548
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,519
There's been an incident.

549
00:48:30,527 --> 00:48:31,562
No!

550
00:48:33,687 --> 00:48:34,597
No!

551
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:43,044
Moses killed her in the Hole.

552
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:44,680
He's dead, too.

553
00:48:45,207 --> 00:48:46,162
Dead?

554
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:49,402
The Warden needs
Death Certificates.

555
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:50,717
Now!

556
00:48:57,407 --> 00:48:58,806
Get rid of the nurse.

557
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:00,559
Nurse, help the officers.

558
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:01,921
- But...
- Get out!

559
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:29,801
- What if she ends up like Moses?
- She's not getting fresher.

560
00:49:32,007 --> 00:49:32,962
Come on.

561
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:44,687
- Top of the spinal cord, right?
- Right.

562
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:58,676
Thorazine?

563
00:49:59,647 --> 00:50:02,036
Don't want her getting
too excited.

564
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:05,203
Hurry up.

565
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:23,356
What's her name?

566
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:25,165
- Remember?
- Leave her!

567
00:50:36,047 --> 00:50:37,799
This is not a good idea.

568
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:52,200
What is she doing?

569
00:51:05,527 --> 00:51:07,324
We can't leave her like this!

570
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:09,405
Let's get her to the lab.

571
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:19,156
Stop here.

572
00:51:24,367 --> 00:51:25,766
Where did he go?

573
00:51:25,967 --> 00:51:28,356
He's got to be here, somewhere!

574
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:30,236
Look everywhere.

575
00:51:30,407 --> 00:51:31,556
Everywhere!

576
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:43,485
Poor little thing.

577
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,518
Come on, go get your food.

578
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:57,839
Let go, you freak.

579
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:13,843
What's going on?

580
00:52:14,887 --> 00:52:15,876
Give it back!

581
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:38,123
- You little...
- No!

582
00:52:39,007 --> 00:52:40,076
And why not?

583
00:52:40,247 --> 00:52:41,646
It's cross species.

584
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:43,718
Then she'll stay like this!

585
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:46,403
You can't experimenting on her.

586
00:52:46,607 --> 00:52:48,006
Now look, Rat NPE...

587
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:48,963
Dr. Phillips!

588
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,002
Get her down.

589
00:52:58,687 --> 00:53:00,245
Where is the body?

590
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:01,397
She...

591
00:53:04,287 --> 00:53:06,164
What is going on in here?

592
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:10,958
Mr West and I... we...

593
00:53:11,127 --> 00:53:12,924
You've set up a Lab.

594
00:53:15,007 --> 00:53:17,123
You're doing illegal research.

595
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:21,275
You'll lose your job for this,
and your medical license.

596
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:28,962
Move.

597
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:40,687
This is what you gave Moses.

598
00:53:44,247 --> 00:53:48,718
You are never going to see the
outside of these walls again.

599
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:54,159
No. No.

600
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:03,202
You're dead.

601
00:54:04,487 --> 00:54:05,078
No!

602
00:54:21,687 --> 00:54:22,802
Hold it there!

603
00:54:25,247 --> 00:54:26,362
Come back here.

604
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,126
Back in your cell!

605
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:32,475
It's party time!

606
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:50,121
What are you doing?

607
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,600
Wait. Just a second.

608
00:54:52,807 --> 00:54:56,163
Two thousand volts
of electric current will

609
00:54:56,527 --> 00:55:00,600
concentrate the nanoplasm to
the brain, so we can pull it off.

610
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,359
You'll electrocute him.

611
00:55:03,007 --> 00:55:04,235
That's the idea.

612
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:08,843
Only through, electrocution
can you

613
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,243
drive the nanoplasm to
the hypothalamus where

614
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:16,406
we can extract it at
the moment of death.

615
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:19,684
You wanna put his
nanoplasm into Laura?

616
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:23,044
Rodent to rodent, no problem.
But human to human?

617
00:55:23,447 --> 00:55:26,519
Do you want Laura
to stay like that?

618
00:55:28,247 --> 00:55:29,202
Sit him up.

619
00:55:29,407 --> 00:55:30,965
Head down on his chest.

620
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:32,958
Move!
Hold his head still!

621
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:42,165
Hold his head still!

622
00:55:44,327 --> 00:55:45,521
He's not dying!

623
00:55:46,527 --> 00:55:47,755
He's not dying!

624
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:51,204
Clear!

625
00:55:58,527 --> 00:55:59,596
That's enough!

626
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:02,563
Stop it!

627
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:03,796
He has to die.

628
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:24,205
Go to the infirmary.

629
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:25,163
Let's go!

630
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:34,482
Ratty!

631
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:36,477
Ratty!

632
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,080
Give daddy a kiss!

633
00:57:26,647 --> 00:57:29,036
Howard? Where am I?

634
00:57:29,247 --> 00:57:30,396
You're okay now.

635
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:34,959
Something happened to me.

636
00:57:35,927 --> 00:57:37,406
You could say that.

637
00:57:40,007 --> 00:57:41,918
Why are you looking at me?

638
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:44,642
Warden Brando strangled you.

639
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:46,481
You were dead.

640
00:57:46,727 --> 00:57:49,560
Doctor Phillips and
I brought you back.

641
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:52,603
What're you talking about?

642
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:54,722
Brought me back?

643
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,920
- I feel so...
- What?

644
00:58:00,007 --> 00:58:01,440
How do you feel?

645
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:15,839
That's interesting.

646
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:18,605
What's happening?

647
00:58:45,407 --> 00:58:48,046
I see what's going on here.

648
00:58:49,607 --> 00:58:52,121
You are using me as a guinea pig.

649
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:53,686
You let him do it!

650
00:58:53,847 --> 00:58:54,677
No!

651
00:58:55,887 --> 00:58:56,876
Stay away.

652
00:58:58,127 --> 00:58:59,446
Both of you.

653
00:59:08,807 --> 00:59:09,717
Stop!

654
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:14,635
Howard. Howard, please.

655
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,726
Please help me.

656
00:59:17,607 --> 00:59:18,596
Howard.

657
00:59:23,487 --> 00:59:24,442
West!

658
00:59:25,647 --> 00:59:27,080
Where are you Einstein?

659
00:59:27,407 --> 00:59:29,318
Hiding is not gonna do you...

660
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:34,395
Listen, Ratty's acting
really weird.

661
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:37,400
You fucked him up,
or gave me the wrong rat!

662
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:39,558
- Get your hands off!
- Guards!

663
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:43,276
There ain't no fucking guards.

664
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:44,880
This place is a riot.

665
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:49,518
- Look here.
- Leave her alone!

666
00:59:49,807 --> 00:59:51,081
What'd you say?

667
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,801
Stay away. She's sick.
Contagious.

668
00:59:54,447 --> 00:59:55,436
Sick?

669
00:59:56,327 --> 00:59:58,921
I got medicine,
make her feel better.

670
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:02,716
West took my ratty.
I'll take his little pussycat.

671
01:00:04,847 --> 01:00:06,439
What's happening Howard?

672
01:00:15,447 --> 01:00:17,119
You like it rough, huh?

673
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:31,282
Laura!

674
01:00:41,127 --> 01:00:42,162
Laura!

675
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,322
Over here.

676
01:00:46,047 --> 01:00:47,116
Come on!

677
01:00:49,047 --> 01:00:50,765
- Where is she?
- Who?

678
01:00:50,967 --> 01:00:52,605
Laura. The journalist.

679
01:00:52,767 --> 01:00:54,280
They were chasing her.

680
01:00:54,447 --> 01:00:56,677
- There was no woman.
- She's there.

681
01:00:56,847 --> 01:00:57,916
Seal it off!

682
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,039
Laura! Laura!

683
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:46,881
This way's dead!

684
01:01:47,607 --> 01:01:48,676
Shit!

685
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:03,240
Don't you play hide
and seek with me.

686
01:02:04,007 --> 01:02:06,646
Daddy has a big present for you.

687
01:02:09,047 --> 01:02:10,196
Cesar, find her.

688
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:53,763
Surprise!

689
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:34,320
Welcome back Warden.

690
01:03:35,247 --> 01:03:39,240
Before I leave, one last
experiment, and you're pertect.

691
01:03:40,127 --> 01:03:44,325
Those three years in
Solitary were very instructive.

692
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:49,197
I did my best work in there...
and this is the result.

693
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,358
Rodent to human.

694
01:03:54,287 --> 01:03:55,845
Neutral energy,

695
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:01,562
or behavioral imprinting?

696
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:04,485
Let's find out.

697
01:04:20,047 --> 01:04:22,117
West, you cretin.

698
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:24,646
You'll fry for this.

699
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:26,320
Do you hear that?

700
01:04:26,927 --> 01:04:30,806
There's a riot going on.
The animals are running the zoo.

701
01:04:31,407 --> 01:04:33,762
They'll make their way down here

702
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:34,996
quite soon.

703
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:41,599
I'd like to see the results,
but I can't.

704
01:04:41,807 --> 01:04:45,277
There's a new early
release programme

705
01:04:45,727 --> 01:04:47,001
and I qualify.

706
01:04:50,767 --> 01:04:55,158
I'll be sure and leave the door
wide open so they find you.

707
01:05:28,767 --> 01:05:30,246
Take these will you?

708
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:31,522
And these.

709
01:05:59,327 --> 01:06:01,204
Come on, come on.

710
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:36,886
Shit!

711
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:40,599
- It's the Warden.
- He's not Warden anymore.

712
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:49,240
You don't dare...

713
01:06:53,727 --> 01:06:55,399
I am always the Warden.

714
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:02,279
I need a doctor.

715
01:07:02,687 --> 01:07:05,440
Sergeant, you let that man go.

716
01:07:06,287 --> 01:07:08,437
Sergeant Moncho!
Straighten up!

717
01:07:14,007 --> 01:07:16,680
On your feet, Sergeant!

718
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:24,676
Stand up! That's an order!

719
01:07:27,327 --> 01:07:29,602
How can I get you
to follow orders?

720
01:07:39,367 --> 01:07:40,880
The good stuff!

721
01:08:10,527 --> 01:08:11,403
Laura!

722
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:15,042
Laura!

723
01:08:57,647 --> 01:08:59,877
Are these men
giving you a problem?

724
01:09:02,407 --> 01:09:03,920
I didn't do that.

725
01:09:04,087 --> 01:09:06,157
Well maybe I did.

726
01:09:07,407 --> 01:09:09,841
Or maybe they killed themselves.

727
01:09:10,367 --> 01:09:13,598
They couldn't stand living
with their crimes.

728
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:23,005
They couldn't stand looking
in the mirror one more day.

729
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:28,676
Me, I like what
I see in the mirror.

730
01:09:44,887 --> 01:09:47,879
The Death House was built
for one purpose.

731
01:09:48,327 --> 01:09:49,601
Punishment.

732
01:09:51,527 --> 01:09:54,837
The problem with execution
is it happens too fast.

733
01:09:55,047 --> 01:09:57,481
One moment of pain,
and you're dead.

734
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,001
You're off the hook.

735
01:10:01,207 --> 01:10:04,517
Today's criminals aren't
scared any more.

736
01:10:05,047 --> 01:10:07,038
He looks scared to me.

737
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:10,559
Just acting.
They're all actors here.

738
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:15,919
Execution is the kindest thing
we could do for them.

739
01:10:16,727 --> 01:10:18,843
But what if the agony of Death

740
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:22,164
didn't end in an instant

741
01:10:27,887 --> 01:10:30,685
but instead, was prolonged

742
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:34,400
indefinitely?

743
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:16,277
Move out!

744
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,196
Quick! Quick!

745
01:11:52,487 --> 01:11:53,476
No!

746
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:15,726
Mother of God. Forgive me.
Mother of God.

747
01:12:16,927 --> 01:12:19,487
Forgive me for I have sinned.

748
01:12:19,727 --> 01:12:21,206
It's all right.

749
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:26,480
I forgive you. It's all right.

750
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:45,196
Laura!

751
01:12:52,767 --> 01:12:53,722
Laura!

752
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,117
Laura!

753
01:12:59,927 --> 01:13:01,406
Lose something?

754
01:13:01,647 --> 01:13:03,046
She changed.

755
01:13:03,207 --> 01:13:05,277
You were wrong.
She changed!

756
01:13:05,567 --> 01:13:07,046
It was a theory.

757
01:13:08,207 --> 01:13:09,526
Oh God, I hate you!

758
01:13:09,767 --> 01:13:12,042
You and your sick experiments!

759
01:13:13,047 --> 01:13:15,197
What was I thinking?

760
01:13:15,367 --> 01:13:17,961
Laura was right.
You killed my sister.

761
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:19,799
An unfortunate incident.

762
01:13:19,967 --> 01:13:21,320
Emily's no incident!

763
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:24,001
Nothing we can do
about your sister.

764
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:27,115
But we can still save
your girlfriend.

765
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:28,522
Laura!

766
01:13:28,927 --> 01:13:30,360
Her name is Laura!

767
01:13:30,847 --> 01:13:32,803
- Try the Death House?
- What?

768
01:13:32,967 --> 01:13:35,117
Did you look in the Death House?

769
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,125
If the Warden found her,
he took her there.

770
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:40,482
The Warden? But, he's dead.

771
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:46,319
God damn you!

772
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:49,926
Religion has got nothing
to do with this.

773
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,723
In position!

774
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:53,684
Come out with your hands up.

775
01:13:54,487 --> 01:13:55,476
Help me!

776
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,398
Hand over your head!

777
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,325
Hands over your head!

778
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:08,719
I see the light!

779
01:14:09,567 --> 01:14:11,478
I'm saved!

780
01:14:11,767 --> 01:14:13,485
Thank you God!

781
01:14:14,927 --> 01:14:16,155
I'm saved!

782
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:17,476
Hold your fire!

783
01:14:18,207 --> 01:14:20,038
Thank you God.

784
01:14:21,247 --> 01:14:22,839
I'm hungry!

785
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:00,882
Great.

786
01:15:03,247 --> 01:15:05,841
It's great what
you did back there.

787
01:15:15,487 --> 01:15:16,761
I like you.

788
01:15:20,047 --> 01:15:21,765
I like you very much.

789
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,436
0n your knees.

790
01:15:27,887 --> 01:15:29,878
Would you prefer punishment?

791
01:15:32,247 --> 01:15:34,317
That's a good girl.

792
01:15:36,687 --> 01:15:38,518
Give daddy a kiss.

793
01:15:43,327 --> 01:15:44,123
Sergeant!

794
01:15:46,967 --> 01:15:48,400
Go stand guard!

795
01:16:24,207 --> 01:16:25,117
What was that?

796
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:31,997
You bitch!

797
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:43,520
That's Laura.

798
01:16:55,287 --> 01:16:56,356
Come on!

799
01:16:58,847 --> 01:16:59,996
Your ass is mine!

800
01:17:50,327 --> 01:17:51,362
Laura!

801
01:18:07,407 --> 01:18:09,204
It's, it's in me...

802
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:11,919
it's taking over.

803
01:18:12,527 --> 01:18:14,757
You have to get it out!

804
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:16,280
I can't.

805
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:17,920
Please.

806
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,436
Please.

807
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:25,003
Don't let it go on,
you have to kill it.

808
01:18:42,327 --> 01:18:43,680
Kill me?

809
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:08,680
Fascinating.

810
01:19:09,407 --> 01:19:11,238
I was a piece of ass for you.

811
01:19:11,407 --> 01:19:13,159
No, never.

812
01:19:24,567 --> 01:19:25,886
This is mine.

813
01:19:26,047 --> 01:19:26,684
Fucker!

814
01:19:26,847 --> 01:19:28,724
You've been holding out on me!

815
01:19:30,247 --> 01:19:31,885
You can't keep this.

816
01:19:32,047 --> 01:19:33,924
This is awesome.

817
01:19:34,127 --> 01:19:36,277
This green shit rocks, man.

818
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,402
Give it to me.

819
01:19:38,247 --> 01:19:40,283
Sorry. I can't.

820
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:41,562
Prison rules.

821
01:19:41,727 --> 01:19:44,400
You can't share needles.
It's not safe.

822
01:19:44,887 --> 01:19:46,798
Now, fuck off.
I need some privacy here.

823
01:19:46,967 --> 01:19:48,400
I wouldn't if I were you.

824
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:53,724
Fortunately, right now cabrón,

825
01:19:55,007 --> 01:19:56,759
you are not, me.

826
01:20:48,287 --> 01:20:49,515
Hey man!

827
01:20:49,687 --> 01:20:50,915
Got any more?

828
01:20:51,287 --> 01:20:52,800
Just another hit.

829
01:20:53,887 --> 01:20:55,240
You had enough.

830
01:20:55,487 --> 01:20:57,079
How about some Vicodin?

831
01:20:57,247 --> 01:20:59,522
The little red pills. Vicodin.

832
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:17,077
Stop!

833
01:21:18,967 --> 01:21:20,082
Howard.

834
01:21:22,207 --> 01:21:23,435
Laura?

835
01:21:23,807 --> 01:21:25,035
Howard, please!

836
01:22:27,287 --> 01:22:30,085
Warden Brando, is that you?

837
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:52,882
Where is it?

838
01:22:53,047 --> 01:22:54,719
- What?
- You know what.

839
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:56,845
Where's my work?

840
01:23:32,367 --> 01:23:35,086
That's quite enough of you.

841
01:23:35,527 --> 01:23:36,562
Ratty.

842
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:14,763
This experiment is over.

843
01:24:24,807 --> 01:24:28,117
Please Howard.
Please stop me.

844
01:24:35,047 --> 01:24:38,562
You will be punished for this.

845
01:24:42,967 --> 01:24:44,400
You're being punished.

846
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:49,601
Kill me, Howard.

847
01:25:02,367 --> 01:25:04,039
Go for it, Howie.

848
01:25:06,847 --> 01:25:08,041
I'm the Warden!

849
01:25:11,327 --> 01:25:12,726
Guilty as charged.

850
01:25:30,407 --> 01:25:31,965
Halt! In position now!

851
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:33,676
Move, move, move!

852
01:25:52,487 --> 01:25:53,602
Howard?

853
01:25:56,047 --> 01:25:58,402
I had to kill her...
to get it out.

854
01:25:59,247 --> 01:26:00,396
To save her.

855
01:26:03,007 --> 01:26:04,804
But I want her back.

856
01:26:08,727 --> 01:26:10,683
It'll be all right, Emily.

857
01:26:12,287 --> 01:26:13,322
I'll take care of you.

858
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:34,766
Hold it right there!

859
01:26:38,487 --> 01:26:39,636
You okay?

860
01:26:43,207 --> 01:26:44,037
She's alright.

861
01:26:47,527 --> 01:26:48,880
I gave her life.

862
01:26:57,847 --> 01:26:58,802
Halt!

863
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:02,639
This man is critical.
I need to get him to hospital!

864
01:27:02,807 --> 01:27:05,560
- Who are you?
- Doctor Phillips.

865
01:27:05,727 --> 01:27:07,763
I run the infirmary.
Who are you?

866
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:09,645
Who's responsible if hedies?

867
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:11,762
Okay, go! Go!

868
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:17,876
Dubious... dubious.

869
01:27:26,287 --> 01:27:27,356
Hey! Take him.

870
01:27:32,967 --> 01:27:34,161
I saved her.

871
01:27:34,847 --> 01:27:35,723
Tell him.

872
01:27:35,887 --> 01:27:37,479
Tell him I saved you!

873
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,156
Emily?

874
01:27:41,567 --> 01:27:42,283
Laura?

875
01:27:43,767 --> 01:27:44,802
Emily?

876
01:27:46,567 --> 01:27:47,636
