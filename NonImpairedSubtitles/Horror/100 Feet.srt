1
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,417
What're you looking at?

2
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,753
Nothing.

3
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,714
Shanks, what's your status?

4
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,757
Yeah, I got her in the car now.
She's not going anywhere.

5
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,992
Listen, we hit a little traffic
on the BQE.

6
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,128
Running a little late,
tell Jimmy, to meet us at the house.

7
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,061
- Over.
- Copy.

8
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,011
Here we are.

9
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,571
Home sweet home.

10
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,211
Enjoy the fresh air.

11
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,983
Last time you'll get to.

12
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,630
- Now, let's go.
- I'm goin'.

13
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,930
Let's go.

14
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,882
Hasn't changed much, has it?

15
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,348
Hey!

16
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,884
- You're late.
- Yeah, traffic.

17
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,386
- Hi, I'm Jimmy.
- Hi.

18
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,854
- Let's get started.
- All right.

19
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,232
Yeah, it's a bit bulky.

20
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,000
Actually, I keep requesting
the smaller ones,

21
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,637
but the department won't spend
the money, so...

22
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:46,195
Just put the fucking thing on her.

23
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,001
I'm gonna need your leg, please.

24
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,196
Is that too tight?

25
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,031
- What, is this a date?
- No, it's fine.

26
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,900
There you go.

27
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,903
Now, it stays on your ankle
all the time.

28
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,272
It never comes off,
even when you shower.

29
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,141
Key stays with me.
You're now under house arrest,

30
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,011
and you'll remain on these premises
for the duration of your entire sentence.

31
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,646
- Understand?
- Yep.

32
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,478
Good. Jimmy, show her
how this thing works.

33
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,718
You're free to move anywhere
within 100 foot radius.

34
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,689
If you go past the 100 foot perimeter,
an alarm activates.

35
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,292
If the alarm continues
for more than 3 minutes,

36
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,661
a signal will automatically be sent,

37
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,763
and the cops will be dispatched
to the scene immediately.

38
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,890
That would be me.

39
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,435
Break house arrest,
you go back to jail.

40
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:55,964
Any violation automatically adds
10 years to your sentence, you get it?

41
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,373
- Do you get it?!
- Yeah, I get it!

42
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,415
Um, also, if you attempt to remove
the electronic ankle bracelet...

43
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,650
or otherwise tamper
with the base unit...

44
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,321
again, an alarm will automatically
alert the police.

45
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,186
Just try it.

46
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,494
Okay.

47
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,297
I wanna make sure that you have maximum
mobility within this restricted area.

48
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,528
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- You're welcome.

49
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,973
Now, the base unit comes
with its own power source...

50
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:07,035
so even if we get a blackout
or something, it's live.

51
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,078
Ms. Watson, go to
the front door, please.

52
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,081
Good.

53
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,054
Good.

54
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,524
What do you think you're doing?

55
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,031
I gotta get the mail, don't I?

56
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,706
Any questions?

57
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,301
None on my end.
How about you, Lou?

58
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,045
Goodbye.

59
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,138
You got it.

60
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,116
Have a nice day, now.

61
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,004
You'd think you guys,
would clean that up.

62
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,802
You made the mess,
you clean it up.

63
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:13,111
Here you got the next year to sit in
this house and think about what you did.

64
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,046
I hope it doesn't give you
a minute's peace.

65
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,679
You, son of a bitch!

66
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,855
If you'd have answered
just one of my 9-1-1 calls...

67
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,347
or taken any of my police
reports seriously...

68
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,328
Mike would be alive today.

69
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,597
You didn't have to kill my partner.

70
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,498
Better him than me.

71
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,113
Carol!

72
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,808
What do you mean you have no one
in the area to turn the power on?

73
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:48,540
I called Con-Ed twice today, the guy
said he'd be here between 1 and 4.

74
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,481
Not util Monday?

75
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:54,679
Oh, man! I gotta go the whole
weekend with no electricity?

76
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,521
That's just great.

77
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,353
No, no, that's it.
Thank you.

78
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,241
Hello.

79
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,911
Honey, your fine ass better be in front
of a color TV watching American Idol...

80
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:58,016
with a Hagen-Daz in one hand and a bottle
of Johnnie Walker in the other.

81
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,584
What's up, girlfriend?!

82
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,189
Same bitches different day, you know.
How's everything on the outside, baby?

83
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,723
Well, I'm home, Chandra.

84
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:09,227
But, you know, they gave me one of those
electronic bracelet thingies, you know?

85
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,229
So it's like I'm sort
of still in jail.

86
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,232
Stop feeling sorry for yourself,
go get laid.

87
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,468
Oh, I don't know how much action
I'm gonna see stuck in this house.

88
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,670
Use the phone, make a booty call.

89
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,739
You don't know how lucky you are.

90
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,509
You make damn sure,
you never come back here.

91
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,613
Rosey and Johnson are still in solitary
for that shit they did to you.

92
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,883
I could never go back inside,
I'd die first.

93
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,453
Listen, my time is up. I gotta go,
but I'm glad you're home.

94
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,590
The girls in Cell Block "C"
say hi.

95
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,023
- Call me.
- Come visit.

96
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,997
Who's there?

97
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,713
Oh, shit.

98
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,653
Oh, no...

99
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,693
Oh, no, no, God!

100
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,423
Please don't be a rat.

101
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,368
Oh, God!

102
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,677
Oh, my God, you scared
the shit out of me!

103
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,749
Come here.

104
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,307
Hey.

105
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,517
Come on, it's okay.

106
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,822
Come here.

107
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,888
Come on.

108
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,928
Hi... it's okay.

109
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,848
I ain't gonna hurt you!

110
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,586
Get back... get back,
or I'll use this! Back off!

111
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,087
- How did you get in?
- Don't cut me!

112
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,023
- How'd you get in?
- An open window in the basement.

113
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,159
- The basement? That's where you been staying?
- Yeah, in the basement.

114
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,461
- Get out! Get out! Get out!
- I'm going.

115
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,089
- Get out!
- I'm going!

116
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,937
Hi, is this Christine's?
Do you deliver?

117
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,185
- Who's there?
- Christine's delivery.

118
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,710
Oh... huh, hang on a sec.

119
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,027
- Hi.
- Hi, huh...

120
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:48,202
it's a long story,
oh, come in.

121
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,443
Huh... where'd you want these?

122
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,537
Kitchen... huh,
just down the hall.

123
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,722
Oh... huh, anywhere.

124
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,836
- You... huh, just moved in?
- Yeah.

125
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,572
Well, not exactly.

126
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,674
It's my house,
I... I was away for awhile.

127
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,309
I live just up the street.

128
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,612
This place was closed up
for the longest time. I thought...

129
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,841
the cops had...

130
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,917
I don't know.

131
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,443
- It's a nice place.
- Oh, thanks.

132
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,524
- I'm Marnie.
- I'm Joey, hi.

133
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,460
Hi, Joey, huh...

134
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,598
I need you to bring me groceries
regularly, is that okay with you?

135
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,231
The market's right around the corner.

136
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,569
Yeah, I know, I'm... I'm
kinda the stay-at-home type.

137
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,731
That's cool, I can use the tips.

138
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,569
Right.

139
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,741
- How's five?
- Yeah, thanks, that'll be cool.

140
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,284
So... um, what do you do?

141
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,121
Oh, I... I work out of the house.

142
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,749
Right... well, cool.

143
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,125
Okay, well...

144
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,617
Yeah, well, I guess,
I should be getting back.

145
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,195
- Alright, see you around, Ms. Watson.
- Marnie.

146
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,066
Okay! Nice to meet you, Marnie.

147
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,776
Robbing the cradle.

148
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,960
What happened?

149
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,230
I fell down.

150
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,804
No, what happened, Marnie?

151
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,469
- I don't remember.
- You remember prison?

152
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,484
How did you get a bruise
on the side of your face?

153
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,053
I don't know. I guess
it happened when I...

154
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,356
- I fell down and hit my head.
- Oh, really? No.

155
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:03,383
You don't get a bruise on the side of
your face when you fall on your head.

156
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,663
It looks like a person did that.

157
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,565
It wasn't a person.

158
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,830
Marnie, was there somebody
in this house with you last night?

159
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,993
No.

160
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,340
- You covering for somebody?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

161
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,575
I'm asking you.

162
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,611
Is somebody beating on you and for
some reason you're covering for them?

163
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,546
No! Why would I do that?

164
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,454
- All right.
- Thanks.

165
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:39,620
I guess living in a house where you killed
your husband must be tough on anyone, huh?

166
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,568
I thought you would have
cleaned that up.

167
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,821
There's no such thing as ghosts.

168
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:01,194
I think I found one, cat.

169
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,287
Yeah... huh, is this Magnum Sales?

170
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,991
Yeah, I'm calling about your ad saying
you're looking for phone sales people.

171
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:24,051
It says here you can work out
of your own home.

172
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,640
Who's there?

173
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,172
Who the fuck is there?

174
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,594
Thank you, Con-Ed.

175
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,709
That's what's wrong with me.
Caffeine withdrawal.

176
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,120
You had it coming!
You hear me?!

177
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,554
You had it coming!

178
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,588
You beat the shit out
of me for years!

179
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,528
And when you were
on the juice it was worse.

180
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:28,269
It's your fault you're dead.
You, bastard!

181
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,472
You were gonna kill me.

182
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,988
This is my house.

183
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,457
And I'm not leaving, you hear me?!

184
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:51,723
This is my house!
You'll have to kill me first!

185
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,024
Hi.

186
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:27,392
Well, I see you haven't lost
your flair for the dramatics.

187
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,343
Oh... huh, I cut myself shaving.

188
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,045
I can't believe you came.

189
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,564
Well, I left a message, I told you
I was coming by with the papers.

190
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:48,815
I know, but, I... I thought maybe you
send your assistant or something.

191
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,122
Well, what you wanna do?
Do it here, or do it inside?

192
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:55,422
Oh, in here, come in.

193
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,320
Sit down.

194
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,168
So I see you're still biting your nails.

195
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,572
Yeah. Thanks for noticing.

196
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:13,310
I'm... I'm glad you're out,
and doing well.

197
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:17,838
Well, it's not a penthouse overlooking
Central Park, but it's home.

198
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,277
And now it's your home.

199
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,886
I'm gonna make some coffee.
Want some coffee?

200
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,821
No, thanks.

201
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,172
Look, I have no idea why it was
mom's dying wish...

202
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:29,926
that you should have this place
when you got out, but,

203
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,724
I couldn't talk her out of it.

204
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,065
I don't understand
why you're so angry at me.

205
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,067
Just sign the goddamned papers,
Marnie.

206
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,102
No. Not until you tell me.

207
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,437
Tell you what?

208
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,173
That mom drained her life
savings to defend you?

209
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,342
That I had to watch
as the stress killed her?

210
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:49,381
And then to top it all off, she used her
life insurance to pay for this dump for you?

211
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:52,076
Is that what this is about?
Money?

212
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,552
You really don't get it, do you?

213
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,952
This is about you.

214
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,924
It's always been about you.

215
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,327
Precious little Marnie.

216
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,027
I thought you worked this stuff
out in therapy.

217
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:07,564
You know, that's exactly
what I would expect from you.

218
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,132
You create all kinds of problems...

219
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:13,193
and then, you just assume everyone else
is gonna clean them up for you.

220
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,599
This is the end of the line for me.

221
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,249
So, what are you gonna do now?

222
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,251
Go back to your fabulous life
of book publishing...

223
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,420
and tell all your socialite pals,
you're an only child?

224
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,946
And to think I never thought
you caught on that quickly.

225
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:48,972
It's ironic, isn't it?

226
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,409
After all these years you're the
one who got all the attention.

227
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,879
And now you'll spend
the next year in this hole...

228
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,281
with no one but the rats
to fall for your shit.

229
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,219
Trick or treat!

230
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,621
Hey.

231
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,582
Thanks.

232
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,833
- Marnie, you okay?
- Yeah, never better, come in.

233
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,761
- What happened?
- Well, I fell down the stairs.

234
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,036
To bad.

235
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,260
My Pop had to wear one
of those for 6 months.

236
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:01,030
I don't know who it was harder on,
him or my Mom, but...

237
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:05,432
she said things were a lot easier when he
wasn't hanging around the house all the time.

238
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:11,129
- How long you gotta wear it?
- Longer than 6 months.

239
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:15,277
- Yeah. I know.
- You do?

240
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:25,155
Talk around the neighborhood is,
some cop got killed by his wife.

241
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:29,292
This place was empty for years,
then you moved back.

242
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,590
It's what they are.

243
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,030
So, people been talking about me, huh?

244
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,099
Yeah, I guess.

245
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,867
- Bad stuff?
- Those people are idiots.

246
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,003
Those people used
to be my friends, Joey.

247
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,006
Carol next door, Romeros
down the block.

248
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,607
We used to have 'em over
for barbecues.

249
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,633
I mean, I used to watch their kids,
for christ sakes.

250
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,948
Now they don't want anything
to do with me.

251
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,439
Hey, screw those jack-asses.

252
00:40:56,854 --> 00:41:00,345
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

253
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,764
So, huh...

254
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:11,757
what's the deal?
I mean, what happened?

255
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:15,034
I don't know if...
if I should talk about it.

256
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:21,001
That's a... that's cool if you don't
wanna talk, but if you do, it's okay.

257
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,145
We married right out of high school.

258
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,877
And we were really in love.

259
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:35,525
But, as soon as Mike joined the force,
he changed.

260
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,289
He hated his job, hated it.

261
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,726
And he brought it home with him.

262
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,627
That's when the beatings started.

263
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,509
People didn't see the bruises?

264
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,273
He knew how, not to leave marks.

265
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,409
You must've reported it
to the police, right?

266
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,385
Yeah, I filed 6 police reports, Joey.

267
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,921
His buddies investigated it.

268
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,514
Mike denied it all.

269
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,857
And then he beat the crap
out of me again.

270
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,798
I had nobody to turn to,
nothing I could do.

271
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:23,799
So I saw a lawyer
and I filed for divorce.

272
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:27,935
I was gonna move back
to my Mom's, but...

273
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,343
papers got shuffled and then
he got served a day early.

274
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:41,250
- He came at me with a knife, he...
- It's okay.

275
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,751
- I got so scared.
- It's okay.

276
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,469
Somehow, something came
outta me, you know, I...

277
00:42:53,470 --> 00:43:00,170
I... I got the knife away from him
and I just... I... I went at him...

278
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,844
I stabbed him three times.

279
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:15,118
Side... neck... chest.

280
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:25,193
He... he died over there
in the corner.

281
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,265
752 days ago.

282
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,813
I knew, I committed a terrible crime.

283
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:51,650
A terrible, terrible crime.

284
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,364
But I'm not a murderer,
I'm not.

285
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,533
Look, I wanna be your friend, all right?

286
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,503
So, I figure you need
some right now.

287
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,131
I don't give a crap what anybody says.

288
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,608
- I'd like that.
- Yeah?

289
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,810
- Yeah.
- Good.

290
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,903
All right, well...

291
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,039
this...

292
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:16,416
is... my house number.

293
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,822
And... this...

294
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,586
is my cell.

295
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,595
- Okay?
- Okay.

296
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,928
You call me if you need anything, all right?

297
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,100
This means a lot.

298
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,142
Like I said, anything you need.

299
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,771
Oh, yeah, actually, there is something.

300
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,040
Name it.

301
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:50,214
Could you go to the library
and get me some books?

302
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,656
Sure, what kind of books?

303
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,456
Ones about ghosts.

304
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:03,081
In order to cleanse an area
of an unhealthy spirit...

305
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:05,802
it is first required, that said
area be thoroughly...

306
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:11,235
eradicated of all the decedent's earthly
possessions, belongings and reminders.

307
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,075
What do you think?

308
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,714
You have nine lives,
what do you care?

309
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,018
The easiest way to get rid of a
ghost is to simply ask it to leave.

310
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:22,418
Okay.

311
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:26,189
Use a firm voice and tell the ghost
exactly what you want and why.

312
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,791
This is the traditional practice
of smudging a home.

313
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:32,628
To get rid of an unwanted entity, crack
a window in each room of your home...

314
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,067
take a dried bundle of sage
and smudge your home...

315
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:37,467
clearing out any negative
or stagnant energies.

316
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:41,637
Smudging is simply lighting the sage bundle
and walking around your entire home...

317
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:45,441
allowing the smoke to circulate
and cleanse the energy and space.

318
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,578
The main thing is your intent,
which is your faith.

319
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,983
Your intentions are to rid the home
of negative energies and spirits.

320
00:45:51,984 --> 00:45:55,042
They will know this,
if they are there...

321
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:00,250
Oh, fuck!

322
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,796
All right...

323
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,911
1-1000... 2-1000... 3-1000...

324
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,715
4-1000... 5-1000... 6-1000...

325
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:29,519
7-1000... 8-1000... 9-1000...

326
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,290
10-1000... 11-1000... 12-1000...

327
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,488
Okay, okay... everything...

328
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,634
Oh, shit!

329
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,143
Prick!

330
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:52,624
Marnie, open the door, it's Shanks!

331
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,194
Marnie!

332
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,966
What the fuck is going on here?

333
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,410
- Nothing.
- Bullshit, I heard screaming.

334
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,823
- Now what happened to you?
- I fell out of bed.

335
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,364
It looks like somebody's
been beating on you.

336
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,464
Oh, yeah? Like who?

337
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,633
It's just me here, Shanks,
you should know that.

338
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,835
You've been staking out the place
day and night like a stalker.

339
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:36,066
Well, there's been people coming
in and out of this house.

340
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:39,972
Is there somebody in this house
right now with you, Marnie?

341
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,412
- Define somebody.
- Meaning what?

342
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:46,381
Look around...
let me know what you find.

343
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,466
This is the police!

344
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,503
Anybody in this house, step out
with your hands on your head!

345
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,445
Come out with your hands up!

346
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,432
He must have slipped out the back
before I got here, huh?

347
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,661
What the hell do you want?

348
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,569
You're not telling me something.

349
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,415
Marnie...

350
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,676
Marnie, did somebody else
kill Mickey?

351
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,626
- What are you talking about?
- I'm asking you.

352
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:07,619
Did somebody kill him
and forced you to take the rap?

353
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,231
No.

354
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,770
Has that person come back here to make
sure, that you keep your mouth shut?

355
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:15,237
Is that what's going on here?

356
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,107
No, that's not it.

357
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,268
I think that is it.

358
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:25,114
I think that is it 'cause you're not
even back in this house for a day...

359
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:28,447
before somebody starts
smacking you around.

360
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,648
I think they're back.
I think they're here...

361
00:51:31,649 --> 00:51:34,523
I think they're threatening
you again, that's it, isn't it?

362
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:37,219
- Isn't it?!
- I wish.

363
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,932
Marnie, who killed Mickey?

364
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,470
Who killed Mike, Marnie?

365
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,672
- I did.
- Bullshit!

366
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:52,664
Who really killed Mickey?

367
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,318
It's that kid, isn't it?

368
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,354
Yeah, the one who's delivering
the groceries.

369
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,957
You don't think I do
my fucking job, Marnie?

370
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:12,261
Joseph DiCenzo, did six in Juvi
for grand theft auto.

371
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:15,166
That little mother fucker killed my partner,
I swear to God I'll kill him myself!

372
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:16,732
You leave him alone, okay?

373
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,901
You leave him alone,
Lou, he's just a kid, okay?

374
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,670
He's my friend! He hangs out
and he talks to me is all!

375
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,640
Why are you covering
for Mike's killer?!

376
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,243
Let me help you, Marnie!

377
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,145
Let me help you,
you don't have to be afraid.

378
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,414
Just tell me!
Who the fuck killed Mike?

379
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,851
Just tell me who did it,
we'll put him down together.

380
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:40,185
We'll put his ass in jail, and you
can go, wherever the fuck you want!

381
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,492
Let me help you!
Let me protect you!

382
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,324
You can't protect me!

383
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,310
Marnie, I went back
and I looked...

384
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,214
I looked in Mike's files.

385
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,489
I saw all the assault reports
you filed on him.

386
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,397
It was just like you said.

387
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:30,969
I should have done something,
but, Marnie, he was my partner.

388
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,905
And now I gotta live with that.

389
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,809
But I will protect you now, Marnie.

390
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,420
I give you my word.

391
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,816
But you gotta talk to me.

392
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,829
You wouldn't believe me.

393
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,165
Try me.

394
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,146
Mike did this to me.

395
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,452
Marnie, Mike's dead.

396
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:20,256
Yeah? Well, he's taking the news badly.

397
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,053
What?

398
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,690
He's a ghost.

399
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:35,761
- A ghost?
- Yeah, that's right.

400
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,141
You know that line,
"Till death do us part"?

401
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,700
Well, that's a crock of shit.

402
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,749
You're crazy.

403
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:55,186
You're fucking nuts,
I can see it in your eyes.

404
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:59,893
And now you're here,
you're back under Mike's roof...

405
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,363
and you're going nuts.

406
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,263
Wow! Lady, lady, lady, lady!

407
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,198
You can't pack your trash like that!

408
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,735
You gotta wrap it properly
or I just can't take it!

409
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,637
Come on, Mister, please,
just this one time, okay?

410
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:45,341
- I promise next time I'll do it.
- I told everybody on my route...

411
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,900
Lady! Lady!

412
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,156
Oh, fuck!

413
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:30,697
I can't get rid of you
if you left something here, Prick!

414
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,067
Where is it, huh?

415
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,676
Where the fuck is it?

416
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,982
Fuck!

417
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,220
Come on, huh?
Where is it?

418
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,859
God-dammit!

419
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,032
Oh, my God!

420
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,039
Oh, Mike...

421
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:38,752
you were one dirty cop.

422
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,305
Thank you, for coming, Father.

423
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,280
I wanted to give you this.

424
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,942
A donation,
I wanna make to the church.

425
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,687
It was my husband's.

426
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:02,193
It's been a long time, since you've
been to confession, Marnie.

427
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:06,374
I'm here now if there is anything
you wanna tell me.

428
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:10,435
Perhaps you could unburden
yourself of any guilt.

429
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,148
I understand this isn't
the ideal confessional...

430
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:17,448
but whatever you say will be
strictly between us.

431
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:24,559
Oh, please, help me, Father.

432
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,926
I don't know what to do.
Help me.

433
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:35,030
Did you kill your husband,
with murder in your heart, Marnie?

434
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,737
Search your soul.

435
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,532
No.

436
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,046
No.

437
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,106
I was defending myself.

438
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:54,246
Then I pray you find peace.

439
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,161
Thank you, Father.

440
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:11,134
One last thing, Father.

441
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,302
Could you bless this house for me?

442
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,516
No...

443
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:24,348
I don't think I can do that.

444
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,414
The money's gone, Mike.

445
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,844
I gave it to the church.

446
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:05,257
The last thing in this house
that belonged to you, is gone.

447
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,959
There's nothing keeping you here.

448
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,434
This is my house now.

449
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:21,132
I want you to leave
and be at peace.

450
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:32,583
I want you to leave my house, Mike.

451
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,758
It's time for you to go.

452
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,769
I hope you can forgive me.

453
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,370
I bear you no ill will.

454
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,346
I want you to leave my house, Mike.

455
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,660
It's time for you to leave.

456
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,579
Oh, no!

457
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,819
What do you want?

458
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,417
I can't take this shit anymore.

459
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,438
Alright.

460
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,875
Alright Mike, huh? Do it.

461
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:11,913
Come on, huh?
What're you waiting for?

462
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,249
Come on, do it!

463
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,740
Come on, Mike!

464
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,732
Yeah?

465
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:47,515
- Joey, it's me, Marnie.
- Marnie? Oh, hey.

466
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:51,819
- You said I could call.
- Yeah, what's goin' on?

467
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,388
- Did I wake you?
- Nah.

468
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,123
I'm just chilling.

469
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,692
I didn't mean to bother you.

470
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,819
You're not.

471
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,630
It's good to hear your voice.

472
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,666
Is everything okay?

473
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:15,106
Look...

474
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:17,712
Can I come over?

475
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:20,615
- No! That's not a good idea.
- Why?

476
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:24,380
Huh... it just isn't, okay?
You have to trust me on this one.

477
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,657
I'm... I'm getting my shoes on.

478
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,627
No, no, no. Joey, no.
Not tonight.

479
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:36,859
- Some other night, huh?
- I promise.

480
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:41,334
Well, sweet dreams.

481
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,664
Hey, Marnie!

482
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,819
- Joey, what the hell you're doing here?
- I was in the neighborhood.

483
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:32,887
Yeah, right.

484
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:36,721
Look, I'm gonna camp out on your
doorstep, unless you let me in.

485
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:42,119
- Joey, you can't come in.
- I'm getting soaked out here.

486
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:45,400
- Joey, you gotta go home, okay?
- Please, come on, let me in.

487
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:46,501
No!

488
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:50,872
I'm gonna stand out here all night in this
rain, unless you let me in, so, come on...

489
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,737
Fine.

490
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,982
Catch.

491
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:05,207
Watch it!

492
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,928
Hey.

493
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,955
Hey.

494
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,022
Are you okay?

495
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,491
Yeah, damn it.

496
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,459
I'm fine.

497
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:50,426
That was funny, I'm sorry...

498
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,893
- Hey.
- Good morning.

499
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,803
- I slept really good.
- Me too.

500
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:39,537
- I can't believe it.
- What?

501
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,970
It's a beautiful day.

502
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,346
No!...

503
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:52,843
No!

504
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,771
No Mike, no!...

505
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:21,309
Stop it! No!

506
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:26,954
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it! No!

507
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,479
No!

508
01:15:55,317 --> 01:16:03,246
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! No!

509
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:26,276
- I'm going in.
- Copy.

510
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:06,444
Marnie!

511
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,746
Marnie!

512
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:13,621
- What do you want?
- I got a warrant for Joseph DiCenzo's arrest.

513
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,392
- I know he's in there.
- Nobody's here but me, and the ghost!

514
01:18:16,393 --> 01:18:18,326
Marnie, I've been outside
of your house all night.

515
01:18:18,327 --> 01:18:19,593
Now, cut the shit.

516
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,796
- I know he's in there.
- Well, let's see the warrant.

517
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:23,898
Come downstairs
and I'll show you the warrant.

518
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,199
You can show it to me right here.

519
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,405
Now quit fucking around with me
and open this door.

520
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:34,308
- I'm in the shower.
- Put some clothes on and open the door!

521
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:37,072
Just give me a few minutes, okay?

522
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:44,183
- We are at the back door.
- Hold on.

523
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:58,794
- Marnie!
- Joey isn't here.

524
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,735
Just hold your freaking horses
I'm...

525
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:01,769
- Shanks!
- getting dressed!

526
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,237
- Check the basement.
- Alright.

527
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:08,672
- Check the basement!
- Okay.

528
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:13,775
- Marnie?!
- I'm coming!

529
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:17,084
- Where is he?
- Easy.

530
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,652
Where is he?

531
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:21,211
I told you, he's not here.

532
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:32,321
He's not here.

533
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,274
What do you want from me?

534
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,862
Let's go.

535
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,844
Go by his house, check by that market
he works at, he's gonna show up.

536
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,073
Alright, come on.

537
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:30,809
- So you admit he was here last night.
- Yeah.

538
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,555
- And when did he leave?
- I don't know, around one.

539
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,591
- And what were you doing?
- Screwing each other's brains out.

540
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:40,753
- In your husband's house.
- In his bed.

541
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:51,839
This isn't over.

542
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,842
- You know the way out, detective.
- I don't know where you stashed this kid,

543
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:56,110
or I don't know where he's hiding...

544
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,879
but I'm gonna be out in that car
all day every day...

545
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,615
until he comes back, because
I know he's coming back. Marnie.

546
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:04,550
You bought yourself maybe
2 or 3 days.

547
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,053
I want you out of my house, Shanks.

548
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:14,320
Okay.

549
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,601
What the fuck?!
You?

550
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,604
What the fuck?!
Get out!

551
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:27,274
Put your fucking hands up!
On your head!

552
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:30,903
You, fucking bitch!
Get your fucking hands up!

553
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,381
You have the right to remain silent.

554
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:37,651
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of fucking law.

555
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:40,321
Go ahead, arrest me,
I'll never be free anyway.

556
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:41,555
I got you. Alright.

557
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:44,558
This is Shanks.
I got the DiCenzo kid, dead.

558
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:46,260
In the woman's apartment.

559
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,130
I got her cuffed.
I got it under control.

560
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:49,997
I'm bringing her in now.
Over.

561
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,862
Let's go.

562
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,429
You win, Mike!

563
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:56,699
What the fuck?...

564
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,485
Mickey?

565
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,950
Mickey, it's me... Lou!

566
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,895
Mickey... what happened to you?

567
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,409
You stay away from her.

568
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:38,401
Mike, you stay away from her!

569
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,970
You stay away from her, Mike!

570
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:50,524
Stay fucking away from her!
Stay away from her, Mike!

571
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:53,254
Mike, you stay away!

572
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:14,648
Shanks...

573
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:17,151
Shanks. Shanks, wake up!

574
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:20,313
Come on. Wake up. Shanks!

575
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:26,922
Shanks! Come on! Wake up!

576
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:32,925
Oh, shit!

577
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:38,126
Oh, shit!

578
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:16,438
Come on! Shanks, wake up.

579
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:19,673
Oh, shit!

580
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:55,041
Oh, Come on!

581
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,462
Marnie!

582
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:15,025
Shanks!

583
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:21,139
Shanks! Shanks, can you hear me?

584
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:30,214
Marnie? Where are you?

585
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:35,719
Answer me!

586
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,993
Marnie!

587
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:42,291
Hang on!

588
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:09,187
Marnie!

589
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:17,021
Come on!

590
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:22,669
Come on.

591
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,707
Come on.

592
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,775
Come on.

593
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:16,879
It's over!

594
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,556
Marnie...

595
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:06,523
Come on.

596
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,227
Shanks...

597
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:13,791
Are you okay?

598
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:18,204
Come on.

599
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,667
You should go.

600
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:25,810
You should go.
