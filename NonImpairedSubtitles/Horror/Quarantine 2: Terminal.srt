1
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:29,593
L.A., this is Flight 734.
We need a runway, 26L.

2
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:34,562
Roger that, 734. You're clear on 26L.

3
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,598
We're at the concert of
our lives and you disappear?

4
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,334
Sorry.

5
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,070
And now we're
gonna be late again.

6
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,717
No, no, no. We'll make it.
Hey, have you seen my scarf?

7
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:55,445
God, this is serious.
I mean, where were you?

8
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:00,323
Well, um, I just went
to get a little souvenir.

9
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,253
Hey.

10
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,763
For my best friend, Paula.
They all signed it.

11
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,629
Oh, my God, Jenny.
I love you.

12
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,135
I got a little something
for myself. Look at this.

13
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,533
Uh, excuse me,
how did you get backstage?

14
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,576
Well, I have my ways.

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,270
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hm.

16
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,118
I told them all about you.
They think you're so cute. I showed them pictures.

17
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,721
You're such a liar.
Why would I lie about that?

18
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,051
Oh, I got this one.
Oh, thank you.

19
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,060
Okay.

20
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,732
That's the only reason, then?
Pretty much.

21
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,926
I was thinking we
could transfer to L.A,

22
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,798
and we check out
Tokyo, Thailand--

23
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,836
No, too crazy,
too many people.

24
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,100
Paula, it beats BNA any day.
Come on.

25
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,077
But my fiancé's in Nashville.
It's never too late to escape.

26
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,944
Oh, wow, great advice
from my maid of honor.

27
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,590
Who's stalking you now?
Only guy that matters. Dad.

28
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,985
Aww.

29
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,853
He wants me
to go to flight school.

30
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,187
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

31
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,498
I already got my dream job.

32
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,167
Flying one of these things,

33
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,370
way too much responsibility.

34
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,134
Hey.
Hm?

35
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,834
Yeah. Hm?
Mm-hm.

36
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,872
Trans Sky Air.
Get there.

37
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,277
Now go to sleep.
Now go to sleep.

38
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,681
Ooh.

39
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:38,046
Girls, is there coffee?
- Sure.

40
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,055
You feeling okay,
Willsy?

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,354
Head cold. It's going around.

42
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,557
There you go.
Thank you.

43
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,797
Think I got it from my dog.
All the dogs in the neighborhood are sick.

44
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,832
It's running around, barking,
being weird.

45
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,466
Thunderstorms out of
the south, southwest.

46
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,975
Church group canceled,
so we're nearly empty.

47
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,171
How long you been working
the aisles, Jenny?

48
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,213
Oh, uh, almost a year now,
captain.

49
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,044
Then you should
know better.

50
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,955
Sorry, sir.

51
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,885
Ha, ha, ha.

52
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,991
- So gullible.
- Heard the concert was great.

53
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,058
Rochambeau?
Really?

54
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,103
Sorry.

55
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:29,037
Jenny, this is George.
George, this is Jenny.

56
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,870
Hey, George,
how's it going?

57
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,904
He's all yours now.

58
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,312
You wanna come
with me?

59
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,017
Okay, so a couple
of things, you're--

60
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,750
"My responsibility."
I know the drill.

61
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,553
Okay. Ah, wrist, please.

62
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,926
I'm 13 next month.
Most airlines don't make me wear that anymore.

63
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,067
This one does. Sorry.

64
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,362
Look, I can
take care of myself.

65
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,199
Okay, less work for me.

66
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,002
EAD?
Check.

67
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,335
Status pitch.
Check.

68
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,341
Fuel quantity.

69
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,878
Twenty-four thousand
five hundred pounds.

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,685
We're gonna take great care of you,
Dr. Kingston.

71
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,247
All right, here we go.
- Jenny?

72
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,253
Just help us out here, all right?

73
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,986
That's good. Oh, good.
Watch your head, Doc.

74
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,491
There you go.
Good job.

75
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,287
Thank you.
Sure.

76
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:29,161
Doc can hear you, he just can't speak,
or move very well. Parkinson's.

77
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,393
Where you headed?

78
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,128
An hour from KC.
His daughter just had a baby girl.

79
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,328
Aww.
Aww.

80
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,467
APU fire.
Okay, Willsy. Fire up the APU.

81
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,016
Good evening. Welcome.

82
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,349
Thought you had
a light load, huh?

83
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,579
Back half of the plane,
completely empty.

84
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,088
Oh, I appreciate that, ma'am.
I really do.

85
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,594
Welcome aboard. Good evening.

86
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,325
Oh, hey,
what's a fella gotta do to get a beer around here?

87
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,934
We'll let you know.

88
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,501
I'm sorry.
You sure you're feeling all right?

89
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,181
I'll be all right.
You just look a little...

90
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,542
Welcome aboard. How are you?

91
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,720
Oh, I love your nails.

92
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,980
Thanks. Keeps the glooms away.

93
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,223
Oh, come on.

94
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,316
May I help you?

95
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,996
No, thanks. I think I got it.
What's in there?

96
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,724
Hamsters. If anything happens to them,
my class will eat me alive.

97
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,300
Ooh, tough class.
Kindergarten.

98
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,404
The one in back's a little bit bigger.
Oh, that's, uh--

99
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,404
Okay, that's not gonna work.
I almost got it.

100
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,009
You're gonna have to check that.
- Easy. Easy.

101
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,304
Thank you.

102
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,140
Ow!

103
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,647
You think they'll survive
down there?

104
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,048
It's pressurized. But, I mean,
I'm no hamster expert. Heh.

105
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,983
Oh, I'll give you this.

106
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,821
Oh, right.
Okay. Ah. Got it.

107
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,121
Oh, most important thing to know:
What's that?

108
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,827
They're like a buck each.

109
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,399
Okay.

110
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,876
Cute guy
you were talking to.

111
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,546
Oh, look who's still looking.

112
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,443
I'm engaged, not dead.

113
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,792
Todd, we're on the red-eye.
These filthy seats.

114
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,223
She's good. I'll tell her.

115
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,623
There you go.

116
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,458
We'll see you there.
I look forward to it.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,300
Well, we're on the red-eye.
I don't know, 7:30, 8 a.m.?

118
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,633
Good evening, everyone.

119
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,776
Welcome aboard Trans Sky Air
Flight 318,

120
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:56,142
with regional service to Kansas City
continuing on to Nashville.

121
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,841
We know you have many options in
regards to your transportation needs.

122
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,112
We appreciate you choosing Trans Sky Air.
Please don't hesitate to let us know

123
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,786
Excuse me.

124
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,428
if we can make your flight more
pleasant this evening. Thank you.

125
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:15,095
L.A. Ground, TS-318,
push off, we're at 69 alto.

126
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,633
318, you're clear for push back.

127
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,601
Please give Jenny your undivided attention

128
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,301
as she demonstrates
this plane's safety features.

129
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,043
To fasten your seatbelt, insert
the buckle and adjust the strap

130
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,274
so it's low and tight
across your lap.

131
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,251
To release the belt, simply lift
the top of the buckle and pull.

132
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,658
Flight attendants,
take your seats for departure.

133
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,792
I need you to buckle that extendabelt.
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,132
Thanks.

135
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,679
Just...

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,627
Gear up.

137
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,007
Five-three-two,
verify visual contact with traffic.

138
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,920
You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.

139
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,113
You want anything?
I'm a little warm.

140
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,349
You want anything?
Careful. Heh, heh.

141
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,486
I'm gonna be nice.
I'm gonna be a daddy.

142
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,222
Roger on hitting 135.

143
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,799
Cruising altitude, Willsy.

144
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,038
Ladies and gentlemen,
your captain has turned off the fasten-seatbelt sign.

145
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,241
You are now free
to move about the cabin.

146
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:17,684
At this time, you may also take out
any of the approved electronic devices.

147
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,155
We would also like to let you know
we have Wi-Fi service available.

148
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
So do you travel
a lot by yourself?

149
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,097
Between my mom and dad.
Oh.

150
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,758
Who's picking you up in the morning?
Janice, my smother.

151
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,901
What's a smother?

152
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,630
Stepmother.
She's about your age.

153
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,040
Okay. I bet that sucks.

154
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,848
Hand me my cell phone.

155
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,659
Flight nerves?

156
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,763
For 19 straight hours.
Oh.

157
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,662
Overseas, huh?
Yeah.

158
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,166
Haven't seen my husband
for over a year.

159
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,840
But I'm home for a while now, so...
He's a lucky man.

160
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,841
Ryan, obviously you are mistaking
me for somebody that gives a crap.

161
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,674
I'm sorry, sir,
we are airborne so you're gonna have to end that call.

162
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,352
It's against FAA regulations
to use any sort of cellular equip--

163
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,613
You're compromising our safety.
Who the fuck are you, man?

164
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,259
If he keeps using his cell phone,
we're gonna arrest him when we land.

165
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,360
Did you hear that?
Give me the phone.

166
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,359
Okay?
You're an asshole.

167
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,260
Okay.
Fucking asshole.

168
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,436
You don't see me doing your job.
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,131
That was stupid, but some people
can be so inconsiderate.

170
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,503
Exactly. Then you really
don't want my job.

171
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,043
Doesn't it make you wonder
about the human race?

172
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,215
Try not to overthink things.

173
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,644
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna shut up now.

174
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:58,523
Um... So do you
got any solutions?

175
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,894
Well, sure.
The few of us that give a damn have to make change.

176
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,688
It's our responsibility, right?

177
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:11,732
I think I have all the responsibility
I can handle at the moment.

178
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,064
Yeah. Right.

179
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,501
I can see that.
Yeah.

180
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,041
Hey, I apologize for the lecture.

181
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:24,205
I'm just finishing my PhD, nights,
and I'm always boring strangers,

182
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,580
kindergarteners,
beautiful flight attendants.

183
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,689
It's not boring. It's interesting.

184
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,523
Henry.
Uh, Jenny.

185
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,429
It's nice to meet you, Jenny.

186
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,196
You're gonna need
to put your cat back in the bag.

187
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,771
I don't know how he got out.
He's usually so well-behaved,

188
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,068
he never leaves
the apartment building.

189
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,838
There you go, sweetie.
Back in your little house.

190
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:57,971
Autopilot.

191
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,152
How was your weekend?
Not too bad.

192
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:04,015
Went somewhere?
No, I played golf. Played terrible.

193
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,855
Lost another six balls--

194
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,183
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

195
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,256
You have a handkerchief?

196
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,899
What does the FAA say about blow jobs?

197
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:19,265
Well, as long as your tray table
is in the upright position...

198
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,269
So, what's going on?

199
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:26,444
Just talking. He's super smart.
Uh-huh.

200
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,373
He get your number yet?

201
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,675
No. Not yet.
The night's still young, though.

202
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,746
Oh, I'll get it.
Okay.

203
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,284
Hey, what's up?

204
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,656
I just need some water.
Are you feeling okay?

205
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,500
I just-- Just need
something to drink.

206
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,126
Okay.

207
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,205
Hey, golf guy in the back asked for water.
Doesn't look so good.

208
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,074
I got it. You go ahead
and start, I'll check it out.

209
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,271
Yeah?
Yeah.

210
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,677
Thanks.

211
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,112
Here you go.

212
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,480
Hey.

213
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,991
He probably just had one too many on the back nine.

214
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,164
Hi, what can I get you
to drink?

215
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,529
Hey. Can I just have a tea?
Oh, sure.

216
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,567
As the investigation gets--
Go ahead.

217
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,296
Thank you.
Of course.

218
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,867
--the situation
continues to be serious,

219
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,013
with the exception
of heavily protected military...

220
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,513
What's going on?
You know, they don't know.

221
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:42,209
They don't know yet.
It's some apartment building in L.A.

222
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,719
Where in L.A.?
I have no idea.

223
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,285
Maybe downtown.
Ooh.

224
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,291
Yeah. It's good we're flying away.

225
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,729
Okay. Well, enjoy your tea.

226
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,494
Thank you very much.
- What can I get you?

227
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,864
Yeah, we're good.
We're just finishing up.

228
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,233
Let us know
if you need anything.

229
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,842
Okay. Okay.
Thanks, captain.

230
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,564
Um...

231
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,864
Sir? Can you hear me?

232
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,367
Sir?
Ugh!

233
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,744
Oh! Oh.

234
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,049
Paula, a little help.
- Oh, man.

235
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,584
Big guy just puked
all over the stewardess.

236
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:52,314
Oh, God. Here. Are you all right?
He's sick. He's really sick.

237
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,754
Okay, you stay here,
I'll be right back.

238
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,552
Stop the plane. Let me off!

239
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:01,597
No, no. You need to stay in your seat.
Please just stay in the seat, sir.

240
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,735
Yeah, chunks flying.
XL pack's in the back.

241
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,029
Roger that.

242
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,105
You girls get all the fun.
They certainly do.

243
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,401
- Stop the plane.
- Please stay in your seat.

244
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,237
You have to stay right there.

245
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,039
Sir, please stay in the seat.
- You don't understand.

246
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,082
Fantastic. Now we're all gonna get it.
Relax. This happens all the time.

247
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,811
What if it's some foreign flu?
We'll sue.

248
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,052
We'll sue anyway.
- Let me off.

249
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,246
Here, put these on.

250
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,724
Sir, you're gonna have to stay still
while we put this mask on your face.

251
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,989
- What's wrong with him?
- Go clean up.

252
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,099
Stop the plane.
Let's go, Jenny. Go.

253
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,162
All right, sir? Okay. Hold still.
I know. Just breathe. Just breathe.

254
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,170
I know it's uncomfortable, okay?
You're all right.

255
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,645
Sir. Sir!

256
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,349
Stop! Ah!

257
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,461
Let me in!

258
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,490
Stop the plane! Let me in!

259
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,996
You have the aircraft.
Yeah.

260
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,130
Stop the plane!

261
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,669
Oh, my God.
Let me in!

262
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,470
Let me in!
- Somebody stop him.

263
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,041
- Jenny!
- Stop the plane!

264
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,975
White shit is coming out of this guy's mouth.
He's going berserk.

265
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,349
George!

266
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,143
Hey! Hey!
Unh!

267
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,316
L.A., this is TSF 318. We have
a code red in-cabin emergency.

268
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,513
Stop! Stop! Stop!

269
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,318
Go get up there.
Fuck that.

270
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,655
We gotta get in there.
We're not compromising the cockpit.

271
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,996
- Get him down. Get his legs.
- Get off the door!

272
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,230
Help me!

273
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,031
Get him on the ground.
Try to get down.

274
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,398
Jenny, get the restraints!

275
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,705
You grab his wrists.
Grab his wrists. Get his wrists together.

276
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,381
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, Jenny.

277
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,915
Affirmative.
He's got all of those symptoms.

278
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,814
Know what this is?
- Give us a name.

279
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,980
- Grab his arm.
- Come on, guys, roll him.

280
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,691
Hit him again. Now!
- I got him.

281
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,261
- What?
- Get the restraints on him.

282
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,826
- Got it.
- Okay.

283
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,598
Got it.

284
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,205
They got him down. He's down.

285
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,331
He's down.

286
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,842
Happens all the time, right?

287
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,876
FAA needs
the passenger's name now.

288
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,210
Jenny, grab this.

289
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,786
"Mr. Ralph Bundt."

290
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,564
B-U-N-D-T.

291
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,866
I need a rest.

292
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,202
Thank you.

293
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,544
You feel nauseous,
like you wanna barf?

294
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,042
I'm telling you I'm okay.

295
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,841
You've had a concussion,
so we'll need to get you checked out.

296
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,373
George, I'm so sorry.

297
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,084
If you're really sorry,
get me off this freaking plane.

298
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,287
Are you a doctor?
Medic.

299
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,393
Get some ice for that contusion
and keep a close eye on him.

300
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,497
If he starts acting strange or sleepy--
I understand.

301
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,725
I'll help keep an eye on him.

302
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,335
Thank you.

303
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,634
He's out.

304
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,786
Paula, I panicked out there.
I was useless.

305
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,750
I didn't do anything right.

306
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,016
Hey, hey, hey.
It's fine, okay? You did your best.

307
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,091
It's done. It's over.

308
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,955
Okay? Come here.

309
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,025
We've been instructed to get our passenger

310
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,929
immediate medical attention.

311
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,161
Everyone in their seats,
belts fastened.

312
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,762
It's Paula.

313
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,439
Secure the cabin for landing.
FAA wants us on the ground now.

314
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,814
We gotta punch through that weather.
Gonna be a rough drop.

315
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,176
It certainly is.
All passengers,

316
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,784
prepare for severe turbulence.
Hang on tight.

317
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,514
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're executing an immediate emergency landing.

318
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,124
Please secure all loose items
and tray tables.

319
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,390
- What the fuck is going on?
- As a safety precaution,

320
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:28,225
give Jenny your attention as she
demonstrates the bracing position.

321
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,402
Lean forward.
Hands on top of your head.

322
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,195
Elbows against your thighs.

323
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,337
Okay. Here we go.

324
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,475
Hold on.

325
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,074
Hang on!

326
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,816
Hold on.

327
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,090
Sir, can I have the laptop?

328
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,595
My presentation's on there.
I need that.

329
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,064
Brace. Brace, everyone.

330
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,066
Cabin's secure.

331
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,704
Not yet.

332
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,077
Okay. Roll him
to my side on three, okay?

333
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,854
One, two, three. Ugh!

334
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,185
Hurry.

335
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,058
Oh, God. It's not gonna fit.
I'm gonna get his extender.

336
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,232
All right, hurry.

337
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,037
Negative 0597.

338
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,518
Ma'am. Ma'am.

339
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,554
Argh!
- Oh, God!

340
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,588
Jesus.

341
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,497
Oh, my God.

342
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,470
Oh, my God.

343
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,512
Willsy, get back there.
We're about to land.

344
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,677
Oh, please,
don't let me die in the air.

345
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,753
- Oh, my God.
- It's gotta be something.

346
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,591
Oh, God.

347
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,767
Oh, God. Oh, God.

348
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,629
Get us out of here.

349
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,829
Ground Control, I need a gate
assignment. What's the holdup?

350
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,031
Ground Control.

351
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,609
Don't let him out!
Keep him in there!

352
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,370
Oh, shit.

353
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,275
Where's your EMK?

354
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,079
Get it. Come on, come on, come on.
Okay.

355
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,347
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

356
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,888
Hold that. Keep the pressure on it.
Okay.

357
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,529
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. You okay?

358
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,357
What?
Only two lousy doses of lidocaine?

359
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,132
What is that?
- It's a sedative.

360
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,207
It'll keep her from going into shock
until we can get her to a hospital.

361
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,377
Give me your scarf.
Okay, okay.

362
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,169
Hold it.

363
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,647
She's bleeding out.
Just hold on. Hold on.

364
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,511
She's bleeding out.
Please hurry.

365
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,017
You gotta keep pressure
on this wound.

366
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:40,880
Come on!

367
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:45,722
Ground Control, I have a critically injured
FA and a violent passenger onboard.

368
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,764
Why are we stopped?
Tower's not clearing us for a gate.

369
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,400
Why not?
- They won't tell us.

370
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,230
Captain!
- What are we gonna do?

371
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,998
Hold your position.
Ground Control, we can't hold.

372
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,268
We gotta do something.
Willsy, find us an open gate.

373
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,676
Captain!
What's going on?

374
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,679
Gate 87 is closest.
Ground Control, I'm taking Gate 87.

375
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,379
I need EMS, police,
cavalry there to meet us. Come on.

376
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,094
Ground Control,
I need that Jetway operational.

377
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,734
Ground Control?
- Two o'clock.

378
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,130
He sees us.

379
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,485
You fucked up, lady.
Wrong gate, wrong airline.

380
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,318
TS Air operates out of Terminal A.
My shift is over.

381
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,052
Evacuate! Evacuate!
What the hell's going on?

382
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,890
Go. Go.

383
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,922
- Shit.
- Get some help.

384
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,260
Easy, easy.
- Get off the plane!

385
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,529
Careful. Careful.
- Get off the plane, now!

386
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,173
Go, go, go.
- We're getting out of here.

387
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,742
Get them to the gate!
Go on, get off the plane.

388
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,407
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

389
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,415
Come on.
- Come here. Stay with me.

390
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,854
I need you to open up Gate 87.
I got an injury here from flight--

391
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,326
It's TS Air 318.
TS Air 318.

392
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,197
Come in.
Why aren't they answering?

393
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,759
Open the fucking door!

394
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,494
Hey, calm down.

395
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,469
Okay, okay.
Everybody just try to stay calm.

396
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,267
Hobbs, open the gates right now.

397
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,002
This woman needs to get
to a hospital immediately.

398
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,942
Okay, okay. The other side.

399
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,483
Come on, come on, George.

400
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,020
Shit. George.
Go, go, go.

401
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,388
Hold the door for me. Hold the door.
Okay, you got it. Hurry.

402
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,463
Jenny, what are you doing here?
Gate's locked.

403
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,327
We're gonna take the passengers
out a different way. What about--?

404
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,436
He tired himself out.
We got it under control.

405
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,505
Take the passengers to safety
then get back here with help.

406
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,903
Come on, Jenny. Come on!

407
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,744
Take off.
Okay.

408
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,808
Come on.
Okay, okay.

409
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,074
Come on.
Okay.

410
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,003
Hey, where are we?

411
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:50,648
Ramp-op staging area.
Where all the shit gets done that you'll never see.

412
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,040
- How's your head?
- Good.

413
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,549
Okay. Well, brilliant job
on that plane.

414
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,743
Thanks.

415
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,155
- Where is everybody?
- At home, where I should be.

416
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:04,852
This terminal is off-line till 3 a.m.
Shut down for maintenance.

417
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,305
We need to take her down
this flight of stairs to tarmac level.

418
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,479
You, help me. Let's go.

419
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:27,414
Easy, all right? On three.
One, two, three.

420
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,538
Through that door,
it'll take you to the main concourse.

421
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,313
This has never been locked before.

422
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,911
Come on.

423
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,494
Don't you have the keys?
The tarmac level, it's automated.

424
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,867
They got us on lockdown.

425
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,131
Lockdown?
What?

426
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:26,276
You ever heard of terrorism?
This was retrofitted after 9/11.

427
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,606
It's a high-security zone.
Like being in a supermax, right?

428
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,339
Every way in or out
is monitored and controlled

429
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,519
by those terminal ops
watching us.

430
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,619
Why are we in lockdown?
You tell me, lady.

431
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,847
Fuck this.
- Damn it.

432
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,356
This is not okay.
What are you gonna do?

433
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,357
How long have you
been working here?

434
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,689
Come in.
There's gotta be something--

435
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:50,994
You have to figure out something.
Hey! I just move the bags, people.

436
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,329
Don't yell at me, all right?
Wait, wait!

437
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,632
Can you hurry this up, man?
We got places to go. For real.

438
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,002
Quiet! Quiet!

439
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,003
Oh, thank God.

440
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,647
They're coming.

441
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,824
George, be careful.

442
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,491
Why'd they stop?

443
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,381
Attention, Flight 318.

444
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,419
Do not attempt
to leave the terminal.

445
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,289
Help is on the way.

446
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,554
You are now under quarantine.

447
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,473
I don't know what to do.
Everything's just gone wrong.

448
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:10,375
I don't know what to tell
these people. We're stuck.

449
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,517
Daddy, please just call me
as soon as you get this.

450
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,016
I need you to tell me
what to do.

451
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,726
Hey, did you get ahold
of your parents?

452
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,728
They're gonna murder you.
Heh, heh.

453
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,064
Yeah, I would too.

454
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,576
Hey, come here.

455
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,178
I just got through to 911.
They don't know anything about this.

456
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,404
What?
Yeah.

457
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,515
I don't understand.
What did they say?

458
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,345
I'm telling you
right now, nothing.

459
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,554
What the hell's this?

460
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,851
What are they doing?
Why are they lighting us up?

461
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,960
How long is this gonna take?
I got a job interview at 9 a.m.

462
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,188
What am I gonna tell my husband?

463
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,866
I am not missing my sister's
wedding for this.

464
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,670
Stop it! Shh!

465
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,205
You just go fetch the captain, honey.
We need somebody in charge.

466
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,274
I understand.
We need information.

467
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,309
My wife is six months pregnant.

468
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,811
How old are you anyway?
I'm really sorry.

469
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,780
That's not good enough.
Everybody just take it easy.

470
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,977
You got no right to keep us here.
You got no right.

471
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,487
She won't make it
unless I stop the bleeding.

472
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:30,024
If I could get to my field kit,
I could maybe buy her some time.

473
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,458
Where's your kit?
In my bag. I checked it.

474
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,155
Shit. Shit.

475
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,663
Hey, you. Uh--

476
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,535
Ed, can you get me into the hold?
The hold?

477
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,830
Yeah.
You didn't see that army outside?

478
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,703
The hold's access panel's right on the floor,
as soon as you walk in.

479
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,070
You sure about that?

480
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,746
I took the qualifying test
a year ago, same plane.

481
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,644
If I get on that plane,
am I gonna get sick?

482
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,581
I don't know.
I have a 3-year-old daughter, okay?

483
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,482
She depends on me.
You understand?

484
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,419
Please look at her.
She's depending on you right now.

485
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:04,321
Please, you gotta do something.
You gotta help. Please.

486
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,689
I'm coming with you.
Me too.

487
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,698
I left my life
on that laptop.

488
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,439
Hey, listen.
I need you to help me out, okay?

489
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,642
If you just man the floor,
can you handle that?

490
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:23,673
Hey, Shilah Washington.
You'll recognize my bag, okay? Hurry.

491
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,558
Ooh.

492
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,495
This is unbelievable.

493
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,263
Unreal.
What happened?

494
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:54,309
Now what? Hobbs, come in.
I need my power back.

495
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:01,274
Hobbs, the power's out. Come on.

496
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,455
Oh, shit.
All right, let's just keep going.

497
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,820
Hobbs, come in.
I need my power back now.

498
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,435
Juice is out here too.

499
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,616
Captain?

500
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,728
Willsy?

501
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,231
The Jetway's disabled.

502
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,085
Captain Forrest?

503
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,915
Willsy?

504
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,857
Anyone?

505
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,894
There's no one here.
There's no one here.

506
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,282
Captain?

507
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,021
This is a mess, man.
What a mess.

508
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,167
Oh, my God.

509
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:06,173
I don't understand.
If-- If he's not in there and everybody else split...

510
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,244
Someone may have opened the gate.
I'm gonna go check.

511
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,616
I'm going to get my laptop.

512
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,183
- Here.
- Hey, there's one in here.

513
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,948
All right.

514
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,226
Oh, shit.

515
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,458
It's just blood, man.
Damn it.

516
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:34,994
I found it.

517
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,212
Wait, it's Doc. It's Doc.

518
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,304
It's Doc. Doc?

519
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,149
What?

520
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,717
Oh, my God.
See you folks at the gate.

521
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,489
Wait. If the gate was open,
they would have never left him here.

522
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:04,862
Right?
She's right. The gate's still locked.

523
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,491
It's gonna be kind of tight.

524
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,686
Hey,
watch over Doc until we get back.

525
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,990
All right. You all hurry up, okay?

526
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,539
Yo, the name's Britz, three bags.

527
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,469
Get your own damn bags.

528
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,676
We're looking for a duffel,
last name Washington.

529
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,857
Hey.

530
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,362
Hey.

531
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,559
It broke open.
Turbulence. I'm sorry.

532
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,435
Looks like I'm out 5 bucks.
Heh, heh.

533
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,300
Here we go.

534
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,173
What the hell are you doing?

535
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,975
The world's a dangerous place, amigo.
I never leave home without it.

536
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:05,417
Besides, after what I've seen here these
should be required on airplanes like seat belts.

537
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:10,321
"Shilah." I got it. I got it.
Come on, let's go.

538
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,928
Oh, shit!
- What? What? What?

539
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,098
A fucking rat.

540
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,968
Shit. It came right at me.
Big one, sucker, with red eyes.

541
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,733
Are you sure it wasn't a hamster?
No, it looked like a fucking rat.

542
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,934
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

543
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,492
Doc?

544
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,925
Captain! Aah!

545
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,264
No! No! No!

546
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,535
No, captain!
- Get it off!

547
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,539
Shots fired. We have shots fired.

548
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,245
Did he get you?
Look at me. Did he bite you?

549
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,451
No, no, no!

550
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,284
- Out. Get out. Move. Move.
- Go. Careful.

551
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,317
- Doc?
- He's all right. He's alive.

552
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,497
- Okay. Pick him up.
- Come on, help me.

553
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,189
Oh, shit. Okay.
- Shit.

554
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,368
I got you, hold on.

555
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,133
All right.
- Is he all right?

556
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,833
He's bit. He's bit.

557
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,532
Move. We gotta get out of here.

558
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,008
Let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go.

559
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:13,174
Check him right now.
See if there are any bites on him. Really look.

560
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,717
- What the fuck was that, huh?
- Nothing, I don't see anything.

561
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,889
Check everywhere.

562
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,894
Hello?

563
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,571
Please, help me.

564
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,744
Shut the door!
- What the fuck is that?

565
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,782
Help me with the door. Push! Push!

566
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,577
- Fucking bitch!
- Close the door!

567
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,553
Take him down to tarmac level,
we'll keep her out! Go! Get out of here!

568
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,898
Hey, Jenny, we heard gunshots.

569
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,228
Here, hold pressure on that.
On her face, don't let it go.

570
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,606
Oh, my God.
What happened on the plane?

571
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,708
They're infecting each other.
I don't understand.

572
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,744
The captain, he got it. I shot him.
There's blood all over your face.

573
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,881
We went in the plane--

574
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,883
The bathroom's empty,
it's covered in blood

575
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,077
and the big guy's
not in there anymore.

576
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,415
We went down into the hold,
you know--

577
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,683
Hold that. Hold it.

578
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,557
Okay. I'm here.

579
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,226
I can't even--
Move.

580
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,834
I love you so, so much.

581
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:39,792
Me too.

582
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:44,338
Just hang in there. I got you.
Breathe. Breathe, Paula, breathe.

583
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,978
It's all right. We're safe. I got the gun,
there's ammo in the bag.

584
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:51,477
I'm glad I did because there's some
crazy shit going on in there.

585
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,948
Why'd the power go out?

586
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,249
Um...

587
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,625
You left this. I picked up
a call from your dad.

588
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,595
He told me to tell you
to take the stick,

589
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,290
and then all the cell phones
went dead at the same time.

590
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,105
Jenny?

591
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:27,947
My dad started giving me
flying lessons when I was 12.

592
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,286
He'd say,

593
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,912
"Take the stick."

594
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:40,357
I was afraid to fly solo,
even with him sitting right there next to me.

595
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,567
One day,

596
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,769
he let go of the stick.

597
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,398
It went into a spin...

598
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,335
and I had to take control.

599
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,479
I never understood why
he did that.

600
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,402
I'm gonna be back.

601
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,584
We got the door shut
and locked.

602
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,524
Whatever's out there in that plane stays out there.

603
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,927
You sure about that? I didn't see Mr.
Bundt around, did you?

604
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,297
Come on. I need you.
Come on.

605
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,564
We gotta go. Let's go.
Come on.

606
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,272
What's wrong?
I'm thirsty.

607
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,469
Hey, listen up.

608
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,944
What do you want?
I got something to say.

609
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:42,118
You said enough.
Hey, listen to what she has to say.

610
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,917
One, we don't know
when they're getting us out.

611
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,785
Two, we gotta make sure
nobody else gets infected.

612
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,756
Oh, smart.
And who's in charge?

613
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,454
I am.

614
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:55,927
You?
Oh, right.

615
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,293
You?
You know nothing.

616
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,662
Well, I think we should vote.
I got this.

617
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,633
So shoot me or shut the fuck up.

618
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,968
Our captain, who murdered
Mrs. Stevens in 7A, is dead.

619
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:11,477
Our co-pilot is creeping around
the cabin like some sort of animal.

620
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:16,142
That means all of you are my
passengers until this flight is over.

621
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,446
Is that clear?

622
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,419
Yeah.
I think it's pretty clear.

623
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,956
Whatever this is,
it's spreading through bites.

624
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,357
We don't know that.
Biting could be a symptom, not how it infects.

625
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:29,862
Could be spread airborne, topical.
We don't know. We don't know shit.

626
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:33,662
If you ask me, it looks like some kind
of fucked-up rabies. People rabies.

627
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,170
People rabies?
Rabies is spread through bites, right?

628
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,841
Right?
- Well, mucus, saliva.

629
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,978
There's a cure for rabies.
You get shots in the stomach.

630
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,138
That's before symptoms start.
Once it manifests, it's over. There is no cure.

631
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,716
Fuck this.
- I don't think this is rabies.

632
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,477
Hm!
- Why not?

633
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,555
Rabies takes weeks for the
symptoms to show in humans,

634
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:56,920
for the virus to travel to the brain.
This takes minutes.

635
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,994
Wait, Henry,
you were watching a newsfeed on the plane.

636
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,859
Didn't it say something
about a quarantine in L.A.?

637
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:06,195
Yeah. An apartment building.
This flight is out of L.A.

638
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,236
Two quarantines, one night.
Wonder how often that happens.

639
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,375
What about your friend?
Wouldn't you think she's infected?

640
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,168
She's not infected.
She's fine.

641
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,938
She got bitten but hasn't
had any symptoms yet.

642
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,444
Doc!

643
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,610
George, no!

644
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,549
Come here.
Don't touch his head!

645
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,519
Go get your medical kit.
Go get it now. Calm down.

646
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,193
Don't let him get away.
Don't let him touch you.

647
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,827
He bit him.
I see that.

648
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,088
- One, two, three.
- Calm down.

649
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,630
I know why people--
Go, go, go.

650
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,192
Did it bite you?
No.

651
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,892
Are you sure?
No, it's fine.

652
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,537
Check your forearms.
I am.

653
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,439
All right.
This is wrong. Inhumane.

654
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:48,509
He's bitten, ma'am.
It's for our own safety.

655
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:54,577
All right. On three.
One, two, three.

656
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,797
You're in charge, right?

657
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,769
You have no choice.

658
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,910
I found something on the rat.
What is it?

659
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,806
- Hold on, let me see.
- What is it?

660
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:29,815
Look, there's a tag
on the hind leg.

661
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,420
That's a lab rat. Albino.
Shit.

662
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,751
It looks like the one in the hold.
Like the other rat?

663
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,486
Yes, and the people.
So a laboratory rat is causing all this?

664
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:43,188
How could a laboratory rat get into
the hold of a commercial plane?

665
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,561
I don't know. How should I know?

666
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,765
Ask him.
- Who?

667
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,497
George?
Did you bring lab rats in that carrier?

668
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,633
No. Those were
my class' hamsters.

669
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,438
When you boarded,
I saw tails inside your carrier.

670
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,672
What the hell you talking about?
Okay?

671
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,474
I had hamsters
when I was little.

672
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:04,814
They have little stubby things
that you can barely see. Not tails.

673
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:08,082
All right.
Well, those hamsters were given to my class

674
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,420
by a parent who just
came back from Ecuador

675
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,392
where I now know
hamsters have tails.

676
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,498
You just made that shit up.

677
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,568
Hey, can I talk to you?
Yeah, of course.

678
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:30,843
Henry, tell me you didn't bring rats onto my plane.

679
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:34,211
Jenny, listen to me. George is
a little mixed up right now.

680
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:38,218
He's been through a lot tonight.
We all have been through a lot.

681
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,321
Are you telling me the truth?
Think about it.

682
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,392
You can't bring lab rats
on an airplane in your carry-on.

683
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:48,122
It's not possible. I never would've
made it through security.

684
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:49,660
Of course.

685
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,367
I'm sorry.
That's okay.

686
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,400
I'm accusing you instead of--
Hey. Hey.

687
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:01,236
You know--
We're okay.

688
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,237
Shit. Shit.

689
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,553
Watch his mouth!

690
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,547
Come here.

691
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,419
Hold it around his neck!

692
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,386
Get away!

693
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,859
- Hold on, Jenny, I'm coming.
- Help!

694
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,761
- Grab that end!
- Hold on, Jenny.

695
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,026
Put it over here.

696
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,864
Pull it. Pull! Pull!
We gotta choke him. Come on!

697
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,937
Come on.
Hold him, guys! Pull!

698
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,539
Come on. Come on.

699
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:42,145
Pull!

700
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,327
He's dead.
He's dead.

701
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,132
Ramirez.

702
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,571
Hobbs, come in.
CDC's on the way.

703
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,745
Oh, shit. CDC's coming in.

704
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,406
- Let's go.
- Roger that. We're all here.

705
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,485
Hey, how you holding up?
He's lying.

706
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,158
You don't have any
proof of that, George.

707
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,590
You believe him
because you like him.

708
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,660
The ammo's
in here somewhere.

709
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,503
George. Is he all right?
- We'll get you out of here.

710
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,005
I don't know.

711
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,644
This is stupid,
but have you seen my briefcase?

712
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,489
Whoa, take it easy.

713
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,861
Don't point the guns at us.

714
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,003
We just wanna get out of here.

715
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,440
Get them to the hospital.
- Give us your full cooperation,

716
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,872
we'll get you out
as fast as possible.

717
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:18,138
- Wait. Listen to me.
- Put down the camera.

718
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,078
Put down the camera, sir.
Put it down. Put it down.

719
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,621
Why are you doing that?
- Everything will be explained.

720
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,054
Sir, your weapon,
hand it over.

721
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:33,387
Nial, give him your gun.
- Give him the--

722
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,192
- Hey. Hey.
- Okay. Okay.

723
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,731
- Everybody stay calm.
- Easy.

724
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:41,631
All right, you, you and you,
over here.

725
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:45,399
Get these people out. Both of them.
- All right, take it easy.

726
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,201
Let's go!

727
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:52,209
You and you, clear off the table.
The rest of you line up here.

728
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,405
Let's move, folks.

729
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,578
- Okay, be careful.
- All right.

730
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,986
What is that?

731
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,627
Oh, God. What is that?

732
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,595
What are you doing?

733
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,696
What is this?
- Protocol. For your safety.

734
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,102
You've been exposed. We don't know
which of you may be infected.

735
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:22,209
So you've identified this.
Everything will be explained.

736
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,075
Hey, what is that?
What are you giving them?

737
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:27,443
Who's next?

738
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:31,417
I'm not putting shit into my body
unless I know what it is.

739
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,452
Am I right?

740
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,316
Am I right, Nial?

741
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,619
Everything will be explained.
Explain it to us now.

742
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:42,298
If you want to be released,
take the protocol.

743
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,701
I'll go.

744
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,473
State your name to the cameras.

745
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,844
Mrs. Louise Treadwell.

746
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,160
The cat is infected!

747
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:14,385
Keep them back.

748
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:19,558
Eliminate the cat.
Put on your thermal headsets.

749
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,270
Give us a heat signature.

750
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,844
Holy shit! Shit!

751
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,051
Let's go. Let's go!

752
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,553
- Where are you going?
- Open up, we got injured.

753
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:49,960
Open the fucking doors! Let us out!

754
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,535
- Everybody move.
- Let's go. Come on.

755
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,575
We gotta follow these guys out.

756
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,948
Shit.

757
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,895
Get away from the door.
Move away from the door.

758
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,826
Got a live one in here. Come here!

759
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,228
Pull him in.
Come on. Come on, man.

760
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,301
Okay, close the door. Quick.
GSW, left eye.

761
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,996
Shit.
George, get my field kit.

762
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,835
They shot him in the leg.

763
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:35,637
Can you help him?

764
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,375
I hear them.
- They're coming from the plane.

765
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,074
Everybody move. We gotta go.

766
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,879
Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go. We gotta go.

767
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:49,119
Move, lady. Come on. Move.
- Let's go. Let's go.

768
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,360
Where are we going?!
- Go to the catering truck.

769
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,726
Everybody go to the catering truck.
This way. Come on. Move.

770
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:02,128
Everybody in. Let's go. Come on,
come on. Move, move, move.

771
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,364
Get in here, quick.
Come on, let's go.

772
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,338
Put them in there. Come on.

773
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,877
- Get in the truck.
- What are you doing?

774
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,878
Your face.
- Get in the truck, lady.

775
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,277
Get in the truck!

776
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,041
- Let's go!
- What are you doing?

777
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,448
I love you.
Get in the truck. Come on.

778
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,316
No.
He's infected. He's infected.

779
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,115
Let him go. Let him go!

780
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,691
- He'll kill you.
- I can't.

781
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,088
Come on.

782
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:50,152
Paula, I left her out there.
We gotta go get her.

783
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,652
If your friend is up and about,
you do not wanna look for her.

784
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:57,315
You don't understand. She took
the protocol, she's gonna be okay--

785
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:01,053
No, honey, there is no protocol.

786
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:02,895
I still don't understand.

787
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:06,296
Maybe I've been in the Army too long,
but we were each getting

788
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,404
a different set of injections,
medications.

789
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,335
What makes you think that?
Hello?

790
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,941
Each cartridge had its own color,
its own label.

791
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,477
That true?
I'm not authorized to discuss it.

792
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:20,309
I'll authorize you.
What is going on here?

793
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:21,882
What does the CDC know?

794
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,355
It's not CDC.

795
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,552
It's CBDT.

796
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,884
Chemical Biological
Domestic Terrorism.

797
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,456
Terrorism?
- What?

798
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,489
Homeland Security.

799
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,261
An apartment building in L.A.
is under quarantine.

800
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,496
One of our units went in
a couple of hours ago,

801
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,108
nobody ever came out.

802
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,873
They found a bio-terror laboratory
in an attic apartment.

803
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,013
Some kind of doomsday cult.

804
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:54,376
Hold on a second.
Wait, somebody made this?

805
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,313
Made the virus.

806
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,816
And they were looking for a cure,
an antidote.

807
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,356
They ran a clinical trial in that lab,
on humans.

808
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,593
We found a test subject,
a survivor,

809
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,638
if you can call him that.

810
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,607
Whatever they were given...

811
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,838
was making it worse,
much worse.

812
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,511
Were there rats in that lab?
Rats are the carriers.

813
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,208
We thought we caught a break
stopping your flight.

814
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,912
Our orders were to try everything
to keep you alive and contained.

815
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:37,354
You don't know what the fuck
this really is or how to treat it.

816
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,087
If what I've seen in here spreads out
into the general population

817
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,663
and we have no clue
how to deal with this--

818
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,927
So we're the fucking lab rats now?
National security.

819
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,901
They're never gonna let us
out of here now, are they?

820
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,772
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't. Put it down.
- Easy.

821
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,309
Just put the gun down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

822
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,478
What do you think?
- No!

823
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:15,554
There's no way out of here.
We are going to die.

824
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,926
That's not true.
We're gonna find a way out--

825
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:21,103
Don't say that. Stop lying.
There's no way out of here.

826
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:24,034
Don't give up.
There's a way out. We will find a way.

827
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,140
- No, there's not.
- There's always a way.

828
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,436
We're gonna stay in here
all night until the people get us.

829
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,507
Shut up. Shut up.

830
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,576
The rain.
What?

831
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,482
The rain. This terminal,
it floods when it rains bad.

832
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:43,317
They said there's a service tunnel
somewhere that never got sealed up.

833
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,153
A tunnel?
Are you kidding me?

834
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,454
Where Terminal F was gonna go.
Never got built.

835
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,224
Airport Authority ran out of cash.
Where is it?

836
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,935
I don't know,
but I know how to find it.

837
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,640
Oh, my God!
Shoot it! Shoot it!

838
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,674
Get the gun!
Shoot that motherfucker! Shoot it!

839
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,737
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Shoot the motherfucker!

840
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,744
There are no bullets!

841
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,315
Shoot him! Shoot him!

842
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:13,614
George! Press the green button!
Okay, okay, okay.

843
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:21,791
Oh, my God!

844
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,023
Follow me.

845
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,682
Shh. Hey, quiet.

846
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,184
Come on, let's go.
We gotta get to the office.

847
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,587
Find that tunnel to Terminal F.

848
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,558
Hey, hey.

849
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,559
Hold on. Hold on.

850
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:34,202
Where's Henry? Where's Henry?

851
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:38,032
We gotta keep moving.
Come on.

852
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,280
- They got her.
- They got her. Let's go!

853
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,779
- Move. Move.
- Go, go, George, go! Run!

854
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,282
Move, they're here. Let's go.

855
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,887
Come on. Don't stop.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

856
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,560
- What was that?
- Henry.

857
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,762
- What was that, Jenny?
- Move, move, move. Let's go.

858
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,841
Come on.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

859
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,710
Keep moving.
- Jenny.

860
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,641
Jenny, get up.

861
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,347
Jenny.

862
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,076
- She's infected.
- Oh, shit.

863
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,478
Paula.

864
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,495
Paula, stay back.

865
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,462
Go!

866
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,368
Give me the wrench.

867
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,535
Jenny! Jenny!

868
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,948
Come on.

869
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,557
Come on. Let's go.

870
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:13,668
Come on, I got you.
Let's go, kid. Here we go. All right.

871
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,504
Go.
Right there.

872
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:20,431
Come on.

873
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:25,507
Go, go. Get in. Get in. Okay.
Find anything that says Terminal F, okay?

874
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,706
Check all the blueprints. Go.

875
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:32,611
Where? Where do we look?
In the corner. Check the corner.

876
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:35,188
It should say right here.
Check the corners.

877
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,758
F, F, F.

878
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,071
George,
what are you doing?

879
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,175
You stole this from Henry?

880
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,553
Look at these.
What are you doing?

881
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,724
Found it.
Terminal F schematic design.

882
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,130
Bring it over.

883
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,602
All right. Okay.

884
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,936
Okay, okay.
Where are we?

885
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:31,944
Terminal F. Good.

886
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:34,412
Yeah, that's it.
Okay, okay, this is it.

887
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:38,781
We're right here. Looks like
the tunnel's entrance is in a shaft.

888
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,922
Right behind the crew-break area.
How do we get to it?

889
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,959
Okay, we go through the work bay
to tarmac level.

890
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:48,960
We gotta get through that wall,
into that wall space.

891
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:53,261
Once we're here, all we gotta do
is walk the service tunnel

892
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,869
and we'll make it to Terminal F.
We'll be fine.

893
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,000
Go!

894
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,466
They got you.
That's a bite.

895
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,136
Yeah.
But you'll be okay, right?

896
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:33,999
Because you have this?

897
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,646
I found it hidden
in his briefcase.

898
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,471
Bring it to me.

899
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,016
That's the antidote, right?

900
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:47,218
That you were testing in L.A.
in that apartment building?

901
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,684
Come on, hand it over.
Who the hell are you?

902
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:53,794
I told you before on the plane,
I'm one of the good guys

903
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,295
willing to do something,
take responsibility for the future.

904
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,027
By starting a fucking plague.
Nobody else is doing anything.

905
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,226
Are you?

906
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:04,531
How many people
were you planning to kill?

907
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,231
As many as it takes.
So you decide who lives?

908
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,274
No, we do.

909
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,344
Because the alternative
is that no one lives.

910
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:16,416
Our population keeps growing and
consuming while our planet is dying.

911
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,721
Don't make me shoot her,
George.

912
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:26,395
Bring it here.
No!

913
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,222
Ed! Ed!

914
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:31,229
Against the wall! Against the wall!
- Okay. All right.

915
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:34,335
Against the wall! Against the wall!
All right.

916
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,752
How'd you get that through security?

917
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,814
The same way
I got the rats through.

918
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:57,083
Same way I found out my lab
in Los Angeles was compromised.

919
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,887
I had to take my toys
and leave town.

920
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,961
Friends of the cause.

921
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:08,126
Same ones who arranged
for my arrival in Kansas City

922
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:13,171
and the ones who will help me
once I get out of here.

923
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,052
Antibodies need the virus
to kick in.

924
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,662
Fight the infection,
keep it from damaging the brain.

925
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,870
What is that?

926
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:55,844
You're a smart kid. Maybe smart
enough to be one of us someday.

927
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,485
Go to hell.

928
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,713
Don't buy in to all that
big government bullshit.

929
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:06,754
They label people like us "extremists,"
"doomsday cults," "terrorists,"

930
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,830
because that's easier
than telling you the truth.

931
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,795
What is the truth, Henry, huh?

932
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,640
Earth could use
a good plague.

933
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,813
Move and I'll kill you.

934
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,853
Oh, amazing.

935
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,085
I can't feel a thing.

936
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,924
Sure it works?
Ran the trials myself in L.A.

937
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:18,266
I heard that didn't go so well.
Shut up!

938
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,367
Time to go, George.
Don't touch him.

939
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:24,596
Hey, let him go.

940
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,335
This is his only chance.
Come on. Move it!

941
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,169
Jenny.

942
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,846
Come on, Jenny. Come on.
Okay.

943
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,788
Come on. We have to go
after them. Come on, let's go.

944
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,056
Come on, Jenny, go.

945
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:50,231
Go. I'm gonna catch up.
Take this.

946
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:53,061
I'll go first. I'll get him.

947
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,327
Hurry.
Okay.

948
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,198
All right?

949
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,521
No. Let me go.

950
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:20,456
George?

951
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:26,567
Oh, shit. Shit!

952
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,574
Oh, God. Oh, God.

953
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:49,751
Shit.

954
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,803
Come on! Come on!

955
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:12,272
Die, you fucking shit!

956
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:09,226
It's me.
Shilah? Shilah?

957
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,167
What is that?

958
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:18,674
Thermal vision. CDC left it behind.
You see them before they see you.

959
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:23,740
George and Henry,
they went in there, into the wall.

960
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,749
Why didn't you follow them?

961
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,246
Here.

962
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,224
Just not my day to fly.

963
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,599
You get George, you kill that rat,
and you get out.

964
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:50,336
Shilah. Shilah.
I'm gonna try to buy you some time.

965
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:51,570
Shilah.

966
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:06,758
Hey, Flight 318!
I'm over here, motherfuckers!

967
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,503
Oh, shit.

968
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,679
Shoot.

969
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:40,485
Mice. Mice. Just mice.

970
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:35,272
George?

971
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:38,910
Jenny?
Hold on, George. I'm coming down.

972
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:42,647
No. Henry-- It didn't work.

973
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:45,411
Don't come down here.

974
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,885
There's a flashlight and a gun by your feet.

975
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,921
I can't see them.

976
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,820
I'm coming down.
Stay up there.

977
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:55,485
Stay there, George.
No. Go back, please. No.

978
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:01,169
Jenny, please don't.
Please go back up. Please, please.

979
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:05,101
Stay up there, please.
Please, go back, Jenny.

980
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,833
Don't come down here, please.
Please.

981
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:42,271
Run, George! Run! Run!

982
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,302
Run!

983
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,184
Hey, you.

984
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,068
Did you get him?

985
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,928
Jenny.

986
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:11,895
Look.

987
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,499
Where is he?
Look.

988
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:37,559
Henry.

989
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,345
Come on.

990
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,088
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

991
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:07,490
Did he get you?
No. Did he bite you?

992
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,028
What happened?

993
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,293
When we climbed out,
he tried to bite me.

994
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:23,842
The terminal.
They're burning it down.

995
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:28,649
Come on. Hold it there.

996
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:31,751
It's the tunnel to Terminal F.
It's welded shut.

997
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:34,252
There's no way out, Jenny.

998
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:36,624
Stay there.

999
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,628
Come on.
It's locked.

1000
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:44,664
We're not gonna get out.
It's rusted. I'll get it open.

1001
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:47,994
I just wanna go home.
Step back. Step back.

1002
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,410
Come on. We gotta go.
I'm not going in there.

1003
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,241
Listen to me. Listen to me.
We have no choice.

1004
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,076
I gotta get you in there, okay?

1005
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,808
Trust me.
I can't go in there.

1006
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:05,452
Come on, we gotta go.
No way.

1007
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:09,090
Listen, George. We don't have
any other choice, all right?

1008
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,054
Look, look.

1009
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:17,090
Be my eyes, okay?
You tell me what you see. Ready? Go.

1010
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:19,333
I don't see anything.

1011
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:22,002
It's just a baggage tunnel.
I'm right behind you.

1012
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:25,332
Promise?
I promise. Go.

1013
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:27,774
Go.

1014
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,943
Keep going.

1015
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,049
George, don't slow down.

1016
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:44,314
Keep going. Keep going, George.
Don't stop.

1017
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:46,153
Go, go.

1018
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,529
Go, George, go. Hurry.

1019
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:26,359
Why'd you stop?

1020
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:33,306
Keep going.

1021
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,760
Don't stop.
Jenny.

1022
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:07,073
I'm infected, George.
Keep going.

1023
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,609
No, you're not.

1024
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:17,308
It's happening so fa--

1025
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,043
I'm sorry.

1026
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:23,251
I can feel it.
I don't have much time.

1027
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,323
You'll be okay.
Go, please.

1028
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:28,621
You're fine.
Leave me.

1029
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,526
I'm not going without you.

1030
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,093
Leave me!

1031
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:37,263
You won't hurt me.

1032
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:41,501
I'm not going without you.

1033
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,234
Okay?

1034
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,108
Okay.

1035
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,449
Jenny, I think I see--

1036
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:38,565
Jenny, we made it.

1037
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,109
Jenny.

1038
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,451
Jenny?

1039
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,085
Get out here!

1040
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:03,649
I'm not leaving without you.
