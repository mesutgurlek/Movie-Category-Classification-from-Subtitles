THE WITCH

00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,077
A presentation from a cultural
and historical point of view

3
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,851
in 7 chapters of moving pictures.

4
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,124
BENJAMIN CHRISTENSEN wrote the
script and produced this film

5
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:38,533
between the years
of 1919 and 1921.

6
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,196
For the photography I am grateful
to Mr. Johan Ankerstjerne

7
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:47,041
and to Mr. Richard Louw
for the art direction.

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,947
My main sources are mentioned
in the theatre's playbill.

9
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:56,882
Let us look into the history
of mysticism and try to explain

10
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:01,960
the mysterious chapter
known as the Witch.

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,931
The belief in sorcery
and witchcraft

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,341
is probably as old as mankind.

13
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,777
When primitive man is confronted
with something incomprehensible,

14
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:29,856
the explanation is always
sorcery and evil spirits.

15
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:35,255
In Persia, the imaginary creatures
depicted in the following picture

16
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:40,332
were thus believed
to be the cause of diseases.

17
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:57,210
The English scientist Rawlinson
and French scientist Maspero

18
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,754
show us pictures of evil spirits,
believed to have resided

19
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,655
amongst the first civilizations.

20
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,938
The belief in evil spirits,
sorcery and witchcraft

21
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,814
is the result of naive notions
about the mystery of the universe.

22
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,023
Here we see how the Egyptians
perceived the shape of the world

23
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,462
(according to Maspero).

24
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,841
The ancient Egyptians believed
that high mountains

25
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,506
surrounded land
and water on all sides.

26
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,750
The sky was made of steel
and supported by strong pillars

27
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,323
that stood on the high mountains.

28
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:25,231
The stars, like lamps,
hung from the sky on ropes.

29
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,371
According to the beliefs
of other ancient civilizations,

30
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,176
the sky was vaulted and the earth
shaped into terraces.

31
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,294
The evil spirits of ancient times
changed in the medieval folklore

32
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,367
to devils, sneaking around
and tempting children.

33
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,258
The devils lived in the earth's core.

34
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,054
In the latter part of the Middle
Ages the earth was considered

35
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,926
to be a stationary sphere
in the middle of the universe.

36
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,300
Above the earth and its waters -

37
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,744
- the medieval man first imagined
a layer of air -

38
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,883
- then a layer of fire -

39
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:01,063
- and outside the fire were the
planets, moving celestial bodies.

40
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:16,678
Each planet was attached to its
transparent, movable sphere.

41
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,716
And outside the planetary spheres

42
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,793
were the fixed stars arranged
in a sky of their own.

43
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,466
Above it all, in the tenth
crystal sphere,

44
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,602
sits the Almighty surrounded
by nine choirs of angels...

45
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,781
...and He is the One keeping
the spheres revolving.

46
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,501
Deep down in the earth's
core lies Hell,

47
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:21,306
where those tempted by the
Devil shall suffer forever.

48
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,752
In the upper part
of the following picture

49
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,324
(from the French historian Lacroix)

50
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,987
The devils are stuffing
the damned into large pots.

51
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,964
A sinner is thrown straight
into the fire

52
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,871
burning under one of the cauldrons.

53
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,777
A devil pours the nasty
sulfur oozing

54
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,855
from a horn down a man's throat.

55
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:14,024
Two monsters torment some of the
damned with their sharp teeth.

56
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,575
I have found a strange old
mechanical presentation of Hell,

57
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,645
which offers a good understanding
of the beliefs in the Middle Ages.

58
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,261
Observe the eagerness
with which the devils

59
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,664
tend to the fire under
the cauldrons!

60
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,434
During the Middle Ages,
devils and Hell

61
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,447
were considered real
and constantly feared.

62
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,592
Witches were thought to have
signed an unlawful pact

63
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,527
with the Devil, and therefore
they were burned at the stake.

64
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,964
The floating figure is a devil
coming to get the witch

65
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,598
by lifting her up into the air.

66
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,610
This picture of a pyre
as well as the following one

67
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,622
are from "German Life
in the Past in Pictures."

68
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,591
In this image a witch
is milking an ax handle.

69
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,404
In the following image a witch
has bewitched a man's shoe.

70
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,308
Witches usually meet in councils.

71
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,388
And after the gathering
they might, for instance,

72
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,257
sneak into a barn
and bewitch a cow.

73
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,205
The small angular symbol,
noticeable under the drawing,

74
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,831
was usually carved into the barn
door as protection against witches.

75
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,174
In this old naive drawing,
a sorcerer and a witch

76
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,546
are casting spells,
setting a village on fire.

77
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,361
Witches were believed to curse
people with diseases

78
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,397
with the help of sorcerer's powder
and magic potions.

79
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,399
Notice how the sick person
is laying naked in bed.

80
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,909
That was habitual in the past.

81
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,013
It was a general belief that the
witch was naked when, at night,

82
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,313
during the so-called Witch Sabbath,

83
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,355
she danced with the devils.

84
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,998
Women who wanted to participate
in the "Sabbath"

85
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,933
sneaked away to the sorcerer...

86
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,445
...where they could have their backs
smeared with "witch ointment".

87
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,716
The witchcraft of the ointment
would allow them

88
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,551
to fly through the air.

89
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,966
The French doctors Bourneville
and Teinturier

90
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,671
gave me the following pictures
of the Witch Sabbath...

91
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,679
...a secret satanic rite to which

92
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,011
thousands of women asserted
their participation.

93
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,979
At the Sabbath witches
and sorcerers

94
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,248
first desecrate
the Church's holy cross.

95
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:40,357
Satan gives all the participants
devils' names.

96
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,463
And a ceremonial banquet is held.

97
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,112
The Sabbath food was
often prepared

98
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,910
from corpses from the gallows.

99
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,496
All witches had to show the Devil
their respect by kissing his behind.

100
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,203
After a merry dance
with the devils,

101
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,973
the witches fly home
at the first crow of the cock.

102
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,726
These scenes are often found on
famous Witch Sabbath pictures

103
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,592
from the Middle Ages
and the Renaissance.

104
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,269
To be continued.

105
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,348
THE WITCH
Chapter 2.

106
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,475
We go now to the underground
home of a sorceress

107
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,087
in the year of the Lord 1488.

108
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,918
"Tonight the stars shine
favorably over the gallows' hill."

109
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,433
"Ugh, what a stench!

110
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,101
The thief's body has been hanging
too long on the gallows."

111
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,932
"When such a thief's finger
is too dried out,

112
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:47,011
it can no longer lend
the brew any healing power."

113
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,318
"Hurry and open up, Karna, so that
the passers-by won't see me."

114
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,914
"Karna, can you perchance
get me a love potion

115
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,489
that has power over
a pious man of the church?"

116
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,661
"Here, young maiden,
take a potion of cat feces

117
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,536
and dove hearts,
boiled in the moonlight."

118
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:07,346
"A drop of this in a man's drink
will soften his heart at once."

119
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,491
"Karna, can I have
an even stronger potion?"

120
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:05,405
"If the maiden wishes to drive
the man out of his wits for love..."

121
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,243
"...I have a potion boiled in May

122
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,581
from a young and playful
male sparrow."

123
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:02,357
"Hold your coin, maiden!
First smell my ointment!"

124
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,771
"This salve is good,

125
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,204
should you wish to travel
to Brocken, one night."

126
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,479
"Secretly smear this salve on

127
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:28,609
and the pious monk might
directly come to your chamber."

128
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,855
"You will fly together
high up in the night

129
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:39,327
and he will bestow upon you
many hungry kisses."

130
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,074
"Listen Brother, I wonder...
shouldn't we pray

131
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,837
before we embark in such
a bold enterprise?"

132
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,649
"Oh Holy Mother, forgive us

133
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,721
for cutting open a person's
dead body with a knife!"

134
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:52,186
"It is not from untimely
curiosity that we so badly sin..."

135
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,967
"...but so that the cause
of many terrible diseases

136
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,973
might be revealed to us."

137
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,639
"Help! Hurry!

138
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,772
The peace of the cemetery has
been desecrated by two witches."

139
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,353
Such were the Middle Ages, when
witchcraft and the Devil's work

140
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,423
were sought everywhere.

141
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:56,288
And that is why unusual things
were believed to be true.

142
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,281
"Damned woman!
You shall not lie here

143
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:23,353
and bewitch the legs
of honest people."

144
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:28,815
"You watch out!

145
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,659
Now your filthy mouth
shall remain open for eternity."

146
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:00,022
So it happens with witchcraft
as with the Devil;

147
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:04,026
people's belief in him was so
strong that he became real.

148
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,816
The Devil is everywhere
and takes all shapes.

149
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,920
He shows himself as a
nightmare, a raging demon,

150
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,921
a seducer, a lover, and a knight.

151
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,514
The devils' companion
can be young and beautiful,

152
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,281
but she is more often
old, poor and miserable.

153
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,473
Is it from the eternal fright of
the pyre that you get drunk

154
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,809
every night, you poor old woman
of the Middle Ages?

155
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,901
When the evening bell tolls
in the night

156
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,731
and all fires in town are
covered with ashes,

157
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,771
the Devil fetches Apelone
for his adventures.

158
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:57,320
High up in the air
is Apelone's dream castle,

159
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,262
and there the Devil will
fulfill all her secret wishes.

160
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,184
To be continued

161
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,212
THE WITCH
Chapter 3.

162
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:21,314
In "Rites and Rights in the
German Past" by Franz Heinemann,

163
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:25,418
we can observe pictures
of inquisition judges at work.

164
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,341
A woman suspected of witchcraft
is thrown into the water

165
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,776
to find out whether
she is guilty or not.

166
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:54,280
In "History of Customs",
Edward Fuchs shows us

167
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,189
how the accused is tied up.

168
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,967
Two executioners use oars
to move the accused

169
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,628
in the water where
she has no support.

170
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,708
If she floats, she will be
pulled up and burned.

171
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,339
If she sinks, the judges
thank God for her innocence.

172
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,783
I will now illustrate a trial for
witchcraft from beginning to end

173
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,223
taking place at the time
when the Pope sent

174
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,159
traveling inquisition priests
out to Germany.

175
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,814
"Oh, my husband could not have
been struck by dizziness

176
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,853
so suddenly, unless a sorceress
had bewitched him!"

177
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,549
"Be comforted Anna,
wife of the Printer,

178
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,560
the power of lead
will soon reveal it."

179
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,768
"Oh, you powerful Saturn,
allow this lead

180
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,503
to show if Jesper
the Printer is bewitched."

181
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,509
"It is written here
in the shape of lead

182
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:40,385
that his dizziness is
atrocious witchcraft."

183
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,909
"Oh Peter, look, where
is the evil sorceress?"

184
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:41,280
"You might see that witch,
before you wish to..."

185
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,153
"...before I wish to."

186
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:11,911
"Jesus' Holy Cross and Wounds!

187
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,882
I did not hear you come,
Maria the Weaver!"

188
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,554
"Oh, maiden, please
have mercy on me,

189
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,660
a poor woman who has to go
begging from door to door!"

190
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,622
"Are you hungry, Maria?
If so, sit down."

191
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:54,314
"Here, eat now, if you can,
in the name of Jesus."

192
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,546
"Watch out, little sister, watch
out. That woman has evil eyes."

193
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,168
"The youngest servant
of the inquisition

194
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,712
may not exchange words
with a strange maiden."

195
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,935
"How wonderful!

196
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,810
It felt like fire when the
young maiden took my arm."

197
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,487
"Young maiden,
you know quite well

198
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:22,224
that what you're accusing this
woman of, endangers her life?"

199
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:30,473
"Swear by the cross that
you are not deadly enemies!"

200
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,965
"Let's go, young men,
before her feet are lifted

201
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,562
so that the evil witch
won't turn us all into mice."

202
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,330
"Now you can have a scalding
death, just what you deserve,

203
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,525
you damned mistress
of the Devil!"

204
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,679
To be continued

205
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:49,012
THE WITCH
Chapter 4.

206
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:52,054
Two "honest" matrons
will change the accused in jail,

207
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,124
so that she will not wear
hidden witch powder.

208
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:07,697
"Maria the Weaver was just taken
here accused of witchcraft."

209
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:13,737
"Master, look carefully,

210
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,813
there might be witch powder
hidden in the sorceress' hair."

211
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:42,129
The suspect's nights are now
dictated by the inquisition judges.

212
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:49,536
Two honorable men try amiably
to persuade her to confess.

213
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,560
If she stubbornly denies
her charges,

214
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,563
they will use a kind
of mental torture.

215
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,144
"Woman, see here the seven
holy words of Jesus crucified,

216
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,723
written on consecrated parchment."

217
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,996
"I will hang them around her neck,

218
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,866
so that the Devil will no
longer help her to be silent."

219
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:31,938
"Does she see this length of
consecrated wax as Corpus Christi?"

220
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:42,153
The accused is taken backwards
into the torture chamber,

221
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:45,318
so as not to bewitch the judge
when entering.

222
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,252
"For the last time I ask:
Does she want to confess

223
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,520
her witchcraft and her misdeeds?"

224
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,744
"Let her suffering begin
so that we might put

225
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,710
an end to the harshness
of her heart."

226
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,675
"Oh, you learned men!

227
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,474
How do you expect me to confess
to that which is not true?"

228
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:38,940
"Well, Rasmus the Executioner!
Let now the evil witch's body sting."

229
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:06,559
"Let her catch her breath, Rasmus
the Executioner, and loosen

230
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:10,230
the screw a little at a time,
as she confesses her sins."

231
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,416
"Oh, learned men! I confess that

232
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:29,321
I've given birth to many
children fathered by the Devil."

233
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,568
"And when I gave birth, Karna
and all her coven helped me."

234
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,445
"If I am spared the pain,
I will confess

235
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,076
that Trina has smeared me
with witch ointment."

236
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,825
"Oh yes, learned men, miserable
me has flown through the night air

237
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,760
to Brocken on Trina's broom."

238
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:08,315
"And the Devil's grandmother was
there with all her witchcraft."

239
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:49,155
"And many a woman, who had not
accomplished enough evil deeds,

240
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,227
was treated miserably by the Devil."

241
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:36,898
"And masses spat
upon all that is holy."

242
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,978
"And a meal of toads
and unchristened children

243
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,712
was cooked by Karna."

244
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,896
"Listen, Maria the Weaver,
did you also see

245
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,938
how the Devil put his mark
on the witches' foreheads?"

246
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,602
"Oh, learned men,
I saw the witches

247
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,771
kiss the evil one on his behind."

248
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,448
"And Anna's mother,
the wife of the Printer,

249
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,520
who wished me a scalding death -"

250
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,287
"- that damned woman, I saw her
kissing the evil one

251
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:44,025
so tenderly... and Sissel, her servant,
that old fool, was also there."

252
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,009
"And Elsa, who kicked me
some time ago,

253
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,480
she shall also burn at the stake."

254
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,084
"She passed Martin
the Writer's door

255
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,522
one moonlit night with her sister."

256
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,551
"And they cast a spell on
Martin the Writer

257
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:39,211
with the water they threw
against his door."

258
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:55,571
"And it was the very same night
that death took Martin the Writer."

259
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:11,145
"And now I will tell you
everything about the witches,

260
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,154
who yell after me
in the street where I live."

261
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,226
To be continued

262
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,902
THE WITCH
Chapter 5.

263
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,132
In this way begins the endless
turn of the wheels

264
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,971
during the witchcraft era.
Each witch gives ten others away.

265
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,568
The town wardens busy themselves.

266
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,821
If you oppose the capture of a
witch, you must be a witch yourself.

267
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,327
The destiny of young Anna,
wife of the Printer, is sealed.

268
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:52,375
So now only two people are left in
Jesper the Printer's haunted house.

269
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:01,648
During the witchcraft era it was
dangerous to be old and ugly,

270
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:05,283
but it was not safe to be young
and pretty either.

271
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,581
"Brother, help me.
My thoughts are sinful."

272
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,335
"Bare your body, Brother!"

273
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:26,097
"I'll whip your sinful body and your
poor soul, into faith healing."

274
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,928
"Oh Brother, why did you stop
the beating of the scourge?

275
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,667
Now my soul will surely
be damned."

276
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,826
"Father Henrik,
Brother John is spellbound."

277
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:27,160
"A witch appears in his cell
to tempt him."

278
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,626
"And she has grabbed him
by the wrist."

279
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:29,223
"Stand up, Brother,
Father Henrik is coming."

280
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,733
"Brother, you have not given
the maiden away

281
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,538
for a witch, have you?"

282
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:04,056
"You know the punishment
for those

283
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,327
who refuse to witness
against a witch?"

284
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:24,710
And so they fetch you too,
young maiden,

285
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:27,118
giving you their unfailing test.

286
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:39,693
"In the name of the Holy Trinity,
if you are not a witch,

287
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:41,826
you will now shed tears!"

288
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,169
"See for yourself
- you cannot shed tears,

289
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,370
as you are allied
with the evil one."

290
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:58,012
We assume now that
the young woman resists;

291
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,214
that no threat and no pain
can persuade her to confess.

292
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,827
I have tried to find out how
the excellent inquisition judges

293
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,869
behaved in such circumstances.

294
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,198
And I see in front of me some
scenes, which I do not find

295
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,070
pictured too darkly here,
on the white screen.

296
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:22,200
"Wake up, young maiden!
I bring you great happiness."

297
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,463
"See, young maiden,
I give you your freedom -

298
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:05,267
- if you would just show me
a small favor in return."

299
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,806
"Why do you taunt me, monk?

300
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:13,540
What favor can a poor creature
like me show you?"

301
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:26,590
"Teach me the beautiful art of
making thunder with this water!"

302
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:12,901
"If you do not want to take
my word, young maiden,

303
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:16,034
stand up and look out
at the jail court."

304
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:42,900
"Did the guards leave?"

305
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:48,874
"Yes, they went far away, maiden.
The keys are now in my hand

306
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:52,378
and I can secretly take you out
through the town gates tonight."

307
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,488
"And I swear eternal silence
to you, maiden,

308
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:11,566
about all you will reveal
about witchcraft with thunder."

309
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:30,318
"Do you remember, maiden,
that Jesper, the Printer's child,

310
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,114
is all alone in the world,
without relatives besides you?"

311
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:10,358
"Oh, Father Henrik, see the tears
of the young maiden.

312
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,461
Look, she cries, hence
she cannot be a sorceress."

313
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:22,066
"Silly boy! Don't you know that
witches secretly smear themselves

314
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:25,435
with spittle, so that we might
believe it to be tears?"

315
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:48,953
"Here, maiden, see the child
who will miserably perish

316
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:53,330
as a dishonorable, rejected
witch's offspring without you."

317
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,118
"Stand here and listen to all
the maiden's words,

318
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:17,123
so that later you may
bear witness against her."

319
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,828
"And will you secretly open
the jail gates

320
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,495
for the child and me, if I speak?"

321
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:42,684
"Then I will tell you that once a
traveling stone cutter told me..."

322
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,817
"...that when witches call
for thunder,

323
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,551
they put their hands in the water..."

324
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,564
"You hardened witch!
Before the sun is down tomorrow,

325
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,830
you will burn alive at the stake."

326
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,560
"And then they will burn you too,
maiden,

327
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:33,691
"as edification for man,
as sweet scent for God."

328
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:36,804
And one pyre after another
burns in the town square,

329
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:39,908
until the judges will one day
move on to the next town.

330
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,615
The witch madness,
like a spiritual plague,

331
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:54,085
ravages wherever these judges go.

332
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:10,771
In the arc of a few centuries,
over 8 million women,

333
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:13,875
men and children
were burned as witches.

334
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,708
To be continued

335
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,251
THE WITCH
Chapter 6.

336
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:29,153
There are witch confessions
that are totally insane.

337
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,987
Many women, for instance, confess
that - transformed into cats -

338
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:35,096
they soiled the altar during
the night, while two devils

339
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,461
in the shape of animals
stood guard at the church door.

340
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,297
But there are also confessions,

341
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,423
which might very well be
close to the truth,

342
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,765
namely during the times
when superstition ruled.

343
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:31,351
Many women were burned
because they confessed that

344
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:34,853
they bewitched a marriage bed
by "tying knots!"

345
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:03,913
For each knot
a pregnancy is destroyed.

346
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:10,015
And the happiness of a whole
house could be ruined

347
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:12,820
with witch hair and metal crosses.

348
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:26,664
Many women have probably really
used such magic tricks

349
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:30,209
and believed in their
destructive effects.

350
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:32,870
But, if we should judge
from the confessions,

351
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:36,917
we must take a closer look at
the props in the torture chamber.

352
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:04,336
You and I would also be driven
to confess mysterious talents

353
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:07,414
with the help of such tools.
Isn't that so?

354
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:31,455
The French doctor Paul Regnard

355
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,296
describes the way
this collar was used.

356
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:45,140
The collar was tightened with
the help of four taut ropes.

357
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,783
The wrists and ankles
of the accused

358
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,654
were tied to two iron rods
screwed to the floor.

359
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:07,999
When a fire bowl was put under
the poor victim -

360
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:12,805
- his movements were so violent

361
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,569
that the spikes of the collar
entered his neck.

362
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,747
Doctor Regnard shows another
picture, which speaks for itself.

363
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:24,408
It is simply called
"After the interrogation."

364
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,622
The "painful interrogation"
preferably began

365
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:42,066
with a "lighter" torture:
The thumbscrew, for example.

366
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:55,545
One of my actresses insisted
on trying the thumbscrew

367
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,675
when we shot these pictures.

368
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:07,227
I will not reveal the terrible
confessions I forced

369
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,263
from the young lady
in less than a minute.

370
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:17,733
In the convents during the Middle
Ages, fear of the Devil

371
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,569
escalated into an almost
hopeless despair.

372
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:38,823
The pious gave themselves up to
many a regrettable self-punishment.

373
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:00,912
Often a single nun was seized,
and suddenly

374
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,711
thereafter the whole convent
was overtaken by insanity -

375
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,552
- a mysterious, contagious insanity.

376
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:18,492
In writings that have survived
to this day,

377
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:21,227
these unhappy women wrote
down with touching simplicity

378
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:23,894
how the Devil penetrated
the convent.

379
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:01,432
"Get thee behind me, Satan!"

380
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,185
"May all good saints stand by me!

381
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:59,122
Sister Cecilia is conniving
with the evil one."

382
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:27,679
How these religious women
must have suffered,

383
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:31,808
before their nerves abandoned
them and insanity broke out?

384
01:26:32,393 --> 01:26:35,362
In their biographies, this
desperate cry is always found:

385
01:26:35,496 --> 01:26:37,794
The devil forced us into it!

386
01:26:49,677 --> 01:26:53,773
"Oh, Holy Mother, the evil
has a terrible power!"

387
01:26:56,851 --> 01:27:01,379
"Look, now he forces me into
doing what I want the least."

388
01:27:37,725 --> 01:27:39,750
"Burn me at the stake,
pious fathers!

389
01:27:39,894 --> 01:27:43,125
Can't you see what the Devil
forces me to do?"

390
01:27:51,805 --> 01:27:53,796
"Take me! Don't you see him?

391
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:55,909
The evil one stands over there
and threatens me."

392
01:27:59,013 --> 01:28:00,605
To be continued

393
01:28:00,881 --> 01:28:02,644
THE WITCH
Chapter 7.

394
01:28:02,716 --> 01:28:05,708
We pass over the Devil's
actual possessions

395
01:28:05,786 --> 01:28:08,220
(speaking in tongues
and convulsions)

396
01:28:08,355 --> 01:28:11,347
And come to present times.

397
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:14,688
The majority of witches
in the old days were poor women;

398
01:28:14,828 --> 01:28:18,025
those who are taken in
by pious organizations

399
01:28:18,165 --> 01:28:20,133
and nursing homes nowadays.

400
01:28:35,816 --> 01:28:39,547
One or more traits that might
make an old woman noticeable

401
01:28:39,687 --> 01:28:43,316
was enough to bring her to court
during the witchcraft era.

402
01:29:03,243 --> 01:29:07,873
Let us not believe that the Devil
belongs solely to the past.

403
01:29:08,215 --> 01:29:11,241
The lovely old woman, who plays
the role of Maria the Weaver

404
01:29:11,385 --> 01:29:14,047
in my film, once raised
her tired face to me

405
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:16,122
during a pause in the shoot -

406
01:29:19,827 --> 01:29:22,091
- and said: "The Devil is real.

407
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:25,357
I have seen him sitting
at my bedside."

408
01:29:30,671 --> 01:29:33,504
With the old woman's permission,
I show here the prayer book

409
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,699
in which a woman (from 1921!)

410
01:29:35,843 --> 01:29:38,676
Thinks she can tell the Devil
by sight.

411
01:30:21,522 --> 01:30:25,151
The witch's insanity can be
explained as a nervous exhaustion

412
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:28,022
that I will try to exemplify here.

413
01:30:28,162 --> 01:30:30,357
I ask my viewer to understand that

414
01:30:30,497 --> 01:30:32,761
in the following I let
the same actress -

415
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:38,133
- portray many different patients
of related nervous disorders.

416
01:30:47,448 --> 01:30:49,780
I have personally known
a very nervous young woman

417
01:30:49,917 --> 01:30:51,851
who often walked in her sleep.

418
01:31:10,571 --> 01:31:12,505
Why did she always enact
the very same thing

419
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,300
she was most afraid she would do?

420
01:31:14,441 --> 01:31:16,170
Like a witch forced by the devil,
this woman -

421
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:17,743
- both when sleeping and awake -

422
01:31:17,878 --> 01:31:19,903
gives way to a mysterious
craving to strike matches.

423
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:29,611
Had this possession anything to
do with her morbid fear of fire

424
01:31:29,756 --> 01:31:32,748
after one broke out in her home?

425
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:53,108
She stated that she felt
as if she were fighting

426
01:31:53,247 --> 01:31:56,080
against an unknown force
stronger than her own.

427
01:32:08,128 --> 01:32:11,029
Isn't there something "witch-like"
with this sleepwalker,

428
01:32:11,165 --> 01:32:14,965
who moves through the slumbering
household with her matches?

429
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:46,663
Doesn't she remind us of the nun,
who walks through the chapel

430
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,633
with her knife, forced by the Devil?

431
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:03,914
This poor woman, also
in a bewildered condition,

432
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:07,919
does during her sleep
just what she fears the most.

433
01:33:15,996 --> 01:33:20,456
These possessions - these
somnambulistic, dazed conditions -

434
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:26,369
are consistent with the nervous
diseases we call hysteria.

435
01:33:26,506 --> 01:33:28,565
And there are still more
connections between

436
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:32,270
the medieval witch and
the modern hysterical person.

437
01:33:32,412 --> 01:33:34,004
We remember for instance that

438
01:33:34,147 --> 01:33:36,877
the witch received nightly
visitations by the Devil.

439
01:33:52,165 --> 01:33:55,396
Today it is not the Devil,
but rather a famous actor,

440
01:33:55,535 --> 01:33:58,993
a popular clergyman
or a well-known doctor,

441
01:33:59,139 --> 01:34:02,734
who disturbs the calm of the night.

442
01:34:10,584 --> 01:34:13,712
The hysterical person will
undoubtedly say that

443
01:34:13,854 --> 01:34:17,483
these celebrities come to her
through the wall or window.

444
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:13,307
Notice how consciously this
unconscious woman holds

445
01:35:13,447 --> 01:35:16,939
onto her bed. A person afflicted
by hysteria always displays

446
01:35:17,084 --> 01:35:18,881
some artificial mannerisms.

447
01:35:43,844 --> 01:35:46,210
In the Middle Ages it was
believed that during the Sabbath

448
01:35:46,346 --> 01:35:48,906
the Devil put some invisible
marks on the witch's body,

449
01:35:49,049 --> 01:35:50,914
where all sensitivity vanished.

450
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:10,228
The executioner often
found insensitive areas

451
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:12,429
on the back of the accused.

452
01:36:31,391 --> 01:36:33,655
"I see clearly that you are a witch.

453
01:36:33,794 --> 01:36:37,560
You do not even feel the master's
instrument on your back."

454
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:49,909
Today, this strange insensitivity is
considered a symptom of hysteria.

455
01:37:12,566 --> 01:37:16,969
"No sir, I do not feel you touching
my back at all."

456
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,614
"Yes, it is as I thought; your
daughter is suffering from hysteria."

457
01:38:06,353 --> 01:38:09,914
"From what you told me,
I must strongly recommend

458
01:38:10,056 --> 01:38:14,049
that we detain your daughter
for the time being in my clinic."

459
01:38:23,169 --> 01:38:25,330
"It would be a pity if
your daughter

460
01:38:25,472 --> 01:38:28,635
were to have an unpleasant
exchange with the police."

461
01:38:38,785 --> 01:38:40,946
Poor little hysterical witch!

462
01:38:41,087 --> 01:38:44,989
In the Middle Ages you were
in conflict with the church.

463
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:47,116
Now it is with the law.

464
01:39:59,065 --> 01:40:01,727
"I ask you to step into my office."

465
01:40:04,304 --> 01:40:07,831
"Or do you prefer that
I call the police?"

466
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,795
"Your name? Do you have a card?"

467
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:46,010
"Your address? Do you have
a telephone in your home?"

468
01:41:02,796 --> 01:41:06,163
"Thank you, that's fine. You can
leave. I will contact you later."

469
01:41:14,941 --> 01:41:18,900
"If my family learns about this,
I will be forcefully detained."

470
01:41:22,615 --> 01:41:25,311
"I beg you to understand that
I am an unhappy, sick person.

471
01:41:25,452 --> 01:41:27,420
I do not know what I am doing."

472
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:33,218
"I have not been able to live
with this persistent fear

473
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:35,384
during the war.
I am a broken person."

474
01:41:38,765 --> 01:41:40,858
"It is as if an unknown power

475
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,094
compels me to commit
this terrible theft."

476
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:55,609
"Look here! I just stole this little,
expensively bound Russian book."

477
01:41:58,618 --> 01:42:01,712
"What shall I do with it?
I do not know a word of Russian."

478
01:42:04,657 --> 01:42:08,149
"My husband died in the war, and
I have not been the same since..."

479
01:42:16,369 --> 01:42:18,701
"I promise not to pursue this matter,

480
01:42:18,838 --> 01:42:22,535
but I have to ask you never
to visit my store again."

481
01:42:33,186 --> 01:42:36,451
Centuries have passed and
the Almighty of medieval times

482
01:42:36,589 --> 01:42:39,319
no longer sits in his tenth sphere.

483
01:42:57,877 --> 01:43:00,607
We no longer sit in church
staring terrified

484
01:43:00,747 --> 01:43:02,715
at the frescoes of the devils.

485
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:21,564
The witch no longer flies away
on her broom over the rooftops.

486
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:34,010
But isn't superstition
still rampant among us?

487
01:43:45,425 --> 01:43:47,188
Is there an obvious difference

488
01:43:47,327 --> 01:43:50,125
between the sorceress
and her customer then and now?

489
01:43:58,538 --> 01:44:00,665
We no longer burn
our old and poor.

490
01:44:00,807 --> 01:44:04,004
But do they not often suffer bitterly?

491
01:44:08,781 --> 01:44:11,716
And the little woman,
whom we call hysterical,

492
01:44:11,851 --> 01:44:14,820
alone and unhappy,
isn't she still a riddle for us?

493
01:44:19,592 --> 01:44:22,652
Nowadays we detain the unhappy
in a mental institution or -

494
01:44:22,795 --> 01:44:25,696
- if she is wealthy -
in a modern clinic.

495
01:44:35,808 --> 01:44:37,867
And then we will console
ourselves with the notion

496
01:44:38,011 --> 01:44:40,411
that the mildly temperate shower
of the clinic has replaced

497
01:44:40,546 --> 01:44:42,036
the barbaric methods
of medieval times.

498
01:45:10,743 --> 01:45:14,372
THE END
