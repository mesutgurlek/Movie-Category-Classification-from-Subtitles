1
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:03,039
- Why do they always wet themselves?
- Just get on with the task.

2
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:10,252
- They got books.
- Well, shake 'em out.

3
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:13,082
See if money comes out the pages.

4
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:17,024
It won't be in the table of contents.

5
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:20,854
Save them jokes that nobody likes
for the campfire.

6
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,816
You didn't cut him deep enough.

7
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:45,520
He had a lot of blood.
An unusual amount.

8
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,416
He has the same as every other.

9
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:51,552
Help me up.

10
00:01:57,231 --> 00:02:01,037
There are 16 major veins in the neck

11
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:03,372
and you have to cut through 'em all.

12
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:05,130
There ain't 16.

13
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,576
My uncle had an acquaintance
with a man who used to be a doctor

14
00:02:08,676 --> 00:02:12,812
and that's what he said.
Now you get on with the task.

15
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:15,814
Worthless.

16
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:18,713
Don't throw no Bibles in there.

17
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:21,319
I know it's bad luck.

18
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:24,754
Besides you can always
sell them to some idiot.

19
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:34,431
Buddy...

20
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,767
I hear horses.

21
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,462
Are you certain?

22
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:40,764
Positively.

23
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:43,593
Damn! It was that gun shot.

24
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:47,242
- A bat in China could've heard that.
- That's a full gallop.

25
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:50,607
We're gonna have to get up there
in them rocks and hide.

26
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:10,126
- Fifteen minutes 'til they get there.
- Scurry.

27
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:16,574
- You hear that?
- It was a gust.

28
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:19,945
- That's a real musical gust.
- And?

29
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:21,379
It's ominous.

30
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:25,482
This is not the time
for womanly imaginings.

31
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:27,344
Go.

32
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,652
What's that? A wolf?

33
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:38,055
Bear, looks like.

34
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:47,905
Is this some kind of sign?
"Keep out" or something.

35
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,388
We got permission.

36
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,228
Was that us?

37
00:04:00,637 --> 00:04:03,541
I thought the sun
was in the other direction.

38
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:06,029
Well, it's here now.

39
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:07,871
Get.

40
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:23,708
That's where we're goin'.
Straight through this place and deeper in.

41
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:27,697
Maybe we shouldn't be going some place
that looks like a burial ground.

42
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:32,396
To a bunch of godless savages.
Ain't no concern of the civilized man.

43
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,749
A jail on fire is safer
than a place like this.

44
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,984
It's better than sittin'
in that damn gulch,

45
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:51,121
riders comin' in from one way
and savages the other.

46
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:53,617
You want to go back there, go.

47
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:06,375
If that was a gust,
then it learned an instrument!

48
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:15,737
Listen clear! We're comin'
through here, like it or not!

49
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:24,347
- Buddy!
- Oh, Je...

50
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,563
Would you like some coffee?

51
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:08,594
No reason to stay up.

52
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,898
More sleeping I do,
quicker Autumn'll get here.

53
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,315
- Arthur O'Dwyer.
- You look real pretty when you're upset.

54
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,162
Do you intend to sit and sulk
for the next 12 weeks?

55
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:24,920
Well, what do you want me to do?

56
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,423
I advised you not to work
on the roof during the storm,

57
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:31,092
but you went up regardless, because
you had "a notion to get things done".

58
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,295
But there's no reason
to go over that again.

59
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:36,762
Didn't you just?
So is this your intention?

60
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:39,766
- Is what my intention?
- To sulk for 12 weeks?

61
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,935
I'm not sulking, I'm sour.

62
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:45,031
- Don't dodge.
- What do you want me to say?

63
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,801
I moved beeves all over the map,

64
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:53,106
with all sorts of crews from terrible
to worse to get this position.

65
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,963
You know all that I've done.

66
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:00,652
This was the big payoff
and now I'm stuck.

67
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:03,816
I understand how disappointing this is.

68
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:08,880
Lot of guys never get to be a foreman.
And when I finally do, this happens.

69
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,163
They'll be gone until autumn.
And you're here...

70
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:14,198
- I know my situation.
- You're here with me.

71
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:18,568
You're here with me for a longer duration
than any time since we were married.

72
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:21,632
Can't you see it's not all bad?

73
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,708
Of course I can.

74
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,018
And not just 'cause you're prettier
than most cows.

75
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:40,450
- Most?
- You never saw Jessica.

76
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,342
Why so quiet?

77
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:09,720
They rode out the beeves yesterday.
Like I told you yesterday.

78
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,256
Nobody left here but... wives, kids...

79
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:16,753
and dead-enders.

80
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:34,871
- Good evening, Mr. Brooder.
- Good evening.

81
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:38,560
It's like a church in here...

82
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,054
though it lacks even pious women.

83
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,853
Well, why don't you patronage the man
over there by the pianoforte?

84
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:48,175
It might enliven things a bit.

85
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,552
Pardon me.

86
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:01,777
Good evening.

87
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:05,374
If one song costs three cents,
why do three songs cost a dime?

88
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:06,795
That's the rate.

89
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:10,243
Shouldn't the price per song get cheaper
when more are commissioned?

90
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:15,081
Well, I get tired after two,
so the third costs extra.

91
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,449
Do four songs cost a dollar?

92
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:21,209
Buy a song or depart.

93
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:30,190
That was a dime.

94
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:34,760
I know the sound of Lady Liberty.

95
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:40,049
I'll have whisky.

96
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:44,971
Whiskey.

97
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,172
Sir.

98
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:04,691
- Good evening, sheriff.
- Chicory.

99
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,093
I was out for a ramble and...

100
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:13,296
that tea smells gruesome.

101
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:15,586
It's soup.

102
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:20,075
You... you think I could have some?

103
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:24,340
I haven't had a good meal today.
Maybe not anything.

104
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:27,576
Nab that chair and sit.

105
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:42,164
I forgot the spoons. You think you can
drink this without burnin' your mouth?

106
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:44,327
Oh, I like challenges.

107
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:54,469
Oh, boy, that smells good. Now that
I know it's not supposed to be tea.

108
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,688
You need to make sure you have
a couple of good meals every day.

109
00:11:06,788 --> 00:11:09,575
Can't have my backup deputy pass out
'cause he forgot to eat.

110
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:12,498
No, no, sir.
That would be shameful. No, sir.

111
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:14,940
Let it cool.

112
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:26,039
You were gonna tell me
about your ramble.

113
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:29,175
Oh, yeah. Glad you reminded me.

114
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:31,945
I was out on a ramble, a night ramble.

115
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,314
You know, just to get some clean air...

116
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:37,877
and put some fresh flowers
on Nadine's grave.

117
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:41,247
You know...

118
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:46,769
And... when I do...

119
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:49,321
I decided to go the long way.

120
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:54,800
You know, like the Serrano
does on patrol over in Spain.

121
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,070
And when I do,
I see this fella on the perimeter.

122
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,500
Sheriff, I don't know him.

123
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:08,040
This tastes like corn.

124
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:12,810
It's corn chowder.

125
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,715
Then things are lining up.

126
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:24,255
So, did he do anything?

127
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,591
The stranger?

128
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,627
Take your time.

129
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,072
He changed his clothes...

130
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:38,341
and he took some luggage and he
threw it in a hole and covered it up.

131
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,769
He went to town.

132
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:47,715
It's the official opinion of the backup
deputy that his manner was suspicious.

133
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:03,397
- Where is he?
- Who?

134
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:07,976
- The stranger.
- Oh, he's over at the Learned Goat.

135
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,689
Let's go make a survey.

136
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:50,286
- How's your tibia?
- Not thinking about tibias right now.

137
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:06,069
Did I hurt you?

138
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:10,023
- Let's do this the right way.
- Is that supposed to be a criticism?

139
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:14,042
It's instinct.

140
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,618
- Yeah.
- Careful.

141
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:29,995
Are you sure you're able to...

142
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,414
Please continue.

143
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,967
What's your predilection, mister?

144
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,969
You look like you could use
something potent.

145
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:50,871
Or omnipotent.

146
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:53,882
My brother makes this.

147
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:57,508
It's like a tree fell on you.

148
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,514
Redwood.

149
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:20,503
Sheriff, it's quiet enough in here
without the two of you comin' in here

150
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,367
and scarin' everybody off.

151
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,319
- We got business.
- Important.

152
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,986
Good evening.

153
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,133
You aren't mute, are you?

154
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,536
No.

155
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:44,087
In civilized towns,
places like Bright Hope,

156
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:47,499
you look a man direct in the face
when you talk to him.

157
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:52,772
I didn't do nothing wrong.
I'm just sat in here having a drink.

158
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:55,852
I didn't say you did anything wrong.
What's your name?

159
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,003
Buddy.

160
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:02,988
Took a moment to recall that, didn't it?

161
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:05,483
- My name is Buddy.
- Why are you here?

162
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:11,587
- I'm going to meet someone.
- What's today's date?

163
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:16,048
It seems like if you had a rendezvous
scheduled you'd know what day it was.

164
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:18,416
Let me give you an easier question.

165
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:22,986
- Who did you steal those clothes from?
- I ain't stole nothing!

166
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:26,798
Why, you're pretty angry
for a guy named "Buddy".

167
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:31,594
You've been squirting lemon juice
in my eye since you came in here.

168
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:36,632
- I didn't commit no crime.
- And why are you talkin' about crime now?

169
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:40,987
Are you carrying a weapon? A gun, knife?

170
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,873
A letter opener with a sharp point?
Dynamite?

171
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:46,705
Nope.

172
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,376
- Deputy.
- Raise your hands.

173
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:51,888
If you move in a hasty manner,
I'll put a bullet in you.

174
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,983
Well, that's the only thing.

175
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,487
Like I just told you,
I ain't got no weapon.

176
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:02,164
Because you put 'em
in that hole you dug?

177
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,642
- You alright, old man?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, I thought I had him.

178
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,902
Grab an arm.

179
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,604
Brooder...

180
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:23,147
rouse Doc Taylor.

181
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,522
Put coffee in him if he's liquored.

182
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:02,159
It's supposed to be elevated
above your heart.

183
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:07,286
Is this why you buy so many pillows?

184
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,816
I buy pillows because they're pretty.

185
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,435
This isn't comfortable.

186
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,694
Well, it's not supposed to be.

187
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,264
So it's correct.

188
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:28,447
- How does it look?
- The same.

189
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,326
You know, once the...

190
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:41,467
hellish burnin' stops feels almost nice.

191
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,797
- Thank you.
- You are very welcome.

192
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:50,040
You're takin' good care of me.
Anything I can do for you?

193
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,171
Yes.

194
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:04,241
Would you read this out loud?

195
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:07,919
It's the poem that you wrote in Wyoming.

196
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:10,995
Oh, it ain't a poem. It's...

197
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:15,960
It's just some things I was thinking
and some emotions.

198
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:20,230
- Would you read it to me?
- Well...

199
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:25,125
Feel stupid if I read it out loud.

200
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:29,008
It will not. It's beautiful.

201
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:34,313
Whenever I was alone I would read it
and I would feel better.

202
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:36,512
Please?

203
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:40,306
I can't think
of a polite way out of this.

204
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,886
That's because there isn't...

205
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,945
What time is it?

206
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:48,692
Half past ten.

207
00:19:51,952 --> 00:19:54,522
Mr. and Mrs. O'Dwyer. It's John Brooder.

208
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:57,299
I'm here regarding a medical matter.

209
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,542
Good evening, Mrs. O'Dwyer.

210
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:17,380
Are you hurt?

211
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,879
Oh, I'm not the injured party,
there was...

212
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:22,515
a drifter that got quick
with the sheriff.

213
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:25,217
- Shot in the leg?
- Shot in the leg.

214
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:28,659
- And, Doc Taylor's in his cups?
- Deep.

215
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,856
- I took his equipment.
- I have my own.

216
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:35,023
Does yours contain two bottles of vodka?

217
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,387
Where's the drifter?

218
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:39,856
He's in jail.

219
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:46,568
- Arthur?
- Yeah?

220
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:49,294
I need to extract a bullet.

221
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:52,979
- Mr. Brooder shall escort me.
- Okay.

222
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:56,210
- John?
- Yes?

223
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:01,648
If you make any flirtatious remarks in my
wife's presence there'll be a reckoning.

224
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:04,125
I'll behave, cowboy.

225
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,565
Please keep your leg elevated.

226
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,886
I'll do it.

227
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:22,108
- Bye.
- Bye.

228
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,713
You have a gift.

229
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:35,978
I have four brothers
and grew up in cold weather.

230
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,992
Checkers is all we did.

231
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:43,769
- You ever beat Nick in a checkers match?
- Nope. Though we only played twice.

232
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,756
I haven't had a different result
in a 100 games.

233
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:50,167
Maybe I shouldn't bet.

234
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:55,607
- What's that?
- A blonde hair.

235
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,779
- Looks like from a woman.
- I told you his manner was suspicious.

236
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:03,304
That's you, Doc?

237
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:06,984
It's John Brooder.
I brought Mrs. O'Dwyer.

238
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:12,547
- Good evening, Mrs. O'Dwyer.
- Ma'am.

239
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:16,517
- Thank you for comin'.
- Happy to help.

240
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:19,355
You can go.

241
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,097
You're welcome.

242
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:26,828
Fling the gate.

243
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:31,719
- What do you need from us?
- A pot of boiling water.

244
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,840
I'll get it.

245
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:42,940
- Can you remove his chains?
- No, ma'am.

246
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,863
He's that dangerous?

247
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,778
He buried that stuff outside of town.

248
00:22:46,878 --> 00:22:49,580
It's not his,
and it's got bloodstains all over it.

249
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,716
- He's boiling.
- I only shot him in the leg.

250
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:55,252
- Well, that's his hobby.
- Deputy.

251
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:58,887
Not every man who leaps
in front of your pistol is hale.

252
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:03,188
Do what you can for him.
Very likely he's gonna get hanged

253
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:05,861
but it would be nice if the families
of the people he bushwhacked

254
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:08,564
could come to town and watch him
go purple on the rope.

255
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:12,768
- Well, that should inspire her.
- Deputy. I want you to stay here tonight.

256
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:14,804
Help Mrs. O'Dwyer
with whatever she needs.

257
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:18,174
Lock everything up
and escort her home when she's done.

258
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:20,477
Isn't that why we have
a backup deputy for?

259
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:23,612
Oh, no, I'll take care of things.
I don't sleep few hours, anyway.

260
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:27,182
Nick stays. I want you to get some rest.

261
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,516
You did real good tonight.

262
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,665
Does he have a name?

263
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:42,671
He proffered "Buddy" but that's probably
somebody he hates or who's dead.

264
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:47,501
Very well. Please let my husband
know not to wait up.

265
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:50,737
I need to stay and monitor
the patient's fever after the surgery.

266
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:52,980
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:54,974
Chicory.

268
00:23:55,574 --> 00:23:59,576
Wait a minute. Hey, I'm doin'
lot better than I thought. Much better.

269
00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:02,488
You're looking at my side of the board.

270
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:04,163
Good night.

271
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:06,748
- Good night, Mrs. O'Dwyer.
- Good night.

272
00:24:06,848 --> 00:24:08,223
Good night, ma'am.

273
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:20,363
It's heating up.

274
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:22,408
Please don't stick
your fingers in the water.

275
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:25,091
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

276
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:31,303
- Thanks for lettin' me know.
- Thanks for loanin' her out.

277
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:34,505
So, Deputy Nick's gonna bring her back?

278
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:36,549
He will.

279
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:39,443
How's your wife doing?

280
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:45,282
Better. Thought maybe it was pneumonia
but seems like it was just a bad cold.

281
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:46,641
Good to hear.

282
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:50,812
- Give her my regards.
- I will.

283
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:54,599
Good night.

284
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:17,029
Dear Samantha,

285
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:20,000
I hope things are going good
for you back in Bright Hope.

286
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,081
And that Doc Taylor is drinking less.

287
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:25,187
I am in Wyoming now.

288
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,724
The ride here was long and difficult

289
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:30,859
and the foreman
had to discipline a lot of men

290
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:34,463
and let some go which made
things harder for the rest of us,

291
00:25:34,563 --> 00:25:37,447
especially in this cold weather.

292
00:25:37,547 --> 00:25:40,315
I've been in charge
of the night round-up for a while

293
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,393
and I've organized it pretty good.

294
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:48,209
Sometimes when I'm working long
I look at the faces of the other cowboys

295
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:52,743
and I can see that they're miserable
all the way through.

296
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:58,292
But since I met you I don't get
that feeling anymore like I used to.

297
00:25:58,716 --> 00:26:02,353
You give me this warmth
in my direct center

298
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:06,146
that won't turn cold no matter
what happens out here.

299
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:10,460
The other day I saw these hills
on the border

300
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,916
and the shapes of them reminded me of you
when you are next to me in bed on your side.

301
00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:21,461
Sometimes I see you in the waterfalls
and the clouds and...

302
00:26:22,036 --> 00:26:25,174
always you have that real
happy look on your face

303
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:28,442
like when I come back from being away

304
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:33,123
and we're about to kiss
for the first time in months.

305
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:39,562
That ain't a poem.

306
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:43,300
No, ma'am.

307
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,132
My body feels like cotton.

308
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:21,624
I gave you some tincture of opium.

309
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:26,336
Are you done?

310
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,774
I need to clean the wound
and sew it shut.

311
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,924
I'm coming, ladies. Don't fret.

312
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:30,101
Mr. Wallington?

313
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:32,346
Is that you?

314
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,622
Samantha, you back yet?

315
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:16,460
Sam?

316
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,980
Told you last night I'd make breakfast.
Why don't you go back to bed?

317
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,665
I'd like to do it, Franklin.

318
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:35,645
- I'm feeling better today.
- You were feelin' better last night.

319
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:38,680
You're a remedy.

320
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:44,518
And you're makin' fry bread.

321
00:29:44,844 --> 00:29:47,312
Well, that's my intention.

322
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,910
But where'd you put the spoons?

323
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:54,686
- They're no place logical.
- I thought you might explain that enigma.

324
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:57,297
Sheriff Hunt?

325
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,558
- Is that you, Clarence?
- It's me.

326
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:02,900
The door is open.

327
00:30:05,128 --> 00:30:07,197
Why are you in my breakfast?

328
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:11,032
There's a situation.

329
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:13,276
Serious.

330
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:16,045
I'll leave you two.

331
00:30:17,103 --> 00:30:18,053
Talk.

332
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:21,654
This morning I went out to tend
to my colt, needed a new shoe

333
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:25,910
and when I got there...
I saw Buford, the stable boy,

334
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,615
he was lying there dead,
he was all torn up.

335
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:31,016
An animal got to him?

336
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:34,452
I don't know. I couldn't say.
I just... I didn't care to linger.

337
00:30:34,552 --> 00:30:37,770
You know, I just went down
to the office to try and get a deputy

338
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,158
but when I went inside
there was nobody in there.

339
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,791
Nobody?

340
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:47,594
- Not even in the jail cell?
- No, sir, completely empty.

341
00:30:47,694 --> 00:30:50,047
Go up the street, fetch Chicory
and meet me in front of the stable.

342
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:51,923
Yes, sir.

343
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:05,271
Get some distance.

344
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:13,237
Listen up!

345
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:15,974
This is Sheriff Franklin Hunt.

346
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:21,270
If anybody is in there, identify yourself
right now or I'll shoot you dead.

347
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:54,173
Poor kid.

348
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:59,536
How many horses does Wallington
usually keep in here?

349
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:02,815
Well, there was my colt
and he kept five.

350
00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:06,917
Let's get to the jail.

351
00:32:55,164 --> 00:32:59,634
- Indians?
- Looks like it, but I...

352
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:01,245
I don't reckon.

353
00:33:16,987 --> 00:33:21,267
Fetch the professor and bring him
to The Learned Goat. Show him that.

354
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:30,567
I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

355
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:33,479
Are you going to talk to Mr. O'Dwyer?

356
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:35,981
Yeah.

357
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,464
Sheriff...

358
00:33:58,564 --> 00:34:01,241
is my wife still at the jail?

359
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:06,366
Let's... talk inside, Mr. O'Dwyer.

360
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:08,849
Did something happen?

361
00:34:09,373 --> 00:34:13,953
- Let's talk where you can sit.
- Tell me here and tell me plain.

362
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:17,924
Mrs. O'Dwyer was abducted.

363
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,984
I think you should go back inside
and sit down. We can talk about...

364
00:34:21,084 --> 00:34:22,996
Who took her?

365
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,190
Looks like Indians.

366
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,091
Got Nick, too.

367
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,956
We're meeting at The Learned Goat
to talk about what can be done.

368
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,688
Clarence?

369
00:34:56,088 --> 00:35:00,000
Mr. O'Dwyer, please sit.

370
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:04,045
Gizzard...

371
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:07,032
- can you brew some coffee?
- Is something amiss?

372
00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:10,676
Yeah. Put some whisky in his.

373
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:16,907
Sheriff Hunt, what do you intend
to do about my horses?

374
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:19,619
- They're not my priority right now.
- Those are my finest...

375
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:24,055
Quiet! Ask about horses again
I'll slap you red!

376
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,410
You come with me, Mr. Wallington, I'm going
to retrieve your special bottle from the bar.

377
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:34,543
I retrieved our expert.

378
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:39,226
You know who did this?

379
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:42,321
- Only one group that hunts with these.
- Who?

380
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:45,187
- They don't have a name.
- What kind of tribe doesn't have a name?

381
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:48,962
One that doesn't have a language.
Cave dwellers.

382
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:52,573
You know where they are?

383
00:35:52,673 --> 00:35:54,350
I have a general idea.

384
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,143
- You'll take us to them?
- I won't.

385
00:35:56,243 --> 00:35:58,363
- 'Cause you're an Indian?
- Because I don't want to get killed.

386
00:35:58,463 --> 00:36:01,280
- You're afraid of your own kind?
- They're not my kind.

387
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,069
They're a spoiled bloodline of inbred animals
who rape and eat their own mothers.

388
00:36:06,717 --> 00:36:09,662
- Well, what are they?
- Troglodytes.

389
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:14,398
What do they look like?

390
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:18,127
Man like you would not
distinguish them from Indians.

391
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:20,380
Even though they're
something else entirely.

392
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,917
Why would they tear that stable boy up
leave him but take the others away?

393
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,636
They don't eat Negroes.

394
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:29,674
- Do they think they're poisonous?
- Chicory.

395
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:32,343
You'll show us where they're at?

396
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:34,342
You'll be killed if you enter
their territory...

397
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,811
That wasn't the question!
Show us where they're at.

398
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:38,879
We won't be dissuaded.

399
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:41,182
Bring me a map of the western range.

400
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,461
We got an old survey map.
You know where it is, Gizzard?

401
00:36:52,826 --> 00:36:57,598
Why was my husband, the mayor, not
informed of this situation immediately?

402
00:36:57,698 --> 00:37:01,586
Well, the sheriff, he told me to go
get him but I'm old and I forgot.

403
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,838
- Do you expect me to believe that?
- I'm hoping.

404
00:37:05,238 --> 00:37:06,740
Was it Indians?

405
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,536
Troglodytes.

406
00:37:14,012 --> 00:37:16,483
This empty area is a mountain range.

407
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,053
Forbidden territory,
it has been for centuries.

408
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,029
Somewhere in the northwestern part of it
is a place my people call

409
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:25,925
the Valley of the Starving Men.
Troglodytes are said to live there.

410
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:29,830
- That's days from here.
- How many of them do you think there are?

411
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,875
It won't matter. You have no chance
against any number of them.

412
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:37,935
I'm riding out with Mr. O'Dwyer

413
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:40,704
because there isn't a choice
for either of us.

414
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:44,383
- The rest of you can stay.
- You'll be killed.

415
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:46,159
I'm coming with you.

416
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:48,559
No, no, I need you here.
I need you to keep an eye...

417
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:53,248
No, I'm coming, I'm coming. Nick's gone
and this is what a backup is for.

418
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:56,493
To help in an emergency,
not stay back. I'm coming.

419
00:37:58,052 --> 00:38:00,088
Alright, old man.

420
00:38:00,188 --> 00:38:01,956
This is suicide.

421
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:04,860
I'll get packed and meet you
in front of the jail in 15 minutes.

422
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,203
As will I.

423
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:11,131
I'm the one who fetched your wife
and got her involved.

424
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:13,867
I've got a responsibility to you both.

425
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:16,869
And I've killed more Indians
than everyone here put together.

426
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:19,170
Well, that's an ugly boast.

427
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,672
It isn't a boast...

428
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:23,984
but a fact.

429
00:38:29,347 --> 00:38:32,718
Telegraph Gatesville.
Let 'em know what happened here.

430
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:35,821
Have 'em send a couple deputies
to watch over things while I'm gone.

431
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,957
You should address the mayor directly.

432
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:41,170
- Yes, you should...
- Somebody should bury Buford.

433
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,596
He's got no kin in Bright Hope.

434
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,664
I'll have him blessed
and put underground.

435
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:47,841
Appreciate it.

436
00:38:54,972 --> 00:38:59,243
Does anybody know
how to spell "Troglodytes"?

437
00:38:59,343 --> 00:39:00,620
For the telegram.

438
00:39:36,684 --> 00:39:38,831
You'll hear it soon.

439
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:46,093
I hope that this
doesn't sound callous but...

440
00:39:46,193 --> 00:39:48,297
do you truly believe
they're still alive?

441
00:39:48,397 --> 00:39:51,241
I'm not gonna speculate on that.

442
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:57,248
There are limits to the responsibilities
of a town sheriff.

443
00:39:58,757 --> 00:40:01,343
- Riding out into the territory...
- Lorna, I'm going.

444
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,911
There isn't an option.

445
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:06,689
Let's not have words on this.

446
00:40:11,352 --> 00:40:13,364
Franklin...

447
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:20,805
Please come back.

448
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:42,711
Hey, Greg.

449
00:40:51,965 --> 00:40:54,885
Here. I got some fresh wilds.

450
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,414
Oh, there's some good people in trouble.

451
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:11,738
And I got to do what I can for 'em.

452
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:17,759
So... I'll see you back here.

453
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:21,804
They're way up high.

454
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:41,549
- Is that my wife's kit?
- It is.

455
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:43,726
I'll carry it.

456
00:41:49,454 --> 00:41:53,826
If we don't find Wallington's stock can your
stallion carry both you and Mrs. O'Dwyer?

457
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:56,163
- I'm carrying her.
- Good.

458
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,922
Nick can ride with me if he has to,
this animal's strong.

459
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:07,603
Mr. O'Dwyer, I need to say this to you
and I don't want you to get sore.

460
00:42:07,703 --> 00:42:09,605
We're making a five day journey
in three days.

461
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:12,073
Ridin' long and sleepin'
the bare minimum.

462
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:14,676
We need to take care
of these animals and ourselves.

463
00:42:14,776 --> 00:42:16,411
I ain't thinkin' about myself right now.

464
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:19,446
I know you're not which is why
I'm puttin' this to you direct.

465
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:21,815
If our horses die before we get there

466
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,868
or we go into hostile territory
weak and foggy with exhaustion,

467
00:42:24,968 --> 00:42:27,019
we won't rescue anybody.

468
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,956
The only advantage we have over
these cave dwellers is bein' smarter.

469
00:42:31,056 --> 00:42:32,890
So let's not lose that.

470
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,060
It ain't gonna be easy makin' camp
while these sa...

471
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,163
I know it won't. But we need
to keep ourselves collected.

472
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:40,708
Well, it ain't gonna be easy.

473
00:42:41,786 --> 00:42:45,112
- I got the dynamite.
- How many?

474
00:42:45,803 --> 00:42:47,005
Six.

475
00:42:47,105 --> 00:42:50,109
Now, that is not a handsome horse.

476
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:52,846
Come on! Come on!

477
00:43:31,623 --> 00:43:34,958
- Let me help you down.
- I can do it.

478
00:43:35,058 --> 00:43:37,068
Not gracefully.

479
00:43:44,784 --> 00:43:47,502
Pain is how your body talks to you.

480
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:50,180
You'd do well to listen to it.

481
00:43:55,643 --> 00:43:58,521
- Mr. O'Dwyer.
- Yeah?

482
00:43:59,013 --> 00:44:02,609
Are we gonna come across
any more ponds before dark?

483
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,586
I don't know what's west of here.

484
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:08,946
No cattle trail or anything else
goes in that direction.

485
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,736
Let's fill up here.

486
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:09,965
That reminds me...
I forgot to pack the Yule tree.

487
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,294
- Are any of you somnambulists?
- That's private.

488
00:45:14,394 --> 00:45:18,230
- He means sleepwalk.
- Oh. No, I don't.

489
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,205
- Me neither.
- Nope.

490
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:23,134
Good.

491
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:25,335
Sleep with your guns nearby...

492
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:28,640
and shoot anything that rings a bell.

493
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:31,641
Could be an innocent animal
or somebody lost.

494
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:34,219
Our horses are hobbled.

495
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:37,647
Any animal that comes at us
is a predator.

496
00:45:37,747 --> 00:45:41,100
Any person that approaches a camp
in the dark without identifying himself

497
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,412
is a criminal or a savage.

498
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,066
If you hear a jingle,
point your gun and shoot.

499
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:54,271
I'll probably beat you to the draw
but don't count on me to save you.

500
00:45:55,529 --> 00:45:57,774
Let it go.

501
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:00,967
I can't.

502
00:46:01,067 --> 00:46:03,711
Hey, hey!

503
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:08,135
You watch how you speak to the law
the sheriff especially.

504
00:46:08,235 --> 00:46:11,108
- You aren't the captain.
- No.

505
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:14,179
But I'm the most intelligent man here
and I intend to keep us alive.

506
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:16,980
Oh, you're the most intelligent here.
Is that a fact?

507
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,096
It is.

508
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:22,238
Sheriff Hunt has a wife,
so does Mr. O'Dwyer.

509
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:24,289
And you're a widower.

510
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:28,226
Yeah, what does that got
to do with anything?

511
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:30,170
Smart men don't get married.

512
00:46:35,432 --> 00:46:37,103
Well...

513
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:40,612
That's because no woman would want you.

514
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:45,316
Many women invite me over for dessert.

515
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:48,900
- Eleven in Bright Hope.
- John...

516
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,461
enough with that kind of talk.

517
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:53,873
Alright, cowboy.

518
00:47:06,128 --> 00:47:07,898
- You got enough?
- Oh, there's plenty.

519
00:47:07,998 --> 00:47:09,499
- Sure?
- Yeah.

520
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,909
- Blow on it first.
- Right. Yes, sir.

521
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:17,042
Let us pray.

522
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:25,706
Bless us, O Lord,
and these, thy gifts...

523
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,365
which we are about to receive...

524
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,971
from...

525
00:47:58,815 --> 00:48:00,294
When do we leave?

526
00:48:01,985 --> 00:48:06,307
I'll rouse everyone when I wake up. I don't
sleep more than about four hours a night.

527
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,324
Sheriff?

528
00:48:31,984 --> 00:48:36,163
Can... can you read a book in the bath?

529
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,030
I don't understand what you're askin'.

530
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,009
What I'm asking is, can you sit in a bathtub
full of hot water and read a book?

531
00:48:47,498 --> 00:48:49,099
I've never tried.

532
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:54,156
I hear about people doing it all the time
but every time I try, I ruin the book.

533
00:48:55,373 --> 00:48:59,443
I splash water on it or I get it wet
turning the pages.

534
00:48:59,775 --> 00:49:02,320
I've even dropped some in.

535
00:49:03,946 --> 00:49:08,185
Why are you so determined
to read literature while takin' a bath?

536
00:49:08,285 --> 00:49:10,252
Well, it's just...

537
00:49:10,352 --> 00:49:13,730
It's just nothing feels better
than sitting in that tub...

538
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:17,827
but it just gets so dull looking
at your toes all the time.

539
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:28,609
Why don't you get a music stand?

540
00:49:29,368 --> 00:49:33,711
Like the kind an orchestra fellow
uses or the choirmaster?

541
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,951
Now that's an idea.

542
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,429
You put your book on that.

543
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:41,870
Right next to the tub.

544
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:44,817
Keep a towel near, so you can...

545
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:48,560
You can dry your fingers, you know,
before you turn the pages.

546
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,715
First thing I'm gonna do when I get back is
I'm gonna go get me one of those stands.

547
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:04,302
Hey!

548
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:08,078
I bet you Mr. Brooder
couldn't have thought of that solution.

549
00:50:08,178 --> 00:50:12,248
- Good night, old man.
- Good night.

550
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:16,608
Here is the official opinion of the backup
deputy of Mr. O'Dwyer's behavior.

551
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:18,709
Suspicious.

552
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,887
Well, he's got a lot on his mind.

553
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:30,953
Could I borrow the German?

554
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:33,990
If you broke it, would you go to Hamburg
and purchase a replacement?

555
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:38,002
Oh, of course I would.
Peter loved schnitzel.

556
00:51:39,294 --> 00:51:41,204
I'll look myself.

557
00:51:43,948 --> 00:51:46,125
What do you see?

558
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:49,579
A snake...

559
00:51:49,979 --> 00:51:52,038
in a tree.

560
00:51:52,138 --> 00:51:54,173
What kind?

561
00:51:55,941 --> 00:51:57,985
Deceased.

562
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:50,746
Oh, Jesus, goddamn!

563
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:58,452
Sorry.

564
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:43,038
Damn, damn, damn!

565
00:54:07,355 --> 00:54:10,257
- You know when?
- Yes, sir.

566
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:12,766
Brooder...

567
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,003
don't step in the middle.

568
00:54:15,103 --> 00:54:17,172
I shan't.

569
00:54:22,035 --> 00:54:25,370
- How's the leg?
- Swollen.

570
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,983
- Any signs of infection?
- I don't think so.

571
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:32,178
Chicory should look at it tonight
when we've camped.

572
00:54:32,278 --> 00:54:34,445
He did some surgery in the war.

573
00:54:34,545 --> 00:54:36,981
I'll mind it myself.

574
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:38,659
With that tincture of opium?

575
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:45,489
You went through my things?
My wife's possessions?

576
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:47,991
- I did.
- Well, you shouldn't have!

577
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:51,195
- Give it back, you dumb imbecile!
- Don't hurl insults at Chicory,

578
00:54:51,295 --> 00:54:53,531
he's followin' orders.
Now give over that bottle.

579
00:54:53,631 --> 00:54:55,364
It ain't yours to claim.

580
00:54:55,464 --> 00:54:57,801
If you use that stuff,
you'll spill from the saddle.

581
00:54:57,901 --> 00:55:00,745
I'm tryin' to prevent that accident.

582
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:06,475
I ain't had any.

583
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:09,753
I apologize for goin'
in your wife's things.

584
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,688
Will you yield it?

585
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:28,740
Mr. O'Dwyer rides vanguard.

586
00:55:37,973 --> 00:55:39,840
Mr. Kory.

587
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,985
Call me Chicory.

588
00:55:42,943 --> 00:55:45,021
Chicory.

589
00:55:45,979 --> 00:55:48,498
I'm sorry for hollerin' at you.

590
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:51,919
My wife used to call me
a dumb imbecile all the time.

591
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:54,195
Felt kinda nice.

592
00:56:04,664 --> 00:56:06,433
Brooder...

593
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:09,470
Take a look with the German.
We need to put in soon.

594
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,306
I'll make a survey.

595
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:13,341
- Sheriff.
- Old man?

596
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:16,787
You know, I know that the world's
supposed to be round but...

597
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:19,441
I'm not so sure about this part.

598
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,449
He's all the way empty.

599
00:56:53,552 --> 00:56:57,904
You think that infection
could turn to gangrene?

600
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,537
It could go either way.

601
00:57:04,197 --> 00:57:07,033
Have you ever performed an amputation?

602
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:10,312
Yeah. In the war.

603
00:57:11,203 --> 00:57:14,249
But even done correctly...

604
00:57:14,657 --> 00:57:16,425
chances aren't good.

605
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:21,822
That seems like an especially miserable
way to spend your final days.

606
00:57:24,216 --> 00:57:26,260
The worst.

607
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:37,528
Relax, gentleman, relax.
Don't be scared. I am a friend.

608
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:39,629
You aren't.

609
00:57:39,729 --> 00:57:43,133
- You're a stranger and a sneak.
- I was about to announce myself.

610
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:46,906
Strike a match so we can see you clear
or we'll light things up with our guns.

611
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:49,947
- Mind our backs.
- One moment, <i>por favor.</i>

612
00:57:52,106 --> 00:57:55,661
- My name's Ramiro.
- You got any <i>compañeros</i>?

613
00:57:55,761 --> 00:57:59,365
- I have an associate.
- Tell him to strike a match.

614
00:57:59,515 --> 00:58:01,785
Do what they ask.

615
00:58:08,456 --> 00:58:10,358
- Just him?
- Just him.

616
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:13,428
If we see any others lurkin' around,
we'll execute you.

617
00:58:13,528 --> 00:58:15,730
I speak the truth.
I was going to announce myself...

618
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,305
Be quiet and toss your guns.

619
00:58:23,305 --> 00:58:25,372
My associate is unarmed.

620
00:58:25,472 --> 00:58:29,319
Come forward. Don't drop those matches.

621
00:58:34,048 --> 00:58:36,125
See if you can salvage the fire.

622
00:58:39,785 --> 00:58:41,895
Damn you!

623
00:58:52,581 --> 00:58:54,760
Deputy, hold.

624
00:59:02,576 --> 00:59:04,653
Holster your gun.

625
00:59:05,277 --> 00:59:07,367
You had no cause.

626
00:59:07,467 --> 00:59:10,890
Those men were scouts
for a raiding party.

627
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:14,752
- Or thieves.
- You don't know that.

628
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:17,056
And I wanted to get information
from 'em in any case.

629
00:59:17,156 --> 00:59:19,925
They wouldn't have told you
the correct year much less anything else.

630
00:59:20,025 --> 00:59:23,695
- I know how to interrogate a man.
- He's got a system.

631
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:29,328
We need to pack up and make a cold camp
somewhere else some place defensible.

632
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:33,991
If you want to question
my morals, do it later.

633
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,488
There aren't any to question.

634
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,518
What transpired?

635
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,790
Mr. Brooder...

636
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,760
just educated two Mexicans...

637
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,021
on the meaning of manifest destiny.

638
01:00:01,363 --> 01:00:03,632
They deserve it?

639
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:06,144
I don't know.

640
01:00:07,435 --> 01:00:09,646
Are we breakin' camp?

641
01:00:10,905 --> 01:00:13,875
No, you go back to sleep.
I'll wake you when we're...

642
01:00:13,975 --> 01:00:15,911
Unless you want to eat dinner.

643
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:19,580
Here, we saved some for you.
Pork and beans.

644
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,525
Thank you.

645
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:55,796
Well, were they armed?

646
01:00:56,456 --> 01:00:58,467
Sort of.

647
01:00:59,592 --> 01:01:01,870
What time is it?

648
01:01:02,862 --> 01:01:07,270
It's about nine,
but it feels like next week.

649
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:25,190
I see a spot.

650
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,723
- Shielded on one side.
- Good enough.

651
01:01:48,446 --> 01:01:51,058
You shouldn't have shot those Mexicans.

652
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:58,121
You hear me, Brooder? It was wrong.

653
01:01:58,221 --> 01:02:00,702
Go to sleep, ol' timer.

654
01:02:01,558 --> 01:02:05,661
- One of 'em was wearing a crucifix.
- Then Jesus should've helped them.

655
01:02:05,761 --> 01:02:08,925
You shouldn't call
for the Lord's attention right now.

656
01:02:09,597 --> 01:02:12,774
- I'm not overly concerned.
- Quiet!

657
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:16,547
We need to sleep every minute we can.

658
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:20,417
- The situation is bad enough already.
- Well, he was wrong...

659
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:23,548
- Deputy!
- Yes, sir.

660
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,874
Ambush!

661
01:02:49,736 --> 01:02:51,638
Blast!

662
01:02:52,588 --> 01:02:54,659
They got the horses!

663
01:02:56,808 --> 01:02:59,009
Save your bullets.

664
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,045
They're beyond.

665
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:03,780
I don't understand
how they got them all.

666
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,384
Saucy would never allow
some greaser on her back.

667
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:09,517
You trained her in bigotry?

668
01:03:09,617 --> 01:03:12,990
She's smart and she's loyal.

669
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,403
John...

670
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:23,424
Looks like she resisted.

671
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,880
I'm coming.

672
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,738
Thank you for your services.

673
01:04:39,785 --> 01:04:42,920
We need to compact our gear
and bury the remainder.

674
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:47,488
If we sleep, it should be
in hot daylight, not now.

675
01:04:48,326 --> 01:04:52,297
Mr. O'Dwyer, that valley
is at least a two day walk...

676
01:04:52,397 --> 01:04:57,070
I'll try to match your pace. If I fall
behind, I'll catch up when you sleep.

677
01:05:03,742 --> 01:05:05,586
Alright.

678
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:09,479
Brooder, compact your gear
to the essentials.

679
01:05:09,579 --> 01:05:11,146
I shall.

680
01:05:11,446 --> 01:05:15,195
- Sorry about Saucy.
- Yes, sir.

681
01:05:15,295 --> 01:05:17,584
She was top quality.

682
01:05:17,684 --> 01:05:19,562
Thank you.

683
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:27,192
We'll carry your stuff.

684
01:05:27,626 --> 01:05:31,140
Go on, get ahead of us.

685
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:38,070
When you pack,
don't forget her medicine kit.

686
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:40,047
We won't.

687
01:05:55,922 --> 01:05:58,126
You watch the terrain now.

688
01:05:58,226 --> 01:06:02,204
'Cause one bad fall,
you could lose that leg.

689
01:06:19,515 --> 01:06:22,094
Watch out for those brigands.

690
01:06:33,631 --> 01:06:36,836
Over in Mississippi, Nadine and I

691
01:06:36,936 --> 01:06:41,472
saw a cripple on crutches,
with one leg race a normal man and win.

692
01:06:41,572 --> 01:06:44,310
He... he took these huge strides

693
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:48,414
kind of a back and forth motion
like a pendulum.

694
01:06:48,514 --> 01:06:52,626
He's... he's uncommonly hasty, yeah.

695
01:06:53,851 --> 01:06:56,730
It isn't the same with a hurt leg.

696
01:06:58,606 --> 01:07:01,604
I was just pointing out
the possibilities.

697
01:08:14,893 --> 01:08:17,259
Mr. O'Dwyer!

698
01:08:19,814 --> 01:08:21,950
Are you well?

699
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:24,261
I'm fine!

700
01:08:41,054 --> 01:08:44,752
I wonder if Peter
will enjoy Mexican food.

701
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:49,542
I imagine he'll like tamales.

702
01:08:52,049 --> 01:08:56,615
If somebody gives him a hot pepper
they'll get a hoof in the face.

703
01:08:57,253 --> 01:08:59,521
Aren't you tired?

704
01:08:59,621 --> 01:09:04,444
Oh, no! Out on the plain here
just pretending to be a pack mule.

705
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,930
That in no way affects
the endeavors of your mouth?

706
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:13,097
Well, would you prefer the...
sound of trudging footsteps

707
01:09:13,197 --> 01:09:15,413
and men breathing?

708
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:18,556
That makes it worse.

709
01:09:26,547 --> 01:09:28,483
Just keep on. I'll catch up.

710
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:31,361
- You sure?
- I don't have a choice.

711
01:09:32,986 --> 01:09:36,432
Just mark the route
with four stones every so often.

712
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:42,476
- We will.
- Here.

713
01:09:42,995 --> 01:09:46,046
You take this if you're gonna trail.

714
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,612
We'll use Brooder's German.

715
01:10:01,132 --> 01:10:05,286
I believe Peter will learn
to appreciate Mexican women.

716
01:10:05,386 --> 01:10:08,030
I'm starting to envy that horse.

717
01:11:39,945 --> 01:11:42,656
It's Arthur O'Dwyer!

718
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:45,727
I'm comin' into camp!

719
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:49,880
We won't shoot, almost certainly.

720
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:00,593
Mind the trip line.

721
01:12:06,056 --> 01:12:09,769
We've been here a couple of hours.
We're leavin' at twilight.

722
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,372
Wake me then.

723
01:12:44,648 --> 01:12:46,692
Time to go.

724
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:50,679
Mr. Brooder...

725
01:12:51,004 --> 01:12:54,208
Mr. Brooder found a pond
and we filled your canteens.

726
01:12:54,308 --> 01:12:57,912
And... we put some provisions
in your squirrel bag.

727
01:12:58,012 --> 01:13:00,514
Lots of things with food energy like

728
01:13:00,614 --> 01:13:02,797
cheese and nuts and some beef cobs.

729
01:13:02,897 --> 01:13:04,943
I appreciate it.

730
01:13:05,651 --> 01:13:08,389
- Mr. O'Dwyer.
- Sheriff?

731
01:13:08,489 --> 01:13:11,733
We'll mark our route
with the four rocks so you can see it.

732
01:13:12,658 --> 01:13:15,059
No, no.

733
01:13:16,984 --> 01:13:18,906
I'm comin' with you.

734
01:13:20,798 --> 01:13:23,558
Follow after at your own pace.

735
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:27,808
If we get there before you catch up...

736
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:31,016
I'll try to refrain from flirting
with Mrs. O'Dwyer.

737
01:13:34,848 --> 01:13:36,769
God!

738
01:13:37,311 --> 01:13:40,848
Don't you talk that way about my wife!
I know you had designs!

739
01:13:40,948 --> 01:13:44,750
That was years ago. And she refused me.

740
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:47,919
And now I'm out here risking
my life for both of you.

741
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:50,422
Perhaps that entitles me
to an occasional innuendo.

742
01:13:50,522 --> 01:13:56,246
Well, it doesn't! She's my whole everything
and those savages have got her and...

743
01:13:56,346 --> 01:13:59,664
God knows
what they're doing to her and...

744
01:13:59,764 --> 01:14:02,140
and every second...

745
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,543
that we delay, we...

746
01:14:07,336 --> 01:14:09,546
Remove yourself.

747
01:14:10,538 --> 01:14:12,549
Damnation.

748
01:14:15,808 --> 01:14:17,653
God!

749
01:14:22,682 --> 01:14:25,357
Will you unearth my medical kit?

750
01:14:31,692 --> 01:14:34,875
Hold still. Let me examine you.

751
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,258
How bad?

752
01:14:53,182 --> 01:14:55,350
Mr. O'Dwyer...

753
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:59,522
- you're stayin' behind.
- No, no, I'm comin' with you.

754
01:14:59,622 --> 01:15:02,533
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

755
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:05,326
You go and get me back my crutch.

756
01:15:05,426 --> 01:15:08,201
That leg can't be disregarded.
Now you're stayin' put.

757
01:15:08,301 --> 01:15:10,887
To hell with your authority
and the way you've been doin' things!

758
01:15:10,987 --> 01:15:14,076
You shouldn't have shot that drifter
in Bright Hope and got my wife involved.

759
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:18,714
And Brooder shouldn't have executed
them Mexicans and made it all worse.

760
01:15:20,841 --> 01:15:24,376
I can't honestly say I know which way
it would've gone with the Mexicans

761
01:15:24,476 --> 01:15:27,088
or if I had left that drifter go.

762
01:15:27,846 --> 01:15:30,258
But this is where we are.

763
01:15:32,951 --> 01:15:36,820
You can't go anywhere on that leg.
It needs to be operated on.

764
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,464
Mr. O'Dwyer.

765
01:15:40,157 --> 01:15:42,301
Look at it.

766
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:53,624
Chicory's gonna...
he's gonna have to take that leg.

767
01:15:55,272 --> 01:15:59,466
- No, no, no...
- If we don't gangrene will set in and...

768
01:15:59,566 --> 01:16:02,246
No, I... This is my choice, not yours!

769
01:16:02,346 --> 01:16:05,192
And I'm saying no! No!

770
01:16:06,389 --> 01:16:08,250
No.

771
01:16:17,726 --> 01:16:19,971
Can you set it?

772
01:16:20,829 --> 01:16:23,106
I can set it.

773
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:28,960
If that's your choice, so be it.

774
01:16:36,544 --> 01:16:39,047
Will you leave some stones
so I can follow?

775
01:16:39,147 --> 01:16:41,512
In case something happens to you.

776
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,794
I'll mark the route.

777
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:47,997
Thank you.

778
01:16:54,595 --> 01:16:59,304
Just give me enough so you can operate.
I don't wanna wake up next month.

779
01:17:00,066 --> 01:17:02,968
And take the rest in case
my wife needs it...

780
01:17:03,068 --> 01:17:05,313
or Deputy Nick.

781
01:17:08,139 --> 01:17:12,676
I'll put some in a whisky flask
and I'll leave the remainder for you.

782
01:17:12,776 --> 01:17:15,855
But you don't take more
than a spoonful a day.

783
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,933
I don't know if I'll be awake...

784
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:29,160
when you go so I want to apologize
to you now for gettin' hot at you.

785
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:32,530
- I don't lose my temper most times.
- We know you don't.

786
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:35,890
- Don't concern yourself over it.
- I thought it made things interesting.

787
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:40,013
I appreciate what you are doin'.

788
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:42,824
Don't think I ain't appreciative.

789
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:45,550
Just please keep her safe.

790
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,621
We won't leave
without Mrs. O'Dwyer in our care.

791
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:55,761
- Feel the medicine?
- My hands got tingles.

792
01:17:58,087 --> 01:18:00,084
Lean back.

793
01:18:07,664 --> 01:18:09,988
Put your head right there.

794
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,379
Brace him.

795
01:18:25,917 --> 01:18:28,429
The tincture will help...

796
01:18:30,188 --> 01:18:31,832
but this is gonna penetrate.

797
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:46,680
So long, cowboy.

798
01:18:54,113 --> 01:18:56,247
Will he survive?

799
01:18:56,347 --> 01:18:58,659
Oh, he has a chance.

800
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:19,899
You hear that?

801
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:25,145
What are you hearing?

802
01:19:25,245 --> 01:19:27,259
It stopped.

803
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:30,318
Just wait a second...

804
01:19:33,886 --> 01:19:36,429
I thought I was imagining that.

805
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:40,083
I am fairly certain I heard
that sound back in Bright Hope,

806
01:19:40,183 --> 01:19:42,753
on the night of the kidnapping.

807
01:19:43,594 --> 01:19:45,971
It feels like a signal.

808
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:49,175
Maybe an alarm.

809
01:19:52,602 --> 01:19:56,125
Inspect your firearms.
We've been spotted.

810
01:20:05,113 --> 01:20:09,163
It's the official opinion of the backup
deputy that leaving a trail of rocks

811
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:13,497
- is a job for the backup deputy.
- I told him I'd do it.

812
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:19,201
- Was that it?
- Yes.

813
01:20:20,927 --> 01:20:23,568
Sounds further than before.

814
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:28,743
- Maybe they're frightened?
- Of us? No.

815
01:20:45,553 --> 01:20:48,082
How many of them did you kill?

816
01:20:49,509 --> 01:20:50,610
Not enough.

817
01:20:52,594 --> 01:20:56,132
They were all, what do you call 'em,
warriors and braves?

818
01:20:56,232 --> 01:20:58,066
Mostly.

819
01:20:58,366 --> 01:21:00,835
Oh, some weren't braves?

820
01:21:00,935 --> 01:21:03,280
Some weren't men.

821
01:21:08,575 --> 01:21:10,378
An Indian woman is still an Indian.

822
01:21:10,478 --> 01:21:14,856
She knows how to use a bow
and a spear, and so do her children.

823
01:21:16,683 --> 01:21:18,860
Why do you hate them so much?

824
01:21:20,753 --> 01:21:23,555
You should ask my mother and my sisters.

825
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:28,502
- I never met 'em.
- That's correct. You never did.

826
01:21:32,063 --> 01:21:34,132
Indians got them?

827
01:21:34,232 --> 01:21:36,842
Let him alone, old man.

828
01:21:38,267 --> 01:21:42,897
A thing like that makes a considerable
impression upon a ten-year old boy.

829
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:48,720
I'm awfully sorry
for what happened to them...

830
01:21:49,244 --> 01:21:51,320
but I don't think
I could ever kill a woman

831
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,524
- or a child, not even...
- Deputy.

832
01:21:55,316 --> 01:21:58,975
Is it possible for you
to close that aperture?

833
01:22:26,684 --> 01:22:30,487
- Do you see it?
- I see several.

834
01:22:30,587 --> 01:22:34,523
Can you tell which one's
the Valley of the Starving Men?

835
01:22:34,623 --> 01:22:36,868
I cannot.

836
01:22:39,995 --> 01:22:44,265
- Oh, you trust me with the German?
- I've seen you operate.

837
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:00,225
- Oh, my Lord!
- What?

838
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:04,370
What?

839
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:08,367
Oh, I wish I had this with me
when I went to the rodeo.

840
01:23:08,467 --> 01:23:11,701
- The clarity and...
- Do you see the valleys?

841
01:23:12,193 --> 01:23:14,051
Yeah, I see a few of them.

842
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,339
They all look the same.

843
01:23:18,566 --> 01:23:20,970
May Sheriff Hunt try the German?

844
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:22,880
He may.

845
01:23:28,943 --> 01:23:32,256
I think we should start
with the nearest one.

846
01:23:33,614 --> 01:23:35,950
I'll take the vanguard.

847
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:39,296
One of you two should monitor
the rear with the German.

848
01:23:46,128 --> 01:23:50,341
If you see anything or hear anything...

849
01:23:51,032 --> 01:23:54,068
point it out for us before...
before you shoot.

850
01:23:54,168 --> 01:23:57,937
I shall. As long as it doesn't
forfeit my opportunity.

851
01:23:58,037 --> 01:23:59,844
Brooder...

852
01:23:59,944 --> 01:24:02,753
we're here for a rescue, not a massacre.

853
01:24:15,556 --> 01:24:17,657
Horse tracks.

854
01:24:17,757 --> 01:24:20,436
Mr. Wallington's or ours?

855
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:23,897
See if you can find a set
where one horse, a smaller one

856
01:24:23,997 --> 01:24:26,498
is missing a hind shoe.

857
01:24:26,598 --> 01:24:28,100
Right here.

858
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:31,670
- Think that's Clarence's colt?
- Almost certainly.

859
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:35,181
- It means we change direction.
- Here we go.

860
01:25:03,138 --> 01:25:07,260
Tracks to your west lead to it.
Their flaw.

861
01:25:12,881 --> 01:25:15,202
So, this is it?

862
01:26:37,179 --> 01:26:39,547
I'll signal once
I've made a determination.

863
01:26:40,047 --> 01:26:42,916
If you haven't heard
from me in 30 seconds...

864
01:26:43,316 --> 01:26:46,212
- go.
- What's the signal?

865
01:28:08,045 --> 01:28:10,824
You see any activity in there?

866
01:28:29,498 --> 01:28:32,616
Chicory... tie this off.

867
01:28:42,429 --> 01:28:44,699
I need the repeater.

868
01:29:00,231 --> 01:29:02,766
Supply me with dynamite...

869
01:29:03,066 --> 01:29:05,846
and don't return until I've used it.

870
01:29:09,707 --> 01:29:13,018
I'm far too vain
to ever live as a cripple.

871
01:29:16,813 --> 01:29:19,322
This is my spot.

872
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:26,322
I'd like a cigar.

873
01:29:46,145 --> 01:29:48,881
The answer to your question...

874
01:29:48,981 --> 01:29:51,393
is 116.

875
01:29:54,186 --> 01:29:57,065
You killed a 116 Indians?

876
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:06,743
Goodbye, Mr. Brooder.

877
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:12,706
We'll make sure all this has value.

878
01:30:12,806 --> 01:30:14,741
Please do.

879
01:30:14,841 --> 01:30:17,686
I shall kill as many as I can.

880
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,302
Sheriff Hunt? Mr. Kory?

881
01:33:10,402 --> 01:33:12,322
Mrs. O'Dwyer, are you...

882
01:33:12,422 --> 01:33:14,781
Go in or they'll kill you.

883
01:33:16,726 --> 01:33:18,473
Go!

884
01:33:42,937 --> 01:33:45,203
Mrs. O'Dwyer...

885
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:50,989
- Are you hurt?
- I'm alive.

886
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:56,141
Is Nick with you?

887
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,836
He's not well.

888
01:34:01,186 --> 01:34:03,303
And the drifter?

889
01:34:03,403 --> 01:34:05,545
They ate him.

890
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,856
No, not him.

891
01:34:32,934 --> 01:34:34,711
We're in hell.

892
01:34:48,984 --> 01:34:51,822
- Don't take him!
- Nick! Wake up!

893
01:34:52,022 --> 01:34:55,248
Don't do this. Don't do this. Please!

894
01:34:56,241 --> 01:34:59,480
Nick! Wake up!

895
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:06,575
God damn it, Nick! Wake up!

896
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:10,081
Damn savages.

897
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:13,208
Come on, old man!

898
01:35:13,308 --> 01:35:16,109
We've gotta break through here. Come on!

899
01:35:18,812 --> 01:35:21,562
Push! Harder!

900
01:35:21,662 --> 01:35:23,543
Harder, old man!

901
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:29,988
Chicory...

902
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,781
tie it off.

903
01:35:35,094 --> 01:35:37,106
Sheriff Hunt, are you there?

904
01:35:38,398 --> 01:35:40,777
I'm here, Nick. I'm right here.

905
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:45,606
You were right about that drifter.
He killed a lot of people.

906
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:50,177
He butchered them in their sleep
and he robbed them. His name was Purvis.

907
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:53,414
And then he desecrated
the burial ground of these things.

908
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:55,948
These Indians or whatever they are.

909
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:59,026
He raved about it all in the end.

910
01:35:59,484 --> 01:36:01,201
Thanks for telling me.

911
01:36:01,903 --> 01:36:04,279
That man deserved to die.

912
01:36:05,057 --> 01:36:06,801
Alright.

913
01:36:07,992 --> 01:36:10,463
Will you send my possessions
back to Michigan?

914
01:36:10,563 --> 01:36:13,481
Most of that stuff
belonged to my brothers.

915
01:36:13,581 --> 01:36:16,599
- I'll send it.
- Thank you.

916
01:36:20,404 --> 01:36:23,213
No, no, no...

917
01:36:38,522 --> 01:36:41,047
Nick. Nick, listen to me.

918
01:36:41,147 --> 01:36:44,694
I want you to know that all these
savages are gonna be massacred.

919
01:36:45,094 --> 01:36:47,664
The cavalry is riding
right now from Gatesville.

920
01:36:48,164 --> 01:36:52,749
And they're gonna butcher
every last one of these godless beings.

921
01:37:38,153 --> 01:37:40,022
It ain't true then?

922
01:37:40,455 --> 01:37:42,732
What you said?

923
01:37:43,223 --> 01:37:46,795
- What?
- About the cavalry.

924
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:53,608
No. It wasn't.

925
01:37:55,501 --> 01:38:01,016
Well, I thought it might be possible
that you had a secret backup plan.

926
01:38:04,477 --> 01:38:06,445
I'm sorry, old man.

927
01:38:06,545 --> 01:38:09,173
Well, why did you say it?

928
01:38:10,415 --> 01:38:14,319
If they were doin' that to me
it's the only thing I'd want to hear.

929
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:17,487
That you'd be avenged?

930
01:38:17,587 --> 01:38:19,838
What happened to my husband?

931
01:38:20,823 --> 01:38:23,103
Is he dead?

932
01:38:24,827 --> 01:38:26,318
He's alive.

933
01:38:30,248 --> 01:38:33,711
Arthur wouldn't have allowed you
to attempt this rescue without him.

934
01:38:36,037 --> 01:38:40,254
He came along,
but he got injured a day ago.

935
01:38:40,354 --> 01:38:42,778
He's... he's convalescing.

936
01:38:42,878 --> 01:38:46,838
But we... we put a trail for him.

937
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,617
Why did you do that?

938
01:38:50,717 --> 01:38:53,087
- So he could follow us.
- Chicory!

939
01:38:53,387 --> 01:38:54,921
Here?

940
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:57,131
To this place?

941
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:04,880
- We didn't know what it was like.
- This is why frontier life is so difficult.

942
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,933
Not because of the Indians
or the elements

943
01:39:08,033 --> 01:39:10,283
but because of the idiots!

944
01:39:12,972 --> 01:39:15,875
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- We're sorry.

945
01:39:16,175 --> 01:39:18,452
You're idiots!

946
01:39:22,214 --> 01:39:26,493
And Arthur's no better. I told him
not to go up on that roof, but he...

947
01:39:27,819 --> 01:39:31,502
I implored him
not to follow, but he's...

948
01:39:33,057 --> 01:39:34,849
He's determined.

949
01:39:35,449 --> 01:39:39,962
We need to do what we can before he
gets here so he has a chance against them.

950
01:39:40,062 --> 01:39:42,064
We already killed two.

951
01:39:42,164 --> 01:39:45,183
- Brooder got one.
- Three then.

952
01:39:45,283 --> 01:39:47,627
Mrs. O'Dwyer...

953
01:39:49,336 --> 01:39:53,175
do you know how many
there are in this clan?

954
01:39:57,511 --> 01:39:59,788
Mrs. O'Dwyer?

955
01:40:13,194 --> 01:40:17,019
Twelve males, maybe more.

956
01:40:18,032 --> 01:40:22,899
And two pregnant females
who are blind cripples.

957
01:40:24,472 --> 01:40:26,276
Alright.

958
01:40:32,114 --> 01:40:35,057
Do you still have that whisky flask?

959
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,021
Yeah.

960
01:40:40,221 --> 01:40:41,956
Yeah.

961
01:40:42,056 --> 01:40:45,326
But it's got tincture in it.

962
01:40:46,126 --> 01:40:49,889
- You have tincture of opium?
- We do.

963
01:40:53,099 --> 01:40:56,712
How many of them can we poison
with two fingers worth?

964
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:05,125
Big James, check and see
if any calves went astray.

965
01:41:41,434 --> 01:41:43,762
Son of a bitch slope.

966
01:42:06,842 --> 01:42:09,253
You won't stop me.

967
01:42:35,526 --> 01:42:39,170
Son of a bitch tincture.

968
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:25,934
You watchin'? You seein' all this?

969
01:43:26,034 --> 01:43:28,770
This is what I've prayed
my whole life for.

970
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:31,314
For help right now.

971
01:44:47,093 --> 01:44:49,138
Sheriff.

972
01:44:52,105 --> 01:44:55,627
Let me, just let me have one drink.
Just give me a little bit.

973
01:44:55,727 --> 01:44:57,819
Give me a taste.

974
01:45:02,008 --> 01:45:04,180
Alright, here.

975
01:45:12,492 --> 01:45:15,030
No, no.

976
01:45:19,259 --> 01:45:20,835
Drink it.

977
01:45:32,975 --> 01:45:35,652
It got to taste better than people.

978
01:45:46,987 --> 01:45:48,965
Damnation.

979
01:46:04,207 --> 01:46:08,136
The one with the wolf skull will lose
consciousness for a long period of time,

980
01:46:08,236 --> 01:46:10,211
but may live.

981
01:46:10,311 --> 01:46:13,648
The second one will die and...

982
01:46:13,748 --> 01:46:16,149
the third one will not be affected.

983
01:46:16,249 --> 01:46:19,494
- Alright.
- Well, two more is respectable.

984
01:46:20,166 --> 01:46:23,990
So my husband will have to face
seven of them, at least.

985
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:26,254
Including the one with the boar tusks.

986
01:46:26,354 --> 01:46:31,404
Well, Arthur O'Dwyer
is a very determined man.

987
01:46:34,951 --> 01:46:36,846
And crippled.

988
01:48:03,099 --> 01:48:05,165
Is that jewelry?

989
01:48:38,957 --> 01:48:41,591
Goddamn abomination.

990
01:50:10,278 --> 01:50:12,950
This is where it capsized.

991
01:50:29,282 --> 01:50:31,368
Back way.

992
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:24,273
You seein' this?

993
01:52:36,707 --> 01:52:39,063
Mrs. O'Dwyer?

994
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:40,711
Yes?

995
01:52:40,811 --> 01:52:43,717
Have you eaten anything
since they took you?

996
01:52:44,481 --> 01:52:46,182
A little.

997
01:52:46,282 --> 01:52:49,719
If it's been more
than a couple of days...

998
01:52:49,819 --> 01:52:53,856
you should try to eat some
of that bird they gave you.

999
01:52:54,206 --> 01:52:56,216
Why?

1000
01:52:56,824 --> 01:52:59,537
Your body needs sustenance.

1001
01:53:02,163 --> 01:53:05,107
They wouldn't want us to grow lean.

1002
01:53:15,242 --> 01:53:19,345
I've been thinking a lot
about that flea circus.

1003
01:53:19,445 --> 01:53:22,548
Remember the one
that had come in to Bright Hope?

1004
01:53:22,648 --> 01:53:26,026
- I remember.
- Did you go?

1005
01:53:26,552 --> 01:53:28,553
I wasn't able to.

1006
01:53:28,663 --> 01:53:31,021
I went with Nadine.

1007
01:53:31,121 --> 01:53:35,137
It was run by these two European men.
They were brothers.

1008
01:53:35,237 --> 01:53:40,606
Possibly identical twins but one
was a foot taller than the other,

1009
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:43,666
that might disqualify them.

1010
01:53:43,834 --> 01:53:47,360
But I don't remember their name.

1011
01:53:48,171 --> 01:53:50,282
The Sanderson's.

1012
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:55,411
Did you see it?

1013
01:53:55,511 --> 01:53:58,080
Arthur wanted to go.

1014
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:02,100
Well, I don't know
what your opinion is, but...

1015
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,668
my wife said it was all a trick.

1016
01:54:04,818 --> 01:54:08,323
Even when those brothers gave us
those magnifying glasses and we...

1017
01:54:08,423 --> 01:54:13,668
we saw those fleas pull that little
stagecoach right into the depot

1018
01:54:13,768 --> 01:54:16,132
or roll those cannons,

1019
01:54:16,232 --> 01:54:19,776
those tiny little cannons
onto the battlefield.

1020
01:54:21,302 --> 01:54:24,104
She said those fleas are dead.

1021
01:54:24,204 --> 01:54:26,441
They're just glued to some
mechanical contraption,

1022
01:54:26,541 --> 01:54:31,703
you know, that moves on
its own like a timepiece or...

1023
01:54:31,946 --> 01:54:34,123
a windup.

1024
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:38,821
Still, I thought it was real...

1025
01:54:38,921 --> 01:54:40,745
and I told her, I said,
"Don't talk so loud.

1026
01:54:40,845 --> 01:54:43,057
The performers will hear you."

1027
01:54:43,157 --> 01:54:46,260
Because I don't know what kind
of hearing fleas have...

1028
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:50,306
or if they can sense kindness
in a voice the way a dog can.

1029
01:54:54,834 --> 01:54:57,303
They drink dog's blood...

1030
01:54:57,403 --> 01:54:59,470
so maybe.

1031
01:55:06,813 --> 01:55:09,197
I think it was real.

1032
01:55:09,931 --> 01:55:14,722
I believe those fleas
were alive and talented.

1033
01:55:18,891 --> 01:55:22,261
Most flea circuses employ tricks

1034
01:55:22,361 --> 01:55:26,574
but the Sanderson's use
real living fleas.

1035
01:55:27,366 --> 01:55:31,379
I knew it was authentic! I just felt it.

1036
01:55:38,077 --> 01:55:41,415
Thank you, thank you for verifying that.

1037
01:55:42,248 --> 01:55:44,259
You're welcome.

1038
01:56:16,053 --> 01:56:19,299
- I think they figured it out.
- Appears so.

1039
01:56:45,783 --> 01:56:48,502
Sheriff! Wake up!

1040
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:53,098
Wake up! Sheriff!

1041
01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:01,672
Sheriff, get up, get up!

1042
01:57:08,938 --> 01:57:11,675
I'll make sure you're avenged!
I'll make sure!

1043
01:57:11,775 --> 01:57:14,043
Sheriff, I'll make sure you're avenged.

1044
01:57:14,143 --> 01:57:16,720
I will. I'll make sure.

1045
01:57:29,325 --> 01:57:33,033
That dumb imbecile,
he doesn't know how to reload.

1046
01:58:05,928 --> 01:58:09,040
Arthur! There's one in here wi...

1047
01:58:53,395 --> 01:58:54,972
Arthur!

1048
01:59:13,866 --> 01:59:16,176
How many did you get?

1049
01:59:17,369 --> 01:59:19,203
Three others.

1050
01:59:19,303 --> 01:59:22,151
Then there are three more...

1051
01:59:22,551 --> 01:59:24,319
at least somewhere.

1052
01:59:25,225 --> 01:59:28,231
- Brooder?
- Gone.

1053
01:59:30,545 --> 01:59:32,929
You gonna make it, Sheriff?

1054
01:59:33,315 --> 01:59:34,391
No.

1055
01:59:37,351 --> 01:59:40,609
- You positive?
- I am.

1056
01:59:41,772 --> 01:59:43,454
Deputy.

1057
01:59:43,554 --> 01:59:45,564
Yes, sir?

1058
01:59:46,255 --> 01:59:48,241
I'm stayin' here.

1059
01:59:48,341 --> 01:59:52,617
I intend to finish off the males
since they know about Bright Hope.

1060
01:59:52,717 --> 01:59:54,891
I want you to...

1061
01:59:55,098 --> 01:59:57,596
escort the O'Dwyer's home.

1062
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:00,969
Make... sure they get there safe.

1063
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,838
Yes.

1064
02:00:02,938 --> 02:00:07,018
- How's your leg?
- Help Chicory. Sheriff...

1065
02:00:09,945 --> 02:00:12,129
Anything I can do for you?

1066
02:00:12,748 --> 02:00:15,451
Put that repeater in my hand.

1067
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,640
Go out the way you came in.

1068
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:29,903
Don't dawdle.

1069
02:00:39,309 --> 02:00:41,242
Thank you.

1070
02:00:41,342 --> 02:00:43,389
Mrs. O'Dwyer.

1071
02:01:00,162 --> 02:01:03,188
Have a talk with Mr. O'Dwyer.

1072
02:01:04,099 --> 02:01:05,667
Yes, sir.

1073
02:01:05,767 --> 02:01:09,103
It's the official opinion
of the backup deputy...

1074
02:01:09,403 --> 02:01:13,455
that a talk with him is a good idea.

1075
02:01:16,028 --> 02:01:18,741
Say goodbye to my wife.

1076
02:01:21,883 --> 02:01:23,932
I'll say hello to yours.

1077
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:28,247
Yes, sir.

1078
02:02:09,163 --> 02:02:11,241
Let's keep going.

1079
02:03:37,666 --> 02:03:39,911
Are you alright?

1080
02:03:40,069 --> 02:03:41,779
Yeah.

1081
02:03:47,209 --> 02:03:49,712
I'd love a proper kiss, but...

1082
02:03:49,812 --> 02:03:52,745
those things that you've been
putting in your mouth...

1083
02:04:03,561 --> 02:04:06,005
- Good?
- Yeah.

1084
02:04:10,966 --> 02:04:13,809
- Were those gunshots?
- They were.

1085
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:25,381
Let's go.

1086
02:04:25,481 --> 02:04:29,343
- Can you keep going?
- Yeah. Come on.
