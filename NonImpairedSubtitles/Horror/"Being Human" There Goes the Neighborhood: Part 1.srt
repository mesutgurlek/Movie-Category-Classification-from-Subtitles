<i>- We're all hiding
something, aren't we?</i>

3
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:15,412
<i>From the moment we wake,
look in that mirror,</i>

4
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:18,682
<i>all we do is spin
our little lies,</i>

5
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:22,119
<i>suck in that gut,
colour that hair,</i>

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,854
twist off that wedding ring.

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,859
<i>And why not?
What's the penalty?</i>

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,397
<i>What are the
consequences, really?</i>

9
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:38,101
<i>"I'm only human," you say,
and all is forgiven.</i>

10
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:42,172
But what if some cruel twist of
fate makes you something else,

11
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:44,741
<i>something other?</i>

12
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:47,377
<i>Who forgives you then?</i>

13
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:49,813
Byron wrote
about Prometheus.

14
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:53,116
"The retched gift
eternity was thine

15
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:55,419
"and thou has
borne it well... "

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,220
- Don't know that one.

17
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:59,690
- "... making death
a victory. "

18
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:03,927
- Wow!

19
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:05,862
Such light date patter.

20
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:09,399
So that's why
you became a nurse?

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,603
To help people experience
the victory of death?

22
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:15,606
- I'm sorry.
Is that what you asked me?

23
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:19,710
But you know
what I mean, right?

24
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:21,044
That living thing,

25
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,113
that breathing, living thing

26
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,748
taking its last breath...

27
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:27,618
it's gorgeous.

28
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:35,692
Every human spends a night
or two on the dark side

29
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:37,194
<i>and regrets it.</i>

30
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:39,997
But what if you only exist

31
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:41,665
<i>on the dark side?</i>

32
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:47,671
- So, this is my place.

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,574
Do you wanna come in?

34
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,711
I think I got a really
awful bottle of wine.

35
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:59,416
- How could I possibly
say no to that?

36
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:07,357
<i>We just want the same things
that you do:</i>

37
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:11,294
<i>a chance at life,
at love.</i>

38
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:14,431
<i>We're not so different
in that way.</i>

39
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:42,359
- Sorry, were you
expecting a cheese course?

40
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:45,929
Come on!

41
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,131
Don't make me embarrass myself.

42
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,302
<i>- And so we try...</i>

43
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:54,271
<i>and sometimes fail...</i>

44
00:02:56,507 --> 00:03:00,110
When you're something other,

45
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:03,080
<i>a monster</i>

46
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,715
<i>the consequences
are worse.</i>

47
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,751
<i>Much worse.</i>

48
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,988
<i>You wake up from
your nightmares.</i>

49
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:13,623
<i>We don't.</i>

50
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,451
- Huh?

51
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,809
<i>Stanislaw's Mortuary.</i>

52
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,043
- Hey, it's me.

53
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:44,014
I need your help.

54
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:35,031
- You little slut.

55
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:45,575
Dr. Baker, telephone for you.

56
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:46,743
<i>Dr. Baker, telephone.</i>

57
00:05:57,421 --> 00:06:00,423
- Hey, you know, there's
a better way to do this.

58
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:02,859
- Do what?
Be a better monster?

59
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,994
No, thank you.

60
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:07,163
- Or dignified monster.

61
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,599
- You're joking, right?

62
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,101
- You shouldn't
have to run

63
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:13,303
into the woods
every time that you turn.

64
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:15,639
- Pretty sure the gang
down at the Econolodge

65
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,841
wouldn't take too kindly
to me doing it there.

66
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:18,875
So...

67
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:21,645
- So what about
what I said?

68
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:22,979
What about
the apartment?

69
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,382
- Yeah, it's perfect.
That's a great idea.

70
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:26,950
Let's do that.
It's perfect.

71
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,385
We'll have
full moon parties.

72
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:30,420
We'll invite the neighbours
over and eat them.

73
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:31,354
- Or...

74
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:36,092
We can look after each other
like normal people.

75
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,994
Aren't you tired
of punishing yourself...

76
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:42,065
...squatting in hostels,
and hourly motels?

77
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,867
Don't you ever just
want your own bed?

78
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,703
Besides, God!

79
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:49,272
What do you do with
a girl if you meet one?

80
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:51,508
- And yet another
gentle reminder

81
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,044
of how badly my
life sucks. Thank you.

82
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,446
- Seriously, would you
just think about it?

83
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:57,480
This could help.

84
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,884
Both of us.

85
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,026
- How could 4 walls and
a toilet possibly help this?

86
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:15,932
And for the record,

87
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,601
reminding me I haven't
had sex in the last 2 years-

88
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,937
Hey.

89
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:23,139
Total lie.

90
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,441
- Sorry.

91
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:25,542
- No, he is. Please.

92
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:26,543
- I am.
- I'm Aiden.

93
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:29,179
- Hi. Um, Cara.

94
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,780
- Josh.

95
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,282
- Are you new here or-

96
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:33,950
- Yeah, I'm actually-

97
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:36,419
I'm just filling in
for... Rebecca.

98
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,889
She didn't
show up in ICU,

99
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,291
so they called me in.

100
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,326
Welcome, Milady.

101
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:49,733
- Yeah, I'm actually just
looking for the nurse's station.

102
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,368
Do either of you know-

103
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,370
- It's 2nd floor,
left from the elevator.

104
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:54,537
- Great. Thanks.

105
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,908
It was really great
meeting both of you.

106
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,775
- Aiden, good to see you.

107
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,111
How you feeling?

108
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:39,315
Better, right?
After last night, huh?

109
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:40,717
Pretty girl.

110
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:42,519
- What are you
doing here, Marcus?

111
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,354
- You know,
the grind.

112
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:46,589
He's an alderman.

113
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,091
Big muckety-muck!

114
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,693
Yeah, Bishop wants us

115
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:52,662
to go after more
people of influence,

116
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:54,297
people of use.

117
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:56,466
- Well, you can tell
Bishop that the hospital

118
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:57,834
is off-limits
for recruiting.

119
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:58,835
- Tell you what...

120
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:00,303
share him with me

121
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:03,039
and we'll take him
to Bishop together.

122
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,974
- I don't drink
live anymore.

123
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:06,509
- Since when?

124
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,577
Last night?

125
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,914
- Leave him alone.

126
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:12,015
- Yeah, sure.

127
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:16,820
Bishop will be
so disappointed.

128
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,588
He thought for sure
you were back.

129
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:21,024
- Tell Bishop what happened
last night was a mistake.

130
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,058
- Sure.

131
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:25,361
Are you back in?

132
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:27,630
I don't mind cleaning up
your occasional mess.

133
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:29,165
That's what we do.
We're family.

134
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,700
But if you are back,

135
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:33,803
you and I are gonna have
to set a few ground rules.

136
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:36,639
There's an order now.
There's Bishop and there's me.

137
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,141
You will respect that.

138
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:41,277
- Don't worry. I know
how many years it took you

139
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,813
to get your nose firmly
inserted up Bishop's ass.

140
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:51,254
- Are we OK in here, Aiden?

141
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:20,568
- Are you serious?

142
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:23,337
- About what?

143
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:25,306
- Being normal.

144
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:29,343
Trying to be.

145
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:32,713
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:37,919
- I used to think this curse

147
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,787
was what happened
to me once a month.

148
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:45,560
And I realized this-this-
this is the curse:

149
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:49,263
every day...

150
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,534
sitting on a bench...

151
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:56,904
watching people walk by...

152
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,908
- I don't
think so...

153
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,511
- ... eating sandwiches,
making plans,

154
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:04,946
being...

155
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:09,917
what I used to be.

156
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,788
I always tell myself:

157
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:15,856
"Well, Josh, this is
what... you get.

158
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:18,926
"This is what you deserve.
This is what you are...

159
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,862
"Now. "

160
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:29,637
I can't do this...

161
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,606
like this...

162
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:34,542
any more.

163
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,551
- Of course I don't cook.

164
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,422
- You don't eat.

165
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:50,091
- And I don't clean.

166
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,227
- I have O.C.D.

167
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,329
- Uh, my credit's crap.

168
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,431
Just putting it
out there.

169
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:14,348
- Took us a month,
but we found it!

170

<i>♪ If I said it
I meant it...♪</i>

171
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:18,085
There's a view.

172
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:20,688
- Of an alley.
The plumbing's beat to hell.

173
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,858
- Go upstairs. You can see
a building that can see water.

174
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:25,326
It's- There's
a reflection.

175
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:27,995
Look at those windows.

176
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,131
I mean, you could rest
a pie on those sills.

177
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:32,500
- Yeah, you could if you were
an 80-year-old woman.

178
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,403
- This place is
amazing, Aiden.

179
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:36,570
You know it.
I want it.

180
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:41,075
- Just play it cool, OK?

181
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:42,510
- Totally.

182
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:44,612
- You sure?

183
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:45,613
- Got it!

184
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,723
- So? What do
you guys think?

185
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:57,925
- Well, honestly,
it's a little dark.

186
00:12:57,926 --> 00:12:59,493
- Yeah.

187
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:01,462
- Which a coat of
light paint can help.

188
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:02,730
A lamp.

189
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,765
You like dark.

190
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:07,201
- And the plumbing
is a little bit-

191
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:09,770
- Look, I know.
I keep meaning to fix that.

192
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:12,606
- Which we can help with.
I mean, what are weekends for?

193
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:15,910
- Look, truth is, there was
an engaged couple living here.

194
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,045
All right? They started
fixing the place up.

195
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:20,781
Things didn't
work out.

196
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:21,782
- What, they split?

197
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:22,850
- Yeah, sort of.

198
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,653
She died.

199
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:27,955
- Who died?
- The girl.

200
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:30,091
- The fianc?e.
- Yeah.

201
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:33,694
- In the house? Shouldn't you
have mentioned this in your ad?

202
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:35,062
- Well, I don't know.

203
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:36,664
Do people do that?

204
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:37,898
- Yeah, it's fine.

205
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,767
- Look, if you
don't want the place-

206
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:40,768
- It's fine?

207
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,336
- People die.

208
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:44,238
- In old-age homes,
car accidents.

209
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,740
Not with their
heads lodged

210
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,374
in my future oven.
- Josh.

211
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,375
- Yeah, um...

212
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,011
She was my fianc?e.

213
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:55,649
- I'm so sorry
for your loss.

214
00:13:57,652 --> 00:14:00,321
- Look, I probably
should've mentioned that.

215
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:01,455
It's just, um...

216
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:04,625
I don't come
back here much.

217
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:07,461
- And that's why you're, uh,
you're out here?

218
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:11,198
- Look, you two
seem all right.

219
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,467
I know the place
isn't perfect,

220
00:14:13,468 --> 00:14:15,936
but it's a great place
for a couple. It really is.

221
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,239
- What?
- What?

222
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,774
- It's OK.

223
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,643
- So-so look,
I can come by on weekends

224
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,578
and do what fix-up I can.

225
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,748
As far as I'm concerned,
any furniture in there is yours.

226
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,083
And honestly...

227
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:32,586
I don't need
a credit check.

228
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,315

- Look at you, Julia Child.

- What?

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,173
- Someone's in the house.

00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:28,943
- Where?

238
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:30,344

Wait, wait, wait!

I am God.
I am everywhere.

I drove all night

- Yeah.

couch cushions, lady.

- Josh.
- What?

00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:15,055
- She's a ghost.

00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,893
You're a ghost?

You've just been here</i>

since you...

261
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:42,527
- Since I bit it?
Pretty much.

262
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:47,132
6 months of a
one-sided conversation,

263
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,901
me ranting, people just
walking through me.

264
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:52,337
Oh! For a month,
there was these vegans.

265
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:53,972
Like, this isn't
Burning Man.

266
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:55,173
You can shower.

267

- How did you die?

268
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:57,842
If it's not too
personal a question.

269
00:16:57,843 --> 00:16:59,411
- No, not at all,

270
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,379
especially since
I have no idea.

271
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,248
- At all?

272
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,884
- I remember going to sleep.

273
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:08,286
I remember lying
next to Danny,

274
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:10,922
and I woke up
and there was this.

<i>Anyway, you two
gonna go all Twilight</i>

276

277
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,661
- Excuse me?

278
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:19,164
- I know what you are.
- How?

279
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:21,800
- Because it's all
you guys ever talk about.

280
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,768
I wanna be normal,
but I can't,

281
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,403
'cause I wanna eat people, etc.

282
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:27,172
It's OK.
I'm cool with it!

283
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:30,208
Believe me, the regular living
are overrated.

284
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:32,877
- So, wait. So, stop.
Let me just get this straight.

285
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:34,813
So you've just been
watching us, right?

286
00:17:34,814 --> 00:17:36,214
Just going through our things?

287
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,250
Great, great.

288
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:40,785
We're living with Sally,

00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:42,087
the peeper ghost.

290
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:45,090
- Oh, relax.
I can't even move dust.

291
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:46,891
And I'm not
a peeper...

292
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:48,827
much.

293
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:51,062
I would have
that mole checked out.

294
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:53,898
You were pre-med, weren't you?
You should know that.

295
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:57,202
- Well, I'm gonna enjoy this.

296
00:17:57,203 --> 00:18:00,105
- You were supposed to marry
what's-his-face, weren't you?

297
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:02,207
- Danny, yes.

298
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,976
- Right, so why don't you
just go haunt him?

299
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:07,145
- Josh, just-
- No, I mean, listen.

300
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:09,948
I'm sorry that
you're a ghost and all,

301
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:12,384
but if you're gonna spend
eternity with someone,

302
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:14,619
shouldn't it be with
the one that you loved

303
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,055
or, you know,
anywhere but here?

304
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:20,058
- I'm sorry. I wish I could say
it's a blood-sugar thing,

305
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,626
but Josh is rude
all the time.

306
00:18:21,627 --> 00:18:24,262
- It's OK. Josh,
I would love to leave.

307
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:25,864
- But she can't,
bec- Right?

308
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:27,032
- Right.

309
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,500
- You're not
my first ghost.

310
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:30,035
- How can you
seme, anyway?

311
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:32,404
- Well, think of us
as sort of

312
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:34,606
different countries
on the same continent.

313
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:37,542
- Oh my god! That's beautiful,
really. We're Africa.

314
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:39,778
OK, so about this
whole leaving thing,

315
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:40,845
have you tried?

316
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:42,313
- Obviously I've tried.

317
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:45,483
I haven't been moping
around the house,

318
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:48,987
rattling chains,
taking bubble baths.

319
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:51,022
I would love to
just open that door

320
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:53,224
and magically walk back
into the life

321
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:54,826
that was ripped away from me.

322
00:18:57,963 --> 00:18:59,731
I did have plans, you know.

323
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:03,835
- We gotta get to work.

324
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:06,704
- I'll be here.

325
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:09,207
- It was great meeting you.

326
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,610
- At lease I don't
masturbate to Nova!

327
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:22,253
- So you're OK with a ghost
living in our house?

328
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,889
- You do realize that
technically it's her house.

329
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,826
- Look, I'm sorry that she died
and she never got married

330
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:30,028
and-and she doesn't
know how to move on,

331
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:32,797
but seriously, I mean,
the whole point of this house

332
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,066
was having one place
where monsters aren't,

333
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,202
where you don't have
to apologize or hide

334
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:38,870
or think about
what we are.

335
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:41,372
Where we can eat pizza,
or pretend to eat pizza,

336
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:43,975
where we can be human for,
like, just an hour or 2.

337
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,877
- And from what I know
about ghosts,

338
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:48,012
a ghost isn't a ghost
without a reason.

339
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:50,048
Sally, everything
she knows about ghosts

340
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:51,749
seems to come from
Whoopi Goldberg.

341
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,251
She knows nothing, Josh.

342
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:55,653
Would you please give her
a chance to find her way?

343
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,791
- Where the hell are we?

344
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:03,294
- They just cleared this
place out for expansion,

345
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:05,063
but that could
take years.

346
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:06,898
It's perfect,
isn't it?

347
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,540
You can change down here.

348
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,742
- Into a crazy person?

349
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:19,344
- Step one,
we got an apartment,

350
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:21,412
but if you really
want to do this,

351
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:23,781
have a chance of
having a normal life,

352
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:25,283
you gotta find
a reliable way

353
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:27,252
to deal with your
transformation.

354
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:29,521
So, step 2,
your own personal-

355
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:31,022
- Cage.

356
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,525
- It works though,
doesn't it?

357
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:36,161
You could use it
tomorrow night.

358
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:37,462
- Does it lock?

359
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:54,012
- Try it.

360
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:00,285
I can let you out
in the mornings.

361
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:40,425
- Emily?

362
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:55,540
- Come on, people.
As fast as you can.

363
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,874
Get out
of the way.

364
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,643
- OK, the G.S.W.
in the chest.

365
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:00,078
Hurry up,
he's bleeding out.

366
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,380
Give me an A.B.G,
C.B.C, M-7.

367
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:30,642
- Sad, isn't it?

368
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:34,946
Cara.

369
00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:36,247
- Oh, I know.

370
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:37,448
- OK.

371
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:39,450
You know, her mom
comes by everyday,

372
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:40,952
passing out flyers,

373
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:43,755
which I get, because you want
to do everything you can,

374
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:44,956
but let's face it,

375
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:46,924
she's scattered in
a dumpster, isn't she?

376
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:48,092
I mean, aren't
they always?

377
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:50,595
Oh God!

378
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:52,030
Unless you...

379
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:54,599
you knew her.

380
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:58,870
Anyway, we absolutely
should do something for her,

381
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:01,339
like, uh, have a vigil

382
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,076
or start a group
or a clothing drive or...

383
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:10,114
o me.

384
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:13,518
I just meant that if it were me,
I would want closure.

385
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,620
- It's OK.

386
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:19,157
- I've had, like, a hundred
cups of coffee today.

387
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:21,059
I keep on making it
for the cops,

388
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,894
and then every time
I make a pot,

389
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:25,563
I think I should stay
and have a cup with them,

390
00:23:25,564 --> 00:23:28,566
because I-I don't want them to
think that I'm hiding anything,

391
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:31,202
oh, which, I'm not.

392
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,404
- So, the police
are here again?

393
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:35,039
- Re-canvassing.

394
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,887
- You're home.

395
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,723
- Yep.

396
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:53,891
- So, I've been thinking
about what you said,

397
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,827
you know, and...

398
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:57,695
I think I should
try to move on.

399
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,931
- Great.

400
00:23:59,932 --> 00:24:01,733
- So, I just need you
to call Danny,

401
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:03,601
tell him to come over,
fix the pipes,

402
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:05,937
and, uh, I'll take it
from there.

403
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,441
Josh.

404
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,045
If you could call Danny-
- Can it wait?

405
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:15,380
- It'll take 2 seconds.

406
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:16,914
- I just want to be alone.

407
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,850
And see,
this is the problem.

408
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:21,085
You're always here,
so I can never be alone.

409
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,954
- Where am I
supposed to go?

410
00:24:22,955 --> 00:24:25,456
- I don't know. Beyond?
I- I-I don't-

411
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:27,425
- Yes, please.

412
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,994
Like I'd rather be
shacking up with a vampire

413
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:32,130
and, oh yeah,
a day drinker.

414
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,102
Josh, I was gonna
get my Master's,

415
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,737
and now I have
nothing to read

416
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:42,473
but stupid blogs
over your shoulder.

417
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:45,076
I've tried to leave.
I don't know how.

418
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:47,512
- Then figure it out, Sally.
Figure it out, OK?

419
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:49,313
Because I-

420
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:50,882
My life sucks enough

421
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:53,851
without having to
live in your purgatory.

422
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:55,920
- You're right.
I have stuff to work out.

423
00:24:57,556 --> 00:24:59,357
You don't know
how lucky you are!

424
00:25:00,993 --> 00:25:03,161
- Lucky. Right, yeah.

425
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,498
- Whatever's going on
with you,

426
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:10,234
at least you have
the chance to fix it.

427
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:13,104
It's a bad bump on the otherwise
ongoing road of your life.

428
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:14,939
I can't do anything.

429
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,374
I can't change anything.

430
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,942
I can't even drink a beer

431
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:19,310
to make myself
feel better.

432
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,679
So just go on your
pansy-ass mopey kick,

433
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,348
but at least have
the decency to appreciate

434
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:26,884
that you haven't dropped off
a cliff to nowhere.

435
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,025
- How did you manage
to make this about you?

436
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:44,302
- Last time we spoke,

437
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:46,037
you mentioned you and
Rebecca were friends.

438
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:47,572
- We worked together, yes.

439
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:50,808
- Some of your coworkers tell us
you were more than that.

440
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:52,643
- More than what?

441
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:54,212
- More than
friends.

442
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:57,248
When was the last time
you were at Rebecca's apartment?

443
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:59,717
- Hold on. I never said
I was at her apartment.

444
00:25:59,718 --> 00:26:01,986
- You've never been there?
- No.

445
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:03,287
- You sure?

446
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:06,123
- Aiden didn't
do this, Tim.

447
00:26:06,124 --> 00:26:07,425
- What are you
talking about?

448
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:11,028
- He didn't do this.

449
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,536
- Of course.

450
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:19,971
He didn't.

451
00:26:19,972 --> 00:26:21,839
- You're going to
wait in the car

452
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,274
and you were
never here, OK?

453
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:29,280
- You know what?
I'll be in the car.

454
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:30,615
- Good.

455
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:31,916
Thanks, Tim. Bye.

456
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:37,588
Good to see
you back, Aiden.

457
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:44,796
- I'm not back, Bishop.

458
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:46,264
- Really?

459
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:48,900
'Cause Marcus said that
girl was so torn up,

460
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,369
you could read the
VIN number off her ribs.

461
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,971
- Marcus is an ass.

462
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:56,307
- Maybe.

463
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:59,477
God, Aiden!
It's been months.

464
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:01,312
- I've been busy.

465
00:27:01,313 --> 00:27:02,881
- I can see that.

466
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:04,616
You look horrible.

467
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:06,217
- Thank you.

468
00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:09,587
Look, I would take it
as a personal favour

469
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:12,590
if you would make
this thing disappear.

470
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:18,630
Please.

471
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:20,598
- I will.

472
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,103
Well, I would, but it's not
as easy as all that this time.

473
00:27:25,104 --> 00:27:27,138
See, 'cause everybody
seems to know

474
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:29,407
that Rebecca had
a thing for Aiden,

475
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,443
so it's Rebecca and Aiden,
Aiden and Rebecca.

476
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:33,878
We'll get through it.

477
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:34,979
We always do.

478
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,347
Always will.

479
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:39,350
- I'm not back, Bishop.

480
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:42,187
What happened with
Rebecca was a mistake.

481
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:43,822
- Right, happens to all of us.

482
00:27:43,823 --> 00:27:46,291
Somewhere between the tiramisu
and the naughty bits,

483
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:47,725
we lose our heads.

484
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:50,595
It wasn't a mistake, Aiden.
You're a shark.

485
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:53,164
Be a shark.

486
00:27:53,165 --> 00:27:54,599
- Not anymore.

487
00:27:55,668 --> 00:27:57,302
- All right.

488
00:27:57,303 --> 00:27:59,838
Marcus mentioned your
little blood-bank diet.

489
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,439
How's that going?

490
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,108
Sit down.

491
00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:10,648
200 and how many years
you played at my feet,

492
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,717
and now I don't even get
basic common courtesy?

493
00:28:14,687 --> 00:28:16,187
Huh?

494
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:22,994
I'm worried about you.

495
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:24,295
- I'm fine.

496
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:25,697
- Well, you don't
look fine.

497
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:28,099
- What do you want
from me, Bishop?

498
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,735
You want help with your
little recruiting plan?

499
00:28:30,736 --> 00:28:32,637
- Who said anything
about recruiting?

500
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:34,038
- Marcus told me everything.

501
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,340
- Forget about Marcus.

502
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:37,142
What I care about is you.

503
00:28:37,143 --> 00:28:39,444
- No, what you care
about is control.

504
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:40,912
The changes that I've made,

505
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:42,614
the life that
I'm trying to live,

506
00:28:42,615 --> 00:28:44,649
oh, you can't
stand that, can you?

507
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,451
- OK.

508
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:49,287
Would you put yourself
in my shoes for a second?

509
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,058
You don't call.
You don't write.

510
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,528
You move in
with a werewolf.

511
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,198
- How did you know that?

512
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:03,034
- I think you have
no idea what you're up to.

513
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,335
I think you're lost.

514
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:06,337
I think if
you're not careful,

515
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:08,773
you may never find
your way back again.

516
00:29:08,774 --> 00:29:10,942
and that, Aiden,
that worries me.

517
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:12,210
- Is that all?

518
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:18,683
- Would you believe
that making you angrier

519
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:20,218
was not the point
of all this?

520
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:21,586
- Bishop...

521
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:24,455
you can forget about it.

522
00:29:24,456 --> 00:29:25,657
- Aiden.

523
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,495
It's cold out there
without us, isn't it?

524
00:29:44,944 --> 00:29:46,578
OK.

525
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:48,613
- Don't you
ruin the time.

526
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:59,390
- Sorry.
- Josh?

527
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:06,764
Josh!

528
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:18,910
Where did you go?

529
00:30:20,913 --> 00:30:22,780
- You found me.
Here we are.

530
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,582
- I wasn't
looking for you.

531
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,718
Jackie broke her
arm "shrooming".

532
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:29,354
- Jackie, she's-
That's your, uh...

533
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:30,722
- My girlfriend?
- Right.

534
00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:32,123
- Yeah.

535
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:34,759
- And her arm's OK?

536
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:40,698
- I missed you.

537
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,204
- I miss you too.

538
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,641
- So...

539
00:30:49,642 --> 00:30:51,943
- So, how is everybody?

540
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:55,079
- Everybody?
You mean your family?

541
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,515
We've been freaking out
for the past 2 years,

542
00:30:57,516 --> 00:30:59,484
wondering if you
were dead or alive.

543
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:00,985
Whatever is happening,

544
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:04,422
how can you not say anything
to the people who love you?

545
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:05,623
- Why would you-

546
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,093
I told you not
to worry about me.

547
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:10,695
- Oh right,
your note.

548
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:16,768
Josh, did you ever think

549
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:20,305
that the one thing not to say to
Jewish parents is "don't worry"?

550
00:31:23,676 --> 00:31:25,443
Please.

551
00:31:26,812 --> 00:31:29,347
Please, just tell me
what's going on with you.

552
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:34,852
- You wouldn't underand.

553
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:37,155
- Try.

554
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:38,256
- You wouldn't.

555
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,360
It's complicated.

556
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:44,762
- Josh, I'm your sister.

557
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:48,566
I'm genetically inclined
to love you unconditionally.

558
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:51,536
But I thought we were
also friends.

559
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:52,937
- I'm happy to see you.

560
00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:57,675
Believe it or not,
I've really...

561
00:31:58,944 --> 00:32:00,178
really missed you.

562
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:05,283
But I kind of need you
not to tell anyone

563
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:06,517
that you saw me here.

564
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:14,826
- What would
I tell them anyway?

565
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:21,999
This has been the least
satisfying reunion ever.

566
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,901
- I love you. OK, Em?

567
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:26,571
Just...

568
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,308
I don't know.
Just try to remember that.

569
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:03,194
Bravo! Bravo!

I've stood at the door.

00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:55,873
I've stuck out a toe.

582
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:58,776
And I can't stop thinking:

583
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:00,878
If I do step outside...

584
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:04,682
what if I just blow away?

00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:10,221
What if I can never
find my way back?

586
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:16,027
What if I never
see him again?

587
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:54,432
- Josh?

588
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:57,568
Josh?

589
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,974
Josh!

590
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,218
- You need to
see something.

591
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:27,265
- What?

592
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:30,468
- You're a lot sloppier
than you used to be Aiden.

593
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:33,404
The girl, they know
it was you.

594
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:52,890
- Josh?

595
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:04,435
- What are
we doing here?

596
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:12,677
You told me this
was about Rebecca.

597
00:37:12,678 --> 00:37:14,412
- I took care of that.

598
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:16,113
It's fine.

599
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:19,383
- I can't be here.

600
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:22,386
- It breaks me up to
see you this way, Aiden.

601
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,188
You can understand
that, right?

602
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:27,358
I gave you eternal life.

603
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,826
I want you to live it.

604
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:30,962
- No, you want me
to fall in line.

605
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:33,531
- I'm not gonna lie to you.
I never have.

606
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:35,399
Things are
about to change.

607
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,935
But that's neither
here nor there.

608
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:40,671
What's important is this:

609
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:46,110
Life doesn't have
to be so hard.

610
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:47,778
Not for us.

611
00:37:50,215 --> 00:37:52,416
Come with me, Aiden.

612
00:38:43,268 --> 00:38:44,802
- What are you doing here?

613
00:38:44,803 --> 00:38:46,604
- What are you
doing here?

614
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:06,029
- You have to leave!

615
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,264
You have to leave!

616
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:08,632
- Two years of nothing,

617
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:11,067
and you can't
even talk to me?

618
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:12,435
No way!

619
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:13,570
No!

620
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:14,938
- No, no, no!

621
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:16,540
Look, look, I'll, uh...

622
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:17,808
I'll come see you.

623
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:19,209
I'll come see you.
I promise.

624
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,377
I just need to be-

625
00:39:20,378 --> 00:39:22,012
I need to be
alone right now.

626
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:23,747
- I know why
you ran away, Josh, OK?

627
00:39:23,748 --> 00:39:25,348
You think I'm an idiot?

628
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:27,217
Everything was
ahead of you,

629
00:39:27,218 --> 00:39:29,519
cookie-cutter perfect,
just like Mom and Dad.

630
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,254
You panicked.
I geit.

631
00:39:31,255 --> 00:39:34,591
You're not nearly as
mysterious as you think you are.

632
00:39:34,592 --> 00:39:36,259
- All right, I hear you.
I really do.

633
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,328
- Why punish me?

634
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:40,163
You were my best friend.
Why shut me out?

635
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:43,500
- Look, Emily,
I told you it's comp-

636
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:45,635
It's complicated and-

637
00:39:47,705 --> 00:39:50,106
- Are you sick?
- I'm sorry. Just go.

638
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:51,141
- What are you doing?

639
00:39:51,142 --> 00:39:52,142
- You have to go!

640
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:53,276
- Josh!

641
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,915
- Oh no!

642
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,267
- Welcome back,
Mr. Aiden.

643
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:05,315
- Come on, Aiden. Please!

644
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:19,095
Please. Aaah!

645
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:20,597
- Let me help you!

646
00:41:20,598 --> 00:41:22,265
Stay away from me!

647
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:23,967
You stay away from me!

648
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:56,499
Sally. Sally.

649
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,069
<i>Are you home?
Can you hear me?</i>

650
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,338
<i>Please, listen to me.</i>

651
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:03,273
<i>If there's any chance,</i>

652
00:42:03,274 --> 00:42:05,909
<i>any way you can leave
the house,</i>

653
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,778
<i>any way you can find Aiden
or find me,</i>

654
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:11,815
<i>tell-tell him
I'm in the roo- the room</i>

655
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:13,984
<i>and my sister's here.</i>

656
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:20,156
And the door's locked.

657
00:42:20,157 --> 00:42:22,459
<i>He'll-he'll know
what that means.</i>

658
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,294
<i>Please.</i>

659
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:25,862
<i>Listen, if...</i>

660
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:30,100
Please, if you don't come,

661
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:32,902
<i>if someone doesn't
open that door...</i>

662
00:42:34,572 --> 00:42:36,506
I will kill her.

663
00:42:36,507 --> 00:42:38,675
Sally, please.

664
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,148
- Josh!

665
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:29,959
