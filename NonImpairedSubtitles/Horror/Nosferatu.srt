ACT I

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,150
Report on the great mortality
which prevails in Wisborg

9
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,060
in the year of grace 1838

10
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,500
It is words

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,260
lugubrious like the call of a bird of
death.

12
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,910
Take care not to say them or your life
will be populated shades

13
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,430
and the phantoms
which will haunt your dreams

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,430
will be nourished of your blood.

15
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,030
I reflected a long time

16
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,860
with the mortality
which had struck my birthplace.

17
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,110
Here its history.

18
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,190
In Wisborg lived Hutter
and his young woman Ellen

19
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,310
"Why you killed... these beautiful flowers?"

20
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,070
"Not so quickly, my young friend!

21
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,310
Nobody escapes from his destiny."

22
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,110
There was certain Knock,
realtor.

23
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,590
All kinds of noises ran on him.

24
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,100
But it paid its people well.

25
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:25,190
"count Orlok,
the lord of Transylvania...

26
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,370
wishes to buy a beautiful house in our
city..."

27
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,130
"You could earn much money..."

28
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,350
"Even if that costs a little efforts, of sweat...

29
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,390
and perhaps a little blood... "

30
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,150
"He would like a beautiful abandoned house..."

31
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,070
"This house... opposite yours.

32
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,150
Propose it to him!"

33
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,590
"you start, my young friend,

34
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,070
and made happy voyage
to the country of the phantoms."

35
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,590
"I leave to travel far, to the country
of the robbers and the phantoms."

36
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,620
Hutter left the concerned young woman

37
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,860
Under the protection of
Harding the ship owner & his sister

38
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,810
"Would be without fear."

39
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:04,710
After having traversed many dusty roads,

40
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,030
the young person Hutter finally
saw the summits of Carpates

41
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,510
the horses tired.

42
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,070
"I have to eat... quickly.

43
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,970
I must go to the chateau of the count
Orlok!"

44
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,970
"do not go further.

45
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,770
there are werewolf  in the wood."

46
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,900
VAMPIRES

47
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,990
Malfaisants spirits with the damned heart

48
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,630
Nosferatu nourishes on human blood.

49
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,190
It lives in the caves and in coffins,

50
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,590
in the ground maudite of the
cemeteries of Pestiférés

51
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,470
"more quickly!
The sun drops!"

52
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,590
"Pay what you want!
We will not go further!"

53
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,870
"let us not go there!
This place is sinister!"

54
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,950
As soon as Hutter had crossed the bridge,

55
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,190
its fears, that it had entrusted to me,

56
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,070
were not long in materializing.

57
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,180
"You made me wait.

58
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,310
It is almost midnight.
The servants sleep!"

59

ACT II

61
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,390
"You hurt yourself... Invaluable blood!"

62
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:16,670
"do you Want to hold me a little company,
very expensive?

63
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:23,670
"There remains time until the rising of the sun

64
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:32,190
and the day, my good,
I sleep of the deepest sleep."

65
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,110
the paddle dissipated the shades of the
night.

66
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,550
My love! My beloved!

67
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,070
would not be sad to know me with far.

68
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,230
the mosquitos are a true plague,
they have bitten me around the neck.

69
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,990
One sleeps badly in this afflicted castle

70
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,350
but is not worried.

71
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,030
At night,
a spectral light seemed to animate the castle.

72
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,590
"Your wife has a splendid neck..."

73
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:02,510
"I buy the abandoned house...
We will be close... "

74
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,390
To continue its pitiful life

75
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,530
Nosferatu drinks the blood of its victims.

76
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,150
Take guard that its demonic shade

77
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,470
does not torment your dreams.

78
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,820
At the same time

79
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,750
"a doctor... a doctor!"

80
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,990
"a benign congestion."

81
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,350
the doctor allotted the anguishes of Ellen
to an unknown disease.

82
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,830
But I know that your heart
answered the call of the bird of death.

83
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,310
Nosferatu unfolded its wings.

84
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,830
Hutter sought to include/understand
the terror of its nights.

85
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,150
the boatmen did not know

86
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,510
which terrible burden they went down in the valley.

87
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,820

"Of the peasants transported it yesterday,
at the hospital.

90
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,810
They say that it made a fall.

91
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,310
It is still feverish..."

92
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,990
"Of the coffins..."

93
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,140
Nosferatu was on the way.
The danger approached Wisborg.

94
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,550
professor Bulwer,
who studied the secrecies of nature,

95
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,910
had spoken to me about it.

96
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,630
One had charged on Empusa
of the coffins filled with ground.

97
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,820
ship must even take the sea this night

98
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:47,790
Loading of Empusa Destination: Wisborg

99
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,070
At the same time, professor Bulwer
explained to his pupils

100
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,220
the cruelty of the plants carnivores.

101
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,470
the secrecies of nature
appeared in horrified eyes.

102
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,530
"is not this... like a vampire!"

103
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,070
It seems that the approach of
malfaisant Nosferatu

104
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,110
the realtor had a knock on influence.

105
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:33,030
"yesterday the patient had a delerious crisis."

106
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,910
"blood, it is the life!"

107
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,600
"See this one..."

108
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,510
"polyp with tentacles..."

109
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,920
"Transparency... Almost incorporeal... "

110
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,110
"A few things close, a phantom..."

111
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,830
"Of the spiders...!"

112
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,790
Ellen often walked in the loneliness of
the dunes.

113
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,870
Its sadness flew away towards its
beloved,

114
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,590
while its eyes scanned the waves and the
horizon.

115

My love! My beloved!

116

"Now, I must leave...
to regain the house as fast as possible!"

120
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,980
New epidemic of Black plague in the seaports.

121
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,990
Young people are decimated in mass.

122
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,140
All the victims carry the same wounds to the neck

123
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:19,300
whose origin is still a enigma for the doctors.

124

Dardanelles are closed with all the suspect ships.

The evening, the captain and his second
immersed their last comrade.

"I go down! If I am not there in ten minutes..."

130
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,670

In spite of its weakness,
Hutter overcame the difficulties of the voyage

134
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,110
the funeral breath of Nosferatu
inflated the veils of the ship

135
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,190
which sailed a such spectrum towards its goal.

that Nosferatu had carried.

01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:29,230
by offering her blood to him would
make the vampire forget the song of the cock

163
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:10,750
"I have the same vision, each evening...!"

164
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,270
the fear reigned on all the city.

165
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,570
Which was still healthy? Who was sick?

166
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:50,270
"I run to seek Sievers..."

167
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,310
another safety
Know that a woman is pure in the heart

168
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:11,460
by offering her blood to him would
make the vampire forget the song of the cock

169
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:25,510
The terrified city sought a victim: it was Knock.

170
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,870
"One saw it! It fled!

171
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:45,430
It strangled the guard... "

172
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:00,090
"It strangled it... the vampire!"

173
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:50,230
"Bulwer! Will seek Bulwer!"

174
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,990
"One captured Knock!"

175
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:37,530
"the Master... the Master...!"

176
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,690
"the Master...... died."

177
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:12,990
At the same moment,
as by miracle, deaths ceased

178
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,020
and, in the victorious rays of the morning sun,

179
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:24,000
one saw disappearing
the shade from the bird of death.

180
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:39,400
