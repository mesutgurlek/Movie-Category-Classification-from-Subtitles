1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,171
(bugs chittering)

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,861
(brakes squeak)

3
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:34,158
- (engine stops)
- (trunk clicks)

4
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,956
(bird cawing)

5
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,553
(birds chirping)

6
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,383
(flies buzzing)

7
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,641
(metal rattling)

8
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,792
(shuffling footsteps)

9
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,210
Little girl?

10
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,338
I'm a policeman.

11
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,591
Little girl.

12
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,722
Don't be afraid, okay?

13
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,393
Little girl.

14
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,404
(panting)

15
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,741
(growling)

16
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,080
Oh my God.

17
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,887
(theme music playing)

18
00:04:59,800 --> 00:04:59,924
- (police radio chatter)
- Man: What's the difference

19
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,634
- (police radio chatter)
- Man: What's the difference

20
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,010
between men and women?

21
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,513
- Man #2: This a joke?
- No, I'm serious.

22
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,600
Man #2: I never met a woman
who knew how to turn off a light.

23
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,727
They're born thinking
the switch only goes one way--

24
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,063
- on.
- (mutters)

25
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,649
They're struck blind
the second they leave a room.

26
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,985
I mean every woman
I ever let have a key--

27
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,196
I swear to God,
it's like I come home,

28
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,074
house all lit up.
(chuckles)

29
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,076
And my job,
you see, apparently--

30
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,745
because my chromosomes
happen to be different--

31
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,664
is I've then gotta walk
through that house,

32
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,417
turn off every single light
this chick left on.

33
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,336
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby. Mmm.

34
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,505
Oh, Reverend Shane is
preaching to you now, boy.

35
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,507
(both laugh)

36
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,010
Then-- the same chick, mind you--

37
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,096
she'll bitch about global warming.

38
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,932
You see, this is-- this is
when Reverend Shane wants

39
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,685
to quote from
the guy gospel and say,

40
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:57,023
"Darling, maybe you and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

41
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,359
just figure out the light switch,
you see, goes both ways,

42
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,320
maybe we wouldn't have so much
global warming." You know?

43
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,197
- You say that?
- Mmm.

44
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,284
Yeah, well, a polite version.
(laughs)

45
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,954
Still, man, that earns me this look

46
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,123
of loathing you would not believe.

47
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,542
And that's when
the "Exorcist" voice pops out.

48
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,628
(deep voice)
"You sound just like my damn father!

49
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,506
Always yelling
about the power bill,

50
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,216
telling me to turn off
the damn lights!"

51
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,053
- And what do you say to that?
- I know what I want to say.

52
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,888
I want to say,
"Bitch, you mean to tell me

53
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,556
you've been hearing this
your entire life

54
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,309
and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?"

55
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,519
(both laugh)

56
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,023
You know, I--
I don't actually say that though.

57
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,900
- That would be bad.
- Right right.

58
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,611
Yeah, I go with the--
I go with the polite version there too.

59
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,613
- Very wise.
- Yes sir.

60
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,573
- Mm-hmm.
- Well.

61
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,329
So how's it with Lori, man?

62
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,248
She's good-- she's good
at turning off lights.

63
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,376
Really good. I'm the one
who sometimes forgets.

64
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,545
Not what I meant.

65
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,426
- We didn't have a great night.
- Hey look, man,

66
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,471
I may have failed
to amuse with my sermon,

67
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,515
but I did try.

68
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,226
The least you can
do is-- is speak.

69
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,270
That's-- that's what
she always says.

70
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,108
"Speak. Speak."

71
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,569
You'd think I was the most
closed-mouth son of a bitch ever

72
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,446
to hear her tell it.

73
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,200
Do you express your thoughts?

74
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,787
Do you share your feelings,
that kind of stuff?

75
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,083
The thing is--

76
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,711
lately, whenever I try,

77
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,173
everything I say
makes her impatient,

78
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,300
like she didn't want
to hear it after all.

79
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,303
It's like she's...

80
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,265
pissed at me all the time
and I don't know why.

81
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,977
Look, man. That's just shit
couples go through.

82
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,312
Yeah, it's a phase.

83
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,819
The last thing
she said this morning,

84
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,739
"Sometimes I wonder
if you even care about us at all."

85
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,911
She said that
in front of our kid.

86
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,707
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

87
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,504
The difference
between men and women?

88
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,551
I would never say something
that cruel to her...

89
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,012
and certainly not
in front of Carl.

90
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,184
(radio beeps)

91
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,019
Dispatcher:
All available units,

92
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,520
high-speed pursuit in progress.

93
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,814
Linden County units
request local assistance.

94
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,692
Highway 18 eastbound. GTA, ADW,

95
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,695
2-17, 2-4-3.
Advise extreme caution.

96
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,281
- (engine starts)
- (siren blaring)

97
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,710
Dispatcher:
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

98
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,171
Be advised they have fired
upon police officers.

99
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,215
One Linden County officer
is wounded.

100
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,389
(tires screeching)

101
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,102
Dispatcher:
Unit 1, unit 3, to eastbound Route 18,

102
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,063
two miles west of Interstate 85.

103
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,649
Will patch in
Linden County sheriff radio.

104
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,234
Man over radio:
Roger that. We're five minutes south

105
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,653
of the Route 18 intersection.

106
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,738
Man #2 over radio:
Dispatch, unit 1 and unit 3,

107
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,032
we are 10-97 and code 100,

108
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,785
Highway 18,
E.B. of interstate, please advise.

109
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,747
Man on radio: 10-9,
we just got word from Linden County

110
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,582
that they're off 18,
now southbound--

111
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,335
(tires screech)

112
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,879
Old French Road
is closed down there

113
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,756
so they're gonna head
back onto 18.

114
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,343
(guns cock)

115
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,097
Sounds like they chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we've got.

116
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,890
Maybe we'll get on one of them
video shows, you know?

117
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,976
Like "World's Craziest Police Chases."
What do you think?

118
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,936
What I think, Leon,
is you need to stay focused,

119
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,397
make sure you've got a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

120
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,565
(distant sirens)

121
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,365
Would be kinda cool,
getting on one of them shows.

122
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,621
- (engine revving)
- (sirens blaring)

123
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,757
- (crashes)
- (tires screech)

124
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,410
(engine putters)

125
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,539
Holy shit.

126
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,132
(car door opens)

127
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,813
- Gun gun gun!
- Put it down!

128
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,982
Man:
Put the gun down!

129
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,656
Ah!

130
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,673
(grunts, wheezes)

131
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,392
Shane: Rick!

132
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,560
I'm all right!
(wheezing)

133
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,732
I saw you get tagged, man.

134
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,275
That scared the hell out of me.

135
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,319
Me too.

136
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,488
That son of a bitch shot me.

137
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,074
- You believe that?
- What? It catch you in your vest?

138
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,826
Yeah.

139
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,914
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened-- ever.

140
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,667
- You understand? Ah!
- (gunshot)

141
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,754
- Man: Police, move in!
- Shane: No no no no no no no.

142
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,382
- Man #2: You see where he come from?
- Shh shh shh shh.

143
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,426
No no no no
no no no no.

144
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,927
He's hit!

145
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,805
Leon! You get
that ambulance down here!

146
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,932
You tell them there's
an officer down! You do it now!

147
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,434
Okay, shh shh shh shh.

148
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,935
I'm here. Hey, you look at me.
You stay with me.

149
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,020
You hear me?
Shh shh shh. Okay.

150
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,856
I'm right here, Rick.
Stay with me. You hear me?

151
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,358
Shh shh. That's it. Do you hear me?
Shh shh shh. Okay.

152
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,610
I'm right here with you.
Stay with me.

153
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,654
- (distant sirens)
- Shh shh. That's it. I'm right here.

154
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,614
Leon over radio:
Dispatch, we have an officer down.

155
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,408
Request paramedics,
please respond.

156
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,410
Route 18 two miles west of I-85.

157
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,704
Repeat, officer down.
Request immediate response.

158
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,874
- (ventilator hissing)
- (heart monitor beeping)

159
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,794
(labored breathing)

160
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,796
(distorted)
Hey, bud.

161
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,591
We're still here.

162
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,302
We're still hanging in.

163
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,474
I'm sorry, man.

164
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,143
I know I say the same crap
every time I come in here.

165
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,312
(sighs)

166
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,107
Everybody pitched in on these.

167
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,526
They-- they wanted me
to bring 'em down.

168
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,403
They send their love,
and they just--

169
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,989
they hope you come back real soon.

170
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,203
(chuckles)
Linda and Diane from dispatch,

171
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,704
they picked these out.

172
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,040
Probably could tell, huh?

173
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,086
I'm just gonna set these
on your side table, okay?

174
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,927
(silence)

175
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,516
That vase--
that's something special.

176
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,186
'Fess up. You steal that for me
at Grandma Jean's house?

177
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,521
(laughing)

178
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,981
I hope you left her
that spoon collection.

179
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,694
(coughing)

180
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,908
Shane?

181
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,872
(rasps)
Shane, you in the john?

182
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,224
(crackling)

183
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,379
(grunting)

184
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,702
Nurse, help.

185
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,206
Nurse, help.

186
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,310
(lights humming)

187
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:56,306
(phone clicks, clatters)

188
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,493
(electrical humming)

189
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,330
(chain clinking)

190
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,174
(door rattling)

191
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,861
(thumping, moaning)

192
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,030
(glass shatters)

193
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,202
(groaning)

194
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,683
(groaning louder)

195
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,034
(Rick coughs)

196
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,586
(coughing)

197
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,304
Ah!

198
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,994
Ah.

199
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,132
Ah.

200
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,305
(clangs)

201
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,473
(bugs chittering)

202
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,962
(flies buzzing)

203
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,946
- (birds chirping)
- (bugs chittering)

204
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,596
(hissing)

205
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,891
Ah. Ah. Oh shit.

206
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,561
(growling)

207
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,676
Lori.

208
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,223
Lori!

209
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,399
Carl. Carl!

210
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,529
Shoot.

211
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,783
Lori! Carl!

212
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,958
(sobbing)

213
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,634
Lori! Carl.

214
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,610
Is this real?

215
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,779
Am I here?

216
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,912
Wake-- wake up.

217
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,081
(sniffles)

218
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,693
(twig snaps)

219
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,656
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Rick: Carl.

220
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,951
Carl. I found you.

221
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,828
Daddy, I got the sumbitch!
I'm gonna smack him dead!

222
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,380
He say something?
I thought I heard him say something.

223
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,924
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

224
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,927
Hey, mister,
what's that bandage for?

225
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,763
W-- what?

226
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,099
What kind of wound?

227
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,102
You answer me, damn you.

228
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,229
What's your wound?

229
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,940
You tell me...

230
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,317
or I will kill you.

231
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,702
(footsteps)

232
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,255
(rubber gloves snap)

233
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,135
Man: You got
that bandage changed now.

234
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,845
It was pretty rank.

235
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:22,223
What was the wound?

236
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,768
- Gunshot.
- Gunshot?

237
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,730
What else? Anything?

238
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,566
Gunshot ain't enough?

239
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,236
Look, I ask and you answer.

240
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,905
That's common courtesy, right?

241
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,579
(emphatically)
Did you get bit?

242
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,999
- Bit?
- Bit, chewed,

243
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,002
maybe scratched--
anything like that?

244
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,171
No, I got shot.

245
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,632
Just shot as far as I know.

246
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,513
Hey. Just let me.

247
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,060
Feels cool enough.

248
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,021
Fever would've killed you by now.

249
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,315
I don't think I have one.

250
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,317
Be hard to miss.

251
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,076
Take a moment,
look how sharp it is.

252
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,578
You try anything,

253
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,205
I will kill you with it.

254
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,582
And don't you think I won't.

255
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,924
(rope snaps)

256
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,301
(knife clicks)

257
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,887
Man:
Come on out when you're able.

258
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,725
Come on.

259
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,695
(ladle scrapes)

260
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,760
Rick: This place--
Fred and Cindy Drake's?

261
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,887
Man:
Never met 'em.

262
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,723
I've been here.
This is their place.

263
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,268
Man:
It was empty when we got here.

264
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,482
Don't do that.
They'll see the light.

265
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,110
There's more of them
out there than usual.

266
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,030
I never should've fired
that gun today.

267
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,825
Sound draws them.
Now they're all over the street.

268
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,620
Stupid-- using a gun.

269
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,582
But it all happened so fast,

270
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,292
I didn't think.

271
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,461
You shot that man today.

272
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,046
- Man?
- Boy: It weren't no man.

273
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,965
What the hell was that
out of your mouth just now?

274
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,342
It wasn't a man.

275
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,137
You shot him in the street
out front-- a man.

276
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,140
Friend, you need glasses.
It was a walker.

277
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,185
Come on. Sit down

278
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,604
before you fall down.

279
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,898
Here.

280
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,694
Daddy,

281
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,529
blessing.

282
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,824
Yeah.

283
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,172
Lord, we thank Thee for this food,

284
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,382
Thy blessings.

285
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,636
And we ask You to watch over us
in these crazy days.

286
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,221
- Amen.
- Boy: Amen.

287
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,271
Hey, mister, you even know
what's going on?

288
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,609
I woke up today in the hospital,

289
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,530
came home
and that's all I know.

290
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,576
But you know about
the dead people, right?

291
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,037
Yeah, I saw a lot of that--

292
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,706
out on the loading dock,
piled in trucks.

293
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,376
No, not the ones they put down.

294
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,920
The ones they didn't--
the walkers,

295
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,881
like the one I shot today.

296
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,591
'Cause he'd have ripped into you,

297
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,219
tried to eat you,
taken some flesh at least.

298
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,722
Well, I guess if this is
the first you're hearing it,

299
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,559
I know how it must sound.

300
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,188
They're out there now?
In the street?

301
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,439
Yeah.

302
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,192
They get more active
after dark sometimes.

303
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,194
Maybe it's the cool air or--

304
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,281
hell, maybe it's just
me firing that gun today.

305
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,492
But we'll be fine
as long as we stay quiet.

306
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,953
Probably wander off by morning.

307
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,582
But listen,

308
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,918
one thing I do know--

309
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,004
don't you get bit.

310
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,173
I saw your bandage
and that's what we were afraid of.

311
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,801
Bites kill you.

312
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,761
The fever burns you out.

313
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,638
But then after a while...

314
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,142
you come back.

315
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,566
Seen it happen.

316
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,823
Come on.

317
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,412
(crickets chirping)

318
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,792
Man:
Carl-- he your son?

319
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,172
Well, you--
you said his name today.

320
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,175
He's a little younger

321
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,135
than your boy.

322
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,928
Man:
And he's with his mother?

323
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,515
I hope so.

324
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,267
Boy: Dad.

325
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,312
Hey.

326
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,189
Did you ask him?

327
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,107
(chuckles)

328
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,276
Man:
Your gunshot--

329
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,070
we've got a little bet going.

330
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,156
My boy says
you're a bank robber.

331
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,699
(chuckles)

332
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,410
Yeah, that's me,

333
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,663
the deadliest Dillinger. Kapow.

334
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,166
- (man chuckles)
- Sheriff's deputy.

335
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,002
Uh-huh.

336
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,130
(car alarm blaring)

337
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,049
Hey, it's okay. Daddy's here.

338
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,967
It's nothing.

339
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,012
One of them must've
bumped a car.

340
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,182
- Are you sure?
- It happened once before.

341
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,352
It went on for a few minutes.

342
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,022
Get the light, Duane.

343
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,191
(alarm continues)

344
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,122
It's the blue one on the street,

345
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,249
the same one as last time.

346
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,543
I think we're okay.

347
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:11,757
That noise--
won't it bring more of them?

348
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,719
Man:
Nothing we can do about it now.

349
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,179
Just have to
wait 'em out till morning.

350
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,601
(gasps)
She's here.

351
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,147
Man: Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

352
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,900
I said go. Go on.

353
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:37,116
- (sobbing)
- Duane. Duane, quiet now.

354
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,243
Come on. Quiet now.

355
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,913
Shh shh.

356
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,851
It's okay. Here.

357
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,604
Cry into the pillow.
Do you remember?

358
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,898
Shh. Shh.

359
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,734
(footsteps)

360
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,336
(doorknob rattling)

361
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,146
She, um--

362
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,899
she died in that other room

363
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,692
on that bed in there.

364
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,948
There was nothing I--
I could do about it.

365
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,408
That fever, man,

366
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,120
her skin gave off
a heat like a furnace.

367
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,289
(crying)

368
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,836
I should've--

369
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,338
I should've put her down, man.
I should've put her down.

370
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,048
I know that, but I--

371
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,011
you know what?
I just didn't have it in me.

372
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,810
She's the mother of my child.

373
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,814
(rattling continues)

374
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,713
Rick:
Are we sure they're dead?

375
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,757
I have to ask
at least one more time.

376
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,759
Man:
They dead,

377
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,887
except for something in the brain.

378
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,222
That's why
it's got to be the head.

379
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,396
(hisses)

380
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,858
(growling)

381
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,572
(grunting)

382
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,749
Man:
Y'all all right?

383
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,753
I need a moment.

384
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,052
They're alive--
my wife and son.

385
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,054
At least they were
when they left.

386
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,597
How can you know?

387
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,599
By the look of this place--

388
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,268
I found empty drawers
in the bedroom.

389
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,770
They packed some clothes-- not a lot,

390
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,939
but enough to travel.

391
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,275
You know anybody could've broken in
here and stole them clothes, right?

392
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,945
You see the framed photos
on the walls?

393
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,572
Neither do I.

394
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,616
Some random thief take
those too, you think?

395
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,332
Our photo albums,
family pictures-- all gone.

396
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:18,420
Photo albums.
(laughs)

397
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,678
My wife-- same thing.

398
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,888
There I am
packing survival gear,

399
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,474
she's grabbing photo alb...

400
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,439
They're in Atlanta, I bet.

401
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,775
That's right.

402
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,486
- Why there?
- Man: Refugee center.

403
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,614
A huge one they said,
before the broadcast stopped.

404
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,993
Military protection, food, shelter.

405
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,036
They told people to go there,

406
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,788
said it'd be safest.

407
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,957
Duane:
Plus they got that disease place.

408
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,917
The Center
for Disease Control

409
00:38:57,085 --> 00:39:00,045
said they were working out
how to solve this thing.

410
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,180
(lock clicks)

411
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,195
- (knob squeaks)
- (pipes groan)

412
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,825
Gas lines have been down
for maybe a month.

413
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,536
The station's got
its own propane system.

414
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,707
Pilot's still on.

415
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,336
- Duane: Whoo-hoo!
- Man: Oh my Lord.

416
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,547
- Hot water!
- Ah!

417
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,591
That feels good, right?

418
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,134
- (laughs)
- ♪ Bring it around, bring it ♪

419
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,927
♪ Bring it, bring it,
bring it around, uh! ♪

420
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,722
Yeah. I'm wet.
Take that. What?

421
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,307
Whoo!

422
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,937
Duane.
Dressing room back there.

423
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,066
What do you say, Duane?

424
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,984
Thank you.

425
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,403
Man:
Mm-hmm.

426
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,949
Rick:
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

427
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,369
Safer anyway-- people.

428
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,580
Man:
That's where we were headed.

429
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,749
Things got crazy.

430
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,876
Man, you wouldn't
believe the panic.

431
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,920
Streets weren't fit to be on.

432
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,671
And then my--

433
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,592
my wife couldn't travel--

434
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,428
no, not with her hurt--
so we had to find a place to lay low.

435
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,014
And then after she died,

436
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,186
we just stayed hunkered down.

437
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,482
I guess we just froze in place.

438
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,277
Plan to move on?

439
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,866
Haven't worked up to it yet.

440
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,835
A lot of it's gone missing.

441
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,379
Daddy, can I learn
to shoot?

442
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,132
- I'm old enough.
- Hell yes, you're gonna learn,

443
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,676
but we've got to do it carefully,
teach you to respect the weapon.

444
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,845
That's right. It's not a toy.

445
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,638
You pull the trigger,
you have to mean it.

446
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,306
Always remember that, Duane.

447
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,641
Yes sir.

448
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:23,480
Man:
Here. Load up.

449
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,113
You take that one.
Nothing fancy.

450
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,282
The scope's accurate.

451
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,921
Conserve your ammo.

452
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,715
It goes faster than you think,

453
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,633
especially at target practice.

454
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,928
- Man: Duane.
- Uh-huh?

455
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,680
- Take this to the car.
- Okay.

456
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,849
Are you sure
you won't come along?

457
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,145
A few more days.
By then Duane will know how to shoot

458
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,980
and I won't be so rusty.

459
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,236
(walkie-talkie clicks, whines)

460
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,031
You've got one battery.

461
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,533
I'll turn mine on a few minutes
every day at dawn.

462
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,994
You get up there,
that's how you'll find me.

463
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,331
- You think ahead.
- Can't afford not to,

464
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,000
- not anymore.
- Man: Listen, one thing--

465
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,878
they may not seem
like much one at a time,

466
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,963
but in a group,
all riled up and hungry--

467
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:33,050
- man, you watch your ass.
- You too.

468
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,847
You're a good man, Rick.
I hope you find your wife and son.

469
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,227
Be seeing you, Duane.

470
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,437
- Take care of your old man.
- Yes sir.

471
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,606
(zombie growling)

472
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,909
Leon Basset?

473
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,248
I didn't think much of him--

474
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,750
careless and dumb-- but...

475
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,836
I can't leave him like this.

476
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,714
(growls)

477
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,591
You know they'll hear the shot.

478
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,094
Let's not be here
when they show up.

479
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,721
Let's go, son. Come on.

480
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,935
(car doors open)

481
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,729
(doors close)

482
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,190
(engine starts)

483
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,150
(gun cocks)

484
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,421
(honks)

485
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,298
(siren blares)

486
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:21,158
(bugs chittering)

487
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,160
(engine stops)

488
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,358
Read your comic books awhile.

489
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,234
Daddy'll be upstairs.

493
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,442
- Daddy?
- It's all right, Duane!

494
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,528
You stay there, son.
Don't you come up here.

495
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,782

Jenny.

499
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,684
Come on, baby.

I'm sorry this happened to you.

Come on. Come on.

00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,489
Come on.

507
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,158
Yeah.

Anybody hears me,

- Damn it.

527
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,339
Hello? Hello?
He couldn't hear me.

528
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:52,924
- I couldn't warn him.
- Try to raise him again.

529
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,052
Come on, son, you know best
how to work this thing.

530
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,307
Hello, hello. Is the person
who called still on the air?

531
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,687
This is Officer Shane Walsh

532

Please respond.

(radio crackling)

534
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:16,573
He's gone.

535
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,326
There are others.
It's not just us.

536
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,953
We knew there would be, right?

537
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,455
That's why we left the CB on.

538
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,123
A lot of good it's been doing.

539
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,000
- Okay.
- Woman: And I've been saying for a week

540
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:30,170
we ought to put signs up on 85
and warn people away from the city.

541
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,297
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

542
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,549
Well, we haven't had time.

543
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,927
I think we need to make time.

544
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,848
Yeah, that--
that's a luxury we can't afford.

545
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,434
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

546
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,604
And who the hell would
you propose we send?

547
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,439
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

548
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,608
Nobody goes anywhere alone.
You know that.

549
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,656
Yes sir.

550
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,533
Hey hey hey.
Go on, take a seat, bud.

551
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,535
You're all right.
Go on. You're all right.

552
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,665
What, are you pissed at me?

553
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,962
You can be pissed at me all you want.
It's not gonna change anything.

554
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,800
I'm not putting you
in danger, okay?

555
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,593
I'm not doing it for anything.

556
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,637
That make you feel like
sometimes you want

557
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,680
to slap me upside the head--
tell you what, girl:

558
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:26,017
you feel that need, you go right ahead.
I'm right here. Go on.

559
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,814
You cannot walk off like that,

560
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,899
all half-cocked.

561
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,069
Look, you do not want to do it
for my sake or your sake, that's fine.

562
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,364
But just-- you do it for him.

563
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:42,075
That boy has been
through too much

564
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:45,036
and he's not losing
his mother too, okay?

565
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,664
Okay?

566
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,666
I'm a good mom.

567
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,004
You tell me "okay."

568
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,928
Hmm?
(chuckles)

569
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,847
It's not hard.

570
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,559
All right? Hey.

571
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,366
Boy: Mom?

572
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:29,455
Shane: What's up, bud?
She's in there. Go on.

573
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,960
Hey, I don't want you to worry.

574
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,546
Your mama's not
going anywhere, okay?

575
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,173
Yeah? Yeah?

576
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,301
- Go finish your chores. Okay.
- Okay.

577
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,066
(trunk clicks)

578
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,429
Hello?

579
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,266
Police officer out here.

580
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,228
Can I borrow some gas?

581
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,275
(wind chime tinkling)

582
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,447
Hello?

583
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:51,120
(knocks)
Hello?

584
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,539
Anybody home?

585
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,142
(flies buzzing)

586
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:55,059

- (neighs)
- Easy now. Easy.

589
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,399
I'm not gonna hurt you.

590
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,902
Nothing like that.

591
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,739
More like a proposal.

592
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,825
Atlanta's just down
the road a ways.

593
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:56,537
It's safe there--
food, shelter, people.

594
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,790
Other horses too, I bet.

595
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,919
How's that sound?

596
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,254
(softly)
There we go. Good boy.

597
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,382
Good boy. Good boy.

598
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,802
Now come with me. Come on.

599
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,845
Come on. Come on.

600
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,430
Come on.

601
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,600
Good boy.

602
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,940
Just go easy, okay?

603
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:26,651
I haven't done this for years.

604
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,613
- Whoa. Whoa whoa whoa!
- (neighs)

605
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,032
Easy now.

606
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,785
Easy, boy.
Easy. Easy.

607
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:39,288
Easy. Easy. Eas--
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

608
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,624
Whoa whoa whoa.

609

Let's go.

- (horse whinnies)
- Rick: Steady.

616
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,167
There's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

617
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,804
Okay. Whoa whoa whoa.

618
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,057
Whoa.

Shoot.

Oh God. Oh God.

630
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,757
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

631
