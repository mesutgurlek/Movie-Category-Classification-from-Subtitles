Well, this...
This chick came into my house and...

475
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:32,709
And she sprouted fangs and then she
turned into stone and exploded.

476
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,512
Now, that's just ridiculous.

477
00:36:36,683 --> 00:36:39,447
Vampires don't just turn into stone
and then explode.

478
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:43,055
They have to be pierced through the heart
with a sharp object.

479

You know, I guess
the antlers could have done that.

480

As a matter of fact,
it doesn't have to be sharp.

483
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:57,931
It can be a blunt object,
as long as it pierces the heart.

This poor sap's drinking the blood
of the head vampire.

They like to trick people

and now she's a vampire.

Half. She's only half vampire.

502

She won't make the transition to full
bloodsucker until she makes her first kill.

I've been waiting to meet someone like you
for quite some time, Chris.

01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:50,465
Someone that would push the boundaries,
someone that would challenge me.

- I saw that in you.
