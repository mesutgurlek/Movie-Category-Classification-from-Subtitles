1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,520
Mom!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,520
She just remembers the school trip.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,000
It can't be.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,200
I know it can't be, but she is here.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,760
What do we do?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,720
I don't know.
There is no precedent.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,080
I was starving.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,000
Mr. Costa?

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,120
What is he doing there?
What's your name?

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,600
What's going on?

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,280
Poor little boy!
Does he live with you?

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,800
- What's his name?
- Victor.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,240
- Where's Adele?
- I'd know if she worked here.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,200
- Good night.
- You too.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,120
- It happened again.
- What?

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,160
I thought it was over.

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,520
10 YEARS AGO

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,040
Another round, please.

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
Thank you, everyone.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,160
Thank you.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
You want more?

22
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,200
Then see you tomorrow.

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,800
It's gonna be the wedding
between a big dumbass,

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,440
Simon, the bass guitarist wannabe,

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,240
and Adele,

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,960
the hottest waitress ever.

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
Lucky bastard.

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,760
Thank you, take care.

29
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,199
Can my friends and I take a picture
with the whole band?

30
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,839
Totally, sure.

31
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,199
I'm coming.

32
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,319
With Adele.

33
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,239
- Are you coming?
- Sure.

34
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,919
- Be careful, that's not a toy.
- Don't worry.

35
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,799
You want me to show you?

36
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,799
Like that.

37
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,999
See? That's easy.

38
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,919
We haven't slept much.

39
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,959
We'll sleep when we're dead.

40
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,279
Stop it.

41
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,679
I have to get ready.

42
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,839
Get up and get dressed.

43
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,399
It's bad luck for you to see me
in my wedding dress.

44
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,799
I'm outta here.

45
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,359
What?

46
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,599
Nothing.

47
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,959
You've got something to tell me.

48
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,999
Not now.
I'll tell you tonight.

49
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,359
Come on, what is it?

50
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,119
Tonight.

51
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,719
What, you're pregnant?

52
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,599
You're pregnant?

53
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,799
Are you happy?

54
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,319
Are you crying?
Honey...

55
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:03,798
So?

56
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:07,078
Damn him.

57
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:10,558
Don't worry.
He'll be here soon.

58
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,598
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

59
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:19,318
Excuse me.

60
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:53,238
La Fabrique
www.sous-titres.eu

61
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:53,998
- You're not eating?
- I am.

62
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:58,118
- What is Mom doing?
- I don't know.

63
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:00,638
She can't seem to get up.

64
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:02,718
Is it like last time?

65
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,598
No, she's just a little tired.

66
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:10,478
Eat your breakfast.

67
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:25,558
Are you OK?

68
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:28,838
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,757
Do you want me to go
to the church without you?

70
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:34,237
I'll go.

71
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:37,517
I just need five minutes.

72
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,437
Do you need an appointment
with Boisseau?

73
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:47,717
I'll be fine.

74
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:50,797
You can talk to me.

75
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:59,157
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,437
I understand.
Don't worry.

77
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:46,717
Hi.

78
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,597
I'm listening.

79
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:53,277
What can I have with this?

80
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:56,597
All right, get lost.

81
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:08,997
Would you just have a piece of bread?

82
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,517
I'm starving.

83
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:12,757
I said get lost.

84
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:00,637
- Sorry.
- Wait.

85
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:03,716
Do I scare you?

86
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:11,756
I scare myself.

87
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:16,556
What happened to me?

88
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:21,196
Sorry.

89
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,516
- You've never seen him before?
- Never.

90
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:38,756
- He really hurt you bad.
- No shit.

91
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:42,676
We'll watch the video
and put out an APB on him.

92
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,036
Yeah, right.

93
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:48,516
May I help you?

94
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:54,756
I was wondering
if there was any report of a 
missing...

95
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:56,156
little boy...

96
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:57,876
brown hair,

97
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:00,716
about 8 years old, maybe younger.

98
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,796
Brown hair and dark eyes.

99
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,676
Why are you wondering that?

100
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,956
Because I saw a little boy last night
on my way home.

101
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:13,516
He seemed lost, so I was wondering.

102
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,876
You didn't ask him if he was lost?

103
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:18,436
Not really.

104
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:20,076
Not really?

105
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:22,876
I was inside the bus.

106
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:26,236
So I just saw him.

107
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,556
- But never mind...
- Wait.

108
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:34,836
You saw the color of his eyes
from inside the bus?

109
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,196
Why haven't you reported it earlier?

110
00:11:43,516 --> 00:11:45,916
Come with me.
I'll take your statement.

111
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:49,316
Come on.

112
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,756
- Do I have to make a statement?
- Of course.

113
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:56,676
That can be evidence.

114
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:19,676
Yoghurt?

115
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:21,836
No, thanks.

116
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:24,556
Want some tea, Camille?

117
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,116
Thanks.

118
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:38,435
Coffee?

119
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:42,515
Is that how it's going to be now?

120
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:45,515
- What do you mean?
- Act as everything is fine?

121
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:48,955
- It's not.
- How do we know it's her?

122
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:52,035
Maybe she's a clone or something.

123
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,675
- Stop it.
- What?

124
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,635
She could be a fraud.

125
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,155
- Can't you see it's Camille?
- Who else could I be?

126
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,555
Do you know how I feel?
Put yourself in my shoes for a second.

127
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,355
I don't care.
You're not real!

128
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:06,355
Enough already!

129
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,795
Why are you lashing out at her?

130
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,475
Geez.

131
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:31,275
Am I the only one who sees
what's happening?

132
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:34,315
She can't be back from the dead.
That's impossible!

133
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,275
Is she some kind of Jesus?

134
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,675
She was dead,
and now, she's returned to life?

135
00:13:39,915 --> 00:13:41,955
That's enough.
Someone might hear you.

136
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:43,955
What? You wanna hide her?

137
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:47,115
We should throw her
a big welcome home party!

138
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:50,355
- Are you out of your mind?
- Are you gonna hit me again?

139
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:54,275
I can't explain it.

140
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:57,035
All I know
is that your sister needs you.

141
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,235
My sister is dead.

142
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:01,315
Don't you get that?

143
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:03,035
She's dead.

144
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,235
Excuse me, do you know Adele Verter?

145
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:30,675
- I'm sorry?
- She used to live here.

146
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:34,115
- I just took her apartment.
- How long ago?

147
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:37,475
- Eight or nine years.
- Do you know Simon Delaitre?

148
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:40,355
- They were a couple.
- I don't know much about Ms. Verter.

149
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:43,835
It was eight years ago,
I met her three times, I'm sorry.

150
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:45,955
Do you know
what happened to Simon?

151
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:48,355
Good bye.

152
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,275
Who the hell is that guy?

153
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:53,755
Victor?

154
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:07,314
You need to talk to me already.

155
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:11,114
I went to the police station.
No one's looking for you.

156
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,314
You need to tell me
where you got lost.

157
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,194
It wasn't in this town?

158
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:33,354
Do you even understand what I say?

159
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:45,634
I can't keep you.

160
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:49,594
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

161
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:56,314
And...

162
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:00,034
I don't have any toys,
I don't have anything for kids.

163
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:03,554
You'll get bored with me.

164
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:38,754
I'd like this to be settled by 
Thursday,
so we can print the texts.

165
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,314
Thursday should be fine.

166
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:45,874
You'll have time
to make up your mind.

167
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:50,234
I'm sorry.
I don't like any of those.

168
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,794
We'll find something.

169
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:54,954
I need to pee.

170
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,074
The restroom is over there.

171
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:00,194
Sorry.

172
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:05,594
Captain.

173
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,994
A woman was assaulted last night
in the tunnel near the town hall.

174
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:12,474
Apparently,
the victim is Lucy Clarsen.

175
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:15,074
- She's a waitress at the Lake Pub.
- She's alive?

176
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:17,154
She's critical.

177
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:20,114
She was stabbed a dozen of times.

178
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,714
- She has bite marks on her stomach.
- Bite marks?

179
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:25,154
It looks like he's back.

180
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:29,554
- Get a canvass going. I'll be here.
- Yes, sir.

181
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:37,713
I have to go.

182
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:39,473
An emergency?

183
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,953
I'll make a detailed report for you.

184
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:44,553
I'm sorry.

185
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,233
It has dropped since yesterday?

186
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:18,033
It's still dropping.

187
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:23,433
Let me know if it keeps dropping.
I'll send someone to check it out.

188
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:26,193
And don't tell anyone.

189
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:44,033
I tried to call her many times.
She won't answer.

190
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:48,553
I'll call you back, Pierre.

191
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:53,793
Is Camille in her room?

192
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,793
I think she's finally sleeping.

193
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,953
I need to get changed at my place.
I'll be back.

194
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:02,193
All right.

195
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:10,672
Why don't you bring
some of your things here?

196
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:15,392
It's for Camille's sake.

197
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:18,472
What about Pierre?

198
00:20:23,552 --> 00:20:24,672
I'm sorry.

199
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:27,912
You're right.

200
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:31,112
See you later.

201
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:09,672
What?

202
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:13,872
- Sorry, were you sleeping?
- I was trying.

203
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:15,472
What did you want?

204
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:19,632
Have you been in your sister's room?

205
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:21,472
No, why?

206
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:24,792
Just asking.

207
00:21:39,352 --> 00:21:41,672
- Hello, Julie.
- Hello, Ms. Payet.

208
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:46,392
Hello, little boy.
You're so cute.

209
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:48,272
- Victor, is it?
- Yes.

210
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:51,032
I didn't quite catch it.
Are you related?

211
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:53,032
Yes, absolutely.

212
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,952
Did you hear
what happened to Mr. Costa?

213
00:21:57,992 --> 00:21:59,352
You didn't hear?

214
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:04,312
This morning, Mr. Costa...

215
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:06,832
What?

216
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:10,672
He took a dive from the dam,
and it was no bungee jumping.

217
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:13,392
You knew him, right?

218
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:17,832
- Not much.
- Poor Mr. Costa.

219
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:21,792
He was nearly 75, right?
He didn't have much longer to wait.

220
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:25,112
He must had been really desperate.

221
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:26,712
Good bye.

222
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:32,632
- The boy doesn't go to school?
- Not today.

223
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:34,752
- Have a nice day.
- Will do.

224
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:39,711
If you can't find a text that you 
like,
we can have more songs instead.

225
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:41,991
That would be better.

226
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:45,831
I feel like
you don't trust me anymore.

227
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:50,151
- Why are you saying that?
- I know you.

228
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:53,351
I can see something is wrong,
and since you won't talk to me,

229
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:56,351
I take it
that you don't trust me anymore.

230
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:03,791
Last night,

231
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,671
I thought Simon came back.

232
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:10,191
It was so real.
He talked to me.

233
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:12,471
He was even shouting.

234
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:16,351
It hadn't happen for years.

235
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:18,231
Actually,

236
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,551
I thought it was over.

237
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,111
I thought I was cured.

238
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:26,471
You know,

239
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:30,191
a few days ago, a lady came to me.

240
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,711
She was completely overwhelmed,

241
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:35,111
because she had just talked
to her husband,

242
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:37,391
who died more than twenty years ago.

243
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:39,751
She told me

244
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,871
that it was as if he reappeared
in the flesh.

245
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:44,671
As if he came back.

246
00:23:45,311 --> 00:23:47,111
Do you think that's possible?

247
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:51,591
I think that our loved ones

248
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,351
live on through us.

249
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:56,351
I believe souls are immortal.

250
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:59,031
The resurrection of bodies,
on the other hand...

251
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,071
I don't think
anybody would want that.

252
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:08,871
Don't worry, Adele.

253
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,631
Thinking about Simon

254
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:14,351
before your wedding
is absolutely normal.

255
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:16,191
But when you realize

256
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:20,351
that you won't have to forget about 
him
once you're married to Thomas,

257
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,191
you will find peace, I'm sure.

258
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:27,791
It is really important
to be at peace with one's ghosts.

259
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,831
Unlike what people think,

260
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:32,711
they mean us no harm.

261
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:37,591
So, if Simon comes back to you,
don't shut him out.

262
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:40,431
Talk to him.

263
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:55,831
Hi, the one who's always been here,
but who nobody knows.

264
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:57,191
How are you?

265
00:24:57,431 --> 00:25:00,191
- Where did you say Adele was working?
- At the media library.

266
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:02,791
- Where is that?
- Next to the town hall.

267
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:06,031
Why do I feel like I know you?

268
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:07,791
Thanks.

269
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,750
What did he want?

270
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,790
Have sex with me.

271
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,070
But he's not my type.

272
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,310
Does she remember friends
that would've been with her in the 
bus?

273
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,670
Yes, she remembers everything
before the accident.

274
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,990
She remembers her life,
her friends...

275
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,270
Hello, doctor.

276
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,590
Still no medical stuff?

277
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,270
- Did you get some sleep?
- Not even for a second.

278
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,430
Can you explain that to me?

279
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,390
- Everything can be explained.
- Yeah, right.

280
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,990
- What are you doing?
- I'm suffocating here.

281
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,110
I don't think that's a good idea.

282
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,110
What do you know?
Who are you anyway?

283
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,710
Pierre is here to help.
You can trust him.

284
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,230
- So what? I'm some kind of zombie?
- You're not a zombie.

285
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,910
So what am I?

286
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,950
You know, you're not the only one.

287
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,550
- It happened before.
- I don't believe that crap.

288
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,630
Whether you believe it or not,
it's true.

289
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,110
I was at your funeral.

290
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,590
I saw you in your coffin.

291
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,630
Yet, here you are.

292
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,070
Someone has given you the chance
to start over.

293
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,670
Who is that someone?

294
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,710
There were forty of us in that bus.
Why did they save me?

295
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,750
I understand why you're scared,
but you don't have to be.

296
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,390
What you're going through
is absolutely amazing.

297
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,910
Someone is watching over you.

298
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,190
I just want to live a normal life.

299
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,670
Like I used to.

300
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,590
It looks good, right?

301
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,310
Do you like it?

302
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:46,229
Hey, Toni.

303
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:47,749
Hey.

304
00:27:47,989 --> 00:27:50,629
Come with us to the precinct.
We have a few questions.

305
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,389
- About what?
- About Lucy Clarsen.

306
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:55,589
What about her?

307
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:58,309
Come on, we'll tell you.

308
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:05,549
Hey.

309
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:07,669
What's going on?

310
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:10,549
I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it.

311
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:14,389
Sylvain, give me my coat, please.

312
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:16,829
See you later.

313
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:26,349
Lieutenant.

314
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:28,149
I think I've located the perp.

315
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:31,549
He's at the media library.
All right, I'll let you know.

316
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,149
Oh, my.

317
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:12,948
You're so handsome.

318
00:30:19,348 --> 00:30:22,868
Just because I'm marrying Thomas
doesn't mean I'll forget about you.

319
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:26,628
You are a part of me.

320
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:29,748
I'll never forget you.

321
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:32,028
Of course,

322
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:34,708
I tried at some point, I had to.

323
00:30:36,508 --> 00:30:37,708
But I...

324
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:40,748
I quickly realized that I couldn't.

325
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:43,668
And I could live with that.

326
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,028
I know that you're a ghost.

327
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:56,908
I know that you're not real.

328
00:30:58,468 --> 00:30:59,708
But I'm not scared.

329
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:03,348
You can stay.

330
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:07,468
I won't ask you to go away anymore.

331
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,668
I'm glad that you're back.

332
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:15,868
Even if it's only in my head.

333
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:29,188
Calm down, everyone.

334
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:34,148
You pick a book, you keep quiet
and you sit down.

335
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:37,428
Have a seat.

336
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:45,108
Hello, sir.

337
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,628
Can you please come with us?

338
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,068
He waited for her in the tunnel,
stabbed her 17 times

339
00:31:58,308 --> 00:31:59,748
and tried to eat her liver.

340
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:03,668
Look, it's exactly the same MO.

341
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,788
It gotta be the same murderer
from seven years ago.

342
00:32:08,188 --> 00:32:09,228
Captain?

343
00:32:19,468 --> 00:32:21,548
Hello, have a seat.

344
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:29,388
Do you know what happened
to Lucy Clarsen?

345
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:30,668
No, I don't.

346
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:33,548
- She did work last night?
- She did.

347
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:36,708
When did she end her shift?

348
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:40,148
I'm not sure.
Around 2 am.

349
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:42,628
Was someone waiting for her?

350
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:44,227
I don't think so.

351
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:48,387
Do you know
if she has any family here?

352
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:52,067
- Not that I know of.
- What were you doing when she left?

353
00:32:52,787 --> 00:32:53,907
Closing the bar.

354
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:56,147
- Were you alone?
- Yes.

355
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,867
Then what did you do?

356
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:00,027
I went home.

357
00:33:00,707 --> 00:33:03,307
- Who can corroborate?
- Why are you asking me all this?

358
00:33:04,027 --> 00:33:07,227
Seven years ago, you were arrested
on suspicion of attempted homicide,

359
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:08,547
in the tunnel.

360
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:11,067
They made a mistake.
I was proven innocent.

361
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,227
Look at your waitress.

362
00:33:15,587 --> 00:33:17,547
It's a miracle
that she's still alive.

363
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:19,227
It can't be.

364
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:23,507
You did this.
You did this to her.

365
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:25,267
And to the others too.

366
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:28,747
You crazy bastard, you wanted more
and you started to eat them.

367
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:30,067
Enough.

368
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:33,547
You may go, lieutenant.

369
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:36,867
All right, sir.

370
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,707
Let's take it right from the start.

371
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,387
What the fuck are they doing?

372
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:18,387
Mom?

373
00:34:26,707 --> 00:34:27,707
You OK?

374
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:35,067
You wanna go somewhere else?

375
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,947
Do you think someone
can come back from the dead?

376
00:34:39,987 --> 00:34:41,427
Yeah, in movies.

377
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,627
In the real life...

378
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:47,107
If they came back, we'd have to hide.

379
00:34:47,347 --> 00:34:50,147
- The dead would be fucking pissed.
- Never mind.

380
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:54,747
Wait, Lena!
What is it?

381
00:34:58,587 --> 00:35:00,467
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

382
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:02,427
Come on, hit it.

383
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:42,906
Yes, I understand.

384
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:48,106
I really can't, tonight.

385
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:50,826
I can come tomorrow
whenever you like.

386
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:53,866
All right, 2 pm.

387
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:56,386
Is it OK with you?

388
00:35:56,746 --> 00:36:00,186
Tomorrow at 2 pm then, Mrs. Romain.
Bye, thank you.

389
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:14,225
What did that animal do to you?

390
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:27,985
What?

391
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,545
Why did you hit me?
Are you nuts?

392
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:15,265
Hail Mary, full of grace...

393
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,504
It's me!

394
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:23,784
... blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

395
00:41:11,504 --> 00:41:12,504
So?

396
00:41:13,744 --> 00:41:15,184
When did you notice?

397
00:41:15,784 --> 00:41:16,944
An hour ago.

398
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:20,024
I went to her room
to see if she was sleeping.

399
00:41:20,264 --> 00:41:23,024
- Did you call Lena?
- She won't answer.

400
00:41:23,904 --> 00:41:25,264
She can't be far.

401
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:28,584
Do you think she'll come back?

402
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:31,464
I'm sure.

403
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:43,704
If she doesn't come back,
I won't bear it this time.

404
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:31,904
What are you doing?

405
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,984
I can get you in.

406
00:42:35,864 --> 00:42:37,144
Want a drink?

407
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:55,183
Did you see Camille?

408
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:58,103
Did she go out?

409
00:42:58,623 --> 00:43:01,783
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- She snuck out.

410
00:43:02,743 --> 00:43:04,023
Where did she go?

411
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:05,783
We don't know.

412
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:16,263
I've never seen that before.

413
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,863
What?

414
00:43:18,103 --> 00:43:20,303
The man who assaulted the waiter,

415
00:43:21,103 --> 00:43:24,943
he's in our records,
but he's supposed to be dead.

416
00:43:25,183 --> 00:43:27,263
For ten years.
Have a look.

417
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:30,463
His name is Simon Delaitre.

418
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:37,383
He didn't tell us his name.
He won't talk to us.

419
00:43:37,623 --> 00:43:39,463
We just took his fingerprints.

420
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,063
Has that ever happened to you?

421
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:44,903
- What?
- That.

422
00:43:45,143 --> 00:43:47,463
I didn't know
the records could be falsified.

423
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:51,503
Does Simon Delaitre
ring any bell with you?

424
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:53,943
No.

425
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:05,143
It's OK, thanks.

426
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:22,703
We're having
a little problem with you.

427
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,023
According to our records,
you are dead.

428
00:44:27,423 --> 00:44:28,943
How do you explain that?

429
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,703
You're the cops.

430
00:44:34,263 --> 00:44:36,143
Your name is Simon Delaitre.

431
00:44:36,703 --> 00:44:37,703
Is that right?

432
00:44:40,703 --> 00:44:41,583
And this.

433
00:44:42,103 --> 00:44:43,983
Are you telling me that's not you?

434
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:45,783
- Are you?
- That's right.

435
00:44:47,303 --> 00:44:48,823
Do you know Adele Verter?

436
00:44:50,223 --> 00:44:51,303
Yes.

437
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,703
Why are you asking me that?

438
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,263
If you know her,
you probably knew Simon Delaitre.

439
00:44:57,503 --> 00:44:58,823
They were a couple.

440
00:45:01,223 --> 00:45:03,143
You know that Simon Delaitre is dead?

441
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:05,503
But he is Simon Delaitre.

442
00:45:06,063 --> 00:45:07,743
He's dead.
That's what you said.

443
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,303
Who is Adele to you?

444
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:17,663
Read him his rights.

445
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:20,542
Take him into custody.

446
00:45:44,702 --> 00:45:48,182
What's going on?
Why was the house closed?

447
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:51,782
Where is Mom?
Did something happen to her?

448
00:45:53,222 --> 00:45:54,382
She's dead.

449
00:45:58,582 --> 00:46:00,742
What happened?
What did you do to her?

450
00:46:00,982 --> 00:46:02,182
I didn't do anything.

451
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:05,622
When did she die?

452
00:46:06,702 --> 00:46:07,822
Three years ago.

453
00:46:08,742 --> 00:46:12,262
What are you talking about?
Why don't I remember it?

454
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:15,902
- Because you weren't around.
- Where was I?

455
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:18,942
With her.

456
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:50,662
Good evening.

457
00:46:52,582 --> 00:46:53,742
How was your day?

458
00:46:53,982 --> 00:46:54,982
Fine.

459
00:46:56,142 --> 00:46:58,942
I chose the songs.
Look.

460
00:47:07,062 --> 00:47:08,502
Tell me if it's OK with you.

461
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:42,662
Where were you, sweetie?

462
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,542
Don't leave like that.
I was so worried.

463
00:47:47,382 --> 00:47:50,461
What could happen to me?
I'm already dead.

464
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:52,901
Where were you?

465
00:47:54,861 --> 00:47:55,901
At the Lake Pub.

466
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:59,501
- I wanted to see Frederic.
- Did you see him?

467
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:03,501
I bumped into Lucho.

468
00:48:04,141 --> 00:48:05,381
Did he recognize you?

469
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:10,021
He didn't.

470
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:53,621
Yes.

471
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:07,381
I saw someone at the Lake Pub...

472
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:09,701
I think he's like you.

473
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,141
What do you mean?

474
00:49:17,181 --> 00:49:18,661
I think he's dead too.

475
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:38,781
You really don't want to call anyone?

476
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:40,101
Are you sure?

477
00:49:43,141 --> 00:49:45,061
Tell me if you change your mind.

478
00:49:59,461 --> 00:50:00,581
There, there.

479
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:17,701
Don't worry.

480
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:20,341
I'll take good care of you.

481
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,060
All right.

482
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Good night.

483
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
