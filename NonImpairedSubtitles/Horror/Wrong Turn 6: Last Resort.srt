I do.

156

You rip the place down,
subdivide the land,

157

and we go back, we'll send someone in

I know it's hard to wait.

635
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:37,793
But I'm so close, that I can touch him.

636
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,004
How did this one get in here
to begin with?

637
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,300
I tried to stop 'em.

638
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,887
The fact they stopped at all
is a small miracle.

639
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:51,599
- They're just not listening.
- Tonight then.

640
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:54,018
We have them all meet Danny tonight.

641
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,271
You ready?

642
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:02,818
Finish him off.

643
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:05,029
Take him to the kitchen.

644
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:06,906
We'll carve him up later.

Mold.

653
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,664
I'm gonna need some more paper.

654
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:00,126
This would go a hell of a lot faster
if we knew what Danny had in mind.

Where is Danny?

656
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,713
We need keys to some of these places.

is on a break.

- Fine.

OK.

- DANNY: Yeah.

Was she trying to take these?

I don't know.

671

about selling things off.

Bryan's done worse.

- Have you seen them anywhere?
- No.

with a few parting gifts.

That's not like them, though.

Well, I guess you never
really know anybody, huh?

We've known them for three years.

679
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,143
Yeah, all they've ever been about
is the quick and easy.

680
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:45,648
Bryan with his subprimes, and Jillian
playing the Manhattan socialite bitch.

- Danny!
- She's from Wisconsin.

682
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,237
I mean, I gave 'em a chance
to get in on the ground floor.

683
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:55,616
God forbid they ever achieve anything
in life by actually working for it.

00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:58,077
- That's what I'm trying to do here.
- Wow, Danny.

685
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,329
- They are your friends.
- You know why Bryan's so eager

686
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:02,665
to get me back in the firm?

687
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,333
So he didn't have to do any work.

688
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,753
I always did the heavy lifting,
and look what that cost me.

They're my old life.
This... this is my new one.

My God! I am really trying hard
to be supportive right now,

691
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,887
but the only person I don't
feel like I know is you!

- What are you talking about?
- It is this place!

693
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,101
- You wanted to bring me here.
- Because I thought it was gonna help.

694
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:24,853
And it has!
Even Sally noticed the difference

695
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,439
- from when I got here.
- Oh, my God. Sally?

696

- Oh, don't start that again.
- You wanna bring up... No, no! No!

brother/husband/cousin/whatever.

- Enough of that shit!
- They are the only ones

00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,618

Go ask them yourself.

Yeah, have you?
Have you checked into

702

anything that
they've told you?

- And we haven't?

so overwhelming for you.

- And we're thrilled that you're

- interested in the hotel.

to use a flashlight?

We've known each other since our clans
first set foot in these hills.

01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:50,601
There were three families
back in those days.

and the Hillickers.

Reaped its rewards,
the coal, the timber.

Others tried to chisel in
on what we'd earned,

became ritual.

Our devotion was strong
