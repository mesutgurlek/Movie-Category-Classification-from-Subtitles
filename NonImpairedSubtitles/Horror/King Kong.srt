37
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,988
That's a funny one.
Isn't that funnier?

38
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,284
It's hysterical, Manny.

39
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,756
As long as we're laughing...

40
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,258
we won't cry
over the box office.

41
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,919
Talk about depressing.

42
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,522
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.

43
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,123
That's depressing.

44
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,533
I love a good chorus line.

45
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,132
What's this?
It's a play.

46
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,698
Who wrote it, Annie?

47
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,573
Some guy. Driscoll.

48
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,273
Driscoll.

49
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,211
From the Federal Theatre.

50
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,648
Don't knock it, honey. At
least they got an audience.

51
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,254
It'll pick up.
Isn't that right, Manny?

52
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,483
It always does.

53
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,486
See you tomorrow.

54
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,658
The trick is to start to build
right from the back of your throat.

55
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,359
Works well
out through the nose, too.

56
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,234
Have you eaten today?

57
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,499
Oh...

58
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,871
I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about me.

59
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,136
Hey.

60
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,174
You're all I've got.

61
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,878
Come on, take me to dinner.

62
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,878
Okay.

63
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,086
You think the kitchen will
still be open on Third?

64
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,688
Soup and biscuits.
Perfect.

65
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,692
Harry, what's going on?

66
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,233
Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore, lady.

67
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,866
It's all right for you. We haven't
had a paycheck in two weeks.

68
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,603
How we gonna eat?

69
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,802
They're not getting away
with this! They just did.

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,314
Ann, it's no use.

71
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,313
The show, it's over.
It's done.

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,382
I'm done.

73
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,552
I'm leaving, Annie.

74
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,319
I'm going back to Chicago.

75
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,788
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,526
I'm sorry, Annie.

77
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,939
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

78
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,905
You gotta
think of yourself now.

79
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,771
You should try out
for that part.

80
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,848
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

81
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,818
Every time you reach out for
something you care about...

82
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,619
fate comes along
and snatches it away.

83
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,283
But not this time, Annie.

84
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,385
Not this time.

85
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,667
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston.
Oh, jeez.

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,805
Look, miss, I told you
already, call my office.

87
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,807
Leave your résumé
with my secretary.

88
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,935
Now, why would I want to do that
when we can talk about it in person?

89
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,639
Because that's what
a smart girl would do.

90
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,182
But I already sent you my
résumé. You returned it unopened.

91
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,275
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

92
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,014
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

93
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,282
Jesus, you don't give up,
do you?

94
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,914
Mr. Weston,
I know this role backwards.

95
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,959
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we
just gave the part to someone else.

96
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,427
I'm sorry, kid.
The play is cast.

97
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,194
I know times are tough.

98
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,260
You want my advice?

99
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,665
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.

100
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,369
A girl like you
doesn't have to starve.

101
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,070
There's a new place.
It just opened.

102
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,281
Now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the Palace, you understand?

103
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,348
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.

104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,051
Just play the date,
take the money...

105
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,021
forget you was ever there.

106
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,096
How much more is there?

107
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,361
Another five reels.

108
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,065
Lights up.

109
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,308
This is it?

110
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,208
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

111
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,908
Another one of your
safari pictures?

112
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,076
You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

113
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,847
Come on, fellows,
you know the deal.

114
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,513
We agreed to push
Maureen's start date...

115
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,147
so she could
get her teeth fixed.

116
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,057
It's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.

117
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,687
Carl, you've been in
production for over two months.

118
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,425
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen...

119
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,399
once we get them on the ship.

120
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,499
What ship?

121
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,398
The one that we hired
to get to the location.

122
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,273
What location? Carl! You're supposed
to be shooting on the back lot.

123
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,867
Yes, I understand that.

124
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,311
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

125
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,642
and I'll tell you why.

126
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,548
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.

127
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,745
Life intervened.

128
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,213
I've come into possession
of a map.

129
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,655
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

130
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,855
A place that was thought
to exist only in myth.

131
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,189
Until now.

132
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,291
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

133
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,699
Is he asking for more money?

134
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,363
He's asking us
to fund a wild goose chase.

135
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,899
I'm talking about a primitive
world never before seen by man.

136
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,070
The ruins
of an entire civilization.

137
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,250
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

138
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,777
That's where
I'll shoot my picture.

139
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,156
Will there be boobies?

140
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,622
Boobies?

141
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,792
Jigglies. Jiblonkas.
Bazooms.

142
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,661
In my experience, people
only go to these films...

143
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,102
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

144
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,739
What are you, an idiot?

145
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,003
You think they asked De Mille if he
would waste his time on nudie shots?

146
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,705
No! They respected the
filmmaker. They showed some class.

147
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,238
Not that you'd know what
that means, you cheap lowlife!

148
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,015
Would you step out
for a moment, Carl?

149
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,260
Zelman and Associates.

150
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,500
Give me that, quick.

151
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,199
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.

152
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:41,406
Preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.

153
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,944
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

154
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,988
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

155
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,354
He's had a lot of
near-success.

156
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,860
He's a preening self-promoter.

157
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,226
An ambitious no-talent. The guy's
got "loser" written all over him.

158
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,787
I understand
your disappointment...

159
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,992
He can't direct.
He doesn't have the smarts.

160
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,866
He's washed up.
It's all over town.

161
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,367
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

162
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,272
The animal footage has value.

163
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,777
Sure. Universal are
desperate for stock footage.

164
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,245
Then sell it!
Scrap the picture.

165
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,679
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

166
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,180
Get him back in.

167
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,815
Mr. Denham.

168
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,026
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

169
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,224
No, Carl,
you can't do this.

170
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,460
Tell them the studio pressured
us into an early departure.

171
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,559
It's not ethical! What
are they gonna do, sue me?

172
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,729
They can get in line.

173
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,237
I'm not gonna let them
kill my film.

174
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,742
You realize that none of the
camera equipment is on board?

175
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,607
We have no permits,
no visas.

176
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,306
That's why I have you,
Preston.

177
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,474
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

178
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,483
In fact, we have
no currency of any kind.

179
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,540
He's there.

180
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,450
Get in there. Who's
gonna pay for the ship?

181
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,613
Get in.

182
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,088
You get out of there! Come
here! Step on it! Step on it!

183
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,222
Get out!
You're finished, Denham!

184
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,434
Don't worry, Preston. I've
had a lot of practice at this.

185
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,067
I'm real good
at crapping the crappers.

186
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,502
Red Label, 80% proof...

187
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,409
to be packed in a crate
marked "lemonade. "

188
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,538
You got it.

189
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,981
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.

190
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,349
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

191
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,048
She doesn't wanna be
in this picture.

192
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,817
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?

193
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,986
Yesterday. I told you.

194
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,694
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

195
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,755
That's what you told her.

196
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,827
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

197
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:48,203
God damn it, Preston, all you had to
do was look her in the eye and lie.

198
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,999
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

199
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,510
She's unavailable.

200
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,411
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow?
Mae West?

201
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,774
You'll never get her
into a size four.

202
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,411
You gotta get a girl that'll
fit into Maureen's costumes.

203
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,983
Fay's a size four.

204
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,549
Yes, she is, but she's
doing a picture with RKO.

205
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,628
Cooper, huh?

206
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,161
I might have known.

207
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,936
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

208
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,471
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

209
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,972
Not an option.
Carl.

210
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,508
I said I'd find a girl.

211
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,840
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

212
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,744
Call Jack. I need that
goddamn screenplay!

213
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,675
Defeat is always momentary.

214
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,711
What?

215
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,306
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

216
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,910
Excuse me.

217
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,447
Ma'am,
I think you dropped this.

218
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,688
Vaudeville, huh?

219
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,788
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

220
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,663
If you don't kill them fast,
they kill you.

221
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,201
Mr. Denham...

222
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,226
I want you to know...

223
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,102
that I'm not in the habit of
accepting charity from strangers.

224
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,039
Or, for that matter...

225
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,667
taking things
that don't belong to me.

226
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,645
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

227
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,682
It's just that I haven't
been paid in a while.

228
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,150
That's awful. Anyway, Ann...
May I call you Ann?

229
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,623
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

230
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,186
No, no. Oh, God, no.

231
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,789
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

232
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,959
I'm not that type
of person at all.

233
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,730
What type of person are you?

234
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,772
I'm someone you can trust,
Ann. I'm a movie producer.

235
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,901
Believe me, I am on the level. No
funny business. Please sit down.

236
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,543
Please. Please.

237
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,542
Okay.

238
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,078
Ann, I want you to imagine...

239
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,817
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

240
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,189
You're filming
in the Far East?

241
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,758
Singapore.

242
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,595
On board ship,
he meets a mysterious girl.

243
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,495
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

244
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,267
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...

245
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,243
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

246
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,504
It's as if her whole life has
been a prelude to this moment...

247
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,253
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

248
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,884
And sure enough, against
her better judgment...

249
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,650
She falls in love.

250
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,420
Yes.

251
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,554
But she doesn't trust it.

252
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,700
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

253
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,160
Uh...

254
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,431
really?

255
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,971
Lf she loves someone,
it's doomed.

256
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,440
Why is that?

257
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,434
Good things never last,
Mr. Denham.

258
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,517
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.

259
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,112
Now, I don't wanna rush you, but
we are under some time pressure.

260
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,624
Well, I really...
Ann, I'm telling you...

261
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,023
you're perfect. Look at you.

262
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,085
You're the saddest girl
I've ever met.

263
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,258
You're gonna make them weep, Ann.
You're gonna break their hearts.

264
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,626
See, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Denham.

265
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,297
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.

266
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,933
Good luck with your picture.

267
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,340
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

268
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,813
I'm offering you money.

269
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,545
Adventure, fame, the thrill of a
lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

270
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,711
You want to read a script?

271
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,847
Jack Driscoll's turning in
a draft as we speak.

272
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,226
Jack Driscoll?

273
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,624
Sure. Why?

274
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,686
Wait. You know him?

275
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,325
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.

276
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,403
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

277
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,496
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

278
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,938
He said to me, "Carl...

279
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,375
"somewhere out there is a
woman born to play this role. "

280
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,845
And as soon as I saw you,
I knew.

281
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,481
Knew what?

282
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,750
It was always
going to be you.

283
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,267
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.

284
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,928
Keep the change.

285
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,772
Is this
the moving picture ship?

286
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,776
Not exactly.

287
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,278
It's actually
this one over here.

288
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,954
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.

289
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,890
Is this all of the equipment?
Yeah.

290
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,056
This is all of it?
Yeah.

291
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,724
We're taking the Bell & Howell? Yeah.

292
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,496
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.

293
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,128
Carl!
Yes!

294
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,571
Get it on board, fellows,
come on.

295
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,368
It's bad, it's bad.

296
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,345
They're on their way.
I've just had word.

297
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,541
Who?
Men in uniform.

298
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,709
The studio called the cops.

299
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,212
Englehorn! Cast off!

300
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,189
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...

301
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,317
whatever the hell it is
you do. We gotta leave!

302
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,054
I cannot do that.

303
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,396
We are waiting
on the manifest.

304
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,932
What? Who? English, please.

305
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,065
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

306
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,765
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.

307
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,273
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

308
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,506
Can we talk about this later?

309
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,410
Can't you see we're in
the company of a VIP guest?

310
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,516
Ma'am.

311
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,786
Ann Darrow.

312
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,949
So you are ready
for this voyage, Miss Darrow?

313
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,319
Sure.

314
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,458
Nervous?

315
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,001
Nervous? No.

316
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,303
Why? Should I be?

317
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,470
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

318
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,546
Why don't I show
Miss Darrow to her cabin?

319
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,415
Wonderful idea.
Thank you, Preston.

320
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,919
Miss Darrow,
if you would just...

321
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,314
Hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.

322
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,427
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?

323
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,759
Do I have a choice?

324
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,332
Please follow me.

325
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,665
If there's anything that
you... Excuse me, fellows.

326
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,638
If there's anything that you
need, please don't hesitate to ask.

327
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,491
Oh, Jesus!
Jack, you scared me.

328
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,964
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

329
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,624
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.

330
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,897
Say I stuck my head
down the toilet.

331
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,897
You want one?
No. I can't stay, Carl.

332
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,000
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

333
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,243
What's this?
It's the script.

334
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,010
This is a script?

335
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,883
Jack, this is 15 pages.

336
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,582
I know, but they're good. You've
got 15 good pages there, Carl.

337
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,648
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

338
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,126
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

339
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,220
No, Jack, you can't do this
to me. I have a beginning...

340
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,891
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.

341
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,163
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

342
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,132
All right, fine.
We might as well settle up.

343
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,010
You're gonna pay me?

344
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,013
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

345
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,015
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

346
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,917
How's $2,000 sound?

347
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,023
Sounds great.

348
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,820
I thought it might.

349
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,418
Sounds great.
Okay.

350
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,294
Raise the spring line!

351
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,957
Watch the aft!

352
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,101
And voilà.

353
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,972
Thanks.

354
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,841
You've written "two grand. "

355
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,682
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from the beginning.

356
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,457
"Two thousand dollars. "

357
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,028
It is the 29th, isn't it?

358
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,900
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.

359
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,502
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.

360
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,735
Never mind, Carl. Just
pay me when you get back.

361
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,175
All right.

362
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,651
Your cabin is the last
on the left, Mr. Baxter.

363
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,222
And may I just say how excited we
are to have you back with us, sir?

364
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,095
Be a sport and lend a
hand here, would you?

365
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,635
Excuse me. I'm trying to...
I gotta get...

366
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,433
Christ!

367
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,141
Appreciate the help, fellow.

368
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,337
Let me get the door for you.

369
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,604
Welcome to your
stateroom, sir.

370
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,213
Dead slow ahead both,
Mr. Hayes.

371
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,223
Dead slow ahead both,
Captain.

372
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,566
Oh, Christ!

373
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,376
God damn it!

374
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,223
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theater.

375
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,750
Oh, no! No!

376
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,994
You're much better off
sticking with film.

377
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,666
I don't do it
for the money, Carl.

378
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,264
I happen to love the theater.

379
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,195
No, you don't.

380
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,466
If you really loved it...

381
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,503
you would have jumped.

382
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,183
You! This is your fault!

383
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,762
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light, fresh straw.

384
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,861
Jesus. What do you keep
down here?

385
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,270
Lion, tiger, hippo,
you name it.

386
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,037
You sell them to zoos?

387
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,701
Zoo, circus.

388
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,606
Skipper get big money
for rare animal.

389
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,875
Careful. Camel have
bad accident on floor.

390
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,712
Stain unremovable.

391
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,323
Skipper catch
any wild animal you want.

392
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,291
He'll do you real good price
on white rhino.

393
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,452
Choy.

394
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,130
My apologies for not being
able to offer you a cabin.

395
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,998
Have you found an enclosure
to your taste?

396
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,535
Spoiled for choice.

397
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,336
What are you, Mr. Driscoll?
A lion?

398
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,138
Or a chimpanzee?

399
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,240
I'll take this one.

400
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,855
I told you to lock it up.

401
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,456
Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said...
Lumpy doesn't give the orders!

402
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,593
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

403
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,703
Get them out of here.

404
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,711
Compliments of the chef.
Okay.

405
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,109
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

406
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,019
Lamb's brains
in walnut sauce.

407
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,855
Jimmy.

408
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,031
You run those ropes
up on deck like I told you?

409
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,089
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

410
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,302
How about you return
Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

411
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,977
He don't mean no harm.

412
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:57,971
Thanks.

413
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,812
I'll keep him out of
your way. It's okay.

414
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,409
It's just that
he likes it down here.

415
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,081
It's where I found him
four years ago.

416
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,017
Stowed away
in one of them back cages.

417
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,728
His arm was broken
in two places.

418
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,798
He was wilder than
half the animals in here.

419
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,295
Still won't tell me
where he came from.

420
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,599
But it wasn't anyplace good.

421
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,267
You got to straighten up.

422
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,705
Jimmy.

423
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,506
You don't want to be on this
ship the rest of your life.

424
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,950
Yes, I do.
No, you don't, Jimmy.

425
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,519
You got to be smart.
Get yourself educated.

426
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,523
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

427
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,718
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.

428
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,350
I've been reading.

429
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,992
Where'd you get this?

430
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,322
I borrowed it.

431
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,771
On long-term loan.

432
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,706
Look at this. Look, look.

433
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:00,040
"Adventures on a tramp
steamer. " See? Just like us.

434
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,746
It's so nice to meet you,
Mr. Driscoll.

435
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,322
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

436
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,423
Hello, Mr. Driscoll.
It's so nice to meet you.

437
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,466
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

438
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,762
I'm a huge fan.

439
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,771
I've read everything
you've ever written.

440
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,306
No, too much.

441
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,273
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

442
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,343
Seagulls.

443
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,508
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

444
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,743
I don't care, Mike.

445
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,218
You're the sound recordist.
Make it work.

446
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,486
Ann! Come on in. Let me
introduce you to the crew.

447
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,753
This is Herb, the cameraman.

448
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,023
Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
Likewise.

449
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,258
May I say
what a lovely dress?

450
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,233
Oh, this old thing?
I just threw it on.

451
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,261
Isn't that
one of Maureen's costumes?

452
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:04,369
Now, what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast?

453
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,467
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

454
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:10,002
Fancy my porridge
à la walnuts?

455
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,747
Oh, Ann, I don't believe
you've met...

456
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,215
Ann?

457
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,855
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.

458
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,763
Thrilled to meet you. It's
an honor to be a part of this.

459
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,404
Gee, thanks.

460
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,908
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

461
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,538
Really?

462
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,405
Yes,
and what I most admire...

463
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,110
is the way you've captured
the voice of the common people.

464
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,150
Well, that's my job.

465
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,389
I'm sure you've heard
this before, Mr. Driscoll...

466
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,927
if you don't mind me
saying...

467
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:00,055
but you don't look at all
like your photograph.

468
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,898
Excuse me.
Wait a minute, Ann...

469
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,769
He's so much younger in
person. And much better-looking.

470
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,468
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

471
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,704
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

472
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:16,576
one of those
self-obsessed literary types.

473
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,480
I'm sorry, I'm not...
You know...

474
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,281
the tweedy twerp with his nose in
his book and his head up his a...

475
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,187
It's nice to meet you, too,
Miss Darrow.

476
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,473
Good Christ!

477
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,937
She's standing
at the railing.

478
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,528
She doesn't know it yet...

479
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:19,265
But they are sailing towards
disaster. You got that?

480
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,173
Okay, so she turns...

481
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,380
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

482
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,311
There's a knife
sticking out of his back.

483
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,321
Wait a sec. We're killing off
the first mate?

484
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,051
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

485
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,958
Come on, Jack.
It was an honest mistake.

486
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,588
Ann is nearsighted. It could
have happened to anyone.

487
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,256
I was joking, Carl.

488
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,631
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

489
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,465
And that's when she sees it.

490
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,008
Sees what?

491
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,371
What?

492
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,284
The island.

493
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,393
We're filming on an island
now? When did this happen?

494
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,563
Jack, keep your voice down.

495
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,626
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

496
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,227
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

497
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,330
All right.
It has a local name...

498
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,932
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

499
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,705
They call it Skull Island.

500
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,506
Did you get that?

501
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,646
What's wrong
with this place?

502
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,446
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

503
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:38,019
Because, technically, it
hasn't been discovered yet.

504
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,393
Okay. All right.

505
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,859
So we arrive at this place.

506
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,659
S...

507
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,494
K...

508
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,901
U...

509
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,099
L...

510
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,869
L...

511
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,713
Island.

512
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,114
All right, everyone,
from the top! And action!

513
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,354
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

514
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,022
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

515
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,556
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?

516
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,596
No, they're a nuisance.

517
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,333
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

518
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,673
Cut!

519
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,149
It's great.

520
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:45,517
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

521
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,491
That was very natural.
I felt moved.

522
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:52,118
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

523
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,027
It was pure effluence.

524
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,861
I beefed up the banter.

525
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,060
Try to resist that impulse.

526
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,364
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

527
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,906
What are you,
a Bolshevik or something?

528
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,168
Actors.

529
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,608
Travel the world, but all
they ever see is a mirror.

530
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,423
Good legs.

531
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,689
Sea legs.
Well, you know, sea legs.

532
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,291
Yeah.

533
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,997
Not that you don't have good
legs. Just making conversation.

534
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,370
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

535
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,867
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...

536
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,776
I know it wasn't
what you wrote...

537
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,874
but Mr. Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...

538
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,179
he must ignore her.

539
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,120
And if things turn
really hostile, then...

540
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,184
No?

541
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,987
Interesting theory.

542
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,719
I know. I should have...

543
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,093
It wasn't
what I had intended, but...

544
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,689
I'm sorry. I was...

545
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,758
And you made it your own.

546
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,226
I was nervous.

547
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,066
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

548
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,306
Please don't say
another word. Good night.

549
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,776
Miss Darrow.

550
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,613
You don't have to be nervous.

551
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,488
Thank you.

552
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,020
Let's take it...

553
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,426
Would you please... We're
trying to shoot a scene.

554
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,124
Okay.
Thank you.

555
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,658
Okay, again.

556
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,410
We're close. Turn southwest.

557
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,047
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

558
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,514
It takes us way outside
the shipping lanes.

559
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,083
I won't sail blind
in these waters.

560
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,358
I'll make it
won'th your while.

561
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,690
There's nothing out there.

562
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,835
Well,
then you've nothing to lose.

563
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,841
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore...

564
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,050
what would you say?

565
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,920
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

566
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,419
Well, we turned southwest
last night.

567
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,292
Gentlemen, please.

568
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,225
We're not looking for trouble. No.

569
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,971
You're looking
for something else.

570
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,742
Yes, we are.

571
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,779
We're going to find
Skull Island.

572
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,216
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

573
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,986
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

574
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,586
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

575
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,522
What do you mean?

576
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,858
Seven years ago, me and Mr.
Hayes were working our passage...

577
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,491
on a Norwegian bark.

578
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,401
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

579
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,503
He'd been drifting for days.

580
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,974
His ship had run aground on
an island way west of Sumatra.

581
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,502
An island hidden in fog.

582
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,546
He spoke of a huge wall...

583
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,582
built so long ago...

584
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,113
no one knew who'd made it.

585
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,258
A wall 100 foot high...

586
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,360
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

587
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,122
Why'd they build the wall?

588
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,234
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

589
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,768
neither beast nor man...

590
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,543
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

591
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,942
A lion or a tiger.

592
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,216
A man-eater. That's how
all these stories start.

593
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,084
What else did he say?

594
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,548
Nothing.

595
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,387
We found him the next morning. He'd
stuck a knife through his heart.

596
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,722
Mmm-hmm.

597
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,954
Sorry, fellows. You'll
have to do better than that.

598
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,463
Monsters belong in B movies.

599
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,559
If you find this place...

600
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,506
if you go ashore with your
friends and your cameras...

601
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,370
you won't come back.

602
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,869
Just as long as
you understand that.

603
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,593
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

604
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,432
You're writing a stage comedy?

605
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,471
I'm writing it for you.

606
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,506
Why would you do that?

607
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,311
Why would I write a play for you? Yes.

608
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,576
Isn't it obvious?

609
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,651
Not to me.

610
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,686
Well...

611
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,025
it's in the subtext.

612
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,995
I guess
I must have missed it.

613
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,903
It's not about words.

614
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,042
Message for you, Captain.

615
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,065
What's going on?

616
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,673
Hayes,
why are we changing course?

617
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,509
Englehorn, you can't just...
Outside.

618
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,179
There's a warrant out
for your arrest.

619
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,148
Did you know that?

620
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,220
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.

621
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:24,697
Another week.
I haven't got a film yet.

622
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,767
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

623
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,104
No, Denham.
You risked everything I have.

624
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,273
What do you want?

625
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,610
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

626
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,615
I want you off my ship.

627
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,677
Set a course for Rangoon,
Mr. Hayes.

628
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,762
I'm finished.

629
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,096
It's over for me, Jack.

630
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,326
How'd you think
this would end, Carl?

631
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,489
Check our position.
Use the stars.

632
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,264
There are no stars, Captain.

633
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,107
What is that?

634
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,171
What?
That.

635
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,812
That right there.

636
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,617
I don't know.
What is it? A coffee stain?

637
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,788
Station the forward lookout and
get me the depth by lead line.

638
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,559
Aye, Captain.

639
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,998
30 fathoms, no bottom!

640
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,811
Reduce speed,
steerage way only.

641
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,444
Dead slow ahead, both.

642
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,475
You should stop the ship.

643
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,651
15 degrees port.

644
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,254
We're getting out of here,
Mr. Hayes.

645
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,454
We'll find clear conditions.

646
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,654
We have seabed!

647
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,894
25 fathoms!

648
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,241
We're shallowing!

649
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,674
20 degrees starboard!

650
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,802
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

651
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,506
Get me another reading!

652
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,342
Another reading!

653
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,617
22 fathoms!

654
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,217
Douse the lights.
Aye, Captain.

655
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,638
10 fathoms!

656
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,016
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

657
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,762
Stop engines!

658
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,867
Give me some power!
Half astern both.

659
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,031
Half astern both, Captain!

660
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:42,805
Rocks!

661
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,076
Rocks!

662
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,816
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

663
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,690
To port! Rocks everywhere!

664
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,452
Take the wheel, Hayes.

665
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,840
Hang on!

666
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,668
Full ahead!

667
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,377
Rocks to port, Captain!

668
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,111
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!

669
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,831
Ah!

670
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,129
Shore up that breach!

671
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,470
Get me more men down here
now! Come on, move, move!

672
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,809
Hayes!
She's taken a pounding!

673
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,515
What about the prop?

674
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,778
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.

675
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,082
But she struck hard
against the rock!

676
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,317
Captain!

677
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,754
Better come up quick!

678
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,027
Right there!

679
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,937
Want me to bring them back?

680
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,275
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denham.

681
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,840
I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!

682
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,546
Come on, move it.

683
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,712
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

684
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,224
Can you believe this, Jack?

685
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,401
We've got our picture.

686
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,725
Why does Marlow
keep going up the river?

687
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,091
Why doesn't he turn back?

688
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,370
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.

689
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,871
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

690
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,773
But there's another part...

691
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,645
that needs to know.

692
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,721
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.

693
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,892
"We could not understand
because we were too far...

694
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,958
<i>"and could not remember...</i>

695
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,559
<i>"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages...</i>

696
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,701
<i>"of those ages
that are gone...</i>

697
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,602
<i>"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories.</i>

698
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,706
<i>"We are accustomed to look...</i>

699
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,943
<i>"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster...</i>

700
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,909
<i>"but there...</i>

701
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:29,054
<i>"there you could look at a
thing monstrous and free. "</i>

702
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,299
It's not
an adventure story...

703
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,498
is it, Mr. Hayes?

704
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,839
No, Jimmy.

705
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,343
It's not.

706
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,235
It's deserted.
Of course it's deserted.

707
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,740
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.

708
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,973
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.

709
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,343
Mr. Denham,
I think we should go back.

710
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,150
I will handle this.

711
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,222
Look. Chocolate.

712
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,194
You like chocolate?

713
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,663
It's good to eat.

714
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,268
You want?

715
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,508
Take it.

716
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,622
Here, put it in your hand
and take it.

717
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,132
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

718
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,498
She doesn't want
the chocolate.

719
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:29,699
Aah!

720
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,093
All right!

721
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,954
Just a bunch of women
and old folks!

722
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,394
They're harmless!

723
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,175
Ann!

724
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:50,764
Jack.

725
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,386
Seen enough?

726
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,891
Lighten the ship!

727
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,062
Anything that's not
bolted down goes overboard!

728
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,895
Just heave it!

729
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,668
We got away.

730
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,471
We gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.

731
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:31,309
What about Mike? He didn't
get away! He's still there!

732
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:35,313
Mike died doing what he believed
in! He didn't die for nothing.

733
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:39,445
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm gonna finish this film for Mike!

734
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,522
I'll finish it...

735
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,730
and I'll donate
the proceeds...

736
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,232
to his wife and kids.

737
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:58,231
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

738
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,440
Hear, hear!

739
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,348
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!

740
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,722
What's wrong now?
Excuse me, Shakespeare.

741
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,592
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

742
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,241
Drop those spare cables
overboard! Go on, just chuck it!

743
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,821
Where's Ann?
What?

744
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,056
Where's Ann?

745
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,425
Ann!

746
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,554
She's free!

747
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,492
Full ahead, both engines!

748
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,207
Ann!

749
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:38,699
No! Stop! Turn back!

750
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,264
Stop!

751
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,969
We have to turn back.

752
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:46,835
They've taken Ann.

753
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:02,349
Kong! Kong! Kong!

754
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:48,435
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!

755
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,173
Jump to it!
Jump to it, gentlemen!

756
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,574
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

757
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:06,650
Come on, move it!

758
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,333
Pull harder!

759
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,575
Row! Row!

760
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,972
Come on!

761
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:17,918
Kong.

762
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,099
Spread out! Find her!

763
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,278
Miss Darrow!

764
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:55,279
Check up there, Jimmy!
Everybody stay together!

765
01:10:58,721 --> 01:10:59,745
Ann!

766
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,653
She's here somewhere!

767
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,195
What in God's name was that?

768
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,164
Behind the wall!

769
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,499
Behind the wall!

770
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,526
She's gone!

771
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,269
Carl, what is it?

772
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:34,576
You saw something.

773
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,555
You can take Hayes
and 15 others.

774
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,024
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.

775
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,588
The rest of you
stay with the ship.

776
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,791
Choy!

777
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,127
Not you, Jimmy.

778
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:57,364
Come on, Mr. Hayes.
Look at them.

779
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,202
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

780
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:00,605
Stay here.

781
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,578
Miss Darrow needs me!
No!

782
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,816
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.

783
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,320
You wanna go
with the 6-inch lens?

784
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,189
The wide-angle
will do just fine.
