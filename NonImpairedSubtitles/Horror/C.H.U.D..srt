to leave one, wait for the beep.'

(Phone beeps)

8
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,226
George, this is Derek.

9
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,684
Hi, Derek.

10
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,726
'Look, George, I know you're there.
You're just not answering the phone.'

11
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,267
You're smart, Derek.

12
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:54,559
'George, this is really important
so I'm asking you as a personal favor,

13
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,601
'please, just pick up the phone
and talk to me, okay?'

14
00:03:57,685 --> 00:04:00,101
Okay, Derek.

15
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:01,601
- 'All right, George, listen.'
- All right, Derek.

16
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:04,476
'Our deadline on the follow-up
article this Friday. That's tomorrow.

Have you found her brother?

what they are. What do you say?'

24
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:25,851
All right, Derek,
you made your point.

25
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,351
(Lauren) Hey, George?

26
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:35,392
- Yes?
- Who was that?

27
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:37,934
Uh, that was a wrong number.

28
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:40,059
Wrong number left a message?

29
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:43,892
You'd better start getting ready.

30
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:45,851
Ready for what?

31
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,267
For what?
We have a photo session.

32
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,351
What photo session?

33
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:54,184
Wait a minute. You are talking about
a photo session that I have today?

34
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:57,934
This is today we're talking about, with
the client, Tony and everybody there?

35
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:00,351
- What are you doing?
- I have a pimple.

36
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:01,976
Why are you putting makeup
on your ass?

37
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,392
(Chuckling)
'Cause it's where the pimple is.

38
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:09,267
And what are we shooting,
a centerfold?

39
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,851
It's a perfume ad, remember?

40
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,476
And what are you wearing
in this perfume ad?

41
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,601
- Perfume.
- Whoa! That's it?

42
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:19,017
- That's all you're wearing?
- (Chuckling) Yeah.

43
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:19,934
Great.

44
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:23,642
I don't ever remember agreeing to this.
You know what I'm saying?

45
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,642
This is some more
of that plastic fashion crap

46
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,559
that I told you
I didn't want to do anymore?

47
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:31,601
Was I drunk?

48
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:33,434
Were we making love?

49
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:35,351
Come on,
let's forget about this

50
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:40,267
and stay here and,
you know, make stuff up.

51
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:43,101
It's at 10:00.
Alderson Studios.

52
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:45,767
We're booked. You're shooting.

53
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:50,101
Come on, don't make me do this.
I've been up all night.

54
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:52,267
You know which box
my jewelry case is in?

55
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,101
It's still down in the basement.

56
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:59,226
Wait, wait. You brought up
all your camera stuff

57
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,351
and left my things in the basement?
My... My jewelry?

58
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:04,392
Don't you think
you better get it?

59
00:06:04,477 --> 00:06:06,517
(Phone ringing)

60
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:08,767
Hello?

61
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:09,934
Oh.

62
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:12,392
Hi, Derek, it's good
to hear your voice.

63
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:23,059
- Hi!
- Hi.

64
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,809
Are you the people
who are subletting Morton's studio?

65
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:29,101
- Yeah.
- Uh, to live in?

66
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:30,559
Yeah, we're improvising.

67
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:33,601
Well, if you need anything,
I'm Francine. This is Justin.

68
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,892
- I'm Lauren. Hi.
- You're a photographer, too?

69
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:38,142
I'm the model.
George is the photographer.

70
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:41,184
(Chuckles) I gotta go.
I roped him into doing a fashion shoot.

71
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,517
Good luck.

72
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,392
Thanks!

73
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:51,934
Shit.

74
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,934
No, I can't use the outs
from the old... (Sighs)

75
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:08,142
That's not the point, Derek!
The point is I don't want to.

76
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,267
I want new photographs
for a new article.

77
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:13,101
And I can't find the people that
I got to take pictures of. They're...

78
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:15,351
I don't know where they are!

79
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,101
I don't know, Derek.
What do bums do on their day off?

80
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:21,434
That's funny.
Did you make that up?

81
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:23,059
Not... No.

82
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,559
Not today either.
I can't help you today.

83
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,809
I cannot do
anything today! Why?

84
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:29,559
Because today
I'm gonna shoot Lauren.

85
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:31,434
Okay? Goodbye!

86
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:42,476
(Indistinct clattering)

87
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:58,392
(Indistinct growling)

88
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:32,434
(Screams)

89
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:37,434
(Eerie music)

90
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,684
Tuesday. Hey, boss.

91
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:52,684
This one's got your name on it.

92
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:55,434
(Phone ringing)

93
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:03,184
Hays, get on the stolen car ring.

94
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,559
- What about the Kirby case?
- This is more important.

95
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:09,642
Than a potential homicide?

96
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:12,101
Kirby isn't a homicide,
he's a missing person.

97
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,517
I can't tie up the whole force

98
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:16,726
just because some guy decided
to walk out on his wife.

99
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,059
This is the fourth time the guy's walked
out on his wife in the last two weeks.

100
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,142
- What'd you turn up on the others?
- Nothing, but...

101
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,934
Right, nothing.
So they're filed under missing persons.

102
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:27,226
Now, if they turn up
great, fine. I'm delighted.

103
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,767
But I can't waste
any more time on this.

104
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:31,434
- But, Captain, you're not...
- Hays, look.

105
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:33,976
I don't wanna bore you
with crime statistics,

106
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,809
but, uh, between you and me,
they're not going down.

107
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:41,267
Now, file Kirby under missing persons
and get on with it.

108
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:46,101
Yes, sir.

109
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:52,309
(Dialing)

110
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:59,517
Uh, Chief O'Brien, please.
This is Captain Bosch.

111
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:02,767
All right, I'll take it.

112
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,101
- O'Brien.
- Chief, this is Bosch.

113
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,934
Look, I can't keep a lid
on this any longer.

114
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:12,476
- You've got to.
- You don't understand, I can't.

115
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,601
- 'No.'
- Chief!

116
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:16,392
- It's not my decision.
- I know that, but...

117
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:19,851
Well, if you know that, then you know
there's nothing I can do about it.

118
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:22,976
You've got your orders, Bosch,
now carry them out.

119
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,392
- (Clicks)
- (Call disconnects)

120
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:33,142
- Sanderson?
- Yes, sir.

121
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,309
Sanderson, uh...

122
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,726
Run down the blotter.
Give me everything we've got

123
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,392
in the vicinity
of Lafayette Street.

124
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:42,559
Yes, sir.

125
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,267
Hey, Bosch! What's happening?

126
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:50,142
Nothing for you today... Murph.

127
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:52,434
Nothing, huh?
You know, you cops will never learn.

128
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,809
I said nothing, Murphy.

129
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:57,476
That's a dead giveaway.
Now, I know something's wrong.

130
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,101
You see, if you guys are smart,
what you do is,

131
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:03,434
you palm me off
a little tidbit of information.

132
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:05,767
That way I'd never know
the difference.

133
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:08,892
Okay. I'll let you in on it.

134
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:12,184
I'm about to interrogate
a bag lady

135
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:15,767
we just nabbed
on the charge of petty theft.

136
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:19,059
Not bad...
Not bad, Bosch.

137
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,601
All right. What we got here?

138
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:30,017
She tried to lift my gun.
I nabbed her.

139
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:32,434
All by yourself?

140
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:35,601
This happened
at Lafayette and Houston?

141
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:37,476
- Yeah.
- What's her story?

142
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,226
(Officer) Who knows? She won't talk.

143
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,184
- You let her make a phone call?
- Who, her?

144
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:46,601
She's entitled to one call.
Let her make it.

145
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,351
(George) Terrific. Wonderful.
You look great.

146
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:53,809
You look like a million bucks.
You got a date later on tonight?

147
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:56,226
Give a smile, huh?
Hey, thank you. Come on.

148
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,934
Whoa, what style, what content!

149
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,309
Oh, what art! Oh, my God!
I love this profession!

150
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:03,351
Tony, give me two more stops
on that backlight.

151
00:12:04,227 --> 00:12:05,642
(Exhales)

152
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:07,726
Is this what it's gonna be all day?
All tits and ass,

153
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,392
ass and tits, sell some perfume.
Whose idea was this anyway?

154
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:14,559
What genius came up with this concept
to sell this perfume today?

155
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,434
You wanna blow this job for me?

156
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,517
What's the matter?
Am I making you nervous?

157
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:21,392
Yeah. This is my first chance
for national exposure.

158
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:22,892
- Well...
- You're making...

159
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,309
Very well put.

160
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,559
Are you upset
because I'm posing nude?

161
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:29,767
No, I'm not, Lauren.
Posing nude comes with the territory.

162
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:32,434
I'm upset because these people
are using your body

163
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,517
and draping it with the carcass
of some helpless, little field mouse

164
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:38,601
to sell some worthless perfume
which probably smells like sheep shit!

165
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:40,851
What are you shushing me for?
They know it! They made it!

166
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:42,976
They know what's in it
and what it takes to sell it!

167
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,642
Stop it!

168
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,059
(Sighs) I'm sorry, okay?

169
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:54,309
I forgot what all wondrous fun
this was for me.

170
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:56,517
It's a goof, it's a joke.

171
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,601
It doesn't matter.
You don't care about them.

172
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,267
You're doing this for me.

173
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:04,434
We're gonna bamboozle these guys
for big bucks and go home.

174
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,684
Okay?

175
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:09,476
(Whispers) Okay.

176
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,434
- Okay.
- (Sighs) I'll be back.

177
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,309
(Feedback)

178
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:34,767
(Derek on answering machine)
'George, this is Derek.

179
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,642

a nervous breakdown.

I'll fudge it to fit them.'

this is Dr. Bremner's office.

'You think I wanna talk to some
goddamn fucking machine?'

188
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,226
Is that all we got
from Lafayette Street?

189
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,767
- It's all the arrests.
- You got something else?

190
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:12,976
Well, I got this,
uh, missing persons report.

191
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,142
A what?
Why didn't you tell me?

192
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,934
''A.J. Shepherd.''

193
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,309
I wonder if that's the guy
I busted five years ago.

194
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,309
- It's not an official report.
- Then what is it?

195
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:27,767
It's a little strange.

196
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:37,684
Here you go.

197
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,059
Here you go.

198
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:45,767
Okay.

199
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,517
There you go.
I'm sorry I can't bring you more.

200
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:54,351
- Well, well, A.J. Shepherd.
- Bosch! What are you doing here?

201
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,934
- You called my precinct.
- What is this, some kind of bad joke?

202
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,267
Yeah.

203
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:00,976
So, what's this all about?

204
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,392
- (Woman) Reverend?
- Yeah?

205
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:05,767
Would you come here a minute?

206
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,809
What is it, Doris?

207
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,392
Reverend, I have
a present for you.

208
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,767
Oh, oh.

209
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:17,101
- Hey, look at that!
- (Chuckles)

210
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:19,892
- So, you're a reverend now, huh?
- Save it, Bosch.

211
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,101
(Bosch) Now, what kind of scam
you're running here?

212
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:24,226
- Look, Lieutenant...
- Captain.

213
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,184
- Oh, you're a captain now?
- You got it.

214
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:27,726
Well, look, Captain,

215
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,684
I didn't call up your precinct
so they would send you down here

216
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:32,892
to hear your two-bit opinion
of my life, all right?

217
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:36,142
Look, just get to the point, Shepherd.
What's this about missing persons?

218
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,976
Oh, Jesus! Would you just
chill out? Please?

219
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:43,851
- It's my family.
- Family?

220
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:47,017
You mean,
your flock, congregation?

221
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:51,059
My regulars. My people here.
You wanna hear this or not?

222
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,601
(Sighs) Shoot.

223
00:15:57,685 --> 00:16:00,851
I've been looking all over
for these people. I can't find 'em.

224
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:03,351
- Where do you think they'd be?
- Some of them are street people.

225
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:05,184
They're probably out
on the street somewhere,

226
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,267
but I got undergrounders here,
people who live underground.

227
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:09,351
I know that people
live underground. So what?

228
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,434
So that's the people
that are missing.

229
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:15,517
Look, in my cellar
I got a hole broken through the wall.

230
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,934
That hooks up
with an old sewer system down there.

231
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,392
It's a regular labyrinth
of tunnels and caves.

232
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:24,226
That's where these people live.
Ten, twelve of my regulars.

233
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:27,767
They come up here
for soup every day.

234
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:30,017
Those are the people
that disappeared.

235
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,017
- All of them?
- Yeah, all of them,

236
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:35,684
but it's just my underground people.
You understand that?

237
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,767
Since when?

238
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:41,267
It's been almost
two weeks now.

239
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,642
You haven't seen any of them
for two weeks?

240
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:48,476
- No.
- One guy, Val.

241
00:16:56,685 --> 00:17:00,726
Now, you watch your step, Bosch.
Remember, you don't belong here.

242
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:08,809
Gog and Magog.

243
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:14,476
Yeah, well, uh...

244
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,017
Val, I understand
you used to live underground.

245
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:20,767
What made you
change your mind?

246
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:25,142
On each side of the throne
there are four living creatures

247
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:28,892
filled with eyes
in front and behind!

248
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:31,851
Creatures?

249
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,767
You're talking
about your friends?

250
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,976
Are they still down there?

251
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:45,184
I know your work.

252
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:49,767
You go by the name
of being alive!

253
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:51,892
And you are dead!

254
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,767
- Now, listen, pal.
- (Screams)

255
00:17:58,018 --> 00:18:00,809
They have the power

256
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:03,517
to shut the sky!

257
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:08,767
They have the power

258
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,351
to shut the sky.

259
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:15,809
Where the hell
did he get a knife like that?

260
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:18,226
All the undergrounders
are looking for weapons now, man.

261
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,809
Guns and knives.
I told you to be careful.

262
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:27,934
Don't be scared.
Where are you goin', man?

263
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:30,976
- I've gotta go check in.
- Check in?

264
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,517
Hey, Bosch!
Who are you callin'?

265
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:48,851
No. How do I know
you didn't take something.

266
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:52,434
How do I know
you didn't give us anything?

267
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:58,976
You have any idea
why she'd take my gun?

268
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,226
Not any good ones.

269
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:05,392
- Where you know her from anyway?
- Just around the neighborhood.

270
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,892
Do you go to movies together?
Is she your steady date?

271
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:11,851
- Get the hell out here.
- Yes, of course.

272
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:14,059
You ready, honey?

273
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:19,851
- I got him.
- Stay on him.

274
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:28,267
Pigs! Suck a duck!

275
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,351
Hey, Jackson,
they finally let you off the desk, huh?

276
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,934
- Hi, Murph.
- (Murphy) What's happened?

277
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:38,517
(Jackson) Nothing going on.
Same old shit, Murphy.

278
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:40,767
Nothing, huh?
Sounds interesting.

279
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:43,309
Listen, Murphy,
I'm really busy.

280
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:46,976
Yeah, it's not surprising
what with nothing going on, I mean.

281
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:53,392
You walked up behind a cop
and took his gun?

282
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:56,767
- I tried.
- What do you want with a gun?

283
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:58,934
It's not for me,
it's for Victor.

284
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:02,767
- Have you got a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.

285
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:05,476
You have any bandages?

286
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,809
Yeah.

287
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:49,601
Forget it, Bosch.
I lost him.

288
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,392
(Indistinct speech)

289
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:36,142
- Really, you're going through here?
- Yeah.

290
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,851
I don't know why you two couldn't
just live in a big cardboard box

291
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,892
- like everybody else.
- (Mrs. Monroe laughs)

292
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:57,226
Here, take this bag.

293
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:04,851
Are you leaving
little breadcrumbs behind

294
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:07,226
- so we can find our way out of here?
- (Laughs)

295
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,184
- Come on.
- We gotta go through here?

296
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:10,892
Come on!

297
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:13,351
I'm gonna get all dirty.

298
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:16,101
I'm coming, I'm coming.

299
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,892
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Blood!

300
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:30,142
What the hell!
Why is everybody so afraid?

301
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,892
- Come on.
- What the hell is going on?

302
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,726
- Come on!
- What...

303
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:40,142
(Sighs)

304
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:43,184
You know, Mrs. M,
there's a whole lot you're not telling me.

305
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:44,892
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, look...

306
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:47,934
Let's start at the beginning.
Why the hell does Victor need a gun?

307
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,726
He needs it,
he says he needs it.

308
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,517
- Yeah, great answer...
- Up here.

309
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:54,726
- We're gonna go up here?
- Yup. Come on.

310
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,476
- You afraid of heights?
- No.

311
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,476
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Come on!

312
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,476
- Whoa!
- Hugo!

313
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,809
That's the man
who took your picture.

314
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:10,059
You don't remember him?

315
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,642
Sure, you do.

316
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,517
Okay, come on.

317
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,351
Oh, my god, what the hell
happened to him?

318
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,267
Did you get it?

319
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:33,559
- Did you get the gun?
- No.

320
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:35,351
I got some bandages.

321
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:36,309
(Groans)

322
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:39,476
I don't need no bandages.
I need a gun.

323
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,142
What do you want
a gun for, Victor?

324
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:45,476
Shoot...
Shoot them.

325
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,351
- Shoot who?
- Ugly fuckers.

326
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:50,476
What ugly fuckers?

327
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,601
Mean, ugly fucker
that comes around here.

328
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:56,142
- What's he talkin' about?
- He's sick!

329
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,476
Can't you see he's wounded?

330
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,059
Right, Victor...

331
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:03,017
Do you remember me,
George Cooper?

332
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:06,226
I don't know if you remember, but...
We ought to get this cleaned up.

333
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,351
Maybe put a new bandage on it,
maybe get you to a hospital.

334
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:10,809
- I don't need any hospital!
- Hugo!

335
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:13,267
Don't you hurt him.

336
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,726
Don't hurt him.

337
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,767
He's gonna help us.

338
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:28,642
(Whimpering)

339
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,809
(Sudden eerie sound)

340
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:43,642
(Bosch) 'A bag lady
tried to steal a gun.

341
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,726
'The guy who bailed her out
is George Cooper.

342
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,934
'He shot an article on the people
down there. I have a copy of it right here.'

343
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:51,892
This article doesn't identify
any of the people in these pictures.

344
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:53,851
I thought maybe, you could.

345
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:56,059
Why don't you ask
the photographer?

346
00:24:56,143 --> 00:24:59,642
Frankly, I can't decide
whether to talk to him or tail him.

347
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:03,101
It's a buck dancer's choice,
my friend.

348
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:05,267
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it?

349
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:07,184
I don't get...
I don't get you, brother.

350
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:09,476
You run in and out of here
like the fucking Mad Hatter...

351
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,559
You don't even know what you're looking
for, Bosch! You make me nervous.

352
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:14,517
I just want to know
if you know any of these people.

353
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:17,892
Why do you want to know them?
What's the motivation here, Captain?

354
00:25:17,977 --> 00:25:19,601
Puttin' in so much of your time

355
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,351
to help me track down
a few undergrounders? Come on!

356
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:24,851
Alright, there are other people
missing as well.

357
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:28,392
Aha.
Who? Important people?

358
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:32,184
Your call wasn't
the only one we got.

359
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:34,267
We've had several
missing persons reports

360
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:36,351
from this neighborhood
in the last two weeks.

361
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,267
- Still doesn't wash, Bosch.
- Look, am I wasting my time...?

362
00:25:39,352 --> 00:25:41,559
Hey, I put in a call...
A missing persons complaint...

363
00:25:41,643 --> 00:25:45,059
I get a police captain
coming down here twice, in one day.

364
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,309
Fishy, fishy.

365
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:49,976
Is everybody getting scared?

366
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:53,309
You tell me who's missing, Bosch.

367
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:57,142
We lose the mayor down there?
Or the president?

368
00:25:57,227 --> 00:26:00,517
- Or your mom disappear?
- My wife.

369
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:03,892
Alright?

370
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:09,934
Alright.

371
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,392
Why didn't you tell me this?

372
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,892
Look, I'm really sorry.

373
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:26,601
When did it happen?

374
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,392
Late last night.

375
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:34,392
She must've gone out
to walk the dog.

376
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:37,226
Hey, do you live around here?

377
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,851
Couple of blocks over.

378
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:44,684
Look, Bosch.
You gotta be straight with me.

379
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:58,226
This lady's name is
Mrs. Monroe.

380
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,226
She doesn't live down here,
her brother lives down here.

381
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,851
- Hey, wait, this is him. That's him.
- Victor. That's his buddy, Hugo.

382
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:06,726
They're undergrounders.

383
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,142
God...

384
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:10,976
George Cooper.

385
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,017
I don't know him,
but I've seen him around.

386
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,601
Okay?

387
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,892
Does that help you any?

388
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:22,601
Maybe.

389
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:28,142
Alright.

390
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:29,892
Your turn.

391
00:27:29,977 --> 00:27:32,309
You tell me somethin'.

392
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:33,809
What?

393
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:36,142
About the EPA probe.

394
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:40,559
- What about it?
- You tell me.

395
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:45,434
It's a routine inspection
of the subways and sewers.

396
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:48,017
It happens every year.
How do you know about it?

397
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:50,809
I always know
when that probe's going on.

398
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:53,226
My customers
start gettin' jumpy.

399
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:57,059
Those clowns, they go down
there in their space suits.

400
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,976
They scare everybody
out of there.

401
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,267
- It's usually over in a week, right?
- So?

402
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:05,059
So, this year
it's been going on for four weeks.

403
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:08,226
It's still going on.
Didn't you know that?

404
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:27,142
Come on.

405
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:32,934
The week after everybody
disappeared,

406
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:34,976
I called the Environmental
Protection Agency.

407
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,184
- I asked 'em what was going on.
- What'd they say?

408
00:28:37,268 --> 00:28:39,351
They said nothing's going on.

409
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:41,434
They said the probe
was over for three weeks,

410
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:43,351
that no one had been
down there since.

411
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,142
Why would they lie about it?

412
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:47,392
God, you don't have a clue,
do you, Sherlock?

413
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,476
(Groans) This ain't no disco.

414
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:54,351
There's all sorts of shit
down there.

415
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:57,476
Hey, let me show you
some of the stuff I found.

416
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:04,392
Check this out.

417
00:29:05,268 --> 00:29:07,684
Huh? You like?

418
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:12,142
Okay. Look at this.

419
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:15,267
N-R-C. You know what this is?

420
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:17,601
This thing detects
accumulated radiation,

421
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:20,226
they wear these things
in nuclear power plants.

422
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,142
How do you know that?

423
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,601
I used to be
a nuclear physicist.

424
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:27,559
(Chuckles) I saw it on TV.

425
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,142
Alright.

426
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,892
Let's go.

427
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,851
(A.J.) So, anyway, this stuff
made me very curious.

428
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:39,476
I called up the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.

429
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,601
Tell them that I wanted to return some
of their stolen property that I'd found.

430
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:46,559
- Mm-hm.
- The guy on the phone got nervous.

431
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,184
Started you know...

432
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:51,142
Passing me on to people...
Passing me on to two other droids.

433
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:53,892
Nobody wanted to come up
with any explanations to me.

434
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:57,351
But they were insistent on knowing
who I was, who I talked to...

435
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:59,267
- Where I'd been.
- Yeah, I get the point.

436
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:01,017
Yeah, good.

437
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:03,226
Here, hold this.

438
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,476
- You're going down there?
- Yup.

439
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,642
- What the hell's this food about?
- Oh, I left that for the shy ones.

440
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:12,101
It's a scary world up there.

441
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:15,809
Looks like they lost
their appetite.

442
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:23,309
Ugh. Smells great down here.

443
00:30:23,393 --> 00:30:25,476
Hey. Whoa.

444
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:29,267
- What is it?
- Looks like a Geiger counter.

445
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:31,642
I told you there was
something going on.

446
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:33,809
Well, let's see.

447
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:37,559
(Geiger counter clicking)

448
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,434
(Starts beeping loudly)

449
00:30:55,893 --> 00:30:57,934
What the hell was that?

450
00:30:58,018 --> 00:30:59,809
(Roaring)

451
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,934
- Hi.
- Can we talk now?

452
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:12,642
- I uh...
- George, sit down.

453
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:15,892
I gotta develop some photographs
and get them over to Derek's. I gotta.

454
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:17,892
I'm pregnant.

455
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:23,101
Oh, on second thought,
maybe Derek can wait a while.

456
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:27,767
Dr. Bremner called
this afternoon, it's official.

457
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,684
I'm pregnant.

458
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,101
- You're going to have a baby?
- Hm.

459
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,226
(Both laugh nervously)

460
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,892
That is one of the side effects
of being pregnant.

461
00:31:41,977 --> 00:31:44,767
There are alternatives.

462
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:48,267
Dr. Bremner wanted to know
if I was interested in, uh...

463
00:31:48,352 --> 00:31:50,351
The alternative.

464
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:52,559
What'd you say?

465
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:55,101
I told him I'd let him know.

466
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:59,976
- Are you interested in an alternative?
- I don't know.

467
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,142
I'm sitting here, trying to think
if it's fair to bring a child into the world

468
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:06,809
who's gonna have a zombie father
that won't talk to anybody.

469
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:08,642
Me?

470
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,726
(Laughing) Yeah.

471
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:14,809
Lauren, do you...
Do you wanna have a kid?

472
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,809
I don't know!

473
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:21,392
I'm thinking about everything, you know,
that I never thought about doing...

474
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:24,059
- Gone.
- Not necessarily.

475
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,642
Do you want me to have a kid?

476
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:30,392
I'll support
whatever decision you make.

477
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:32,226
But I think
that it's gotta be your decision.

478
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,642
I don't believe it. You're not going
to tell me if you want me to have a kid?

479
00:32:35,727 --> 00:32:39,392
Look, it's not fair! It's your body,
it's your career, all that stuff.

480
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:41,392
And... Our baby.

481
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:45,059
If I said that I wanted to have it,
would you want to have it?

482
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:49,642
- Yeah.
- Alright.

483
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:51,559
We're having a kid.

484
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:53,392
(Both laugh)

485
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:03,434
(Phone rings)

486
00:33:10,102 --> 00:33:12,976
George and Lauren aren't in
right now, but if you want to,

487
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,142
leave a message
when you hear the beep.

488
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,726
- Beep.
- (Lauren laughs)

489
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,934
(Derek) 'Look, George, I'm trying
to maintain my sense of humor.

490
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:24,809
'But you said you'd be here two hours
ago. Was that a joke? Please tell me.

491
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:27,559
'I'd like to laugh too.'

492
00:33:33,977 --> 00:33:36,351
(Man) Crosby and Spring.

493
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:39,184
I think it is.
Look both ways.

494
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:45,476
Before any cars come,
nothing's coming, remember that?

495
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,142
Honey, I want to go
into this phone booth and...

496
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,976
We'll have to wake Uncle Art.

497
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,267
And find out where we're going.
Come on in, dear.

498
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:57,976
And close the door.

499
00:34:02,018 --> 00:34:04,684
Just wait a minute, hon.
Stay there.

500
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:07,017
(Suspenseful music)

501
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:13,642
(Dialing) 6-7...

502
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:15,809
3...

503
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:24,976
Art...

504
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,184
Art, I'm sorry to wake you,
I'm sorry to wake you.

505
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,684
Yeah, yeah, we're here.
We're here.

506
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:35,809
Uh, but uh... We got on
the subway downtown, but...

507
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:38,559
We're lost, Art.
We're lost...

508
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,351
(C.H.U.D. growling)

509
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:16,809
- What's going on?
- We have a kid who's hysterical.

510
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:18,601
She's makin' up a story.

511
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:21,017
- What makes you think it's a story?
- What? Are you kidding?

512
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:25,351
She says some monster came out
of the sewer and ate her grandfather.

513
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:34,642
Sanderson, get me
Chief O'Brien.

514
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:36,934
- Sir...
- Just get him.

515
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,976
Jackson. Post men
on all the street corners

516
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,267
within a 10 block radius
of Lafayette and Spring.

517
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:44,351
At least two men per corner.

518
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,934
- All of them?
- All of them.

519
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:48,642
Pull them off other precincts,
if you have to.

520
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:51,392
Then cover the subways.
At least four men per station.

521
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:53,851
Put out an APB on Flora Bosch.

522
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:57,059
- Your wife?
- Sir, I've got O'Brien.

523
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:03,059
O'Brien?
You call the Commissioner's office

524
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:05,101
and tell him we're coming
there at 12 o'clock sharp.

525
00:36:05,185 --> 00:36:07,684
'Oh, and uh...
Tell him to have someone

526
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:10,351
'from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission with him.

527
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,976
Are you crazy, Bosch?

528
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,684
- 'I can't tell him that.'
- You tell him.

529
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:17,767
'And tell him if he's not there,
he can pick up the afternoon papers

530
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:21,142
'and read all about his involvement
in the NRC cover-up.'

531
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,476
Hey, Bosch, can't get enough, huh?

532
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,309
You got it, Rev. Come on, grab
your evidence. You're coming with me.

533
00:36:31,393 --> 00:36:34,976
- Where are you going?
- We got a date downtown.

534
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:41,392
What do we need
this guy for, anyway?

535
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:45,809
Are you kidding? I accused the goddamn
Commissioner of a cover-up.

536
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:51,059
- You got me.
- Yeah.

537
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:52,767
I got you.

538
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:56,017
And a six year old kid
who thinks she saw a monster.

539
00:36:56,102 --> 00:36:58,059
If this guy doesn't have
somethin' solid, I'm through.

540
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:01,351
- Hey, Cooper. Open up!
- He's not there.

541
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:04,101
What do you wanna do?

542
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:06,809
Well, we gotta
get in there, somehow.

543
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:17,267
Hey, that's breaking and entering.
You're...

544
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:19,351
...under arrest, Shepherd.

545
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:30,601
(Bosch) Hey, this is your friend
from the magazine, isn't it?

546
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:32,851
That's Victor, yeah.

547
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:36,017
- What the... What's this?
- It's his leg.

548
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:38,809
(A.J.) Oh, my god...

549
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:41,017
(Bosch) Holy shit.

550
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:45,434
Gentlemen, may I present Mr. Wilson
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,

551
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:48,809
Chief O'Brien,
Captain Bosch, and uh...

552
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,434
A.J.

553
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:53,059
And Mr. A.J.

554
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:55,267
Alright, Captain.

555
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,726
I guess, this is your meeting.

556
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,059
It'd better be good.

557
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:05,684
As you all know...

558
00:38:05,768 --> 00:38:09,351
I've recently been ordered to ignore
what amounts to, uh...

559
00:38:09,435 --> 00:38:13,267
An alarming number
of disappearances in my precinct.

560
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:16,601
We're all here right now,
because...

561
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,101
I can't do that anymore.

562
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:21,476
For one thing,
I have reason to believe

563
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,559
that a number of these people
have been murdered.

564
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:27,726
And I believe that these murders are
somehow connected to the probe

565
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,142
that's going on underneath the streets
of this city at this very moment.

566
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,017
Nonsense, Bosch.

567
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,642
Look, we're as concerned about
those disappearances as you are.

568
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:38,767
But there's no evidence of murder.

569
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:42,601
And as to any connection
with the underground... Preposterous.

570
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:45,392
It's hot down there,
Commissioner.

571
00:38:45,477 --> 00:38:48,476
Don't tell me the NRC
doesn't know about that.

572
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,434
Mr. Wilson.

573
00:38:52,435 --> 00:38:55,434
Is this why I was invited
to this meeting?

574
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,934
Who is this man?

575
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:06,517
I went to this man's
soup kitchen last night...

576
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:07,892
(Sarcastic) Soup kitchen!

577
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:10,184
Because he reported
12 people missing.

578
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:15,017
And he took me down where these
people used to live, underground.

579
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,101
And that's where we found
this Geiger counter.

580
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:21,559
Granted, that doesn't necessarily
implicate you, sir.

581
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:23,892
But let me tell you what happened.

582
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:28,392
We turned it on, it was still working,
and it began to surge.

583
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:30,309
We were standing still.

584
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:32,392
But this thing went
as high as it could go.

585
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:34,392
It lit up like a god damn
Christmas tree!

586
00:39:34,477 --> 00:39:36,476
Then it eased right back down to normal,

587
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,851
like something hot
was moving down there.

588
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,601
Nonsense, Bosch.

589
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:42,559
Quite often, there's a, uh...

590
00:39:42,643 --> 00:39:45,642
Surge when you turn those things on,
it's a typical equipment malfunction.

591
00:39:45,727 --> 00:39:47,392
It doesn't mean a thing.

592
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:49,726
(Bosch) What about all the stuff
we found down there?

593
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,101
I can't be held responsible for everything
that washes up in the sewer.

594
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:58,601
Anything else?

595
00:39:58,685 --> 00:40:01,017
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

596
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:03,017
A young girl saw something.

597
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:06,809
She said it was a monster. Dragged
her grandfather down into the sewers.

598
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:11,517
Do you have anything else?

599
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:13,351
That's what I thought.

600
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:15,476
Forget this!

601
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,684
Wasting my time here.

602
00:40:17,768 --> 00:40:20,601
You guys wouldn't know the truth
if it came up and bit you!

603
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:23,017
I'll take my pictures
somewhere else.

604
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:25,476
Pictures?

605
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,934
Yeah. I took a camera down there,
I took some pictures.

606
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:31,476
But you guys
wouldn't be interested.

607
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,309
Well, you want to see 'em?

608
00:40:33,393 --> 00:40:34,934
Do you?

609
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,892
Well, I'll...
I'll show you one.

610
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:42,184
This is a picture of a man
that saw a monster.

611
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:47,851
Here's a picture of a bite
taken out of his leg.

612
00:40:47,935 --> 00:40:51,351
Does that look like anything
you've ever seen before?

613
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:54,434
Here's a close-up of it.

614
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,934
Maybe you have
some glib explanation for that!

615
00:40:58,352 --> 00:41:00,684
Now, do you wanna talk
about this?

616
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:03,851
Or should I go discuss this
with the newspapers?

617
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,434
I was just thinking...

618
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:14,017
Uh-oh. What were you
just thinking?

619
00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:16,726
If we're gonna have a kid,
where are we going to live?

620
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,226
I thought that was settled.
We sell your father's house,

621
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,351
- we get a place of our own.
- Yeah, but I was thinking

622
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:24,851
why sell one place to live in,
just to get another?

623
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:26,976
- Wow.
- It's a nice house.

624
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,809
It'd be a nice place
for a kid growing up.

625
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:32,642
Yeah, but it's in the suburbs.

626
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:35,309
- Oh, no.
- Safe.

627
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,767
I hate to think of our kids
growing up here. It's scary.

628
00:41:38,852 --> 00:41:40,976
My work is here.

629
00:41:43,102 --> 00:41:45,434
Millbrook's a nice town.

630
00:41:45,518 --> 00:41:50,476
Lots of quaint,
old aldermen and ancient farmers.

631
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,351
(Both laugh)

632
00:41:52,435 --> 00:41:54,892
I don't want to talk about it now,
I'm in too good a mood.

633
00:41:54,977 --> 00:41:56,892
- I might agree to anything.
- Yeah?

634
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:58,934
Glad to hear that.

635
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,642
I think it's time you and I
had a little talk, Mr. Cooper.

636
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:05,809
Who are you?

637
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:07,809
That's the problem.

638
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:10,101
I know who you are.

639
00:42:10,185 --> 00:42:12,559
George Cooper,
prominent fashion photographer.

640
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:13,934
Nobody knows me.

641
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:16,351
What the hell are you talking about?
Who are you?

642
00:42:16,435 --> 00:42:18,892
Murphy. Freelance reporter.

643
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:22,851
(Clears throat) You know
you were wearing a tail yesterday?

644
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:24,892
- What?
- That's right.

645
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:27,392
From the police department,
no less.

646
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,559
You must be a pretty important
fella, fella.

647
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:35,309
This should go
no further than this room.

648
00:42:35,393 --> 00:42:38,351
About three weeks ago,
the Environmental Protection Agency

649
00:42:38,435 --> 00:42:43,559
encountered slightly elevated radiation
levels in the Lafayette Street area.

650
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:45,809
Well, where's this radioactivity
coming from?

651
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:49,017
Do you remember that story that leaked
out about us wanting to, uh...

652
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:52,767
transport radioactive materials
through Manhattan?

653
00:42:52,852 --> 00:42:55,392
Sure. There was a big stink
about it in the press.

654
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:58,559
Didn't somebody get a court order
restraining you from doing it?

655
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:01,726
That's right.
The case is still under appeal.

656
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,517
In the meantime,
we can't move the stuff.

657
00:43:04,602 --> 00:43:06,517
You see, it's already here.

658
00:43:06,602 --> 00:43:10,809
The order is preventing us from,
uh... moving it out.

659
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:14,226
(Murphy) 'George Cooper.

660
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,059
'Suddenly just chucks it all,
and drops out of sight.

661
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,726
'Resurfaces six months
later with a...

662
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,517
'An award winning pictorial essay on
derelicts who hang out in the sewers.'

663
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,101
So?

664
00:43:26,185 --> 00:43:28,184
Look, everybody wants
to be rich and famous.

665
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:31,309
But given the choice,
most people prefer to be rich.

666
00:43:31,393 --> 00:43:33,392
It's really rare to find someone
who prefers fame.

667
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:37,351
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Sure, you do. I prefer fame myself.

668
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:39,934
- Just hasn't come my way, yet.
- That is not why I did it.

669
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:43,351
- Oh, of course not.
- He wasn't out to win any awards.

670
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:45,767
Just wanted to do
something relevant.

671
00:43:45,852 --> 00:43:48,267
- Oh! Relevant!
- Yeah.

672
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:51,851
Oh. That's a bad word. It went off
the okay word list years ago.

673
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,267
Look, what is this all about? What do
you want? An interview or something?

674
00:43:55,352 --> 00:43:57,351
- I want a story.
- A story about what?

675
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,434
- About the sewer people.
- Oh, I see.

676
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:01,934
I did a story about some people
who happen to live in the sewer.

677
00:44:02,018 --> 00:44:04,517
I'm not a reporter, I don't want to have
anything to do with the press.

678
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:07,101
- Goodbye.
- (Murphy) Forget the press!

679
00:44:07,185 --> 00:44:09,184
What about the people
down in the sewer?

680
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:12,059
- Come on, now.
- You figure it out.

681
00:44:12,143 --> 00:44:15,934
You may not know, but there's NRC men
crawling all over this goddamn city.

682
00:44:16,018 --> 00:44:18,934
Something's going wrong, and it's so
bad, nobody wants to talk about it.

683
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:23,517
The cops are going nuts trying to figure
out why a bag lady wants a hand gun.

684
00:44:27,518 --> 00:44:30,017
They even start following you.

685
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:36,101
How does this tie in
with the people that are missing?

686
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:39,684
- Well, now...
- I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to him.

687
00:44:39,768 --> 00:44:42,601
- There's no cause to be insolent, here.
- Eat it!

688
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:44,767
What about the disappearances?

689
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,976
I'm aware
of some alleged disappearances.

690
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,267
The little girl said
that she saw a monster!

691
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:51,184
- Was she right?
- I don't know.

692
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:53,934
- I think she was.
- I'm not prepared to, uh...

693
00:44:54,018 --> 00:44:55,934
concede the existence
of any monster.

694
00:44:56,018 --> 00:44:58,684
The fact that these people
are disappearing

695
00:44:58,768 --> 00:45:00,934
at the same time
that your guys go down.

696
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:04,142
You're telling me that that is just
some sort of bizarre coincidence?

697
00:45:04,227 --> 00:45:07,309
We don't have to listen to the lunatic
ravings of this paranoid hippie.

698
00:45:07,393 --> 00:45:10,017
I just want to know
what is going on here!

699
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:12,601
Why? So you can get your name
in the papers?

700
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:15,351
- So I can help!
- We don't want your help.

701
00:45:15,435 --> 00:45:18,642
Why not? I don't believe this,
I just... I don't believe you!

702
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:21,226
What are you trying to hide?

703
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:24,017
You saw it.

704
00:45:24,227 --> 00:45:26,184
You saw the monster.

705
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:28,309
Is that what
you're going to tell the paper?

706
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,017
That you're afraid of monsters?

707
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,142
It's just what I'm going to tell them,
if you don't fill me in!

708
00:45:32,227 --> 00:45:35,351
Go ahead, go scream
your fool head off.

709
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:37,517
This has been really fun, boys.

710
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:40,684
You, at least you...
You kept your mouth shut.

711
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:42,976
You're a fool.

712
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,684
And you, sir, are a liar!

713
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,767
- I'll see you all on the front page...
- You've got no evidence.

714
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:52,059
You're blind, buddy!

715
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,434
Have a nice day.

716
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,684
Long hair, carrying a paper bag.
He just left.

717
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,059
Follow him. High priority.

718
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:17,809
You're an idiot, Bosch, you know that?
You've really done it now.

719
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:20,101
- C.H.U.D.?
- What?

720
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:23,726
- C-H-U-D.
- Here, let me see.

721
00:46:25,852 --> 00:46:28,601
Give me that. Where do you think
you are, high school?

722
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:32,351
- That's a classified government file.
- And what does it stand for?

723
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:34,476
- That's not important.
- I'm through playing games.

724
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,642
Either you tell me what
C.H.U.D. stands for,

725
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,851
or I'm going to the newspapers.

726
00:46:38,935 --> 00:46:42,101
- Well, I have to get clearance.
- You got a call on four.

727
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,017
Wilson here.

728
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:49,226
What? Really?

729
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:52,434
Okay, you know what to do.

730
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,934
Two gas company guys
just found it.

731
00:46:57,018 --> 00:47:00,517
A cannibalistic humanoid
underground dweller.

732
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,351
A C.H.U.D. Alright?

733
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:06,642
It's dead.

734
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:19,934
(Change clinking)

735
00:47:48,935 --> 00:47:50,517
- Mr. Wilson.
- Doctor.

736
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:53,892
It's good to see you. You'll have to put
on one of these suits before we go in.

737
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:55,476
Gentlemen.

738
00:47:57,018 --> 00:47:58,476
(Eerie music)

739
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,101
(Doctor) There's every indication
this once was human.

740
00:48:01,185 --> 00:48:03,517
It's dressed in the rags
of a Bowery bum.

741
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:16,726
(Music grows louder)

742
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:26,267
- Well, let's have it.
- You realize this is just preliminary.

743
00:48:26,352 --> 00:48:28,309
- Yes, yes, of course.
- It was a gas leak, alright.

744
00:48:28,393 --> 00:48:31,517
- Death by asphyxiation.
- Good. Thank you.

745
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,059
(Wilson) Okay, that's it.
I'm going ahead with the clean- up.

746
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:38,142
Well, wait... Wait a minute.

747
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:40,642
How do you know there aren't
more of those things down there?

748
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:43,184
Of course there aren't any more.
It was a freak accident.

749
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:45,851
It couldn't happen again.
I'm sending my men back to work.

750
00:48:45,935 --> 00:48:48,517
Alright, you do that.
But I'm sending a team

751
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:51,351
armed with flame throwers
right down there with them.

752
00:48:51,435 --> 00:48:54,892
- I'm sorry, I can't let you do that.
- You what?

753
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:57,226
I can't afford the publicity.

754
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,226
If you do that, every paper
in town will be onto it.

755
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,267
- Well, I can fix it, so they won't.
- You won't do it at all.

756
00:49:04,352 --> 00:49:06,601
If I have to make it an order,
I'll make it an order.

757
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:09,017
I don't take orders from you!

758
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:14,351
Sorry, Bosch.
Wilson's in charge.

759
00:49:14,435 --> 00:49:19,601
I understand how you feel. But like it
or not, we're gonna do this my way.

760
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:31,642
Okay, I'm on the bottom now.
Do you read me?

761
00:49:38,268 --> 00:49:42,351
Hey! What the hell's going on here?

762
00:49:42,435 --> 00:49:46,976
Alright, men. Fan out
and form a solid line across the tunnel.

763
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:53,184
Now, Bosch. You leave this to me.
Just watch the monitor.

764
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:55,517
You'll see
there's nothing down there.

765
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,392
Son of a bitch.

766
00:50:03,685 --> 00:50:06,642
- Parker, this is Bosch. You read me?
- 'Loud and clear.'

767
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:08,934
Roger. Hang on.

768
00:50:10,352 --> 00:50:12,934
- We're ready.
- You're making a big mistake.

769
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:15,101
- Beg your pardon?
- You've had your laugh,

770
00:50:15,185 --> 00:50:18,976
- now get those men out of there.
- I'm busy, Wilson.

771
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,351
- Benson?
- 'Yes, sir?'

772
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,601
- Get those cops outta there.
- What, are you kidding?

773
00:50:24,685 --> 00:50:27,851
Your man has a camera.
Mine has a flame thrower.

774
00:50:31,518 --> 00:50:33,934
Okay, Parker, move 'em out.

775
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:54,767
'We're at the first intersection.'

776
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,101
Which way?

777
00:50:56,185 --> 00:50:59,601
You're a college graduate.
You figure it out.

778
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:01,934
I can wait as long as you can.

779
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,351
The, uh...

780
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:11,017
The north tunnel.

781
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:14,434
Take the north tunnel.
But check it out, first.

782
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:21,934
'Everything looks clear.

783
00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:24,142
- 'We're moving out.'
- Don't take any chances.

784
00:51:24,227 --> 00:51:26,434
First sign of trouble,
get the hell outta there.

785
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:41,976
Move it!

786
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,559
I think I see something moving
up ahead in the tunnel.

787
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,601
Get those flame throwers working.

788
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:49,059
- I'm trying to see what it is first.
- Forget it.

789
00:51:49,143 --> 00:51:51,809
'If it isn't saying hello,
I don't care what it is.'

790
00:51:58,602 --> 00:52:01,059
This is ridiculous.
We're wasting time.

791
00:52:01,143 --> 00:52:04,017
- Tell them to speed it up.
- 'Radiation level's going up.'

792
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:08,226
- I see something, there in the flames!
- Are you crazy?

793
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:12,351
- Nothing could possibly survive in...
- 'Radiation level's going up!'

794
00:52:13,643 --> 00:52:15,101
Parker?

795
00:52:15,185 --> 00:52:17,434
Parker?

796
00:52:17,518 --> 00:52:19,767
Parker!

797
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,351
I've got to go along with
Bosch now, Wilson.

798
00:52:29,435 --> 00:52:32,309
- The people have to be warned.
- No.

799
00:52:32,393 --> 00:52:35,601
Come on, Wilson. How many
of those things do you think there are?

800
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:38,017
- We'll stop them.
- How?

801
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:40,976
- With gas.
- Gas?

802
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,434
(Bosch sniggers)

803
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:45,184
We can't use gas,
it's too dangerous.

804
00:52:45,268 --> 00:52:47,184
My men are doing
an autopsy right now.

805
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:49,434
They'll come up with
a dozen ways to kill those things.

806
00:52:49,518 --> 00:52:51,934
Meantime we just sit around
on our thumbs, right?

807
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:54,434
Come on, Bosch,
you've got men out all over the city.

808
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,601
Who's gonna get hurt?

809
00:52:56,685 --> 00:53:00,976
Yeah, admittedly, the guy's a little wacky,
but suppose for an instant that he's right?

810
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,934
So what if he is?
We don't want to get involved.

811
00:53:04,018 --> 00:53:07,059
I've been down there,
you know?

812
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:09,101
Well, is there
something going on?

813
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,017
No, there's nothing
going on, but...

814
00:53:11,102 --> 00:53:13,351
So leave it alone.

815
00:53:34,143 --> 00:53:35,767
Gone.

816
00:53:35,852 --> 00:53:38,559
Prints of Victor's leg are gone.

817
00:53:39,977 --> 00:53:42,351
And that's
the only thing that's...

818
00:53:42,435 --> 00:53:45,142
Honey, have you been
in my dark room?

819
00:53:45,227 --> 00:53:46,934
(Lauren) No.

820
00:54:03,727 --> 00:54:06,642
Hello, Murphy?
This is George Cooper.

821
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:10,351
I want my photographs back.
I think we ought to have a little talk.

822
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:13,351
I'll meet you on the northbound side
of Chambers Street station

823
00:54:13,435 --> 00:54:16,017
in about half-hour. Bye.

824
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,142
(Creaking)

825
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:46,392
(Yells)

826
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,934
You look terrible.
What the hell happened to you?

827
00:54:54,018 --> 00:54:56,559
Nothing.

828
00:54:56,643 --> 00:54:59,434
(Panting)

829
00:55:07,518 --> 00:55:09,351
What's going on, Bosch?

830
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:11,892
I saw our monster.

831
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,934
(Shutter clicking)

832
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:21,267
We're not going anywhere
and I'm not showing you anything

833
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:23,184
unless you give me
my pictures back.

834
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:26,184
I don't have your pictures.
The police have your pictures.

835
00:55:26,268 --> 00:55:28,267
Police. You're still
putting out that crap?

836
00:55:28,352 --> 00:55:30,351
Why would the police
take my photographs?

837
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:32,642
- There's a cover-up going on.
- Cover-up.

838
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:35,392
You write this political bullshit?
Cover-up of what?

839
00:55:35,477 --> 00:55:37,892
I don't know, because I don't know
what was in those photographs.

840
00:55:37,977 --> 00:55:39,809
The only way to find out
is for us to go down there.

841
00:55:39,893 --> 00:55:43,559
- You wanna go down there?
- Yeah, I wanna go down there. Now.

842
00:55:48,018 --> 00:55:51,601
(Bosch) Cannibalistic humanoid
underground dweller.

843
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,434
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin'.

844
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:57,767
(Breathing heavily)
God.

845
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:00,767
- What are we gonna do, Bosch?
- I don't know.

846
00:56:00,852 --> 00:56:05,142
Wilson is toying with the idea
of flooding the sewers with gas.

847
00:56:05,227 --> 00:56:08,142
What? God, that guy is a madman!

848
00:56:08,227 --> 00:56:10,392
He is a madman.

849
00:56:10,477 --> 00:56:12,642
Gas could drive those
things up here.

850
00:56:12,727 --> 00:56:14,559
Great, great.

851
00:56:15,935 --> 00:56:19,351
What I'm saying is,
this isn't the safest place to be.

852
00:56:19,685 --> 00:56:22,267
I heard you the first time.

853
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:24,976
You wanna lift somewhere?

854
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,476
(Scoffs)
No, I gotta cook dinner.

855
00:56:31,352 --> 00:56:33,684
Keep your eye on that flame.

856
00:56:41,102 --> 00:56:42,601
We can't wait any longer.

857
00:56:42,685 --> 00:56:45,351
I've ordered my men
to prep the city gas lines.

858
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,434
We'll seal off
every tunnel in the area,

859
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:50,559
divert some of the gas mains
back into those tunnels.

860
00:56:50,643 --> 00:56:53,351
If there are
any more incidents, we'll...

861
00:56:53,435 --> 00:56:55,892
We'll turn
those mains back on.

862
00:56:55,977 --> 00:56:59,601
Are you crazy?
You'll blow up the whole city!

863
00:56:59,685 --> 00:57:03,476
I'm not gonna flood the whole city,
only, uh, a section of Soho.

864
00:57:12,352 --> 00:57:14,601
- Shh...
- What?

865
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:17,351
You hear something?

866
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:19,101
(Chuckles) No.

867
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,184
Listen, I did.

868
00:57:25,893 --> 00:57:27,434
Holy...

869
00:57:32,685 --> 00:57:34,684
(Sighs)

870
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:38,601
What the hell
are you doing with a gun?

871
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,559
(Clears throat)
You said Victor knows something.

872
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:45,809
If Victor wants a gun,
I want a gun.

873
00:57:55,268 --> 00:57:57,017
Come on.

874
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:59,309
Light. Light. Ah!

875
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,226
Hey, Val!

876
00:58:29,435 --> 00:58:31,476
Hey, Val!

877
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,684
- Val.
- (Yelling indistinctly)

878
00:58:36,768 --> 00:58:38,101
Jesus!

879
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:40,267
Hey, look, Val, man.
You got to get out of here.

880
00:58:40,352 --> 00:58:42,684
Get out of here, man.
It's dangerous.

881
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:46,851
Look, the sky's falling.
The sky's gonna shut.

882
00:58:46,935 --> 00:58:49,184
It's gonna shut, Val.

883
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:52,101
Go on.

884
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,351
Go on.

885
00:58:56,643 --> 00:58:58,559
Get out.

886
00:58:59,477 --> 00:59:02,226
- (Whispering) Sky.
- Sky, yeah. Get out.

887
00:59:02,643 --> 00:59:04,309
Go on.

888
00:59:05,727 --> 00:59:09,309
Sky... Sky!

889
00:59:10,393 --> 00:59:12,642
(Loud clattering)

890
00:59:14,352 --> 00:59:15,809
Val?

891
00:59:18,352 --> 00:59:20,059
Val?

892
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:22,059
Oh!

893
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:30,517
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

894
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,767
Wilson!

895
00:59:42,477 --> 00:59:44,476
Wilson... Wilson!

896
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,309
Wilson! Wilson!

897
00:59:47,393 --> 00:59:49,059
Wilson!

898
00:59:49,143 --> 00:59:51,142
(Loud banging)

899
00:59:57,268 --> 01:00:00,059
Now, this is it.
We have to go right through here.

900
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:03,351
Oh, you and your damn gun!
Come on.

901
01:00:07,893 --> 01:00:11,101
That's it, Murphy. You're on your own
as far as I'm concerned.

902
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:13,184
I told you, I didn't want
any more of this bullshit.

903
01:00:13,268 --> 01:00:14,976
I mean, I have to be down...

904
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,309
(C.H.U.D. roaring)

905
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:20,142
Shit.

906
01:00:20,227 --> 01:00:22,142
(Yelling)

907
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:25,726
(Murphy screaming)

908
01:00:27,518 --> 01:00:29,351
(Muffled cries) Murphy!

909
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,226
Goddammit.

910
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,517
Shit.

911
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,309
Damn it.

912
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:41,059
(Geiger counter clicking)

913
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:54,059
(C.H.U.D. growling)

914
01:03:23,768 --> 01:03:26,059
(C.H.U.D. growling)

915
01:03:55,685 --> 01:03:57,392
(Yells)

916
01:03:59,227 --> 01:04:00,726
(Grunts)

917
01:04:16,643 --> 01:04:18,476
(Geiger counter clicking)

918
01:04:21,435 --> 01:04:23,059
(C.H.U.D. growling)

919
01:04:39,518 --> 01:04:41,309
Oh, shit.

920
01:05:16,602 --> 01:05:18,517
(Eerie music)

921
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:24,101
(Screams)

922
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:39,809
Are you the one who found it?

923
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:41,642
Where is it?

924
01:06:05,643 --> 01:06:07,309
(Officer 1) Oh, my God,
it's his wife!

925
01:06:07,393 --> 01:06:09,309
(Officer 2) Shit!

926
01:06:09,393 --> 01:06:11,934
- (Officer 1) Get him out of there.
- (Officer 2) Come on! Come on!

927
01:06:12,018 --> 01:06:13,642
Come on!

928
01:06:35,893 --> 01:06:38,392
Why don't you
let us take you home?

929
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:42,142
Home?

930
01:06:42,227 --> 01:06:44,059
(Scoffs)

931
01:06:44,143 --> 01:06:46,059
(Laughing)

932
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,684
- Bosch, come on.
- She...

933
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:03,059
She just went back to college.

934
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,559
She always wanted to teach.

935
01:07:08,518 --> 01:07:10,851
Used to stay up half the night.

936
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,184
Studying.

937
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:20,559
Then she'd go out and...

938
01:07:23,477 --> 01:07:25,392
...walk the dog.

939
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:28,892
Yeah, police?

940
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:34,142
(Stuttering) I found a mangled dog
hanging in my basement

941
01:07:34,227 --> 01:07:37,142
and I'd like to have someone
come check it out.

942
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,851

(Melancholic music)

947
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,517
Uh, 7 of 6.

948
01:10:04,018 --> 01:10:06,309
- Cut it out, will you?
- Moron!

949
01:10:11,643 --> 01:10:15,351
- What'll it be, boys?
- Rare cheeseburger and a coke.

950
01:10:15,435 --> 01:10:18,101
- Same here.
- Coming up.

951
01:10:20,518 --> 01:10:23,142
- Nice legs.
- (Chuckling) Stop it.

952
01:10:23,227 --> 01:10:25,392
- I heard that.
- Yeah?

953
01:10:25,477 --> 01:10:27,809
I bet you heard it before too.

954
01:10:27,893 --> 01:10:29,059
Go on.

955
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:31,142
(Mocks crying)

956
01:11:03,268 --> 01:11:06,267
- Where'd you learn to cook like this?
- (Coughs)

957

(Chuckles)

958
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,059
You're asking for it.

959
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,601
I've been asking for it
all my life.

960
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:16,267
Just never get it.

961
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:19,309
- Shouldn't you boys be on duty?
- Nah.

(Wilson) Right in this area.
I want your team to take the north,

981
01:13:23,768 --> 01:13:26,017
yours south,
yours east, yours west.

982

I want ever manhole sealed off
in a 10 block radius. Right?

983
01:13:29,435 --> 01:13:32,017
Forget about the water mains.
Concentrate on the gas mains

984
01:13:32,102 --> 01:13:34,101
and the sewer mains.
Forget about subway grating.

985
01:13:34,185 --> 01:13:36,184
Now remember, those trucks
are rigged to explode

986

You killed my brother!

994

- You Cooper?
- Yeah.

995

- You all right?
- Who are you?

996
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:20,601
I run the soup kitchen.

- On Kenmore.
- Yeah, right.

01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:24,351
Man, this is crazy.

999

Have you seen enough?
Is this enough for you?

1004
01:15:56,935 --> 01:15:58,976
We can't wait any longer.
We have to start pumping gas.

1005
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,351
What about the subways?
What about the power lines?

1006
01:16:01,435 --> 01:16:05,142
If we stop the subways,
we'll kill every power line under the city.

1007
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,601
Why not? I mean,
you've killed everybody here.

1008
01:16:08,685 --> 01:16:11,392
All these people are dead
because of you, Wilson.

1009

My wife is dead because of you,
you son of a bitch!

Easy, Bosch. Easy.

1011
01:16:15,268 --> 01:16:17,892
This is your responsibility, Wilson.

1012
01:16:17,977 --> 01:16:20,476
Someone's got to stop you
and it's gonna have to be me.

1013
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,142
You go back to the car, Captain.
You understand me?

1014
01:16:23,227 --> 01:16:26,726
You go back to that car
and you wait for further orders, Captain.

1015
01:16:37,185 --> 01:16:39,726
The media is not gonna
wait much longer.

1016

We're going to have
to make it a statement.

1017
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:46,351
Shit.

no one even will confirm
that anyone was killed.

There are, uh, seven manholes

These are the only two
that go anywhere. Seal 'em.

01:23:18,143 --> 01:23:19,559
'Is anybody there?'

1087
01:23:19,643 --> 01:23:22,726
- Get Captain Bosch!
- Keep going. Just keep talking.

1088
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,809
- 'Get Captain...'
- Who the hell are you?

1089
01:23:24,893 --> 01:23:26,476
'Hey! Get somebody.'

1090
01:23:30,268 --> 01:23:32,267
(Sanderson on radio)
'Hey, Captain, this is Sanderson.

1091
01:23:32,352 --> 01:23:35,892
'I just got a very strange
phone call from some NRC guy.

1092
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:37,476
'He said it was urgent.

1093
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,267
'He said, ''Tell Bosch,
he's got the Reverend on the video

1094
01:23:40,352 --> 01:23:42,767
'''in the NRC control room.''

1095
01:23:42,852 --> 01:23:45,017
'Do you know what that means?'

1096
01:23:45,102 --> 01:23:47,726
(Screaming) Help!

1097
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:50,642
Somebody help me!

1098
01:23:50,727 --> 01:23:53,059
(Screaming) Help!

1099
01:23:53,143 --> 01:23:56,517
Somebody help me!

1100
01:23:57,435 --> 01:23:59,684
(Screaming)

1101
01:24:05,185 --> 01:24:07,976
(Burst of discordant music)

1102
01:24:10,143 --> 01:24:12,309
(Banging)

1103
01:24:22,393 --> 01:24:24,601
- (C.H.U.D. growling)
- Ah!

1104
01:24:52,685 --> 01:24:54,476
Ah!

1105
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:00,642
(C.H.U.D. growling)

1106
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:15,726
- (C.H.U.D. roaring)
- (Screaming)

1107
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:32,809
(High-pitched screaming)

1108
01:25:35,185 --> 01:25:37,059
(Yelling)

1109
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,517
(Bosch) 'Reverend?
This is Bosch. Do you read me?'

1110
01:25:51,602 --> 01:25:53,809
- Yeah, Bosch.
- Where are you?

1111
01:25:53,893 --> 01:25:57,226
(Stammering) I'm here. I'm at that place
where your guys got killed.

1112
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:59,351
- All right, see the side tunnel?
- Yeah.

1113
01:25:59,435 --> 01:26:01,601
'About 100 yards
down that tunnel to the right'

1114
01:26:01,685 --> 01:26:05,142
there's a ladder to a manhole.
Be there. I'll open it.

1115
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:07,434
Yeah, I'll be there.
I got to tell you something, man.

1116
01:26:07,518 --> 01:26:10,767
- It can wait.
- 'No, it can't wait. It's about Wilson.'

1117
01:26:10,852 --> 01:26:13,184
(Dramatic music)

1118
01:26:21,518 --> 01:26:23,809
(Both coughing)

1119
01:26:27,143 --> 01:26:29,392
Come on, let's go.

1120
01:26:29,477 --> 01:26:31,726
(Siren)

1121
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:34,142
Man, come on!

1122
01:26:34,227 --> 01:26:37,434
Step up the pressure.
We've got to have more gas.

1123
01:26:37,518 --> 01:26:39,809
(Siren)

1124
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:57,726
May I have your attention?
This is an emergency!

1125
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:00,267
Who has the key to the truck
parked in the corner

1126
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,309
of Washington
and Dekalb Street?

1127
01:27:02,393 --> 01:27:04,434
There are people
trapped under a manhole.

1128
01:27:04,518 --> 01:27:06,642
We need to move the truck
to get them out.

1129
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:09,226
- Who has the key?
- Right here.

1130
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:16,809
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1131
01:27:16,893 --> 01:27:18,601
We've already started the gas.

1132
01:27:18,685 --> 01:27:20,892
Those things will be looking
for a way out. It's too risky.

1133
01:27:20,977 --> 01:27:23,434
Too risky?
Oh, for who? For you?

1134
01:27:23,518 --> 01:27:26,559
What, afraid people are gonna
get wind of your filthy little project

1135
01:27:26,643 --> 01:27:29,642
and find out who you really are?
Give me the keys goddamn it!

1136
01:27:29,727 --> 01:27:32,184
Maybe the press would like
to hear about this. Hey, you guys!

1137
01:27:32,268 --> 01:27:34,351
Hey, all right! Come on.

1138
01:27:41,935 --> 01:27:44,392
All right, Bosch.
What are you gonna tell them?

1139
01:27:44,477 --> 01:27:47,351
For starters, I'll tell them there's more
than leaky canisters down there.

1140
01:27:47,435 --> 01:27:50,351
- So what does that mean?
- You're not from the NRC.

1141
01:27:50,435 --> 01:27:52,892
You'll cover for 'em
as long as it's convenient for you

1142
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:56,392
but you don't care about that.
You want them to clean up their mess

1143
01:27:56,477 --> 01:27:58,476
before anybody finds out
what's really going on.

1144
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,726
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1145
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:04,351
I know what C.H.U.D. stands for.
Cannibalistic, my ass!

1146
01:28:04,435 --> 01:28:07,226
Contamination hazard
urban disposal.

1147
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:10,392
You know, you're nothing
but the government garbage man.

1148
01:28:10,477 --> 01:28:12,267
You take industrial waste,

1149
01:28:12,352 --> 01:28:15,351
you take toxic slugs
from every research project

1150
01:28:15,435 --> 01:28:17,559
and dump it
under the streets of our city.

1151
01:28:17,643 --> 01:28:19,684
- Christ!
- You can't hide it anymore, Wilson.

1152
01:28:19,768 --> 01:28:22,684
Now give me the keys.
I'm gonna get those men out of there.

1153
01:28:22,768 --> 01:28:25,809
- I can't let you do that.
- It's over, Wilson.

1154
01:28:25,893 --> 01:28:28,851
I said, I can't let you do that.

1155
01:28:32,852 --> 01:28:35,142
How are you gonna cover up
killing a cop, huh?

1156
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,351
I don't know. But I can't let
that story get out.

1157
01:28:37,435 --> 01:28:41,101
- You won't shoot me, Wilson.
- I will if I have to.

1158
01:28:46,018 --> 01:28:48,517
(Both coughing)

1159
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:54,642
Isn't this it?

1160
01:29:05,602 --> 01:29:07,517
(Grunting)

1161
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,892
Move it! Police! Move it!

1162
01:29:11,977 --> 01:29:14,226
(Fast-paced music)

1163
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:21,392
(Siren)

1164
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,184
Stop the gas! Who's in charge?

1165
01:29:46,268 --> 01:29:48,726
- They've gotta stop the gas.
- (Officer) Stop it? Why?

1166
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:51,226
(Lauren) My husband's down there.
Who's in charge?

1167
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:52,934
- Some NRC guy...
- Show me...

1168
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:56,142
- Where is he?
- He just went down there.

1169
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,976
- (C.H.U.D. growling)
- It's jammed.

1170
01:30:24,643 --> 01:30:27,934
- (Bosch) Hey, you guys down there?
- Bosch, hurry!

1171
01:30:28,018 --> 01:30:30,726
- I'm here.
- (Gunshot)

1172
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:32,684
(Whispering) What was that?

1173
01:30:53,143 --> 01:30:54,684
(Shouting)

1174
01:31:01,393 --> 01:31:02,976
(Engine starting)

1175
01:31:11,810 --> 01:31:13,392
(Tires screeching)

1176
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:17,434
George, look out!

1177
01:31:20,977 --> 01:31:23,142
(Tires screeching)

1178
01:31:25,643 --> 01:31:27,392
(Mouthing) Bosch.

1179
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:34,392
Come on. Get up! Get up!
He's trying to kill us.

1180
01:31:34,477 --> 01:31:36,642
Get up.

1181
01:31:38,685 --> 01:31:40,476
No!

1182
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,392
- No!
- (Tires screeching)

1183
01:31:53,018 --> 01:31:55,476
(Explosion)

1184
01:32:17,477 --> 01:32:19,142
(Bosch) Nice shot.

1185
01:32:21,143 --> 01:32:22,851
Bosch!

1186
01:32:37,268 --> 01:32:39,392
Nice shot!
