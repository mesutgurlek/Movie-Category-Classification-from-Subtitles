<i>Zenithoptera lanei.</i>

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,056
Look at that. Just gorgeous
adaptations for flight.

5
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:18,425
The only thing I know
this blue in nature

6
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:20,760
are my wife's eyes
first thing in the morning.

7
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:28,167
There's magic out there.

8
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:30,502
There is magic out there.

9
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:31,904
There's magic out there.

10
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:34,240
Oh! There's magic out there.

11
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:36,709
You get that?

12
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:39,145
There's a finless porpoise
that swam right up to me.

13
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,279
Tell me you got it.

14
00:00:40,313 --> 00:00:42,749
- Yes, we got it.
- Got it, dad.

15
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:44,483
Lincoln, how great was that?
Did you see it?

16
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:45,517
Yes.

17
00:00:51,457 --> 00:00:53,591
Got it?

18
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:56,494
There is magic out there.

19
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:58,897
We're filming a species
that perhaps no one

20
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:00,565
has ever seen before.
Lincoln, come here.

21
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,906
All right, okay, cut.

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,974
Cut.

23
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:10,575
We'll see you next week, I hope.

24
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:18,817
Explorer, naturalist,
and beloved television host

25
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:20,285
Emmet Cole
has been reported missing.

26
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,253
He was a wonderful character.

27
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:24,689
He was
a passionate environmentalist.

28
00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:26,591
Cole and his documentary crew
were last seen

29
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:27,958
on the Amazon
onboard their ship the "Magus."

30
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,931
Rescue teams have searched
the Amazon for weeks,

31
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:35,400
but with no sign.

32
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:38,903
And his death is tonight
being mourned around the world.

33
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:42,239
As a kid, I used to watch
my father on TV,

34
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:45,743
and the voice would come up,
"Next week, Emmet Cole

35
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:48,813
may not survive
what he finds in the cave."

36
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:51,015
I'd be terrified
he wouldn't come home.

37
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,351
He always did.

38
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:57,021
Well, today...

39
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,588
We give up hope.

40
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:00,791
Thanks for joining us
on "The Undiscovered Country."

41
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:03,194
I'm Emmet Cole.
We'll see you next week.

42
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:24,148
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's get
that mike fixed, shall we?

43
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,984
We shouldn't be doing this
to him.

44
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:30,487
Yet here we are.

45
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:32,288
He's my son.

46
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:38,695
<i>*</i>

47
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:49,072
Tequila.
That's your dad's drink.

48
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:51,174
Yeah, it's his day.

49
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,346
Why are they following you?

50
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,880
Come on, guys.
Enough with the cameras.

51
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,248
I just buried my father.

52
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:00,916
You didn't bury him.

53
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,553
Mom, we said good-bye, okay?
We let go.

54
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,321
Why weren't you there?

55
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:09,425
'Cause he's not dead.

56
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,195
We've had this conversation,
okay? He's legally dead.

57
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,163
He's actually dead.
I wish he wasn't, but he is.

58
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:16,164
Lincoln--

59
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,600
Mom, I'm fine.

60
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:20,135
You know what? I've gotten
pretty used to him being gone.

61
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,405
I had a lot of practice
waiting for him to come back

62
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,106
from Kenya or Peru

63
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,375
for my birthday, my graduation.

64
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,743
I mean, you were there, right?

65
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:29,944
You'd bake a cake
and you'd tell me not to be sad

66
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:33,314
because dad was here in spirit.
So you know what?

67
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:36,050
To me, this just feels like
another birthday.

68
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:39,854
This is different.

69
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,255
They found his beacon.

70
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,126
4:08 P.M. yesterday.

71
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,428
The emergency signal--

72
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:48,963
His personal frequency.

73
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:50,565
After six months.

74
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,935
That doesn't mean that that--

75
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,369
I mean, that could be
anything, right?

76
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,605
Well, it could be him.

77
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,940
We can find his ship.
We can find him.

78
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,475
I need you to come with me,
Lincoln.

79
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,675
No, no, mom, listen to me.

80
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,979
Look, I'm going back to school
in a week, okay?

81
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:06,880
I start my residency
in Chicago.

82
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:10,451
They accepted my research.
I can finish my PhD.

83
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:13,754
You never know.
I might even make you proud.

84
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,323
Lincoln, wait. Wait.

85
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:17,224
Your father needs you.

86
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,259
No.

87
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:19,626
I gave enough to him,
to that show.

88
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,728
He missed <i>my</i> life
to inspire a billion people

89
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,264
I could give a fuck about.

90
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:24,665
There's no magic out there.

91
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,968
I'm not going.
I'm not getting involved.

92
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,769
They won't pay if you don't go.

93
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:33,006
The network says it's both of us
or no show.

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,775
That's the deal.
We pay for the expedition

95
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:36,009
for as long as it takes
to find him,

96
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,179
but we get full, unfettered
access to both of you.

97
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:43,083
They know dad and I
hated each other.

98
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,551
That's why we want you.

99
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:46,319
Clark.

100
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,726
Please.

101
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,761
Angel.

102
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,230
Come with me.

103
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,350
So, Lincoln, tell us

104
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,820
about your relationship
with your father.

105
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,457
Go fuck yourself.

106
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,429
He'll come around.

107
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,444
Hi there. I'm on the Amazon.

108
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,047
Not a lot of other Jews
out here, though.

109
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:52,450
There's a storm
coming out of Tefe.

110
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:55,086
Don't throw up.

111
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,996
100 kilometers.

112
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,999
We're close.

113
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,302
This is not
a ship. This is a boat.

114
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:13,337
The "Magus"-- She is a ship.

115
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:17,674
I sail her for Doc 23 years.

116
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:22,279
A year ago, Doc is
fueling up for the Amazonas,

117
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:23,713
and he says to me,

118
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:27,350
"Emilio, you no go on this trip.
Go home."

119
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:30,920
I say, "Doc... fuck you.
This <i>is</i> my home."

120
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:34,691
Now I understand.
He wanted to protect me.

121
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:36,426
But it was just
another expedition, right?

122
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:38,228
Why did he want to protect you?

123
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:40,497
Because of my daughter.

124
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,735
God hates me. I know.

125
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:49,306
Or he would have made her ugly.

126
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:53,542
Hello there. <i>Hola.</i>

127
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:57,012
So you can--
You can fix things?

128
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:59,014
Esos no son los
zapatos adecuados.

129
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:02,751
<i>Sí.</i> Uh, <i>je m'apelle</i> Sammy.

130
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,791
Escuelas americanas.

131
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:12,394
So we have to watch out
for the sand.

132
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:14,130
So when's high tide?

133
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:16,832
It's about 4:42.

134
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,834
That's four hours.

135
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:22,604
Uhh!

136
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,806
Uhh!

137
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:26,441
Oh! Uhh!

138
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:31,780
Caught him touching my guns.

139
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:34,883
Where we're headed, there may be
20 people in the world...

140
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:38,586
That can say I've seen worse
and not be lying to get laid.

141
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:41,657
People like Mrs. Cole--

142
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,291
They don't know how lucky
they are they hired me.

143
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:46,528
Stop the boat!
We found the beacon!

144
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:48,063
It's here!

145
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:49,464
Get in there. Get in there,
get in there, get in there.

146
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:53,934
- Here we go, here we go.
- Okay, where is it?

147
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:55,502
15 meters, right up here.

148
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,271
On the left.

149
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,373
Okay, stop it! Stop.

150
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:03,477
Where is it?

151
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,880
It's here.

152
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,281
All I got is river.

153
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:09,183
Okay. If it's here,
it's under the water.

154
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:14,354
It's here.

155
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:21,195
I know, but if it's here,
it's under the water.

156
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:55,461
His beacon. I'm sorry.

157
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,570
Well, we don't know
if he was in there.

158
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:09,342
We don't know he was in there.

159
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:12,478
Someone turned the signal on.

160
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:17,383
Someone-- Emmet--
wants our help.

161
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:25,224
The door-- The way it is broken,
something not try to break in.

162
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,028
Something... break out.

163
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:32,196
We got what we came for, mom.

164
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:34,566
We have an answer.

165
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Come on. Let's just go home.

166
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,402
No.

167
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,671
We keep going.

168
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,774
We don't even have a direction.

169
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:46,645
I'll find one.

170
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,231
<i>Medico.</i>

171
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:08,465
Sí, le duele.

172
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,634
- Mm. ¿Te duele?
<i>- Sí.</i>

173
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:13,938
Espérate, ya está.
¿Bueno aquí, señor?

174
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,074
Very strong. It's good.

175
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,025
Lena, you shouldn't be here.

176
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:36,159
You shouldn't be here.

177
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:39,029
Lena...

178
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,632
No.

179
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,006
I modeled tide patterns
from the beacon's location.

180
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,408
I came up with six probables,
and the first five were empty,

181
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,110
but this was the sixth.

182
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,646
Here. 55 kilometers west. Look.

183
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,148
There's nothing there, Lena.

184
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:00,150
There's no river for the boat
to be on.

185
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:02,018
It's not on the map.
It doesn't exist.

186
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,854
I'm telling you,
a boat doesn't just disappear.

187
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:05,956
It's there. It has to be,
and they will be there--

188
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,024
My dad and Emmet.

189
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:09,926
It's the only possible place.

190
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,394
Then we go there.
Tell the crew.

191
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:14,030
No.

192
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:16,333
Eso es la Boiúna.
No podemos ir para allá.

193
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:23,973
Tell the crew.

194
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,164
Up here on the left.

195
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:28,636
I thought for sure I'd hear
from you at some point

196
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,939
after they went missing.

197
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:36,344
Sorry. Just school.

198
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:37,745
The lab.

199
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:39,747
That all sounds
rather boring--

200
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:41,049
I mean, compared
to your father's work.

201
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,917
Yeah, well,
that's the point, Clark.

202
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:44,885
Science isn't
a great, big wonder anymore.

203
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,755
Discoveries are made in a lab,
not the jungle.

204
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,914
Okay, that was pretty cool.

205
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:16,750
That's her.

206
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:49,682
Hello?

207
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,718
Emmet?!

208
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:53,653
Dad?!

209
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:59,358
Hello?! Is anyone here?

210
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:05,030
What the hell was...
Hello?!

211
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:10,002
That was from inside.

212
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:11,937
Someone's in the ship.

213
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:25,622
Emilio!

214
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,790
Hey.

215
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,759
Get the gennie running.
We need some lights.

216
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:37,167
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

217
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:58,421
Hello? Is anyone here?

218
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:03,859
It's coming
from the panic room.

219
00:15:03,894 --> 00:15:06,996
Go, go, go, let's go.

220
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,565
Come on. Move.

221
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,366
We made the safe
into a panic room

222
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:12,702
in case of hijackers.

223
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:16,538
Emmet, is that you?
Listen to me. I'm here!

224
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:17,873
They can be in there.
Open it.

225
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:19,174
It closes from the inside.

226
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,377
Yeah, well, it's welded shut
from the outside

227
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:24,246
- all the way around.
- Why would somebody do that?

228
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:26,949
Emmet.

229
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:31,087
I'm gonna get you out,
all right? Emmet?

230
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:34,156
I'm gonna get you out.
I'm here.

231
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:52,306
Okay, what have we got?

232
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:53,742
Look at the state of this place.

233
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:55,276
- Yeah, it's not pretty, is it?
- Oh, my God.

234
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:59,213
That's-- that's good.

235
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:02,083
Power's back on.

236
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:09,589
Oh, good.

237
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:11,025
Ship's cameras back up.

238
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:14,161
Can you believe it?
That's very nice.

239
00:16:17,165 --> 00:16:18,565
AJ, can you stop
farting around, please?

240
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,967
Get the rest of it.

241
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,201
I want every inch of this boat
covered, all right?

242
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:23,070
And we might even get a view
into the panic room.

243
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:24,304
And get the editing bay up
live, too.

244
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:26,273
We can log it all.
We can cut as we go, all right??

245
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:28,275
Now please, excuse me.

246
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:30,043
Trying to make a TV show.

247
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,747
- It's working. <i>It's working.</i>
It's very nice. AJ. - Yeah?

248
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,316
We're in business.

249
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,317
Come on.

250
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:38,618
Lovely.

251
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:00,639
No deberían de abrirlo, papá.

252
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,436
Well, people always tell me that

253
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,171
the reason they loved
Emmet's show

254
00:17:33,206 --> 00:17:35,774
was not because of the travel
or the adventure

255
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:37,709
but because
they wanted to be part

256
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:40,645
of our own perfect
little family.

257
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,080
I mean, yeah,
we had our problems.

258
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:44,983
Everybody does, sure.
Our secrets.

259
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:47,719
But... who doesn't?

260
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:52,824
We're in.

261
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:58,630
Go on.
Pull it.

262
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:00,065
Get it!

263
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,166
Ohh!
Ohh.

264
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:05,970
Hello?

265
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:17,347
Oh, my God.

266
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,434
Dad?

267
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:53,350
What is that?

268
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:56,420
Lincoln, no!

269
00:18:57,588 --> 00:19:00,056
Aah! Uhh!

270
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:04,394
Bloody hell!

271
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:20,243
What the fuck was that?

272
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:29,655
One night, Jahel--
She come to me.

273
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:32,457
I'm upstairs playing cards
with Doc.

274
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:35,560
And she said to me,
"Papa, come.

275
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:38,864
Ghost friend--
Tell him to be quiet."

276
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:40,732
I think
it's one of the new crew

277
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:44,636
is bothering my daughter,
so I go get my gun.

278
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:47,572
I say, um, "Which man is it?"

279
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:51,209
She said, "No, <i>no es</i> man.
<i>Es</i> ghost friend.

280
00:19:51,243 --> 00:19:53,911
Tell him to be quiet, papi."

281
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:57,214
So I say,
"Ghost friend, be quiet."

282
00:19:57,248 --> 00:19:59,750
Couple of days go by,
and I ask her if these voices

283
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:05,189
are still bothering her,
and she say, "No. No bother.

284
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:08,492
Ghost friend
talk more quiet now."

285
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:13,764
No me gusta este
amigo fantasma.

286
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,499
No! No!

287
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:16,667
We need to keep pressure
on that.

288
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:18,335
- You're gonna be okay.
- Put your arm around her.

289
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,071
- It's okay.
- Put your arm around her.

290
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:21,806
Come on.

291
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,576
AJ, get the medkit.
She's bleeding!

292
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,011
Put the damn camera down
and get the kit!

293
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:32,482
Mm.

294
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:35,018
That's it. Just breathe in.

295
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:40,857
You're okay. You're okay.

296
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,992
One more.

297
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,331
How bad is it?

298
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:50,234
Well, know how you used
to think scars were sexy?

299
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:52,369
You're about to be much sexier.

300
00:20:54,272 --> 00:20:59,476
Remember when we used to play
hide-and-seek on this boat?

301
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,944
And you could never find me.
I mean, typical, right?

302
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:05,948
I used to try and camo myself,

303
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:08,217
and that one time
I picked the wrong vine.

304
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:11,820
And I got covered in hives.

305
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,557
And you didn't come near me
for, like, a week.

306
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,292
No way.

307
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:17,760
You thought I looked like
the boogeyman.

308
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:18,894
You did.

309
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:21,897
And you know I had it
all over my face.

310
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:24,267
That was kinda funny.

311
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:26,769
You remember what my dad said?

312
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:29,938
- What'd he say?
- He said you're trouble.

313
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:32,375
Well...

314
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:34,309
There may be something to that.

315
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:35,443
Hey, AJ.

316
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:36,578
Yeah.

317
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:37,746
Thanks for the help, man.
She was hurt.

318
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,547
What, you think I'm a fireman?

319
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:41,182
I don't save people, man.

320
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:53,561
Hell with him. I got the shot.

321
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:01,436
No excrement.

322
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,837
That was no animal.

323
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:07,474
What is this?

324
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,976
Some kind of shrine
or something?

325
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,481
They left the food out.

326
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:18,819
Who's that?

327
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:29,029
- Holy cow, you scared me.
<i>- No me gusta</i> being scared,

328
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:30,230
little girl.

329
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,174
Sangre.

330
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:47,314
These mean anything to anyone?

331
00:22:47,348 --> 00:22:49,449
Yeah, these are pictures
of Cam Travers,

332
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:51,751
one of our producers.

333
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:55,655
Emmet insisted on bringing him
on this one instead of me.

334
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:57,957
He was a son of a bitch.

335
00:22:57,991 --> 00:23:00,292
The only decent thing about him
was his wife.

336
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:03,162
You think Travers is dead?

337
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:05,297
Before they went missing,

338
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:07,467
Emmet said that
Travers caught a fever

339
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,602
and that he didn't make it.
They buried him out here.

340
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:13,906
You spoke to Emmet?
From here?

341
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,809
He just had some questions
about how to back up files.

342
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:19,211
He was always afraid
of a server crash.

343
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,852
Emilio, all that time
you sailed with my father,

344
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:02,554
you ever see anything
like that?

345
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:04,222
Any idea what it could be?

346
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,357
Before he fired me,

347
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:09,661
your father started to spend
a lot of nights off of the ship,

348
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:14,098
all night, by himself.
No food, no gear.

349
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,934
I told Doc
I start to worry about him.

350
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,670
He said, "Don't."
He's protected.

351
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,572
By a gun?

352
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:22,106
By magic.

353
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:27,278
Papá, él no cree.
Cuéntale.

354
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:33,484
<i>Mira. Sangre.</i>

355
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:40,358
Wh--

356
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:43,361
<i>- Cállate, niña.</i>
- What's she saying?

357
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:44,963
You know what that thing was?

358
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:47,432
It's okay.
You can tell me.

359
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:48,866
It's okay.

360
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,704
<i>No es un animal.</i>
<i>Es Corpo Seco.</i>

361
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:55,739
It was not an animal.

362
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:57,608
It was <i>Corpo Seco.</i>

363
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:59,043
The dry spirit.

364
00:24:59,078 --> 00:25:01,512
A soul so bitter,
the ground would not take him.

365
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,547
And the devil sent him back,

366
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:07,351
so he wanders, looking for blood
to make it whole.

367
00:25:07,385 --> 00:25:09,887
More blood, more strength.

368
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:13,724
Well, are you talking
about some kind of ghost?

369
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,628
El féretro del niño.

370
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,864
Coffin for the child.

371
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:21,198
This is <i>kraho,</i>

372
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:23,901
from the chonta palm.

373
00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:26,604
Full of <i>tsarutuma.</i> Holy.

374
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:29,907
The shamans use it
to catch the angry soul.

375
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:33,110
Your father used blood
to lure the spirit.

376
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:35,212
They caught it inside,

377
00:25:35,246 --> 00:25:36,646
but we opened it.

378
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,415
<i>...Sangre de</i> Lena.

379
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:41,118
We fed it with Lena's blood.

380
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:43,353
Now it's strong enough.

381
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:44,721
To what?

382
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:58,101
Hey. We're going right now.
Pack what you need.

383
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,469
Everyone on the rafts.

384
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:01,804
Well, hang on a minute.
What are you talking about?

385
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,340
We're not safe.
Someone's out there.

386
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:04,941
I don't know if it's an animal
or a guy on drugs

387
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:06,642
or just the fucking crew's
on drugs.

388
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:08,110
But people died here,
and we could be next.

389
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:10,146
I am <i>not</i> leaving this close
to finding your father.

390
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,516
<i>Someone</i> welded the door shut.
<i>Someone</i> survived.

391
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,751
You're captain here.
It's your call.

392
00:26:15,785 --> 00:26:18,787
I already lost my father
to this place.

393
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:20,989
I'm not losing the two of you.

394
00:26:22,392 --> 00:26:25,261
Let's go home.

395
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,798
Out here!

396
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:32,101
Out here! The rafts!

397
00:26:36,606 --> 00:26:38,006
Lincoln, I don't know
what happened.

398
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,307
I came out to see if
they were okay,

399
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:41,009
and someone must have
slashed them or something.

400
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:43,912
There's no way to fix that.
Where's the other one?

401
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:44,980
What?

402
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:47,148
- Over there!
- Can we get it?

403
00:26:47,183 --> 00:26:49,217
No, the current's got it.
It's long gone.

404
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:51,386
- Did you do this? Huh?
- What?

405
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,555
- Of course I didn't.
- Then who did?

406
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,890
I have no--

407
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,403
No nos va a dejar irnos.
Hasta que no tenga la sangre suficiente.

408
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:23,897
We gotta get the hell
outta here.

409
00:27:23,932 --> 00:27:25,265
We don't know
what that is, okay?

410
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:26,767
We don't know.

411
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:29,703
And we don't have any way
to leave, so...

412
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,271
Yes, we do.

413
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:33,173
This. The "Magus."

414
00:27:35,276 --> 00:27:37,811
Emilio,
how long to get us moving?

415
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:39,179
I gotta get one
of our engines working.

416
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:40,714
I have to reattach
the rudder line.

417
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:43,216
I have to reseal the hull.
Two days.

418
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:44,217
All right, you got
two and a half hours.

419
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:45,852
Just work the engine.
Keep us alive

420
00:27:45,886 --> 00:27:47,153
long enough to fix
the rest, okay?

421
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:49,956
We gotta be moving by 4:43.

422
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,458
- And what happens then?
- High tide.

423
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:54,060
Look, we get one
chance to shove her out.

424
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:57,430
I'll clear the propeller.
Everyone else, eyes open.

425
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:01,368
You might need this.

426
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:06,273
He's starting
to sound like his father.

427
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:14,480
Papá.

428
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:36,935
This place-- It gets to you.

429
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:39,705
You know, everything
I've ever studied tells me

430
00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:42,608
we're all caught up
in group hysteria.

431
00:28:42,642 --> 00:28:45,010
But what we saw,

432
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:47,179
what hurt you...

433
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,614
If that's anything other,

434
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:52,750
if that's something unnatural,

435
00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:55,954
we need to know more,
or we're not gonna make it.

436
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:11,469
Nature's just disgusting.

437
00:29:11,503 --> 00:29:13,271
Lincoln...

438
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:14,973
There's something
you need to see.

439
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:21,511
Emmet made me promise that if
anything ever happened to him,

440
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:23,080
I was supposed to find
these tapes and destroy them,

441
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:25,415
but... there might be something
on these that could help us.

442
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,020
This is his journal.

443
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:34,158
These are the originals.
He sent me backups, all encoded,

444
00:29:34,192 --> 00:29:38,762
so I don't know what's on them,
but... what he told me.

445
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:25,841
<i>The engine's dead.</i>

446
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:29,344
<i>It's killed half the crew.</i>
<i>There are four of us left.</i>

447
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:31,179
Corpo Seco.

448
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:34,950
<i>It's Cam Travers.</i>

449
00:30:34,984 --> 00:30:38,253
<i>I know it's impossible.</i>
<i>We buried him.</i>

450
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:41,857
<i>It's this place.</i>

451
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:45,394
<i>It's trying to kill us.</i>

452
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:46,729
So he thought that ghost
was one of their own crew?

453
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,163
This Cam Travers--

454
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:51,233
He killed them.
Now... he's coming after us?

455
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:56,238
<i>The</i> kraho <i>carve</i>
<i>these-- these soul traps,</i>

456
00:30:56,272 --> 00:31:00,342
<i>and Landry and I are gonna try</i>
<i>and just draw it in.</i>

457
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:03,878
<i>It's our only chance.</i>

458
00:31:03,913 --> 00:31:06,381
<i>It's the only chance.</i>

459
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:09,717
"There's magic out there."

460
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:11,820
He was looking for real magic.

461
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:14,789
Well, it looks like
he bloody found it.

462
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:16,691
And he didn't tell you
about any of this?

463
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:20,562
I shouldn't have let him go.

464
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:31,105
Pop another tape in,
would you, AJ?

465
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,273
Yeah.

466
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,809
Mm-hmm.

467
00:31:34,844 --> 00:31:37,879
<i>We're so close to the source.</i>

468
00:31:37,913 --> 00:31:41,449
<i>And we have to keep going.</i>
<i>We have to.</i>

469
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,618
<i>And the further</i>
<i>we go off the Boiuna,</i>

470
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:48,089
<i>the more-- The more physics</i>
<i>breaks down.</i>

471
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:52,293
<i>Reality gets so much...</i>

472
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:57,131
<i>Bigger.</i>

473
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,633
<i>I have to see it.</i>

474
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:04,138
We just got a second season.

475
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:09,276
Hey, mom.
It's dangerous, you know?

476
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:10,677
You shouldn't be out here
in the open.

477
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:14,248
All that time,
he was on some quest,

478
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:16,450
and he didn't tell me.

479
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:17,918
Come on. You two had your
secrets from each other, right?

480
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:20,388
No, Lincoln, we didn't.

481
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:23,224
Oh, enough with the act, mom.
The show is over.

482
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:24,625
We weren't a perfect family.

483
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,793
I mean, he wasn't perfect.
I sure as hell wasn't,

484
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:28,062
and you-- I mean, you had--

485
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:30,031
What about me?

486
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:31,165
Not even.

487
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,134
Lincoln, don't you walk
away from me.

488
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:34,535
You come here and you tell me

489
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,436
how I wasn't perfect enough
for you.

490
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,005
You know what?
I'm not a kid anymore.

491
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,141
All those years, you were
his partner, his captain.

492
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:43,276
And all of a sudden,
he goes off without you?

493
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,845
And you let him?

494
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,213
I always was curious.

495
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:49,349
Who was it anyway?

496
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:50,717
- Huh? - It's none of your business,
Lincoln. Don't even--

497
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:53,820
You made my life
the whole world's business.

498
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:55,556
You cheated on dad
with someone else,

499
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,490
so he cheated on you
with his work.

500
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:58,759
That is not fair, Lincoln.
Stop it.

501
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:00,661
You know, and maybe that's why
he went nuts,

502
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:02,195
looking for something
to believe in,

503
00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:04,598
because he sure as hell
couldn't believe in you.

504
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:07,867
You have no idea
what our lives were.

505
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:09,769
Sure, I do.

506
00:33:09,803 --> 00:33:11,404
I know why you're out here
in the middle of a jungle,

507
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:14,174
willing to get yourself killed.

508
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:17,110
No one goes that far for love.
But guilt?

509
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:19,712
Sure, that'd get you
to the Amazon,

510
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:21,614
and you know what, mom?

511
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:23,783
You <i>should</i> feel guilty,

512
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:26,052
because you were the magic
in his life.

513
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,987
And when he lost you...

514
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:31,291
Good. The engine's working.

515
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:32,525
Let's go home.

516
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:46,806
¡Somos mejor que nadie!

517
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:00,720
Come on! Let's go! Mom!

518
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:15,767
Ohh!

519
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:16,901
Ohh!

520
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:19,971
It's working!

521
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:21,973
Turn it hard!

522
00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:29,447
We're clear!
We're gonna make it!

523
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:41,659
Hey.

524
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:43,661
Hi.

525
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:45,495
One hour till sunrise,
two hours till the Yutay.

526
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,530
I think we can make it.

527
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:50,233
Yeah. Listen, Tess,
I-I keep thinking,

528
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:53,137
if that thing--
If it really is Cam Travers,

529
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:55,139
it could know about Emmet.

530
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:58,809
If he's dead... or alive.

531
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:04,882
Papá.

532
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,685
What the hell was that?

533
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,553
Okay.

534
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:13,490
Oh!

535
00:35:16,994 --> 00:35:18,294
Where you going?

536
00:35:18,328 --> 00:35:20,730
Getting a shot of it.
Lead cameraman.

537
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:21,831
There is a reason.

538
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:36,079
Where are you? Huh?

539
00:35:36,113 --> 00:35:39,315
Where are you? Come on.

540
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:41,250
Show me your face.

541
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,686
You know what I think?

542
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:48,489
You haven't got the balls
to come out here.

543
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:52,560
Here you go.

544
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:57,933
Aah!

545
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:01,436
Oh, my God.

546
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,604
It's following us.

547
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:12,981
Get inside.

548
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:23,558
Damn it.

549
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:30,431
Oh, great.
Someone grew a pair.

550
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:32,333
Suck it. I'm getting the shot.

551
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:53,487
Watch out! It's here! Oh!

552
00:36:57,725 --> 00:36:59,259
Fuck, fuck, that was close.

553
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:08,968
- Watch out! It's coming back!
- Ohh!

554
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:37,180
Uhh! Fuck oh, my God. Fuck.

555
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:39,282
It's Sammy. Sammy.

556
00:37:39,317 --> 00:37:40,583
Sammy's dead.

557
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:42,552
What? What do you mean,
he's dead? What?

558
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:44,621
He's out there, and he's dead.
I don't know what happened--

559
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:46,889
- What the hell are you talking about?
- He was just there, and now he's gone.

560
00:37:46,923 --> 00:37:48,524
- AJ!
- I don't give a fuck!

561
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,827
AJ! AJ, what are you--

562
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:02,371
Ohh!

563
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:05,074
It's going for the engines!

564
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Come on! Get it going!

565
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,015
I...

566
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,350
The engine's dead!

567
00:38:14,384 --> 00:38:15,918
Come on.

568
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:20,288
Come on!

569
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:31,899
The engine-- Can you fix it?

570
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,336
Si prueba demasiada sangre
no tenemos a dónde correr.

571
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:41,176
Lincoln, what are you doing?

572
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,677
Same thing my father did.

573
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:44,512
I'm gonna trap it.

574
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:49,084
Anything?!
Can you see it?!

575
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:55,890
Lincoln, what are you doing?!

576
00:38:57,492 --> 00:39:00,194
No, no, no, wait! Wait!

577
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:03,965
Lincoln...

578
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:07,201
Come on...

579
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:22,282
Aah!

580
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:24,350
Uhh!

581
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:44,738
- Aah!
- Uhh!

582
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:48,008
Uhh!

583
00:39:50,144 --> 00:39:51,778
Throw it overboard!

584
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:54,180
Uhh!

585
00:39:54,214 --> 00:39:55,181
- Mom!
- Lincoln...

586
00:39:55,215 --> 00:39:57,216
Mom, are you okay?

587
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:24,377
<i>Watch out! It's coming back!</i>

588
00:40:25,845 --> 00:40:29,014
You shouldn't have
let him up there.

589
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:31,083
He made his choice.

590
00:40:37,223 --> 00:40:39,158
Well, Emmet's tapes--
Golden ticket.

591
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:41,326
Mm.

592
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,095
Hundred of 'em.

593
00:40:58,611 --> 00:41:00,946
What are you up to, Kurt?

594
00:41:05,818 --> 00:41:08,586
Mess with my camera.
You bastard.

595
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,387
Missed one.

596
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:13,691
Gotcha.

597
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:17,428
<i>Emmet Cole saw more</i>
<i>than we thought.</i>

598
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:20,064
<i>He may be alive if he is.</i>

599
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,800
<i>And if he found The Source,</i>
<i>I'll put him down.</i>

600
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:42,252
How you feeling?

601
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:43,887
Fine.

602
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:48,491
AJ, give us a minute,
would you?

603
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:58,501
I thought I knew your father.

604
00:41:58,535 --> 00:42:00,070
Me, too.

605
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:04,407
The last dated tape
shows him headed west,

606
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:06,542
towards the mountains.

607
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:10,846
But we don't have to do this.
We can go home.

608
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:14,083
No, mom, dad's alive.

609
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,718
You were right
to drag us out here.

610
00:42:16,753 --> 00:42:21,490
We're gonna look through
every single one of those tapes.

611
00:42:21,524 --> 00:42:22,691
We're gonna follow
every move he made

612
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:24,760
until we find him.

613
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:28,230
You sure?

614
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:32,067
You wanna give up everything
to believe it's some ghost?

615
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:35,637
Dad was on to something.

616
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:37,206
And you know what?

617
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:42,077
There <i>is</i> magic out there.

618
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:44,313
So let's go see it.

619
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,620
You know there's a camera
right there.

620
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:53,922
I know.

621
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:24,529
*

622
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:27,099
for all the magic
there is out there,

623
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:29,367
there's even more magic right
here at home with your family.

624
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:32,938
So from all of us
at "The Undiscovered Country"...

625
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:35,641
Happy holidays!

626
00:43:35,675 --> 00:43:36,775
Bye!

627
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,110
Cut!

628
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:40,011
- Presents. Ready for presents?
- All right, here we go.

629
00:43:40,045 --> 00:43:42,446
Okay! Merry Christmas!

630
00:43:44,616 --> 00:43:45,850
Here you go.

631
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:47,785
Hey.

632
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,186
Here, Lena.

633
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,221
Just a little something
for you.

634
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:53,423
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

635
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:55,392
♪ and down the chimney
with old Saint Nick ♪

636
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:58,029
♪

637
00:43:58,063 --> 00:44:01,799
Just put Marbeley down
for a second.

638
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:04,135
Okay, he can strum.
He-- he can play with him.

639
00:44:04,169 --> 00:44:06,370
Just like Christmas
back home, eh?

640
00:44:06,404 --> 00:44:09,106
He wanted to give Lincoln
a little bit of normal, Clark.

641
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:36,933
¡A toda máquina!
¡Ella vive!

642
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,803
Claro que sí está viva.

643
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,185
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, mate.
- Oh, bollocks.

644
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,987
We need a new camera operator.

645
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:01,990
Yeah? Well, the last one got
his head taken off by a ghost.

646
00:45:02,025 --> 00:45:04,327
So... good luck with that.

647
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,972
Hey, Jahel.

648
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:24,613
Había un agujero perforado en la cabeza del
cilindro que estaba derramando el aceite.

649
00:45:24,647 --> 00:45:28,416
You're really not gonna learn
English ever, are ya?

650
00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:31,720
Yeah.

651
00:45:31,754 --> 00:45:34,055
Emmet's journal says that
he and my dad were right there.

652
00:45:34,089 --> 00:45:35,590
But when?
A month ago? A year ago?

653
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,792
Before or after
they went missing?

654
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:39,827
We need to know
where they were last.

655
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,597
We need to establish
a time line.

656
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:47,469
What about Emmet's tapes?
He shot so much footage here.

657
00:45:47,503 --> 00:45:50,171
If we could tie him visually
to a location--

658
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,172
Yeah, I've been trying, mom,
but there's 104 tapes,

659
00:45:52,206 --> 00:45:53,940
and there's s no way to put them
in any kind of order.

660
00:45:53,975 --> 00:45:55,909
About a month before
he lost contact with Emmet,

661
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:57,811
he told me that he had
a bug bite on his thumb

662
00:45:57,845 --> 00:46:00,013
that got infected.
He couldn't get rid of it.

663
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:01,882
He asked me to research
some sort of medical treatment.

664
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,684
Well, how does that help us?

665
00:46:03,718 --> 00:46:04,951
We track the bite on the tapes.

666
00:46:04,986 --> 00:46:07,388
The worse the infection,
the later the date.

667
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:09,523
It could give us
some sort of direction.

668
00:46:11,192 --> 00:46:12,426
One of the strays swam up.

669
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,495
He's refusing to leave the boat.

670
00:46:15,764 --> 00:46:18,832
<i>The camera. Yeah.</i>

671
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:20,601
<i>Yeah.</i>

672
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,973
Put the next one in.

673
00:46:32,646 --> 00:46:35,381
Okay, wait.
Hey, look at the bite there.

674
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:37,249
It's fresh, so that means that
tape must be from earlier.

675
00:46:37,284 --> 00:46:39,151
Put the next one in.

676
00:46:46,293 --> 00:46:51,297
Look.
See how bad the infection is?

677
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:52,465
Mm-hmm.

678
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:54,600
So this tape
must be more recent.

679
00:46:56,837 --> 00:46:59,705
Great, so dad's tapes-- So far
we've got eight possible sites,

680
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:01,640
but any one of them could be
his last recording.

681
00:47:01,674 --> 00:47:03,843
Well, that's more than we had
this morning.

682
00:47:03,877 --> 00:47:05,477
Pick one,
and we'll start there.

683
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:08,214
Could be dangerous.
We should warn the crew.

684
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:10,549
Everyone on this boat
has been to the Amazon before.

685
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,918
Well, they haven't been here
to the Boiuna.

686
00:47:12,953 --> 00:47:14,553
I mean, hell, according to
every map ever made,

687
00:47:14,587 --> 00:47:16,488
this place doesn't even exist.

688
00:47:16,522 --> 00:47:19,291
Come on. Anyone who doesn't want
to stay, we should let 'em go.

689
00:47:19,326 --> 00:47:21,060
Excuse me.

690
00:47:22,229 --> 00:47:24,529
Here's the reality, Lincoln.

691
00:47:24,564 --> 00:47:26,899
You let Kurt go,
who's gonna protect us?

692
00:47:26,933 --> 00:47:30,402
Hmm? Emilio and his daughter--
They keep the ship running.

693
00:47:30,403 --> 00:47:34,478
Everyone is on this boat because
we need them to find Emmet.

694
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:37,609
You let any one of them go,

695
00:47:37,643 --> 00:47:39,978
you're letting your father go,
too.

696
00:49:18,976 --> 00:49:21,611
Tess?

697
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:25,882
¿Qué haces aquí?

698
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:28,685
You shouldn't have come here.

699
00:49:31,956 --> 00:49:33,723
Not Jahel.

700
00:49:33,757 --> 00:49:35,892
It's not Jahel.

701
00:49:40,664 --> 00:49:42,665
Emmet?

702
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:47,769
It can't be you.

703
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,394
Tess, you need to let me go.

704
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:12,794
What?

705
00:50:14,664 --> 00:50:15,898
They have me, Tess.

706
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:17,766
I'm not leaving you.

707
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,035
Who has you?

708
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:22,571
This place--
I shouldn't have come.

709
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:24,205
Save yourselves.

710
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,774
Take Lincoln and go.

711
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:27,809
Emmet!

712
00:50:27,844 --> 00:50:31,713
Emmet! Emmet!

713
00:50:31,748 --> 00:50:33,381
Emmet!

714
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:34,983
Lincoln!

715
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,815
It was him.

716
00:50:44,816 --> 00:50:45,916
Tess...

717
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,818
I know my husband.

718
00:50:47,852 --> 00:50:49,886
Sometimes when we want something
badly enough,

719
00:50:49,887 --> 00:50:51,354
we can imagine it--

720
00:50:51,355 --> 00:50:52,823
I did not imagine this...

721
00:50:52,857 --> 00:50:55,959
Emilio, has, uh, Jahel ever done
anything like this before?

722
00:50:55,993 --> 00:50:58,294
No.

723
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:02,898
So <i>if</i> somehow
that was your husband,

724
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:06,369
maybe you'd should listen
to him, turn around, go home.

725
00:51:06,403 --> 00:51:08,037
If it was someone you loved,

726
00:51:08,071 --> 00:51:10,707
could you just
leave them alone to die?

727
00:51:10,741 --> 00:51:14,244
Yes.

728
00:51:14,278 --> 00:51:16,178
And I have.

729
00:51:16,213 --> 00:51:19,148
Well, I'm not going to.

730
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:21,651
Emmet gave us a lead.

731
00:51:21,685 --> 00:51:23,953
He said, <i>"they</i> have me."

732
00:51:23,987 --> 00:51:26,222
Mom, who's "they"?
We don't even know who that is.

733
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:28,558
- Who has him?
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

734
00:51:28,592 --> 00:51:29,892
In all of Emmet's last tapes,

735
00:51:29,926 --> 00:51:31,227
it shows him alone with his crew
except for one.

736
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:32,729
In it, he's, um...
In the mountains,

737
00:51:32,763 --> 00:51:34,897
talking to some kind
of local militia.

738
00:51:34,931 --> 00:51:36,398
Pull up that tape.

739
00:51:36,432 --> 00:51:38,367
Let's find what piece of jungle
these guys call home.

740
00:51:38,401 --> 00:51:40,970
All I need is a direction.
Clark, get your cameras ready.

741
00:51:41,004 --> 00:51:43,873
We're gonna rescue Emmet Cole
today.

742
00:51:48,411 --> 00:51:50,312
Just so we're clear,

743
00:51:50,346 --> 00:51:52,782
a little girl
who talks to ghosts

744
00:51:52,816 --> 00:51:54,950
says...

745
00:51:54,985 --> 00:51:56,218
"Don't go,"

746
00:51:56,253 --> 00:51:58,120
And we're going.

747
00:51:58,155 --> 00:51:59,354
Yeah.

748
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:01,223
Emilio?

749
00:52:03,293 --> 00:52:06,360
If Emmet-- Uh, if Jahel says
anything else, you radio me.

750
00:52:06,395 --> 00:52:07,528
¿Entendiste?

751
00:52:07,562 --> 00:52:09,597
Actually, a better idea--
Film it.

752
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:11,599
Come on.

753
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:35,222
AJ,
grab the camera. Let's go.

754
00:52:35,256 --> 00:52:36,557
Yeah, yeah.

755
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:39,226
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

756
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,394
So you really think

757
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:42,262
that was Emmet channeling
through Jahel?

758
00:52:42,297 --> 00:52:44,164
I know it was.
You should put the camera down,

759
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:45,466
watch where you're walking,
Clark.

760
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,901
You forget I did start life out
as a camera operat--

761
00:52:47,936 --> 00:52:48,902
Ow!

762
00:52:48,937 --> 00:52:51,305
Yeah, so carry on, carry on.

763
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,541
Emmet's alive,
and we're gonna find him.

764
00:52:53,575 --> 00:52:57,377
And if we do, what's the first
thing you're gonna say to him?

765
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:58,812
I'm gonna tell him I'm sorry.

766
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:00,313
What are you talking about?
He's the one that left <i>you</i>

767
00:53:00,348 --> 00:53:02,114
to go on this insane quest
to find magic.

768
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:03,516
- Shouldn't he be the one to apologize?
- Hey.

769
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:05,084
It-- It's all right, Lincoln.
Clark is incapable

770
00:53:05,118 --> 00:53:08,287
of asking a question
without trying to get a rise.

771
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:11,658
Yes, Emmet left me.

772
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:13,960
We've all done things
we regret.

773
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:16,563
I know I have.

774
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:25,037
Thanks.

775
00:53:25,072 --> 00:53:27,907
So you and my dad--
You talked a lot, huh?

776
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:30,509
Just when he needed help.

777
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:32,511
Research, technical support.

778
00:53:32,545 --> 00:53:33,679
Or medical help.

779
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:35,915
Here we go.

780
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:38,784
Is that why
you're pissed at me?

781
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:40,052
- I'm-- I'm not pissed at you. I'm--
- Yes, you are.

782
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:41,420
No, I'm not.

783
00:53:41,454 --> 00:53:42,922
You're pissed
because instead of coming

784
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:45,157
to his son
who graduated medical school,

785
00:53:45,192 --> 00:53:47,193
he came to me.

786
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:50,062
He had a question,
and I was there.

787
00:53:50,097 --> 00:53:51,364
There's something to that,
you know--

788
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:55,167
Being there
when people need you.

789
00:53:55,202 --> 00:53:57,270
Be right back.

790
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:58,971
Don't separate.

791
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:00,506
Stay with the group!

792
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,840
I've got business.

793
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:03,809
Don't take too well to company.
Sorry, mate.

794
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,812
He and I need to talk.

795
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:13,585
Hold on.

796
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:20,526
You're not jungle.

797
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,093
Guys!

798
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:30,135
Why would there be
a graveyard out here?

799
00:54:30,169 --> 00:54:32,203
I thought the locals
didn't bury in the ground.

800
00:54:32,238 --> 00:54:35,373
They don't.

801
00:54:37,576 --> 00:54:40,412
Wow. What is this?

802
00:54:42,415 --> 00:54:45,016
"Sir Henry Nevins.

803
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:48,253
Hero to the crown."

804
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:50,788
It seems like sir Nevins and I
are both a long way from home.

805
00:54:50,823 --> 00:54:52,991
"The tree that weeps."

806
00:54:53,025 --> 00:54:56,161
British colonial rubber barons
came over in the 19th century.

807
00:54:56,195 --> 00:54:57,695
Devastated the rain forests,

808
00:54:57,729 --> 00:55:00,065
slaughtered the natives-- If they
didn't work them to death.

809
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:04,535
Mm. Made a fortune. That's what
they called playing hero.

810
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,238
Shh, shh, shh.

811
00:55:07,273 --> 00:55:08,606
Did you hear something?

812
00:55:13,278 --> 00:55:16,013
It's coming
from this way. Go!

813
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,991
Wait.

814
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,897
<i>Mommy.</i>

815
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,004
Hey.

816
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:41,270
What's that?

817
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:45,475
- Is that...
- Whoa.

818
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,543
Is that a child?

819
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:52,615
Hello?

820
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:54,484
Hello?

821
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:57,920
Honey?

822
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:58,988
Hello?

823
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,357
Hola, chiquita.
¿Estás sola?

824
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,868
Hey.

825
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,070
Hi.

826
00:56:22,578 --> 00:56:23,711
Oh!

827
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,889
Jesus fucking Christ!

828
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:37,526
How the fuck does a monkey
get a doll's head out here?!

829
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,328
I think I can see how.

830
00:57:02,617 --> 00:57:04,452
Oh, fuck.

831
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,229
I've heard about
places like these.

832
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,598
They're called spirit trees.

833
00:57:17,632 --> 00:57:19,633
When locals believe that
the woods are home to a spirit,

834
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,734
they sometimes leave gifts.

835
00:57:21,768 --> 00:57:23,970
Why dolls?

836
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:31,578
This is a graveyard.

837
00:57:33,147 --> 00:57:34,747
Mom.

838
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:38,284
What is it?
Did you find something?

839
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:43,623
Oh, my God.

840
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:49,395
That's my bear, Marbeley.

841
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:53,899
How?

842
00:57:53,934 --> 00:57:56,802
Emmet.
He must've been here.

843
00:57:56,837 --> 00:57:58,671
He must have put the bear
in that tree.

844
00:57:58,705 --> 00:58:00,840
We picked the right trail.
He must be close.

845
00:58:00,874 --> 00:58:04,243
Sun's going down. We have to
camp here for the night.

846
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:06,779
Here? With all the dolls?

847
00:58:06,813 --> 00:58:09,281
Oh, yes, please.
AJ, let's set up some cameras.

848
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:11,651
Let's mine this gold, okay?
High angles from the top--

849
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:14,854
Tree shots.
Way ahead of you.

850
00:58:14,888 --> 00:58:16,321
Wait. No, no,
we can't stay here.

851
00:58:16,356 --> 00:58:18,357
If we press on, we could
find Emmet by morning.

852
00:58:18,391 --> 00:58:20,259
At night out here,
the only thing you will find

853
00:58:20,293 --> 00:58:22,294
are ways to get killed.

854
00:58:22,328 --> 00:58:24,263
We'll pick up his trail
in the morning.

855
00:58:24,297 --> 00:58:25,631
This is not an option.

856
00:58:29,501 --> 00:58:31,136
How many have you got set up?

857
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,004
- One, two...
- What else? Show me?

858
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:34,906
Three, four, five, six.

859
00:59:50,196 --> 00:59:52,497
Mm.

860
00:59:52,532 --> 00:59:53,665
Tess?

861
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,833
Mm-hmm?

862
00:59:54,867 --> 00:59:56,167
- You okay?
- Yes.

863
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:57,636
Think we're gonna find Emmet
tomorrow? Or at all?

864
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:58,970
You know, Clark,
you've been on me all day.

865
00:59:59,004 --> 01:00:00,605
Would you just give it a rest,
all right?

866
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,773
- You know, I just want a-- Just--
I just want a quick-- - Yeah, you--

867
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:03,675
- Give me a quick one.
- What do you mean?

868
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,909
- Come on, give it to me. Give it to me.
Pass it over. - What are you talking about?

869
01:00:04,944 --> 01:00:06,077
Don't handle the camera
like that.

870
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:07,912
- Hang on.
- You focused?

871
01:00:07,947 --> 01:00:09,748
- Yeah, hang on. I got it. Just-- just fix
your-- - Don't fuss with it. Come on.

872
01:00:09,782 --> 01:00:11,082
All right, then.
What about you?

873
01:00:11,116 --> 01:00:12,818
What are you doing here
in the middle of the jungle,

874
01:00:12,852 --> 01:00:14,486
looking for Emmet?

875
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,121
Hmm.
That's a good question.

876
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:19,057
And do you really care
if we find him?

877
01:00:19,091 --> 01:00:23,862
Wow. I forget how little
you think of me sometimes.

878
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:25,330
Here's the deal.

879
01:00:25,364 --> 01:00:27,698
Everybody always thought that
Emmet and I hated each other.

880
01:00:27,733 --> 01:00:30,133
You know? I mean, it's probably
'cause we spent so much time

881
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,135
arguing over every last frame
of the show.

882
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,772
But...
You know.

883
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:36,774
The thing with him
is that--

884
01:00:36,808 --> 01:00:39,109
What he never got was that
the show, this whole thing,

885
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:43,213
it wasn't about adventure
or magic.

886
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:45,983
It's about product.

887
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,686
Right?

888
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,390
But he was, uh...

889
01:00:52,424 --> 01:00:54,258
He was incorruptible,
wasn't he?

890
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:57,261
I did love that about him.

891
01:00:57,295 --> 01:00:58,796
Here, give it back to me then.

892
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,964
Give it back to me.

893
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:02,299
Now... back to the real job.

894
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:05,635
Good night, Clark.

895
01:01:05,669 --> 01:01:07,837
Night, Tess.

896
01:01:18,616 --> 01:01:19,983
Hey, Lincoln.

897
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:22,052
Hey.

898
01:01:22,086 --> 01:01:26,957
Long ago, when I was hiking
in Mali,

899
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:30,527
I met a man high up
in the Bandiagara cliffs--

900
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:34,398
A shaman who was
old as the hills

901
01:01:34,432 --> 01:01:35,765
and said he would never die.

902
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:41,871
And he said to me,
"Life and death are the same,

903
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,407
like a weight on a clock.

904
01:01:44,442 --> 01:01:47,977
That swings back and forth.

905
01:01:48,011 --> 01:01:50,547
"Tick to tock."

906
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:55,184
Then he said the clock
was getting very old

907
01:01:55,218 --> 01:01:56,586
and was waiting for someone
strong enough

908
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:00,289
to cut the weight
and stop the swing.

909
01:02:00,324 --> 01:02:03,159
And all the time
he's telling me this,

910
01:02:03,193 --> 01:02:04,661
that his old wife--

911
01:02:04,695 --> 01:02:07,564
Who was also as old as the hills
and would never, ever die--

912
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:12,034
Was making...

913
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:13,902
This.

914
01:02:18,908 --> 01:02:21,777
And she gave it to me
and she said

915
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:24,046
that one day,
I would meet a child

916
01:02:24,081 --> 01:02:27,483
who was strong enough.

917
01:02:27,517 --> 01:02:28,985
To do what?

918
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:30,386
Well, that's for the child
to know.

919
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,056
My place in things was that...

920
01:02:34,091 --> 01:02:36,892
I would know the one

921
01:02:36,926 --> 01:02:40,729
when I saw him.

922
01:02:40,763 --> 01:02:42,798
And when I did,

923
01:02:42,832 --> 01:02:45,867
I should give him this.

924
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:51,939
What if I lose it?

925
01:02:55,478 --> 01:02:58,146
We never lose
the things that matter.

926
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:08,589
I'm-- I'm sorry.

927
01:03:11,394 --> 01:03:12,860
It's just-- My dad and I,

928
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:17,297
we barely spoke
the year before he went missing.

929
01:03:17,332 --> 01:03:21,935
My mom had no idea what
he was up to. But you?

930
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:25,772
You knew everything
he was doing.

931
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,841
Not everything.

932
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:33,447
Marbeley.

933
01:03:33,481 --> 01:03:35,449
I remember this guy.

934
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:38,485
You used to carry him
everywhere.

935
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,087
Yeah.

936
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:43,390
We'd, uh, we'd watched
"A Christmas Carol."

937
01:03:43,425 --> 01:03:46,260
Jacob Marley
was my favorite part.

938
01:03:46,294 --> 01:03:47,928
"Marbeley."

939
01:03:50,865 --> 01:03:53,566
First ghost you ever saw.

940
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,733
Yeah.

941
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:59,372
I thought you lost him
years ago.

942
01:03:59,406 --> 01:04:01,974
I did.

943
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:03,876
When I was, uh, 16,

944
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:06,412
I pitched him
into the Indian ocean,

945
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:10,149
swore I'd never set foot
on the the "Magus" again.

946
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:13,519
Next day,
I left for boarding school.

947
01:04:13,554 --> 01:04:15,521
Bit dramatic, in retrospect.

948
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:20,793
Your dad must've
gotten him back.

949
01:04:20,827 --> 01:04:23,596
Or the doll tree
has friends in Sumatra.

950
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:27,466
Well...

951
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:31,236
When I was a little kid,

952
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:33,972
my whole life was this bear.

953
01:04:34,006 --> 01:04:35,974
And my dad...

954
01:04:36,008 --> 01:04:37,642
<i>You know, he made me feel</i>

955
01:04:37,676 --> 01:04:40,812
<i>like I was the only thing in</i>
<i>the whole world that mattered.</i>

956
01:04:40,846 --> 01:04:43,081
<i>You know?</i>

957
01:04:43,116 --> 01:04:45,783
Like I was the light
in his life.

958
01:04:47,953 --> 01:04:49,887
You know...

959
01:04:49,922 --> 01:04:54,226
One day, that light went off.

960
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,560
I don't know why,

961
01:04:55,595 --> 01:04:57,496
but nothing I could do
could flick it back on again.

962
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,831
You know?

963
01:04:59,865 --> 01:05:02,667
I mean, I knew he loved me,
but...

964
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:05,336
Whatever quest he was on,

965
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,304
I wasn't on the map.

966
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,445
I know that you think there's
some reason that he came to me

967
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:18,883
instead of you or your mom.
But...

968
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:20,184
I...

969
01:05:24,156 --> 01:05:26,991
I think he was just trying
to protect you.

970
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:31,295
He knew what he was doing
out here,

971
01:05:31,329 --> 01:05:35,199
that he'd be inviting in...

972
01:05:35,233 --> 01:05:36,733
Darkness.

973
01:05:39,037 --> 01:05:43,340
He wouldn't ever risk
exposing you or Tess to that.

974
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:45,042
But <i>me?</i>

975
01:05:48,246 --> 01:05:50,080
He could risk me.

976
01:05:52,717 --> 01:05:55,686
All these dolls. I can't sleep.

977
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,374
Ah.

978
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:20,376
Actually, you're a good one.

979
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:21,811
You're like
Jane Austen's Binkie, aren't ya?

980
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:24,180
All right, well,
it's just you and me, Bink.

981
01:06:24,215 --> 01:06:27,350
So just open those eyes for me.
Do it on camera just once.

982
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:29,719
That'd be fantastic. Yeah?

983
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:31,354
Please?

984
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:32,855
For Uncle AJ?

985
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:35,224
Yeah?

986
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:36,791
Come on.

987
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,294
Any spirits out there?

988
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:43,932
I dare you,
open that doll's eyes.

989
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,402
Go ahead. Bet you can't.

990
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:50,472
God, you're boring me now.

991
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,342
Come on. Do it.

992
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,949
I'm going to bed.

993
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,385
I'm going to bed.

994
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:48,829
Aah! Oh!

995
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,198
- Uhh! Aah!
- Lincoln?

996
01:07:51,232 --> 01:07:52,365
Lincoln!

997
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,867
- Get off me! Mom!
- What did-- What happened?

998
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:56,069
- Who grabbed me?!
- Grabbed? Everyone was sleeping.

999
01:07:56,104 --> 01:07:58,071
Then how the hell
did I end up over here?

1000
01:07:58,106 --> 01:08:01,874
Huh? Huh?

1001
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:03,642
Oh, this is...

1002
01:08:09,749 --> 01:08:11,750
Where you going?

1003
01:08:11,785 --> 01:08:14,020
Anywhere but here.
We're all leaving now.

1004
01:08:14,054 --> 01:08:15,955
You won't survive at night
in the jungle.

1005
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:18,791
Yeah? Stop us.

1006
01:08:18,826 --> 01:08:21,593
This way. Let's go.

1007
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:27,967
- Watch that rock.
- Yeah.

1008
01:08:28,001 --> 01:08:30,036
It's just a stream.
Don't worry about it.

1009
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:31,970
Aah! Something grabbed me!

1010
01:08:32,004 --> 01:08:33,604
- Aah!
- Give me a rope!

1011
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:36,274
Help me! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1012
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:38,043
Tess, hold on!

1013
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:42,513
Clark, grab the camera!

1014
01:08:42,548 --> 01:08:43,648
Quick!

1015
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:47,385
Get her out of there!

1016
01:09:19,425 --> 01:09:21,961
AJ! AJ, camera.

1017
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:24,096
Are you okay?

1018
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,341
Okay. Hmm?

1019
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:38,110
Tómate esto.

1020
01:09:38,145 --> 01:09:40,812
No?

1021
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:47,585
Tengo que aguantar...

1022
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:06,337
Mm.

1023
01:10:21,452 --> 01:10:23,887
They won't.

1024
01:10:23,922 --> 01:10:25,555
I know what's out there.

1025
01:10:25,589 --> 01:10:27,825
I have to protect them.

1026
01:10:27,859 --> 01:10:30,593
From what?

1027
01:10:34,999 --> 01:10:37,968
Something--
<i>Someone</i> was grabbing me.

1028
01:10:38,002 --> 01:10:39,469
Okay.

1029
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:41,571
So what you're saying then...

1030
01:10:41,605 --> 01:10:43,907
Is that
someone is in this stream

1031
01:10:43,942 --> 01:10:49,078
in-- what, less than...
half a foot of water?

1032
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:51,348
Are you sure?

1033
01:10:51,382 --> 01:10:54,183
Easy on the lady, Clark.
I saw a hand grab her.

1034
01:10:54,218 --> 01:10:55,985
Stay out of this please, AJ.

1035
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:57,920
I see a dead hand
reaching out of the ground,

1036
01:10:57,955 --> 01:10:59,489
I'm damn well staying in it.

1037
01:10:59,523 --> 01:11:01,558
I mean, we both pulled her out.
What do <i>you</i> think happened?

1038
01:11:01,592 --> 01:11:03,760
Like I said, thank you.

1039
01:11:03,794 --> 01:11:05,595
Wait. I remember we used to sit
around the campfire,

1040
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:07,163
and Emmet...

1041
01:11:07,197 --> 01:11:10,299
He'd tell stories,
legends from wherever we were.

1042
01:11:10,334 --> 01:11:12,535
And there's this one
from the Amazon.

1043
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:14,303
<i>La dejada--</i>
The abandoned one.

1044
01:11:14,338 --> 01:11:16,005
Do you remember?

1045
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,173
Mnh-mnh.

1046
01:11:19,076 --> 01:11:21,610
There's a little girl
from far away

1047
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,812
<i>whose mother was too busy</i>
<i>for her...</i>

1048
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,816
<i>So she plays by herself</i>
<i>in the forest.</i>

1049
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:30,419
<i>One day, her doll falls</i>
<i>in the river.</i>

1050
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,320
<i>Her mother isn't there</i>
<i>to help her, so...</i>

1051
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:34,823
<i>She goes in by herself</i>
<i>to try to get it,</i>

1052
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:36,291
but she falls in and drowns.

1053
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:40,763
They never find her body.
They can't even bury her.

1054
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,298
They say
her spirit gets lonely,

1055
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:47,068
so... she brings people
to the river to drown.

1056
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:48,570
So many people have died,

1057
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:53,776
locals began leaving her gifts
so she'd leave them alone.

1058
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,978
Maybe this tree is for her.

1059
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:58,346
She must've been

1060
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:00,048
from one of the old
British colonial families.

1061
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,083
Well...

1062
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:05,353
That explains the dolls.
But why is it coming after us?

1063
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:06,888
I don't know.

1064
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:15,263
You took this from the tree?

1065
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:16,764
Come on, man.

1066
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,699
It's hard enough to believe
there's a ghost out here,

1067
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,368
but one that's mad
we took its toys?

1068
01:12:20,403 --> 01:12:22,404
Please.

1069
01:12:30,178 --> 01:12:32,846
Give it back.

1070
01:12:34,215 --> 01:12:37,284
Can't believe I'm doing this.

1071
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:45,592
Lincoln.

1072
01:12:46,928 --> 01:12:49,964
Okay, I'm-- I'm sorry
I took <i>my</i> bear

1073
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:52,666
There. You happy now?

1074
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:57,438
I think we're all past
a good night's sleep.

1075
01:12:57,472 --> 01:12:59,273
The sun's coming up soon.

1076
01:12:59,307 --> 01:13:00,507
Let's pick up
your husband's trail.

1077
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,421
Put it back.
Tie it carefully.

1078
01:13:15,456 --> 01:13:17,590
- I <i>did.</i>
- Do it again.

1079
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:40,245
Sorry.

1080
01:14:14,179 --> 01:14:15,812
Give me the bear.

1081
01:15:00,324 --> 01:15:01,657
Aah! Aah!

1082
01:15:05,463 --> 01:15:07,762
What do you want from us?!

1083
01:15:07,797 --> 01:15:10,732
<i>Mommy.</i>

1084
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,293
- This way! We can make it
to the "Magus." - Go!

1085
01:15:21,327 --> 01:15:23,628
- This way! - As fast as you can!
Fast as you-- Come on!

1086
01:15:25,564 --> 01:15:28,166
- Oh, my God!
- Hurry up, mom!

1087
01:15:30,603 --> 01:15:31,703
Go!

1088
01:15:32,871 --> 01:15:34,806
- Run! Stay together!
- Okay.

1089
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,841
Oh, my God. Okay.

1090
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,742
Stay together, guys!

1091
01:15:38,777 --> 01:15:40,044
Come on!

1092
01:15:40,078 --> 01:15:42,346
Aah!

1093
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,714
We're almost
at the "Magus."

1094
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,283
Go! Go! Come on!

1095
01:15:45,317 --> 01:15:47,852
Um... the doll tree?!

1096
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,390
You...

1097
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:56,027
You led us right back here?

1098
01:15:56,061 --> 01:15:57,728
We were going the right way.

1099
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,463
What, so the tree brought us
back here?!

1100
01:15:59,497 --> 01:16:02,099
Huh? Come on!

1101
01:16:03,969 --> 01:16:07,938
It did this. It's trying to trap
us. What does it want from us?

1102
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:11,541
I think it's pretty clear.

1103
01:16:14,812 --> 01:16:16,246
Where's my mom?

1104
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,581
She was right behind me.

1105
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:19,883
- She's not here.
- Tess!

1106
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:21,051
Tess?

1107
01:16:21,085 --> 01:16:23,119
Tess!
Mom! Where is she?

1108
01:16:23,154 --> 01:16:24,387
- Aah!
- Mom?!

1109
01:16:24,421 --> 01:16:25,555
Tess!

1110
01:16:25,589 --> 01:16:28,291
Where is she?! Who saw her?!
Who-- What-- Mom!

1111
01:16:28,326 --> 01:16:29,893
- Tess!
- Tess!

1112
01:16:29,927 --> 01:16:32,662
She was right here.
She was right here. Tess!

1113
01:16:32,696 --> 01:16:33,830
Tess!

1114
01:16:33,865 --> 01:16:36,599
It's to our left.

1115
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:37,967
Hold on!

1116
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:40,503
- Aah! Aah!
- Mom!

1117
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,775
Help!

1118
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:48,411
- Tess! Tess!
- Where is she?!

1119
01:16:48,445 --> 01:16:49,746
Mom!

1120
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,014
I can't see anything!

1121
01:16:52,048 --> 01:16:54,049
- She's in here somewhere!
- Aah!

1122
01:16:54,084 --> 01:16:55,885
We all saw her drown.

1123
01:16:55,919 --> 01:16:58,120
Guys, over here!

1124
01:16:58,154 --> 01:17:00,055
Uhh! Keep looking!

1125
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,223
<i>Lincoln!</i>

1126
01:17:01,258 --> 01:17:02,392
- Tess!
- Mom?

1127
01:17:02,426 --> 01:17:03,426
- Oh, my God. Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

1128
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,261
<i>Lincoln.</i>

1129
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,997
Mom! Where the hell is she?!

1130
01:17:09,031 --> 01:17:10,499
Tess!

1131
01:17:10,533 --> 01:17:12,100
- Mom!
<i>- Lincoln.</i>

1132
01:17:12,134 --> 01:17:14,736
Where are you?!

1133
01:17:14,771 --> 01:17:17,572
<i>Lincoln!</i>

1134
01:17:17,607 --> 01:17:18,907
Where the hell is she?!

1135
01:17:18,941 --> 01:17:20,308
- Wait.
- Mom!

1136
01:17:21,911 --> 01:17:23,412
Wait.
Listen to her voice.

1137
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:24,979
It sounds like
they're in the same place.

1138
01:17:25,014 --> 01:17:26,180
<i>- Lincoln!</i>
- Where?! Where?!

1139
01:17:26,215 --> 01:17:27,516
It doesn't matter.

1140
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:28,983
If she can take my mom,
she can give her back.

1141
01:17:29,018 --> 01:17:31,853
How do we get her to do that?

1142
01:17:31,888 --> 01:17:34,956
We give her
what she really wants.

1143
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,892
You've gotta be kidding me.

1144
01:17:36,926 --> 01:17:39,093
If she wants her mother,
we'll give her her mother.

1145
01:17:40,663 --> 01:17:42,897
Just keep looking, okay?
Just look!

1146
01:17:42,931 --> 01:17:44,865
What the hell is this?

1147
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,199
Here.

1148
01:17:46,234 --> 01:17:48,101
That's Nevins.

1149
01:17:50,204 --> 01:17:51,972
There's one here.

1150
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:54,174
- That it? - No, no, no, no.
This isn't the mother.

1151
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:56,310
Hey, I've got something.
I've got something here.

1152
01:17:56,344 --> 01:17:58,145
Here we go. Here we go.
It's this one.

1153
01:17:58,179 --> 01:17:59,847
"Taken by the--
Taken by the river."

1154
01:17:59,881 --> 01:18:01,849
- It's her.
- That's her, isn't it?

1155
01:18:01,883 --> 01:18:03,417
- That's the daughter.
- Where's the mother?

1156
01:18:03,452 --> 01:18:04,952
Wait.

1157
01:18:08,323 --> 01:18:11,024
She's there.

1158
01:18:13,328 --> 01:18:15,896
"Her heart broke
when love drowned."

1159
01:18:15,931 --> 01:18:19,065
That's the mother.

1160
01:18:22,069 --> 01:18:23,970
Wait.

1161
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:32,378
We gotta get in there, guys.

1162
01:18:32,412 --> 01:18:35,782
Another two or more to go.
More shovel. More shovel!

1163
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:37,350
Come on!

1164
01:18:38,919 --> 01:18:41,554
And the side.

1165
01:18:41,589 --> 01:18:43,422
We got something.

1166
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:47,927
There it is.

1167
01:19:09,516 --> 01:19:13,252
Please... give her back.

1168
01:19:26,365 --> 01:19:29,300
You have your mother.

1169
01:19:29,335 --> 01:19:31,637
I brought her to you.

1170
01:19:33,372 --> 01:19:35,106
Now give me mine.

1171
01:19:39,445 --> 01:19:41,713
Come on! Give her back!

1172
01:19:42,982 --> 01:19:45,216
Give her back!

1173
01:19:55,443 --> 01:19:56,509
I mean, how could
she just disappear like that?

1174
01:19:56,544 --> 01:19:59,046
She was right here.

1175
01:20:01,115 --> 01:20:02,449
And now she's dead.

1176
01:20:02,483 --> 01:20:05,452
I mean, this-- this place
is-- is taking them both.

1177
01:20:05,486 --> 01:20:07,587
It's a fucking nightmare.

1178
01:20:07,621 --> 01:20:12,258
We shouldn't be here.
We should never have come.

1179
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,063
Now they're both gone.

1180
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:19,732
We should never have come.

1181
01:20:19,766 --> 01:20:21,468
You're not alone.

1182
01:20:43,824 --> 01:20:45,891
Lincoln!

1183
01:20:45,926 --> 01:20:48,360
Lincoln!

1184
01:20:48,394 --> 01:20:51,530
- Mom! Mom!
- Lincoln!

1185
01:20:51,564 --> 01:20:53,933
Mom!

1186
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:55,501
Aah! Lincoln!

1187
01:20:55,535 --> 01:20:57,803
Okay! Oh!

1188
01:20:57,838 --> 01:21:01,707
I couldn't breathe.
I thought I was...

1189
01:21:01,742 --> 01:21:03,275
Oh!

1190
01:21:03,309 --> 01:21:06,912
It's okay. You're back.

1191
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:12,450
Are you hurt? Let me see.

1192
01:21:12,484 --> 01:21:15,020
Let me see.
Keep the light on her.

1193
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,837
Here. You okay?

1194
01:21:39,278 --> 01:21:40,511
You need to talk to her.

1195
01:21:40,546 --> 01:21:42,913
About what?

1196
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:46,717
We got lucky with her. We might
not be with your father.

1197
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:48,553
It might be too late.

1198
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:06,537
Jahel?

1199
01:22:16,147 --> 01:22:17,614
Dad?

1200
01:22:20,885 --> 01:22:24,487
Dad, if you're still there,

1201
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:28,625
I mean, I-I know you can be,
but...

1202
01:22:28,659 --> 01:22:30,961
If you are, I...

1203
01:22:30,995 --> 01:22:33,230
I just want you to know, I...

1204
01:22:33,264 --> 01:22:35,232
I understand.

1205
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:40,370
There's a whole world
of things out there

1206
01:22:40,438 --> 01:22:44,674
that... I never knew.

1207
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:48,245
That's just terrifying. I...

1208
01:22:48,279 --> 01:22:49,679
But you knew.

1209
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,215
You know, maybe you <i>were</i>
just trying to protect me

1210
01:22:52,249 --> 01:22:55,752
all that time.

1211
01:22:55,786 --> 01:22:58,154
But now it's my turn
to protect you.

1212
01:22:59,923 --> 01:23:01,791
We're here for you.

1213
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,727
If you're still out there,

1214
01:23:04,762 --> 01:23:08,664
if there's a chance
you're still alive, then you--

1215
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:10,967
Dad?

1216
01:23:11,001 --> 01:23:12,301
Dad, can you hear me?

1217
01:23:16,473 --> 01:23:19,408
If you're anywhere, you just
tell me and I will find you.

1218
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:34,422
Perdón...

1219
01:23:36,492 --> 01:23:38,293
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay, it's okay.

1220
01:24:16,831 --> 01:24:21,478
<i>...That one day I would meet</i>
<i>a child who was strong enough.</i>

1221
01:24:47,094 --> 01:24:50,063
So how was your day?

1222
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:03,709
Hey, Russ, this autofocus
is acting up again.

1223
01:25:03,744 --> 01:25:06,746
It's just-- I guess
it's the humidity.

1224
01:25:09,716 --> 01:25:12,718
Good God. These kids are gonna
end up getting married someday.

1225
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:32,169
Lena.

1226
