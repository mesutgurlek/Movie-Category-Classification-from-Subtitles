00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:33,602
IF WE SAW ANY THING AT ALL.     
     I'M GOING TO REPORT.       

435
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,971

00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,908
         WESS, YOU COME WITH ME.
    THE REST OF YOU, BE CAREFUL.

437
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:48,884
 WHAT IS IT?                    

438
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:50,052
            I THOUGHT I SAW     
                 SOMETHING.     

439
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,619
             WHAT?              

440
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:51,987
                     OUT THERE. 

441
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:53,856
                    WELL, LIKE  
             LUMINOUS GLOBES.   

442
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,491
             I SAW THEM OUT OF  
         THE CORNER OF MY EYE.  

443
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,228
         BUT WHEN I LOOKED,     
             THEY WERE GONE.    

444
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:05,634
             WHERE'S BURT?      

445
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:10,739
                 HE'S GONE BACK 
             TO POST NUMBER 2.  

446
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:13,609
        KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN,    
     BUT DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY.

447
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,543
                     [Buzzing]  

448
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:15,977
     WHO'S OUT THERE?           
         HOLD IT!               

449
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:34,713
        [Screaming]             

450
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:52,531
BURT, WHAT HAPPENED?            
TELL ME, WHO DID IT?            

451
00:40:52,598 --> 00:40:57,203
        IT WAS...CAPTAIN,       
         CAPTAIN SALAS.         

452
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,270
             [Groans]           

453
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:08,030
WHAT'S OUT THERE, MARK?         
 WHAT'S HAPPENING?              

454
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:13,169
 THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO FIND    
OUT BEFORE THEY KILL US ALL.    

455
00:41:13,236 --> 00:41:18,991
COME ON, LET'S GET HIM INTO     
THE SHIP. GIVE ME A HAND.       

456
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:20,893
[Machine humming]               

457
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:31,970
 1 ENTIRE CREW LOST AND 2       
 OF OUR OWN CREWMEN GONE.       

458
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:34,039
    BURT DEAD,                  
    ELDON DISAPPEARED.          

459
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:36,108
AND THIS UNKNOWN ENEMY          
KEEPS GETTING CLOSER.           

460
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:37,710
[Karan] THE ENEMY IS ALSO       
    BECOMING VISIBLE.           

461
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:39,311
WHAT DO YOU                     
MEAN BY THAT?                   

462
00:41:39,379 --> 00:41:41,480
        WELL, YOU SAW           
         SOMETHING.             

463
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,081
     SOMETHING NOT              
    QUITE IDENTIFIABLE,         

464
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:44,683
 OUT OF THE CORNER              
    OF YOUR EYE.                

465
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:47,386
AS IF IT WERE COMPOSED          
OF LITTLE GLOBES OF LIGHT,      

466
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,288
SOMETHING FLEETING,             
NOTHING DEFINITE.               

467
00:41:49,355 --> 00:41:51,891
 THE MINUTE I LOOKED AT         
 THE THINGS DIRECTLY,           

468
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:53,826
                 THEY WERE GONE.

469
00:41:53,894 --> 00:41:54,894
                 [Sanya] HOW CAN
                 YOU EXPLAIN IT?

470
00:41:54,961 --> 00:41:56,161
                     [Mark]     
                 I DON'T KNOW.  

471
00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:59,498
         IT'S POSSIBLE THEY'RE  
         AN ALIEN FORM OF LIFE. 

472
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:01,801
[Dr. Karan] THAT'S TRUE. THEIR  
 FORM HERE COULD BE BASED ON    

473
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:03,168
            A DIFFERENT PLANE   
             OF VIBRATIONS.

475
00:42:05,171 --> 00:42:07,740
             EXCEPT OBLIQUELY,  
             AS YOU DID, MARK.  

476
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:10,876
     [Wess] THOSE STRANGE WAILS 
 WE HEARD COULD BE THEIR VOICES.

477
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:12,344
             THAT'S RIGHT.      

478
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:15,280
     WELL, WE'LL BURY           
     BURT TOMORROW.             

479
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:18,317
 ANOTHER TOMB WE HAVE TO LEAVE  
 ON THIS DANGEROUS PLANET.      

480
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:19,351
         SANYA?                 

481
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:21,053
                 I'LL BE RIGHT  
                 WITH YOU, MARK.

482
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,255
FIRST, I WANT TO REMOVE

484
00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:47,830

 THEY NEED YOU.                 

485
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:01,476
OH, I STILL HAVE                
BURT'S NAMEPLATE.

                GIVE IT TO ME.  

487
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,080
        I'LL FINISH THE RECORDS.
     YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH TODAY.  

488
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:06,448
             THANK YOU.         

489
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:12,330
    AAH!

         I'M SORRY WE WEREN'T   
            AROUND TO HELP YOU. 

495

     I PROMISE WE'LL TRY TO SEE 
    THAT YOU DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN.

            STAND AROUND,       

497
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,101
                     WE'VE GOT  
                     WORK TO DO.

498
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:31,159
        FEELING BETTER,         
                 TIONA?

00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,666
 I SWEAR IT, MARK.              
I DIDN'T IMAGINE IT.            

501

                WESS?           

502
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:40,469

MAKE IT, MARK.

504
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:44,106
            HOW MUCH LONGER?    

505
00:45:44,173 --> 00:45:45,407
WE MIGHT BE READY               
 BY TONIGHT.                    

506
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:47,876
         GOOD. WE'RE MAKING     
    A LITTLE TOUR OF INSPECTION.

        SOMETHING IN THE VALLEY,

508
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:51,347
         SOMETHING SHINING.     

509
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:53,215
                LET'S GO        
             TAKE A LOOK.

         LOOK DOWN THERE.       

512
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:14,520
             THAT'S WHAT        
            I SAW SHINING.      

513
00:46:20,826 --> 00:46:22,994
             [Mark]             
 FINALLY, SOMETHING TANGIBLE.   

514
00:46:23,062 --> 00:46:26,231
     THAT DOESN'T DISAPPEAR     
    WHEN I LOOK STRAIGHT AT IT. 

515
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,263
[Sanya] LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN    
    HERE FOR A LONG TIME.       

516
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:00,065
         LOOK HOW PITTED AND    
        SCARRED THE HULL IS.    

517
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:02,334
 [Marc] DOESN'T LOOK LIKE       
 ANY SHIP I'VE EVER SEEN.       

518
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,035
     [Sanya] DO YOU THINK       
 IT BELONGS TO THE AUREANS?     

519
00:47:04,103 --> 00:47:06,838
[Carter] I DOUBT THEY EVER      
BUILT ANY SPACESHIPS.           

520
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:07,839
     IF THEY HAD,               
     WE WOULD'VE...

00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:13,044
                 [Gasps]        
             LOOK, MARK.        

522
00:47:13,112 --> 00:47:15,247
         [Mark] IT'S 3 TIMES    
             THE SIZE OF US,

             OF THE CALCIUM,    

524
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,985
                 IT MUST'VE BEEN
             HERE A LONG TIME.  

525
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:23,988
PROBABLY BELONGED TO            
AN ANCIENT CIVILIZATION.        

526
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:36,468
CARTER, YOU STAY HERE.          
KEEP YOUR EYES AND EARS OPEN.

00:47:36,536 --> 00:47:37,769

AROUND INSIDE THIS THING.

 JUST CALL OUT.

                     WHAT IS IT?

535
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:40,952
                         HOW?   

536
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,754

539
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:48,259
                    THAT MUST BE
                 OVER 200 VOLTS.

00:58:43,584 --> 00:58:44,918
             WE'RE SO EXHAUSTED 
     IT'S HARD TO CONCENTRATE.  

648
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:46,953
     WE REMEMBER DESCENDING     
         FOR A LANDING          

649
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,924
        WITH ALL CONDITIONS     
             PERFECT.           

650
00:58:50,991 --> 00:58:53,225
             THEN NOTHING.      

651
00:58:53,293 --> 00:58:59,098
            UNTIL WE FOUND      
             OURSELVES          

652
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:02,268
                FIGHTING OUR WAY

653
00:59:02,336 --> 00:59:08,274
        OUT OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS  
         SOMEWHERE OUT THERE.   

654
00:59:08,342 --> 00:59:10,677
WELL?                           

655
00:59:10,744 --> 00:59:13,980
         THAT'S ABOUT           
            IT, MARK.           

656
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,883
 GO ON.                         

657
00:59:16,951 --> 00:59:20,554
                     WE WALKED  
                    AROUND SOME,

658
00:59:20,621 --> 00:59:23,457
                     LOOKING FOR
                    THE GALLIOT.

659
00:59:23,524 --> 00:59:26,159
             BUT WE DIDN'T      
                 FIND HER.      

660
00:59:26,226 --> 00:59:29,779
                IT WAS A MIRACLE
             THAT YOU FOUND US. 

661
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:33,166
ALL RIGHT. I'M GLAD YOU         
MADE IT. I SURE CAN USE YOU.    

662
00:59:33,234 --> 00:59:35,969
NOW, GO AND                     
GET SOME SLEEP.                 

663
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:37,370
                 THANKS, MARK.  

664
00:59:37,438 --> 00:59:40,940
I FORGOT. IF ONE OF YOU SLEEPS, 
THE OTHER MUST STAND GUARD.     

665
00:59:41,008 --> 00:59:43,410
THAT'S AN ORDER.                
I'LL EXPLAIN IT LATER.          

666
00:59:43,477 --> 00:59:45,077
                 VERY WELL,

667
01:00:01,962 --> 01:00:04,030
             WHAT DO YOU        
             MAKE OF IT?        

668
01:00:04,097 --> 01:00:06,199
I DON'T KNOW WHAT               
TO THINK, MARK.                 

669
01:00:06,266 --> 01:00:09,736

OR PARTIAL AMNESIA?             

670
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:11,904
BY NOW, NOTHING                 
SHOULD SURPRISE US.             

671
01:00:11,972 --> 01:00:14,874
ANYWAY, YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH    
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE HERE.     

672

676
01:00:24,885 --> 01:00:26,786
    HOW MANY STRANGE

677
01:00:26,854 --> 01:00:29,121

    WE GOT ON THIS PLANET?      

678
01:00:29,189 --> 01:00:34,327
    I REALLY SAW THEM,          
THE 3 WE BURIED YESTERDAY.      

679
01:00:34,395 --> 01:00:38,130

680
01:00:38,198 --> 01:00:43,603
            AND I SAW           
     ANOTHER ONE, MARK.

01:00:49,176 --> 01:00:52,178
             EVEN THOUGH WE     
         BURIED HIM YESTERDAY.  

685
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:56,649
                I SAW HIM, MARK.
                I SAW HIM.      
                I SAW HIM, MARK!

            TO BE CERTAIN.

    TO ACTUALLY RESPOND.

         NEED OUR DEAD BODIES?

     NO. THEY MUST BE           
 WILLING ONLY TO SUBMIT.        

740
01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:53,562
LOSE THEIR BODIES AS WELL       
 AS LOSE THEIR WILL.

         A BREED OF PARASITES.  

742
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,834

WOULD BE SYMBIOTIC.             

743
01:05:58,902 --> 01:06:01,621

744

         SANYA?                 

865
01:22:05,284 --> 01:22:09,187
IF I WASN'T SO WIDE AWAKE,      
I'D SWEAR I WAS DREAMING.       

866
01:22:09,255 --> 01:22:11,489
            WHAT HAPPENED, WESS?

867
01:22:11,557 --> 01:22:13,358
         I WAS ABOUT            
         TO FALL ASLEEP,        

868
01:22:13,426 --> 01:22:15,793
     WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS     
     OUT IN THE PASSAGEWAY.     

869
01:22:15,861 --> 01:22:17,495
     THEY APPROACHED            
         MY CABIN.              

870
01:22:17,563 --> 01:22:18,896
                     THEN WHAT  
                     HAPPENED?  

871
01:22:18,964 --> 01:22:22,200
         THEN, THE DOOR         
         OPENED, SLOWLY.        

872
01:22:22,268 --> 01:22:26,671
 AS IF SOMEONE WERE DEBATING    
 WHETHER OR NOT TO COME IN.     

873
01:22:26,739 --> 01:22:28,373
                 AND DID THEY?  

874
01:22:28,441 --> 01:22:30,775
            NO, SANYA.          

875
01:22:30,843 --> 01:22:33,778
             THEN YOU DIDN'T    
                 SEE ANYTHING.  

876
01:22:33,846 --> 01:22:36,748
            YES, I DID.         

877
01:22:36,815 --> 01:22:39,251
     HE WAS HOLDING HIS         
     FIELD RAY GUN.             

878
01:22:39,318 --> 01:22:43,421
         HE WAS MIRRORED        
     ON THE METAL WALL.         

879
01:22:43,489 --> 01:22:46,090
                    ARE YOU SURE
                    YOU SAW HIM?

880
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:48,860
         I KNOW YOU WON'T       
        BELIEVE ME, SANYA.      

881
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:52,664
        I CERTAINLY WISH I      
        WAS WRONG, MYSELF.      

882
01:22:52,732 --> 01:22:56,000
     BUT IT WAS REALLY          
        HIM. MARK!              

883
01:22:56,068 --> 01:22:58,102
     IT WAS MARK, SANYA.        

884
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:01,306
         WHY DID HE             
        COME TO ME SO...        

885
01:23:01,374 --> 01:23:03,040
         FURTIVELY?             

886
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:06,578
     MAYBE HE WANTED            
        TO KILL ME.             

887
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:10,749
 WELL, THEN WHAT ARE YOUR       
        CONCLUSIONS, WESS?      

888
01:23:10,816 --> 01:23:14,486
 UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S         
     ONLY 1 CONCLUSION.         

889
01:23:14,553 --> 01:23:17,355
 EVEN MARK IS CONTROLLED        
     BY ONE OF THEM.            

890
01:23:17,423 --> 01:23:20,958
            OH, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

891
01:23:21,026 --> 01:23:22,193
                 LET'S GO SEE.  

892
01:23:31,504 --> 01:23:33,571
                     WESS?      

893
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:35,507
             WAIT A MINUTE.     

894
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,962
             MARK.              

895
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:00,699
WESS HAS FOUND                  
OUT ABOUT US.                   

896
01:24:09,107 --> 01:24:11,242
                     DON'T BE   
                 AFRAID, WESS.  

897
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:13,177
                 NOBODY WANTS   
                 TO HARM YOU.   

898
01:24:13,245 --> 01:24:14,846
                 NOBODY WANTS   
                 TO KILL YOU.   

899
01:24:14,914 --> 01:24:17,015
 YOU...                         

900
01:24:17,082 --> 01:24:19,384
 YOU'RE ONE                     
 OF THEM.                       

901
01:24:19,452 --> 01:24:22,621
         AND YOU                
         TOO, SANYA.            

902
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:24,790
         IT'S HORRIBLE.         

903
01:24:24,857 --> 01:24:27,158
                 YOU.           

904
01:24:27,226 --> 01:24:30,929
             BOTH OF YOU.       

905
01:24:30,996 --> 01:24:33,865
YOU MUST BECOME                 
ONE OF US.                      

906
01:24:33,933 --> 01:24:36,968
ALL YOU HAVE TO                 
DO IS WANT IT.                  

907
01:24:37,036 --> 01:24:39,137
JUST LET ONE                    
OF US JOIN YOU.                 

908
01:24:39,205 --> 01:24:42,006
IT'LL GIVE YOU THIS             
WONDERFUL NEW COMPLEXITY.       

909
01:24:42,074 --> 01:24:44,275
                NO. NO!         

910
01:24:44,344 --> 01:24:47,011
        OUR WORLD WILL NEVER    
        FALL INTO YOUR HANDS!   

911
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:50,415
     MAYBE NOT, BUT YOU WON'T   
        BE THE ONE TO STOP US.  

912
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:52,984
            YES, I WILL!        

913
01:25:01,794 --> 01:25:03,795
[Meteor rejector sounding]      

914
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:16,291
             AH!                

915
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:17,525
         [Groaning]             

916
01:25:32,157 --> 01:25:34,259
     SANYA, WITHOUT THE         
     METEOR REJECTOR,           

917
01:25:34,326 --> 01:25:36,762
 WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE            
     TO REACH HOME.             

918
01:25:36,829 --> 01:25:38,630
                 WHAT DO WE DO? 

919
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:44,969
WE'LL HAVE TO LAND NOW,         
    ON THAT PLANET.             

920
01:25:45,037 --> 01:25:48,106
    I'VE DONE AN ANALYSIS       
    WITH A SPECIAL PROBE.       

921
01:25:48,173 --> 01:25:50,876
     WE CAN EXIST IN            
     THE ATMOSPHERE.            

922
01:25:50,943 --> 01:25:54,446
    IT'S THE THIRD PLANET       
 OF THE STAR WE CALL SOL.       

923
01:25:54,514 --> 01:25:56,080
 IT'S SO SMALL, IT'S            
     NOT EVEN MARKED            

924
01:25:56,148 --> 01:25:58,082
ON THE ASTRONAVIGATION          
 CHARTS.                        

925
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:00,652
BUT WILL IT BE POSSIBLE         
         TO LIVE THERE,         

926
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,154
             FOR US AND THOSE   
                WHO FOLLOW US?  

927
01:26:03,222 --> 01:26:06,558
IT'S MOST LIKELY A YOUNG,       
 PRIMITIVE WORLD.               

928
01:26:06,626 --> 01:26:09,494
         BUT I THINK IT'LL BE   
            ALL RIGHT FOR US.   

929
01:26:09,562 --> 01:26:12,363
     [Sanya] I'LL ACTIVATE THE  
     LONG-RANGE TELESCOPIC LENS.

930
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:21,139
                     [Chuckles] 
             YES, I WAS RIGHT.  

931
01:26:21,206 --> 01:26:24,409
     IT IS A PUNY CIVILIZATION. 

932
01:26:24,477 --> 01:26:30,231
     THEIR BUILDINGS ARE STILL  
     MADE OF STONE AND IRON.    

933
01:26:30,299 --> 01:26:33,768
                HOW WILL THEY   
                 ACCEPT US?     

934
01:26:33,835 --> 01:26:37,805
        I HOPE, WELL.           

935
01:26:37,873 --> 01:27:49,211
         FOR THEM.
