1
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,463
Radar Control,
this is Prison Transport 9961

2
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:19,335
requesting permission to land.
Over.

3
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:22,722
We've been expecting you,
PT 9961.

4
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:23,709
Please confirm payload.
Over.

5
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:25,872
Crite prisoners...
eight of them. Over.

6
00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:28,940
There seems to be
a problem, PT 9961.

7
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:31,349
My advance notice cube
states there should be

8
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:35,100
10 Crite prisoners aboard your ship.
Please explain. Over.

9
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:36,936
We did have 10
at one time,

10
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:39,258
but the Crites were
eating everything in sight.

11
00:01:39,294 --> 00:01:42,263
We had to kill two of them
to make the food last longer. Over.

12
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:44,528
Roger, PT 9961.

13
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:47,091
You're cleared for landing
in docking bay B.

14
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:49,899
Send Crite prisoners
through detox and immunization.

15
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:53,015
Put them in the termination lock
as soon as you land.

16
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:54,940
Shock control will be
standing by. Over.

17
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:56,604
Roger, Radar Control.

18
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,055
This is Warden Zanti.

19
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,686
Get Shock Control over
to the termination lock.

20
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:14,526
The Crites are
up to something.

21
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:24,563
Explosion in termination lock.

22
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:26,403
Damage report.

23
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,500
Two dead
and three wounded, sir.

24
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:30,775
- Escapes?
- The Crites. All eight of them.

25
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:32,372
The Crites have stolen a ship!

26
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:41,724
Damn.

27
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:45,486
Get the bounty hunters.

28
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:16,586
I have a job for you.

29
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:26,095
They've stolen
one of our fastest ships,

30
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,699
with enough fuel to cross
the galaxy 10 times over.

31
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,837
So fuel is
not their concern.

32
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,308
However, you must stop them
before they can feed.

33
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:39,284
You will receive
full payment, as usual,

34
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:42,116
only upon evidence
of their destruction.

35
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:22,317
Brad, April, breakfast!

36
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:28,690
Brad, I need
to get in there!

37
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:33,032
Come on, you little snot,
I'm in a hurry!

38
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:38,099
Mom, Brad won't let me
in the bathroom!

39
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,336
Hello?
Yeah, hold on.

40
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,328
April, telephone!

41
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,883
Brad, you're
a real jerk!

42
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:53,715
Mom, Brad's hogging
the bathroom.

43
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:54,918
Two minutes.

44
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,094
Hello?

45
00:05:58,128 --> 00:06:00,223
Oh, hi.

46
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,226
Jay, breakfast!

47
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:07,761
Helen, was that
Charlie calling?

48
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:10,433
No, it was Steve.

49
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:12,306
Steve?

50
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:23,117
Yeah?

51
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:25,057
Happy birthday!

52
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,951
Yeah?

53
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:31,156
What'd you get?

54
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:33,795
- No!
- Hey.

55
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,925
Steve who?

56
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:38,803
The new boy at school.

57
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:41,101
Whatever happened
to what's-his-name?

58
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,971
- Richard?
- I'm a terrible guesser.

59
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,909
Yeah, Richard.

60
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:47,378
I thought he was
the love of her life.

61
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:49,210
Try and keep up,
will ya?

62
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,047
You got to keep me informed.
Did you wash my bowling shirt?

63
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:54,315
Yes, it'll be ready
for the tournament. Go eat.

64
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:56,516
Brad, get Chewie
off the table.

65
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:01,386
I can't wait!

66
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,588
Have you seen
Charlie this morning, Brad?

67
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,100
Bye.

68
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:11,704
Thanks.

69
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:13,798
So who is this Steve?

70
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,433
The dork from New York.

71
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,604
Shut up.
You're such a baby.

72
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,080
What happened
to Richard?

73
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,549
All Richard cared about
was hog farms.

74
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:25,212
So?
My Dad farmed hogs.

75
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,448
Dad!

76
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,548
Brad, what are you
sitting at the table

77
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,650
with a thermometer
in your mouth for?

78
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:33,717
I'm not feeling
very good.

79
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,491
I'll bet.

80
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,432
- You look okay.
- 106?

81
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:41,663
Did you tell Mom about your
big geometry test you have today?

82
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:43,763
Shut up.
Just shut up!

83
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:45,363
You have
a test today, Brad?

84
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,740
- You're a real shithead.
- Bradley!

85
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:51,272
Boy, I'm going
to wash your mouth out.

86
00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:54,682
Maybe you'll do as well on this
as you did on your last one.

87
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,918
What last test?

88
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,878
Bye.
Mmmmm.

89
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:02,083
Brad!

90
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:05,525
Come on, April,
we're running late!

91
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:07,153
Get yourself ready
for school, boy.

92
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,163
Dad.

93
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,063
You miss that bus
I'm going to skin you

94
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,726
and hang your bones
out to dry.

95
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:18,241
"Thank you for the lovely breakfast
you prepared, Mother."

96
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,335
Wonder what happened
to Charlie?

97
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,981
Morning, Harv.

98
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:34,014
Morning, Sal.
What's happening?

99
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:37,994
This here says
that John Travolta

100
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:40,361
used to be a waitress
in Fort Myers, Florida.

101
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:44,128
What's happening
here, Sal?

102
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:47,195
Big bowling tournament
tonight.

103
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:50,537
And Charlie, he's sleeping
it off in the back.

104
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:54,305
Be nice, Harv.
He don't mean no harm.

105
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:04,712
They're coming!

106
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,470
They're coming, Harv.

107
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:26,404
Yeah. I'm getting them through
my fillings, just like last time.

108
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:28,277
Cut the crap, Charlie.

109
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:29,782
Listen.

110
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:31,564
Jeez.

111
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:36,745
They're the same ones
that ruined my pitching career.

112
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:41,523
You ever consider slowing down
on the whiskey, Charlie?

113
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,358
It ain't the whiskey.

114
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:46,230
Sal.
Sal, you remember, right?

115
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:49,633
I was a prospect, huh?
I wasn't drinking then, was I?

116
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,648
Sure, Charlie, sure.
You were Major League material.

117
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:55,039
Right.
I had heat.

118
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:59,373
Then I started
getting these messages...

119
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:04,180
This is Patrol GXP 1198

120
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:06,813
calling Alpha Tango Delta.
Come in.

121
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:09,677
- Over.
- Do you hear that?

122
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:11,483
Charlie, it's Jeff.

123
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:13,618
I'm on Route 22.
Come on, lover, pick it up.

124
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:21,132
- Cut the horseshit, Jeff.
- Ooh, sorry, Harv.

125
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,330
- I didn't know you were in.
- What do you need?

126
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:25,271
Just signing off
for the night.

127
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:26,695
So sign off, already.

128
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:32,679
Uh, Charlie...

129
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:36,514
why don't you just
go on out to Jay and Helen's?

130
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,490
You don't want
to get fired now.

131
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:41,645
Oh no.
No, I like my job.

132
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,855
You just forget about
that Martian stuff, okay?

133
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,862
Forget about that.

134
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,195
Yeah, right.

135
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,132
This town's a zoo.

136
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:08,515
Prepare for holographic
transmission.

137
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:11,282
In my haste
to get you on your way,

138
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:14,415
there were a couple of things
I neglected to inform you of.

139
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,017
We are tracing the Crites
to a solar system

140
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,052
where only one planet
supports life... Earth.

141
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,180
Your ship database will contain
adequate information

142
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,335
on the culture
of the planet.

143
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:26,059
Your transformation
capabilities

144
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:28,903
should come in
quite handy there.

145
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:33,069
I trust, however, you will be
less destructive this time,

146
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,602
considering you nearly
destroyed half...

147
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:50,517
Earth is a culture
of many contrasts.

148
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:52,928
Their technological
advances have been...

149
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,527
Bring him down,
bring him down!

150
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,789
Okay.

151
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:01,161
Okay, I'm ready
for that carburetor, Charlie.

152
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,391
Charlie!

153
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:06,959
Give me the carburetor!

154
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,437
It's 5:16 at KEAT.
K-Eat in Kansas City.

155
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,248
Okay, 1948.
A Missouri housewife is kidnapped

156
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:22,310
by six little men with orange heads
on her way to the laundromat.

157
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:25,680
All right!
Whoo!

158
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,987
What the hell
was that?

159
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:31,823
Did you see that?
That was the best one we ever did!

160
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:33,990
Yeah, that was...
that was real good.

161
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:37,299
Homemade.
Best in the state.

162
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,902
Charlie,
you broke my slingshot.

163
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,534
It's... I can fix this.
I can fix this.

164
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:47,374
You just go get
a tin can.

165
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:54,943
Anyway, like I was saying,
this housewife...

166
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:56,044
What housewife?

167
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,955
I thought I told you to get rid
of them fireworks?

168
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:01,186
- You like working here, Charlie?
- Yes, sir.

169
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,058
I've been waiting
on that carburetor.

170
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:05,461
You've got to try and concentrate
on what you're doing, okay?

171
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:07,329
- I'm gonna.
- I got a lot to do today,

172
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,526
so try to keep up.

173
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:11,331
- Dad, I asked if he could...
- Give me those.

174
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,099
These are not toys.

175
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,767
I want to try to get this thing
fired up before dark.

176
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,847
Now what?

177
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:34,991
Sorry, Charlie.

178
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,156
That don't feel right.

179
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:46,590
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, girl.

180
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,100
Daddy, this is Steve Elliot.
I asked him to stay for dinner.

181
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:52,511
I hope it's okay.
Mom said it was okay.

182
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:55,914
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Brown.
- Expensive little toy.

183
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,111
Steve's dad just gave it
to him for his birthday.

184
00:15:58,508 --> 00:15:59,618
It's the greatest,
isn't it?

185
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:02,145
Don't look like you're going
to haul much hay in it.

186
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,885
No...

187
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,791
Let me... let me
just test it out.

188
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:15,065
Careful, Charlie.

189
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:25,013
Charlie.

190
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:27,880
Bradley Brown,
I'm going to kill you.

191
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:34,916
You get back here!

192
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:42,259
Brad, I'm going
to kill you!

193
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,194
Come here,
you little snot.

194
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:47,256
- April!
- He shot me with a slingshot!

195
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:49,400
- I did not!
- Liar!

196
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:50,839
- April!
- Liar!

197
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:53,104
Hold it, hold it!

198
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:56,635
Boy, did you shoot your sister
with that slingshot?

199
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,239
I think I'll stand
on the fifth amendment.

200
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:01,911
This is not a democracy.
Did you or didn't you?

201
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,627
Yeah, I guess I did.

202
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:12,788
You know better
than that, boy.

203
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,109
Go to your room.

204
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,994
- And no supper.
- Oh, Jay.

205
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,162
Helen.

206
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:57,633
At least you like me.

207
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,555
She's all set to go,
Mr. Brown.

208
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,979
Okay, Charlie.
See you in the morning.

209
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,814
This is a great meal,
Mrs. Brown.

210
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,383
Really, one of the best
I've ever had.

211
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:48,019
Thanks.
Thank you, Steve.

212
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:52,993
- Well, we should get going.
- What?

213
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:55,331
You promised you'd take me
for a ride, remember?

214
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,466
I did?

215
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:00,334
right.

216
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:04,039
Hon, I kinda figured
you'd watch me bowl tonight.

217
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,411
We're defending
the championship, you know.

218
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,439
- Oh, we're...
- Maybe we'll come by later.

219
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:12,554
Don't suppose anybody would like
some dessert before they leave?

220
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,418
- No thanks, Mom.
- It was very good.

221
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:16,219
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

222
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:23,169
- Helen?

223
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:25,568
Have you... you know,
talked to her

224
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:27,626
about the way
things are?

225
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,102
Years ago.

226
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:32,147
Years?

227
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,426
I thought you were
going to let me drive?

228
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:54,363
Okay. Be careful.

229
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:16,449
What do I want
to see an old barn for?

230
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:19,012
Come on.
It's romantic.

231
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:20,990
April...

232
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:23,774
You want your car keys back,
don't you?

233
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,235
Come on, Steve.
Want your keys?

234
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:42,539
Come on!

235
00:21:20,254 --> 00:21:22,553
I'm allergic.

236
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:25,384
Just a minute!

237
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:35,364
Come in.

238
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:46,076
You can thank your mama
for fixing you a plate.

239
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:53,186
Where's that slingshot?

240
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:02,764
Brad, why are you always
fighting with your sister?

241
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:05,357
How come you and Mom
always take her side?

242
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:08,063
I mean, I didn't even
do nothing!

243
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:10,798
Boy, you shot her
with a slingshot.

244
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:14,965
Right.

245
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,406
Anyway, I'm confiscating
this until further notice.

246
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:22,383
- But Dad...
- And no movies...

247
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:23,715
for two weeks.

248
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:29,848
No, uh... April...

249
00:22:32,209 --> 00:22:34,957
if your Dad catches me
up here I'm history.

250
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:37,465
He didn't even like me
eating his food.

251
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:41,897
My parents never
come out here at night.

252
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:43,496
You sure?

253
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:47,344
Sorry.

254
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:49,091
Chewie!

255
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,270
And now for the number one
song of the week...

256
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:21,297
Johnny Steele's,
"Power of the Night."

257
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:09,253
Jay?

258
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,555
There's something wrong
with the TV!

259
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:33,174
Jay?

260
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:42,548
The earth moved.

261
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:44,423
- Already?
- Yeah.

262
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:49,661
Jay, will you forget about
the shaking? Let's go.

263
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,066
I'm just going
to have a look.

264
00:25:52,102 --> 00:25:55,191
We're going to be late
for the tournament.

265
00:26:25,237 --> 00:26:27,398
Brad, what the hell
are you doing up there?

266
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:30,874
Dad... you see... uh...

267
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:33,408
the earthquake threw me
clear out of my room.

268
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:34,407
I could not believe it.

269
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:36,539
Cut the bull and get
your butt down here.

270
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:45,350
You look like you've
done that a couple of times.

271
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:47,085
- A couple times.
- Come on.

272
00:26:47,126 --> 00:26:48,649
I want to keep
an eye on you.

273
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:51,130
- Where are we going?
- Out to the field.

274
00:26:51,164 --> 00:26:54,621
- Did you see that meteor?
- I saw something.

275
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:58,432
Maybe it's a Russian spy probe
on some sort of secret mission.

276
00:26:58,471 --> 00:27:01,463
I think you watch
too much TV.

277
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:00,895
Smells like oil burning.

278
00:28:00,937 --> 00:28:03,427
Smells like cow crap
to me, Dad.

279
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,550
Holy shit!

280
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:25,618
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

281
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,754
What is it?

282
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:31,734
Looks like
one of the herd.

283
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:34,464
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

284
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:39,568
Without my gun,
I don't want to find out.

285
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:41,044
Let's go.

286
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,876
Mom's going to be
really grossed out

287
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:46,041
when she hears about this.

288
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,848
Maybe we shouldn't even
tell her about it

289
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:51,252
till we find out more
about what happened out here.

290
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,908
This is GXP 11 niner eight,

291
00:29:12,944 --> 00:29:15,606
come in
Alpha Tango Delta. Over.

292
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:17,707
What is it, Jeff?
Over.

293
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:19,411
Hey, Sal.

294
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,013
How about we get some donuts
and coffee after work? Over.

295
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,650
Not tonight, Jeff.
Not ever. Over.

296
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:31,062
I copy, Alpha Tango Delta.
Over and out.

297
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:39,202
Shit!

298
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,276
Damn dog.

299
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:08,963
Come here, poochy.

300
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:12,865
Here, pooch.

301
00:30:12,238 --> 00:30:14,069
Come on.

302
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:16,542
Come on, doggie.

303
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:18,512
Come on.

304
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:21,071
Bark, bark, bark.

305
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:22,548
Come on.

306
00:30:23,585 --> 00:30:25,211
What the...?!

307
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:33,652
Damn cat.

308
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:06,107
Oh, you scared
the hell out of me!

309
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:08,884
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Forgive me.

310
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,953
- Something was staring at me.
- What do you mean something?

311
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,761
- Where?
- Over there by the window.

312
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:33,104
- I don't see anything.
- Maybe it was Chewie.

313
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:35,113
Yeah, maybe.

314
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:38,245
Did you find anything?

315
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:43,093
Yeah, we found something
a little strange.

316
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,653
Jay?

317
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:00,971
Transform.

318
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:03,482
Nothing likes me.

319
00:33:03,517 --> 00:33:06,144
Find something.

320
00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:34,549
Eating start.

321
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,482
Who are you calling?

322
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:12,080
Harv. I want to tell him
what's going on out here.

323
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:14,521
Maybe he's gotten
other calls.

324
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:31,533
This phone is dead.

325
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:33,373
What?

326
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,179
Mom?

327
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,120
Okay.

328
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:54,395
There's no reason for you to
come down here. Just wait a minute.

329
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:57,731
Probably just a circuit
breaker's been tripped.

330
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:13,814
What the...?

331
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,767
Jay, any luck?

332
00:35:35,876 --> 00:35:37,070
Just a minute.

333
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:31,488
What's wrong?

334
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,269
Dad!

335
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:38,796
- Stay upstairs!
- Mom, we got to help him!

336
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:02,190
- Bradley!
- No, no, don't come down here!

337
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:25,185
Jay, come on!

338
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:26,849
What's down there?

339
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,757
I don't know.
Something meaner than hell.

340
00:37:55,288 --> 00:37:58,120
Jeff, come in, Jeff.
Over.

341
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:02,891
This is Alpha Tango Delta

342
00:38:02,928 --> 00:38:05,988
calling GXP
11 niner eight.

343
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:07,430
Come in.
Over.

344
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:13,395
Come on, will you quit fooling
around and answer me? Over.

345
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:26,614
All right, I'm sorry
about the donuts and coffee.

346
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:30,248
Maybe another time, but tonight
I have to wash my hair.

347
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:32,018
Over.

348
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:39,531
Come on, Jeff.

349
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:42,899
I've been getting all sorts of calls
about UFOs in the area.

350
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:47,223
Carla Emmons swears
one nearly ran into her house

351
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,070
and then went flying off.

352
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:50,872
I think she's been dipping
in the cooking sherry again.

353
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:55,412
Anyway, she wants you to get
over there right away. Over.

354
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,721
I am starting to lose
my patience, Jeff.

355
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:04,418
If you are sleeping on
the job again, I am not going...

356
00:39:28,717 --> 00:39:30,480
I can't feel that.

357
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:43,960
Hey, careful, boy.

358
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:46,545
That's some kind
of poison.

359
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:48,763
That's better, babe.

360
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:50,976
I'm beginning to get
the feeling back.

361
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:06,146
I'll get it.

362
00:40:21,894 --> 00:40:22,536
Steve!

363
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,907
Steve!

364
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:48,464
Who's that?

365
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,660
April!

366
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:51,168
April?

367
00:41:04,283 --> 00:41:05,613
Brad!

368
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:09,320
April?

369
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:11,571
Brad! Brad, help!

370
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:13,760
Hurry up!

371
00:41:16,062 --> 00:41:17,529
Do something, Brad!

372
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,822
Brad!

373
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:29,866
Brad!

374
00:41:57,972 --> 00:42:00,441
- Brad!
- Mom!

375
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:04,309
- What? What are you...
- Steve's dead!

376
00:42:10,352 --> 00:42:12,410
Charlie?

377
00:42:12,454 --> 00:42:14,355
- Call Harv.
- What for?

378
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:17,290
Call Harv.
Call.

379
00:42:17,325 --> 00:42:19,885
Call the army.
They're here.

380
00:42:21,884 --> 00:42:22,960
- Who?
- Who?!

381
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,523
Them!
My teeth.

382
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:28,695
Sally, call Harv, please?

383
00:42:28,737 --> 00:42:31,103
Charlie...

384
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:33,502
I want to go home.

385
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:37,274
Okay.
Just... where is he?

386
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:39,041
Might be
at the bowling alley.

387
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:42,210
Okay, good, good.
I'll get Harv.

388
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:44,481
- You call the army.
- Okay.

389
00:42:52,629 --> 00:42:55,621
Thank you, Ms. Grubner.

390
00:42:55,665 --> 00:42:58,065
Tonight...

391
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:01,195
I would like to read to you
from the book of Genesis.

392
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,503
Chapter 19...
which, as most of you know,

393
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:07,738
is the story
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

394
00:43:16,587 --> 00:43:19,887
Obviously, some
of our citizens are...

395
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:43,942
We're here for the Crites.

396
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:56,122
The county is going
to pay for this, Jeff.

397
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:02,123
Jeff?

398
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,830
Jeff?

399
00:44:16,382 --> 00:44:17,577
Jeff Barnes?

400
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:20,340
Jay.

401
00:45:22,418 --> 00:45:23,817
Jay, what are you doing?

402
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,652
Maybe we ought to just
stay put.

403
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:32,718
They haven't gotten
into the house yet.

404
00:45:32,762 --> 00:45:34,423
They will.

405
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:37,991
We could board up the place.
We could make it stronger.

406
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,628
Helen, these things
are vicious.

407
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,957
They've cut out our phone,
they've cut out our power.

408
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,169
You understand
what that means?

409
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:48,040
It's just a matter of time
until they get in here.

410
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,012
Yeah, but we should
just stay here.

411
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:52,072
No, we can't wait.

412
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,390
Wait up, Brad.

413
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:09,696
All right, Jay,
I've got her.

414
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:14,094
Okay, let's go.

415
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,605
Stay together.

416
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,775
I'm going to drive, Jay.

417
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:27,648
Okay, baby.

418
00:46:33,113 --> 00:46:35,272
Come on.

419
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,023
Oh my God, Jay.

420
00:46:38,063 --> 00:46:40,463
- Oh, Mom.
- What the hell are those things?

421
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:43,332
They're from outer space,
like Charlie says.

422
00:46:43,707 --> 00:46:44,562
Bradley.

423
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,598
Maybe they're some government
experiment gone haywire.

424
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:49,937
They used to be gophers,
but got zapped by some radioactive...

425
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:52,258
- Bradley!
- What are we going to do now?

426
00:46:52,665 --> 00:46:54,839
Steve's keys.

427
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,008
Oh God.
Wait!

428
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:02,516
Stay together.

429
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:04,181
Come on, come on.

430
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:26,869
Go on!

431
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:33,948
They're getting bigger!

432
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:40,660
Come on, faster!
Faster!

433
00:47:50,772 --> 00:47:51,829
It's locked!

434
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:53,203
Come on!

435
00:47:57,294 --> 00:47:58,540
Go! Get in!

436
00:48:05,987 --> 00:48:07,046
Jay!

437
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:22,070
Brad!

438
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:44,490
Get him up to the door.

439
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:46,553
Get your feet up, Jay!

440
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,340
Mom, shoot!

441
00:48:51,715 --> 00:48:53,874
I can't!
It must be empty!

442
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:56,499
My pocket.
My shirt pocket!

443
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,133
Get them. Hurry.

444
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:54,526
- Well?
- The line's busy.

445
00:49:54,566 --> 00:49:56,659
I don't get it.
Jay's never this late.

446
00:49:56,825 --> 00:49:59,398
- Except when he pays for the beer.
- Yeah.

447
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:02,431
Jake, they are coming.

448
00:50:02,475 --> 00:50:05,344
They are not only coming,
they are here.

449
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,569
See, I was out
on Route 22...

450
00:50:07,614 --> 00:50:11,641
- and I looked up...
- Have another drink, Charlie.

451
00:50:13,554 --> 00:50:15,680
I don't want
another drink, Jake.

452
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,019
I want Harv.
We're under attack.

453
00:50:20,061 --> 00:50:22,324
I'm going to leave it
right here.

454
00:50:22,363 --> 00:50:25,636
Just don't bother me
any more.

455
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:28,761
I saw the sign was shaking
and everything.

456
00:50:39,146 --> 00:50:43,248
- Isn't that Johnny Steele?
- I don't know.

457
00:50:50,726 --> 00:50:52,421
Whoa!

458
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:05,073
Joe, let's go.

459
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:53,388
Holy shit!

460
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:56,725
Wonder what team
he's on?

461
00:52:08,973 --> 00:52:11,805
Hey, Jake, are we gonna get
a couple beers over here or what?

462
00:52:11,843 --> 00:52:14,209
Keep your shirt on,
asshole.

463
00:52:14,245 --> 00:52:16,611
I got a problem here.

464
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,884
You believe these guys?

465
00:52:22,554 --> 00:52:24,385
It ain't Halloween, is it?

466
00:52:27,493 --> 00:52:32,192
If anything does happen to me,
you crooks won't live long.

467
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,496
What does he mean
we won't live long?

468
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,204
What can I get
for you fellas?

469
00:52:39,238 --> 00:52:41,763
Reverend, what are
you doing here?

470
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:43,741
That's some outfit
you got on.

471
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:46,336
- We want the Crites.
- Oh really?

472
00:52:46,378 --> 00:52:49,097
Who are they,
some new team?

473
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,911
The Crites.

474
00:52:53,954 --> 00:52:55,979
Mister, I don't know
what you're talking about.

475
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:02,924
I think you all
better be leaving

476
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:04,556
before somebody
gets hurt.

477
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,542
You all have
a serious attitude problem.

478
00:53:18,478 --> 00:53:19,878
Keep your shirt on,
asshole.

479
00:54:15,637 --> 00:54:17,605
This had better
be important.

480
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,234
Harv, you better get
down to the church,

481
00:54:19,576 --> 00:54:21,737
- all hell is breaking loose.
- What?

482
00:54:21,777 --> 00:54:24,339
The reverend says
a couple of guys started shooting...

483
00:54:24,381 --> 00:54:26,405
Whoa, slow down.

484
00:54:26,449 --> 00:54:28,179
...destroyed the organ,
you know how beautiful...

485
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:30,276
- Where's Jeff?
- I don't know.

486
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,372
I've been trying
to get him for hours.

487
00:54:32,778 --> 00:54:34,752
Give me 10 minutes.

488
00:54:56,814 --> 00:54:58,476
He looks pretty sick, Mom.

489
00:54:59,784 --> 00:55:01,011
I'm okay, sport.

490
00:55:01,052 --> 00:55:02,416
He's fine.

491
00:55:03,788 --> 00:55:05,483
He doesn't look
fine to me.

492
00:55:05,523 --> 00:55:08,273
Why don't you go
check the windows?

493
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:10,221
- I already did.
- Check them again!

494
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:23,435
It's okay, Mom.

495
00:55:23,475 --> 00:55:25,910
I'm so sorry.

496
00:55:44,696 --> 00:55:46,392
April?

497
00:55:46,432 --> 00:55:48,560
Yeah?

498
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:51,503
You okay?

499
00:55:56,677 --> 00:55:58,474
The flue's open!

500
00:56:11,658 --> 00:56:13,023
Mom!

501
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,725
The shotgun!

502
00:57:12,225 --> 00:57:13,021
Brad!
Brad, look out!

503
00:57:40,918 --> 00:57:42,510
Hey, hey!

504
00:57:42,552 --> 00:57:44,077
Hey, hey!

505
00:57:45,189 --> 00:57:47,383
I've been looking
for you guys!

506
00:57:47,425 --> 00:57:49,290
I just want to talk
to you.

507
00:57:50,361 --> 00:57:53,023
- At first he was Jeff.
- Was it Jeff or wasn't it?

508
00:57:53,063 --> 00:57:55,293
- He changed.
- Changed?

509
00:57:55,521 --> 00:57:57,357
They were wearing
really funny clothes.

510
00:57:57,814 --> 00:57:58,994
Like they was
from Los Angeles.

511
00:57:59,036 --> 00:58:02,371
- Everybody calm down.
- Harv, all hell is breaking loose.

512
00:58:02,406 --> 00:58:05,604
- Yeah, Sal. Over.
- There's been a disturbance

513
00:58:05,643 --> 00:58:08,659
at the Bowlarama Lanes. Over.

514
00:58:07,945 --> 00:58:10,859
What kind
of a disturbance? Over.

515
00:58:10,048 --> 00:58:13,393
Well...

516
00:58:13,831 --> 00:58:16,555
evidently some guys
shot up the bar.

517
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:20,289
You get a description?
Over.

518
00:58:20,325 --> 00:58:22,988
Well...

519
00:58:23,028 --> 00:58:26,464
it's kind of strange, Harv,
but Jake says

520
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:30,367
it was Reverend Miller
and Charlie

521
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,200
and some stranger.

522
00:58:32,238 --> 00:58:34,432
Hold it, hold it,
hold it.

523
00:58:34,474 --> 00:58:36,669
I'm not reading you
clear, Sal.

524
00:58:36,709 --> 00:58:38,267
Repeat that. Over.

525
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:40,643
Reverend Miller,
Charlie McFadden

526
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,979
and some stranger
just shot up the bar

527
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:47,189
at the Bowlarama Lanes. Over.

528
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:49,489
Have you heard
from Jeff? Over.

529
00:58:49,523 --> 00:58:52,515
I can't raise him, Harv.

530
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,792
I also got a report here

531
00:58:55,929 --> 00:58:58,454
about shots fired
out Route 22...

532
00:58:58,498 --> 00:59:00,729
near the Brown place. Over.

533
00:59:00,768 --> 00:59:04,100
Harv, do you read? Over.

534
00:59:04,551 --> 00:59:07,071
Sal, I want you to keep
trying to raise Jeff.

535
00:59:07,107 --> 00:59:09,268
I'm headed over
to the bowling alley.

536
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,710
Then I'm going to head out
towards the Brown's place.

537
00:59:11,745 --> 00:59:13,077
Over and out.

538
00:59:13,113 --> 00:59:14,546
Over and out.

539
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,589
Get 'em, Harv!

540
00:59:32,934 --> 00:59:36,098
Babe, I got to get to a phone,
get some help out here.

541
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:40,237
I can do it.

542
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:43,143
- Absolutely not.
- Dad, you can't even walk.

543
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:48,274
I'm so tired.

544
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,618
Damn.

545
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:59,158
Son...

546
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:02,061
assuming I said okay,
how would you do it?

547
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,862
Hit the yard, grab my bike
and head for the highway.

548
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:08,701
Dad, somebody's got
to go for help.

549
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,830
All right.

550
01:00:11,286 --> 01:00:14,728
But boy, you ride like
you never rode before.

551
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,578
You get over to the Emmons' house
and get on the phone.

552
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,173
- Get Harv over here.
- Dad, I'll be fine.

553
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:20,478
Don't worry.

554
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:22,314
You want to take this?

555
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,619
Nah, you keep it.

556
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:28,878
It'd just slow me down.

557
01:00:29,222 --> 01:00:30,182
Anyway, you might need it.

558
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,481
Brad?

559
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,119
See ya.

560
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:14,061
Oh my gosh.

561
01:02:14,102 --> 01:02:16,365
They're growing!

562
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:52,398
How ya feeling, hon?

563
01:02:54,877 --> 01:02:56,902
Like a brick hit me.

564
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:01,677
Oh, baby.

565
01:03:05,421 --> 01:03:07,447
How long have I been...?

566
01:03:09,493 --> 01:03:11,255
Where's Brad?

567
01:03:11,557 --> 01:03:14,229
Brad has gone
to get help.

568
01:03:14,264 --> 01:03:18,252
Oh, Jay, you shouldn't
have let him go.

569
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:14,085
Stop, stop!
Wait!

570
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:24,702
Go, just go.
These things... these critters.

571
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:26,671
Come on, go!

572
01:04:26,706 --> 01:04:29,369
Dad's all torn up and Mom's got
a harpoon thing in her neck.

573
01:04:29,409 --> 01:04:30,500
They're getting
bigger.

574
01:04:31,678 --> 01:04:33,805
Let's go!

575
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:35,940
Charlie?

576
01:04:37,317 --> 01:04:39,479
Where's Jeff?

577
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,955
Hey, you're Johnny Steele.

578
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:45,288
- Where?
- Huh?

579
01:04:45,326 --> 01:04:47,469
Where are they?

580
01:04:47,824 --> 01:04:49,161
At my house.
Come on, hit it.

581
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:55,965
Where?

582
01:04:56,004 --> 01:04:58,198
Charlie, you know
where my house is.

583
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:02,266
Who are you guys?

584
01:05:03,744 --> 01:05:06,594
We want the Crites.

585
01:05:06,427 --> 01:05:07,640
The Crites?

586
01:05:07,682 --> 01:05:10,243
Critters,
Crites.

587
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:13,978
You're not from
around here, are you?

588
01:05:14,022 --> 01:05:17,788
Okay, okay.
You help me, I help you.

589
01:05:40,715 --> 01:05:41,739
Stop it!

590
01:05:47,991 --> 01:05:50,356
Goddamn it, stop it!

591
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,434
I got one.

592
01:06:24,706 --> 01:06:26,219
Get out of my house!

593
01:06:28,498 --> 01:06:31,985
Damn it!
Give me some more rounds.

594
01:06:32,433 --> 01:06:33,230
That's it.

595
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:34,932
Oh, Jay.

596
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,940
Holy...

597
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,383
Mom? Dad?

598
01:07:18,606 --> 01:07:20,408
Are you all right?

599
01:07:20,452 --> 01:07:23,361
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

600
01:07:22,689 --> 01:07:24,486
Brad, who did you bring?

601
01:07:24,524 --> 01:07:26,424
Charlie
and Johnny Steele.

602
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:27,983
- Who?
- Go on!

603
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:32,589
Help us!

604
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:34,260
Oh God, Chewie!

605
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,069
Help us!
Help us!

606
01:07:38,104 --> 01:07:40,664
Oh, it's Harv.

607
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:42,539
Holy shit!
What is that, a cannon?

608
01:07:42,575 --> 01:07:44,441
What's going on here?

609
01:07:44,581 --> 01:07:46,309
Brad.
Where's Brad?

610
01:07:46,347 --> 01:07:48,542
He's still in the house.

611
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:50,880
Helen, Helen!
Helen, Helen, Helen!

612
01:07:50,919 --> 01:07:52,715
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

613
01:07:52,752 --> 01:07:54,220
Get in there.
Get in.

614
01:07:54,255 --> 01:07:56,072
Jay, get in the car.

615
01:08:20,715 --> 01:08:21,841
Watch it!

616
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:55,751
Jeez, these folks could use
a good exterminator.

617
01:08:58,155 --> 01:09:00,783
Charlie, what do you think
you're doing?

618
01:09:05,071 --> 01:09:07,194
You drunk?

619
01:09:14,004 --> 01:09:16,063
I hope not you'll
take over our operation.

620
01:09:16,106 --> 01:09:18,097
Charlie, put me down.

621
01:09:29,921 --> 01:09:32,754
Harv...
are you okay?

622
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:35,486
I swallowed
my chewing tobacco.

623
01:09:49,908 --> 01:09:51,809
Chewie.

624
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,801
Here, Chewie.

625
01:10:10,863 --> 01:10:13,059
Chewie.

626
01:10:13,099 --> 01:10:14,464
Come here.

627
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:25,005
Chewie.

628
01:10:27,948 --> 01:10:30,975
Where've you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

629
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,212
Come on.
We're going for a ride.

630
01:10:33,253 --> 01:10:35,745
Brad, get down here!

631
01:10:40,828 --> 01:10:42,989
Brad!

632
01:10:51,907 --> 01:10:53,372
Help!

633
01:11:11,556 --> 01:11:12,620
Thanks.

634
01:11:16,098 --> 01:11:18,498
Oh, no.

635
01:11:18,534 --> 01:11:20,831
April!

636
01:11:24,695 --> 01:11:26,406
No, Helen, no!

637
01:11:26,441 --> 01:11:27,533
No!

638
01:11:28,866 --> 01:11:30,076
Where's April?

639
01:11:30,112 --> 01:11:33,640
It just grabbed her.
I couldn't...

640
01:11:33,682 --> 01:11:35,741
It was huge.

641
01:11:35,784 --> 01:11:37,685
- Come on, Harv.
- They took her that way.

642
01:11:39,757 --> 01:11:41,690
What was that thing?

643
01:11:48,766 --> 01:11:50,062
Charlie?

644
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:02,600
Brad!

645
01:12:05,316 --> 01:12:07,374
Brad!

646
01:12:07,418 --> 01:12:09,045
No! You get him!

647
01:12:09,086 --> 01:12:11,350
Get him!

648
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,753
- Charlie?
- Brad.

649
01:13:22,795 --> 01:13:24,320
I was right.
I was right!

650
01:13:24,364 --> 01:13:27,161
What are you doing here?

651
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,725
I'm just following
my teeth.

652
01:13:28,769 --> 01:13:31,500
- I'm getting signals like crazy.
- Come on.

653
01:13:31,538 --> 01:13:33,472
Where are we going?

654
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:47,182
- What the heck...
- Shhh!

655
01:13:48,255 --> 01:13:50,690
Brad, is that April?

656
01:14:02,891 --> 01:14:04,231
- Stay down, Brad.
- Stay here.

657
01:14:04,272 --> 01:14:06,468
If I need you,
I'll holler.

658
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,031
Brad...

659
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:09,872
What's that thing
going to do with April?

660
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:12,142
- It's going to kill her.
- Oh, it's going to kill her.

661
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,672
Kill her?!

662
01:14:15,483 --> 01:14:17,315
Bradley!

663
01:14:56,962 --> 01:14:57,928
Let's go.

664
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:47,001
Brad!

665
01:15:48,047 --> 01:15:49,208
April?

666
01:15:57,957 --> 01:15:59,390
Give me your hand!

667
01:16:03,429 --> 01:16:06,297
- I dropped my firecracker!
- Forget it!

668
01:16:06,332 --> 01:16:07,924
But they'll get away!

669
01:16:11,203 --> 01:16:13,137
- Charlie, let's go!
- Come on!

670
01:16:13,173 --> 01:16:16,165
Brad, I got an idea.
Come here!

671
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:17,767
- Give me your fire.
- Brad!

672
01:16:17,811 --> 01:16:20,492
Brad, come on!

673
01:16:21,482 --> 01:16:23,506
Come on!

674
01:16:28,488 --> 01:16:30,547
Throw it!

675
01:16:52,848 --> 01:16:54,314
Dad!

676
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:58,516
- Mom, Dad!
- Are you okay?

677
01:16:58,554 --> 01:17:00,248
Yeah, we're okay.

678
01:18:00,251 --> 01:18:02,463
Hey!

679
01:18:04,288 --> 01:18:08,604
I, uh...
just wanted, you know...

680
01:18:08,979 --> 01:18:10,890
to say thanks.

681
01:18:20,305 --> 01:18:22,432
Call me.

682
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:33,217
listen, you wouldn't
happen to have

683
01:18:33,252 --> 01:18:35,515
another one of them
electronic gizmos

684
01:18:35,554 --> 01:18:37,488
like you gave
to Brad there?

685
01:18:37,523 --> 01:18:39,514
Listen, maybe you need
a good mechanic

686
01:18:39,559 --> 01:18:41,025
to work
on them guns there.

687
01:18:41,059 --> 01:18:42,619
I'm real good
with my hands...

688
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:10,686
Chewie!

689
01:20:46,357 --> 01:20:48,551
Chewie?

690
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,301
Chew.
