1
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,151
<i>In Nature's scheme of things, certain plants
are carnivorous, or "eating plants".</i>

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,393
<i>The Venus flytrap
is one of the best known of these plants.</i>

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,677
<i>A fly, drawn to the plant by a sweet syrup,</i>

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,354
<i>brushes against trigger bristles.</i>

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,399
<i>Just how these plants digest their prey
has yet to be explained.</i>

6
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,519
<i>There is much to learn
about these fascinating "eating plants".</i>

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,990
<i>This is a newcomer, Triffidus selectus,</i>

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,188
<i>brought to Earth on the meteorites
during The Day of the Triffids.</i>

9
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,997
<i>All reports confirm that the world is witnessing
an unprecedented shower of meteorites.</i>

10
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,039
<i>There is no record of a display such as this
in recorded history.</i>

11
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,159
<i>At observatories, astronomers are noting
this fantastic phenomenon...</i>

12
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,870
<i>.. and carefully calculating the effect
on our solar system.</i>

13
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,670
<i>The consensus of opinion is that the meteorites
burn up from the intense heat</i>

14
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,796
<i>before they reach the Earth.</i>

15
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,992
<i>The show of meteorites continues unabated.</i>

16
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,915
<i>This is a thrilling once-in-a-lifetime spectacle
that simply must be seen.</i>

17
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,676
"Once-in-a-lifetime spectacle"!
Free tickets, take any seat in the house!

18
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,831
Here I am!

19
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,835
Dr Soames to see you, Mr Mason.

20
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,790
Doctor, why can't I look at what's going on?
The bandages come off tomorrow anyway.

21
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,193
I'm afraid not, Mr Mason. After an eye operation
like yours, it's best to wait the full 10 days.

22
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,512
- Eight o'clock tomorrow morning, Nurse.
- Yes, Doctor, eight o'clock.

23
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,673
- Goodnight, Mr Mason.
- Thank you. See you in the morning, I hope!

24
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,637
I hope so!

25
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,356
I'll have that cigarette.

26
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,073
- Open your mouth, please.
- Ahh.

27
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,912
Now, this should give you
a good night's rest.

28
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,073
Lie back. I'm going to put your bed down.

29
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,872
Miss Jameson, are you realy
as pretty as they say you are?

30
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,510
Tomorrow morning,
you can answer that question for yourself.

31
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,035
Hmm. Tomorrow morning.

32
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,998
Do you realy think I'll be able to see?

33
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,393
Tomorrow night you'll be in Southampton,
on board your ship and ready for duty.

34
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,039
Aye, Ma'am.

35
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,710
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

36
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,831
<i>.. And we remind you
the spectacular display of meteorites</i>

37
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,754
<i>is turning the night sky
into a blazing display of fireworks.</i>

38
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,990
<i>All over the world at this moment...</i>

39
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,796
I can't leave this specimen. Why don't you go up
the tower and have a look? It sounds spectacular.

40
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,308
Sure! The tobacco company probaby found
a way to light up the sky to sell more cigarettes.

41
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,070
- Where did you hide it this time?
- It's in the cupboard.

42
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,794
It's always in the same cupboard.

43
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,831
I was, er...

44
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,152
I was hoping we could get back
to dissecting that stingray this evening.

45
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,557
Here we go again!

46
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,396
The subject is Tom Goodwin,
brilliant marine biologist.

47
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,509
I'm bored with stingrays.
I realy don't care what a stingray stings.

48
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,954
What DO you care about, Tom?

49
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,829
Realy want me to tell you?

50
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,036
Sooner or later,
you're going to have to face the fact.

51
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,715
Day and night, drunk or sober,

52
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,193
in a lecture room or a lab
or a deserted lighthouse off the coast of Cornwall.

53
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,796
To hell with it! Meteors and all, who cares?

54
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,909
I care what happens to us.

55
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,758
Karen, you're... You're a nice girl.

56
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,310
At the most...
You talked yourself into marrying me.

57
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,077
All right... What do you want us to do?

58
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,434
I don't know what you want.
But I want to get away from this island.

59
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,513
- This pretence of doing important experiments.
- It was your idea.

60
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,231
- Six months away from university. Fieldwork...
- Let's clear out of here!

61
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,551
Let me go where I can buy
a bottle of scotch when I want,

62
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,679
not wait for a rotten boat
to bring me one bottle a week!

63
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,679
- What about the equipment?
- Leave it.

64
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,669
- What about the fish?
- Throw them back in the sea!

65
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,840
Fine. We'll leave the island tomorrow.
The boat's due in the morning.

66
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,512
<i>We are awaiting word from Australia.</i>

67
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,752
<i>Reports will confirm we
are witnessing the most...</i>

68
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,517
<i>.. the most beautiful
display of meteorites...</i>

69
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,193
<i>The BBC will be on the air all night tonight</i>

70
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,639
<i>to keep you posted on this truly historic
and marvellous display of Nature at its best.</i>

71
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,392
<i>.. from time to time
with the latest reports.</i>

72
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,831
Eight...

73
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,919
.. Nine.

74
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,233
Nine?

75
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,750
Miss Jameson!

76
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,309
Hello? Hello?

77
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,758
Hello?

78
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,237
Miss Jameson?

79
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,038
Dr Soames?

80
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,076
Miss Jameson!

81
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,709
Can anybody hear me?

82
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,628
- Phew! Dr Soames.
- Bill Mason?

83
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,475
Sorry, I just couldn't wait
to get those bandages off.

84
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,438
- You can see, Mason?
- Yes.

85
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,513
But I can't believe what I see.
What's happened?

86
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,718
Would you please take me to my office?

87
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
Now try the other eye.

88
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,352
- Certain the beam's on the pupil?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,188
All right. That's enough.

90
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,679
- Is the blind drawn in here?
- Yes, sir.

91
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,752
Would you be kind enough to pull it up?

92
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,279
What is it, Dr Soames? What's happened?

93
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,956
The optic nerves have gone.
The glare of the meteorites last night.

94
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,671
You're probaby one of the few people
in London who can still see, Mason.

95
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,070
I don't envy you.

96
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,516
I wouldn't care to see
the things you're likey to see.

97
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,673
In the outer office, in my desk,
you'll find a black leather kit.

98
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,831
Would you get it for me?

99
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,838
Of course.

100
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,755
No, it's not there.

101
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,117
Ah, here it is.

102
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,473
- No sign of the boat?
- No sign of anything.

103
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,949
It should have been here hours ago.

104
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,113
Nothing on the radio, either.
I've been trying all morning.

105
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,191
I suppose you're losing
valuable drinking time.

106
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,311
I'm sorry.

107
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,709
<i>.. look-out. Repeat..</i>

108
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,634
<i>the entire population of England
is afflicted with blindness</i>

109
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,076
<i>after watching the meteorite
shower last night.</i>

110
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,878
<i>This is the Royal Dockyard at Devonport.</i>

111
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,430
<i>A number of naval personnel
have escaped blindness.</i>

112
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,114
<i>We are trying to set up a rescue centre.</i>

113
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,274
<i>All those who are still able to see
are urged to make their way to the dockyard.</i>

114
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,952
<i>Urgent warning..</i>

115
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,319
<i>all of England appears to be infected with
a strange new plant that can inflict a fatal sting.</i>

116
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,113
<i>It is rumoured this plant
can uproot itself and move about.</i>

117
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,874
<i>If you are blind, stay indoors.</i>

118
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,157
<i>If you can see, keep a constant look-out.</i>

119
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,192
<i>We will return to the air
with further bulletins.</i>

120
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,954
<i>Stay tuned to this wavelength.</i>

121
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,795
Blindness, men-killing plants...
I'm not drunk, am I?

122
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,710
I wish you were.

123
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,678
And how do we get off this island?

124
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,031
Where would we go?

125
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,560
<i>We are still trying to reach the police.</i>

126
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,349
<i>Please remain calm. Do not move about.</i>

127
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,231
<i>The only danger is that you will injiure
yourselves or accidentally start fires.</i>

128
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,358
<i>Do not smoke, do not light matches.</i>

129
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,197
<i>Stay clear of all electrical equipment.</i>

130
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,591
<i>We are doing everything
possible to get help...</i>

131
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,752
- Are any trains running?
- I don't know.

132
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,388
Suddeny it went dark and I can't see.

133
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,313
Can you help me, sir?
Please, can you help me?

134
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,710
Beg pardon, sir, can you help me?

135
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,952
- I couldn't help overhearing...
- Can you get me a taxi?

136
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,432
- If you could phone my wife...
- I'm happy to pay. Here's my purse.

137
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,151
I'm sorry. There are no taxis
and the phones don't work.

138
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,148
Peter, my little boy, where is he?
I must find my boy.

139
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,153
- What's your boy look like?
- You can see?

140
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,393
- Of course I can see. Why shouldn't I?
- Perhaps you can help me...

141
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,155
- Where's the one who can see?
- This little girl.

142
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,150
- Can you see, girlie?
- Yes.

143
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,077
- Come on!
- No, let me go! Let me go!

144
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,471
Let me go!

145
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,913
Out of my way! Go away, I tell you!

146
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,277
Drop that child!

147
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,791
Thief! You thief!

148
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,474
- Were you in that train by yourself?
- I was in the luggage van.

149
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,918
- What were you doing in there?
- I ran away from boarding school.

150
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,709
- Where are your parents?
- I haven't any.

151
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,271
- The bank in London takes care of me.
- Well, the banks are closed.

152
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,879
- Why is he barking?
- I don't know.

153
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,076
Come on, we'll find out.

154
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,548
Ah, it's nothing. Come on.

155
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,877
Stay here.

156
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,438
Come on, let's go down to my ship.

157
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,472
Wait here.

158
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,398
Let's see if we can find some rocks.

159
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,031
Susan!

160
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,919
- Susan!
- Arghhh!

161
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,477
Get in the car!

162
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,472
- I wish I could understand French.
- I can!

163
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,758
<i>- What's he saying?
-.. catastrophe. Les services sont terminés.</i>

164
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,354
All services stopped...

165
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,478
Will continue sending as long as he can.

166
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,676
That's a big help

167
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,116
<i>.. approximately 400 miles east of New York.</i>

168
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,637
<i>All officers, crew and passengers
suddenly stricken blind.</i>

169
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,519
<i>If you read me, come in, please.</i>

170
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,195
<i>SS Midland calling. Mayday, mayday.</i>

171
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,920
<i>If you read me, come in, please.</i>

172
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,753
<i>SS Midland calling. Mayday.</i>

173
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,718
- Is the captain here?
- Yes, what is it?

174
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,314
The passengers are panicking, sir.

175
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,313
- Can't you contact the doctor?
- No, sir.

176
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,869
<i>This is the captain speaking.
Attention, all passengers.</i>

177
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,477
<i>There is no one on board who can help you.
We're radioing for a rescue vessel.</i>

178
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:42,589
<i>The only immediate danger is that
you may injiure yourselves by moving around.</i>

179
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,274
<i>Everyone stay where you are.</i>

180
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,035
<i>And if there is anyone who can see,
even a child...</i>

181
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,990
<i>.. please, come up on the bridge.</i>

182
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,599
<i>.. Ici Paris. Tous les gouvernements sont priés
d'envoyer immédiatement leur représentants...</i>

183
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,231
It's Paris. He says they're calling
a meeting, a disaster meeting...

184
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,198
.. at the Palais du Charot.

185
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,954
<i>Ici Paris. Ici Paris...</i>

186
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,430
There must be others who can see.
If we could make contact...

187
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,398
<i>.. Flight 356 from Cape Town calling.</i>

188
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,950
<i>Request tower stand by
for emergency landing.</i>

189
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,594
<i>Please talk us down.</i>

190
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,116
Please talk us down. Tower, can you read me?

191
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,435
Tower, can you read me? Mayday, mayday.

192
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,475
Tower, please come in.

193
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,315
Please talk us down. Please talk us down.

194
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,392
- Still no repy, sir.
- Keep trying.

195
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,636
- Flight 356 from Cape Town...
- Fuel's about gone, sir.

196
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,872
- How much longer?
- Any moment now, sir.

197
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,829
Please talk us down. Tower, can you read me?

198
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,116
Tower, can you read me?

199
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,317
Mayday, mayday! Tower, please come in...

200
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,950
I've got the passengers quiet again, sir,
but it won't last.

201
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,193
They want to know what's happening.
I have to tell them something.

202
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,911
Tell them... Tell them everything's
all right and not to worry.

203
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,959
Tell them to fasten their safety belts.
We're coming in to land.

204
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,153
Yes, sir.

205
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,712
Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten
your safety belts, as we are about to land.

206
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,676
<i>I assure you everything's all right.
Thank you.</i>

207
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,513
Fasten your safety belts, please.

208
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,637
Fasten your safety belts,
and no smoking, please.

209
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,074
- Belt all right?
- The pilot, is he blind too?

210
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,754
- Blind? Blind?
- Don't be sily...

211
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,959
- Blind?
- Don't panic! Don't panic!

212
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,398
- We're going to crash!
- Please sit down!

213
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,954
Arghh!

214
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,272
<i>Mayday, maydayI Tower, please come in.</i>

215
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,375
Tom! Tom, there's one of those plants
growing out there!

216
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,612
- Where?
- On the ledge by the cove.

217
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,977
How about this?

218
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,097
I'm coming with you.

219
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,210
Keep behind me.
No sense in getting killed by a plant.

220
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,009
- I thought you didn't care what happened to you.
- I don't.

221
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,978
But I picked a much pleasanter way to die.

222
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,338
Tom... It was here.

223
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,611
I know it was here!

224
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,059
Come on. Let's get back inside.

225
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,539
Arghh!

226
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,092
Arghh!

227
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,058
Arghh!

228
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,458
Arghh!

229
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,259
It's all right. It's all right.

230
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,214
<i>Ici Paris. Bulletin in English.</i>

231
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,532
<i>Because of worldwide disruption,
it is impossible for delegates to gather.</i>

232
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,693
<i>Paris, with its millions of helpless inhabitants,
has become dangerous.</i>

233
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,170
<i>This will be our last broadcast.
No one here can see.</i>

234
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,013
<i>There is no one left.</i>

235
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,377
There's nothing, Bill.

236
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,460
We're lost, aren't we, Bill?

237
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,054
Let me see that map again.

238
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,776
Bill, look!

239
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,774
Thank goodness, Mr Coker!

240
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,851
- But you are not Mr Coker.
- You can see!

241
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,012
- You too!
- Do you live near here?

242
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,978
- Five kilometres.
- Show us the way.

243
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:29,211
- Miss Durant, thank heavens!
- Mr Coker, this is Mr Mason and Susan.

244
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,530
- Hello.
- How do you do?

245
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:49,615
- You've found some more!
- Miss Coker, Mr Mason and Susan.

246
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,736
- How do you do?
- They can see.

247
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,619
Oh, good. I hope you'll stay and help us.

248
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,133
- How many blind people do you have here?
- About 40.

249
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,053
But you must be very hungry.

250
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,170
My sister and I were touring France.
We collided with Miss Durant's car.

251
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,855
Both our cars were ruined.
No one was bady hurt.

252
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,092
But we were all three under
sedation that night.

253
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,377
Thanks to Miss Durant,
her chateau became a hospital.

254
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,694
Yes, a tragic irony. The sick stayed well
and the healthy became blind.

255
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,332
- Your daughter is very sleepy.
- Hmm?

256
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,650
Come along, my dear.

257
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,850
Good night... Daddy.

258
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,772
- How old is your daughter, Mr Mason?
- Susan is not my daughter.

259
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,728
We met in London
and we've sort of been stuck with each other.

260
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,575
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're all friends here.

261
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,052
Bettina, I want you to meet Susan.

262
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:18,929
- She's an English girl who's just arrived.
- Hello, Susan.

263
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,419
Hello.

264
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,131
I brought her to you because she feels
strange here and you speak English.

265
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,973
I'll call by later and tuck you in.

266
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,609
But you can see!

267
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,568
- How can you tell?
- I'm finding I can tell many things.

268
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,699
I can tell the way people react
when you touch them.

269
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,217
- See if I can tell anything more about you.
- Can you tell how old I am?

270
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,371
- About 13.
- I'm ony 12.

271
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,613
- But you're a very grown-up 12!
- I think I am.

272
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,176
Cury... blonde hair, right?

273
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,092
Right.

274
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,094
- And brown eyes?
- That's right!

275
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,453
And a good sense of humour. You have
the nicest laugh lines round your mouth.

276
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,728
I'll tell you something else, too.

277
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,368
We're going to be good friends.

278
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,897
Until things get back to normal,
you're welcome to stay and help us.

279
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:38,009
In the past few days,
I've seen London, Paris and a lot in-between.

280
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,412
- Things will never be "normal".
- So I've tried to tell Miss Durant.

281
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,890
- I have faith, Mr Mason.
- Faith is fine, Miss Durant.

282
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:50,690
- But we need a lot more than that to survive.
- Why shouldn't we survive?

283
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,138
In France alone there are
over 50 million people, almost all blind.

284
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,292
There's going to be
starvation, fire, pestilence.

285
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:04,251
Anyone caught in the middle has no chance.
I think we should get out and go on to Spain.

286
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,298
- How do you know it's any better?
- I don't.

287
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,453
And even so,
how could we get all the people there?

288
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,250
- We couldn't.
- Mr Mason, you're just running away.

289
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,652
Miss Durant, I've told you
what things are like.

290
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,816
If you sit here with your eyes closed and let
this run over you, it's YOU that's running away.

291
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:33,492
Perhaps you'll change your mind. I hope you
and Susan will decide to stay and help us.

292
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,174
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

293
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,737
A warm, generous-hearted woman,
but I'm afraid very stubborn.

294
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,369
- The lights are on again!
- They've got the electricity going!

295
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:28,410
- Who turned all the lights on?
- It's happened! France is back to normal.

296
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,936
- Maybe I can reach someone on the phone.
- The lights are on?

297
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,694
Yes, isn't it wonderful?

298
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,019
Allô? Allô?

299
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,492
- You won't get an answer, Miss Durant.
- Why are you so sure?

300
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,415
I put some fuel in the auxiliary motor for
the generator. While it lasts, we have light.

301
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,572
But there's nothing I can
do about the phone.

302
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,128
Cortex of the root system.

303
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,739
It's good to see you working again, Tom.

304
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,690
I assure you it's not for the greater glory
of science. I just want us to survive.

305
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,737
- We will.
- Huh!

306
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,539
Damn it all, I'm not even a botanist!

307
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,659
- Is it a plant or an animal?
- Who knows?

308
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,972
Doesn't seem to have a
central nervous system.

309
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,416
- No circulation.
- Then, how does it move?

310
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:08,257
All plants move. But they don't usualy pull
themselves out of the ground and chase you!

311
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,852
If we could find out how
this thing functions...

312
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,012
.. we might figure out an
easier way of killing it.

313
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,812
Look, you must get some sleep.

314
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,052
- There's no time.
- Just an hour.

315
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,940
Then I'll wake you, I promise.

316
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,499
Tom...

317
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,735
You realy must get some sleep.

318
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:40,336
Sleep now. I'll wake you in an hour.

319
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,169
Arghh!

320
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,732
Tom...

321
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,809
It got out! It came to life and it got out!

322
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,619
They regenerate.

323
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:29,817
Like worms - cut them in half,
you can't kill them.

324
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,019
There's no telling how many are out there.
Get the hammer and nails.

325
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,853
It's like being nailed in your own coffin.

326
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:28,211
- Bettina, what are you doing out here?
- I wanted to talk to you.

327
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:32,259
- You shouldn't wander round by yourself.
- I had to talk to you.

328
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:38,330
Is it true you're going to
leave us to go to Spain?

329
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,174
- Yes.
- But what about the rest of us?

330
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:50,095
Bettina, the ony way I can help
is to try to find some real help.

331
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:54,617
- I can't do it by staying here.
- Then you're coming back?

332
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,609
Yes... if I can.

333
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,329
I hope you do come back.

334
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,813
Come on, I'd better get you back inside.

335
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,290
- A triffid.
- A what?

336
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,178
A triffid.

337
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,492
The original triffid,
the kind I saw in a greenhouse years ago,

338
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,652
was known to have come
to Earth on a meteorite.

339
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:45,689
This reappearance must have been caused
by the meteorite explosion the other night.

340
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,169
Why should they attack people?

341
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:54,495
Most plants thrive on animal waste. I'm afraid
this mutation has an appetite for the animal itself.

342
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,293
This must be how they propagate.

343
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:07,292
- There are millions of them.
- One light wind and they're everywhere.

344
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,098
- Susan, where's Miss Durant?
- In there.

345
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,979
- I've something to tell you.
- Wait a minute.

346
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,375
- Miss Durant.
- One moment. Please sit down.

347
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:40,933
Now, Miss Durant, whether you like it or not,
we have to pack up and leave.

348
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,615
- Did you bring some more supplies?
- You tell her.

349
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:49,490
Mason's right. In 24 hours
the vicinity will be swarming with triffids.

350
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:55,178
I cannot leave all these people here to die!
I grew up with them. They're my friends.

351
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,659
Listen!

352
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:04,611
Bill, it's that plane again! It flew over before.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

353
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,053
Come on, Coker!

354
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,776
He says Toulon, the naval base,
is a rescue centre.

355
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:12,173
Toulon. 'Course, the French base
in the Mediterranean near Marseilles.

356
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,131
He's dead.

357
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,699
Ahh!

358
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,135
Are you all right?

359
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,170
- What's the matter?
- My ankle, I can't go on.

360
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,535
I'll carry you.

361
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,773
Coker?

362
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,292
Coker?

363
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,619
- Bill!
- What's going on?

364
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,577
- Shh!
- What is it?

365
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:42,894
Some men, convicts, I think. They've taken
the girls in there and made them dance.

366
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,972
- They brought food and whisky.
- How many?

367
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,335
- I don't know, a lot.
- They can see?

368
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,297
- Yes.
- Where's Miss Durant?

369
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,692
She's with them.
They said they'd kill anyone who...

370
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,572
No! No!

371
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:39,616
Stay here and lock the doors.
Don't open for anyone but me.

372
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,654
Go on. Susan's in the car.

373
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,851
You're not one of us!

374
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,779
Come on.

375
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:44,336
Susan, open up!

376
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,938
I can't open it!

377
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,817
Arghh!

378
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,296
Susan, get over the other side!

379
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,298
Arghh!

380
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:45,532
Arghh!

381
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,818
Arghh!

382
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,009
Arghhh!

383
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:30,619
The things I said to you back at the chateau,
I had no right to say them.

384
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:37,489
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'd probaby
have said the same, under the circumstances.

385
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,611
Feel guilty, huh?

386
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,179
Maybe.

387
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:46,013
- You know why?
- Why?

388
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,648
Because you survived.

389
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,698
Bettina, Coker and all the rest dead.

390
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,499
And you're alive and you wonder why.

391
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:58,369
- That's exacty right.
- I know the feeling.

392
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:02,328
In the war, you get a ship
shot out from underneath you...

393
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,492
.. all your friends gone,
ony a handful left.

394
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,938
You ask yourself,
"Why me? Why not someone better?"

395
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,860
Where will we go in Spain?

396
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:32,176
There's a big American naval base
in southern Spain, at Cadiz.

397
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,299
They're equipped for disaster.
They've got supplies.

398
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,128
So were the French at Toulon.

399
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,338
Negative.

400
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,576
Five per cent nitric acid
solution: negative.

401
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:01,372
Not that I expected a miracle.
I didn't think we'd find a magic bullet.

402
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,612
But absolutey nothing
seems to affect this tissue.

403
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:08,498
They live, they grow, they take nourishment.

404
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:15,060
They have sensory response,
they absorb and expend energy.

405
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,577
No matter what they're made of,
something must interrupt their life cycle.

406
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:24,733
Fundamentaly, it's a simple problem,
like finding a weedkiller.

407
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:33,658
No help out there.
There's been nothing on the air for days.

408
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:39,653
Can't help thinking
about that last radio call from Devonport.

409
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:45,978
The way the place caught fire and blew up,
it was like listening to the end of the world.

410
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:51,692
Well, it's not the end of the world, not quite yet.
There's an answer here, there has to be!

411
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:11,694
- We'd better find the answer pretty soon.
- What are they doing out there?

412
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,888
Staring in at us
like guards outside a condemned cell.

413
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:20,934
- Let's get through this checklist again.
- Right.

414
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,139
Whoa.

415
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:51,138
You're a good horse. You must be tired.
I'm going to find you some fresh green grass.

416
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:56,658
- Bill, may I go and look at the fair?
- Yes, but don't wander off.

417
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,732
If we can find something,
we'll eat right away.

418
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,735
- Ooh!
- Sorry, did I burn you?

419
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,891
No, it's nothing.

420
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:25,491
Bill, do you think we have a chance?

421
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:31,739
Once you taste this coffee of mine,
you'll know nothing worse can happen!

422
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:39,217
Your coffee is very good.
In fact, you're a handy man in the kitchen.

423
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:42,178
I've been doing for myself a long time.

424
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:47,852
- You have never been married?
- No.

425
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:51,729
- Why?
- Never been around long enough to get caught.

426
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,209
Now you're saddled with a famiy.

427
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,649
It might have its points.

428
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,213
Susan!

429
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:13,410
Look what I've found!

430
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,780
We could use it. We'll take it.

431
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,976
We can't leave our horse!

432
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:25,134
- We'll leave him in a field. He'll be fine.
- We can't leave him! I won't go!

433
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:30,533
- Susan, be reasonable. We can't take him.
- Don't let him, Christine! It isn't fair!

434
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:36,013
- It's mean! He doesn't have any right!
- But it's not Bill's fault, Susan.

435
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:42,096
He's ony doing what's right for all of us.
He'll never hurt you, never, if he can help it.

436
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:44,820
- You know that.
- I know.

437
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:08,779
- Are we on the right road for Cadiz?
- I think so.

438
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:36,409
What's the matter?
Let's find out.

439
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:02,973
Hello? Is anybody here?

440
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:16,137
Please... Please come in, come in.

441
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,370
Oh, God. Teresa!

442
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:25,694
Teresa, ven pronto! Ha llegado gente.
Pueden ver. Nos ayuderán.

443
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,930
I knew it. That's my rope.

444
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:32,252
- Luís de la Vega.
- I'm Bill Mason. This is Susan and Miss Durant.

445
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:35,539
But, please... Teresa...

446
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,736
.. three guests!

447
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,858
- This is my wife, Teresa.
- Welcome.

448
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,648
We are not the ony two people
left in this part of the world.

449
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:49,893
I believed someone would arrive to help.
That's why I put up the rope.

450
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,735
We are expecting a baby
and need someone to help.

451
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,733
Perhaps the two ladies could...?

452
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,490
You can't see?

453
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:08,812
- You both seem so natural.
- My wife has been blind for many years.

454
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:14,054
Now she's teaching me to get around.
But you ladies will stay and help her?

455
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:20,614
- Of course.
- Please be seated. I'll go and get some food.

456
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:23,169
We'll help. Come along, Susan.

457
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:29,055
- We were trying to get to Cadiz.
- You don't know about that?

458
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:32,735
- Know what?
- They had to evacuate the naval base.

459
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:37,416
- They did? How?
- By submarine. I heard it on my radio.

460
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:43,052
Some submarines were submerged on the night
of the meteorites. The crews were all right.

461
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:48,089
I tried to contact them with my transmitter
but something went wrong.

462
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:51,013
I can neither transmit nor receive.

463
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:57,372
- Let's take a look. Maybe I can fix it.
- Oh, are you familiar?

464
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:01,852
Yes, as first mate,
I have to have a working knowledge of it.

465
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:19,374
<i>.. from the Gibraltar Rescue Centre.</i>

466
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:23,135
<i>Final survivor pick-up
will be on Saturday at Alicante.</i>

467
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:28,215
<i>We repeat our warning.
Vast bands of triffids are roaming the area.</i>

468
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:32,498
<i>Do not travel at night. Barricade all doors.</i>

469
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:39,133
<i>We repeat our warning.
Do not travel at night. Barricade all doors.</i>

470
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,459
<i>Final survivor pick-up
will be on Saturday at Alicante.</i>

471
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:48,809
That's tomorrow!
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

472
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:32,055
I think that'll work.

473
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:34,973
When I tell you, turn that switch.

474
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,694
OK, Susan, turn it on.

475
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:54,452
Well, it works.

476
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:57,612
All right, Susan, you can turn it off now.

477
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,212
- Baby born?
- Yes, it's a boy.

478
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,894
- How is he?
- Fine.

479
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,338
- And the mother?
- She's weak, but that's to be expected.

480
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,139
- Hmm.
- Bill!

481
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,619
Susan!

482
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,899
Look!

483
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,494
Susan, go turn on the switch.

484
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:24,337
The current's weakening.
Susan, get back to the house!

485
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,339
We just don't have enough power!

486
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,413
Come on!

487
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,500
Keep the engine running.

488
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:49,217
- Why do they keep coming back?
- I don't know, Susan.

489
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,099
There must be some reason.

490
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:58,299
- Maybe they can hear us.
- Hmm?

491
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,614
Hey, maybe that's it.

492
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,419
Maybe it's sound that attracts them.

493
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:09,458
That generator... Come on, Susan.

494
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:23,212
You're right. It's sound that attracts them!

495
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:32,810
If sound leads them to us,
it can lead them away, too.

496
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,734
- Like the Pied Piper of Hamelin.
- Yeah!

497
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:41,733
Yeah, the Pied Piper.
Susan, you've hit it! Come on.

498
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:49,170
When it's dawn, open the gates and take off.
But until then, no noise at all. All right?

499
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:50,773
Come on.

500
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:02,733
- What about you?
- I'll see you in Alicante.

501
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:08,740
Windows up, hmm?

502
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:27,293
Time to get aboard, Miss. We're sailing.

503
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,859
Miss Durant, we have to go now.

504
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:38,213
<i>The submarine will depart
in five minutes. Life rafts will search for survivors.</i>

505
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:44,891
Hey!

506
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,696
Ahoy!

507
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:22,418
Hey!

508
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:54,093
<i>This is the Gibraltar Rescue Centre
for the Mediterranean area.</i>

509
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,730
<i>Our pick-up at Alicante
has been made on schedule.</i>

510
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,892
<i>This is the final rescue
operation for the present.</i>

511
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:04,052
<i>Stay tuned to this wavelength
for further bulletins.</i>

512
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:08,577
<i>Repeat.. stay tuned to this wavelength
for further bulletins.</i>

513
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:13,971
- How far is Gibraltar?
- Too far to swim. Let's get back to work.

514
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:30,297
Get away from that window!
Stop staring at them!

515
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:45,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

516
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:11,094
Karen, they're dissolving!
The sea water's dissolving them!

517
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:43,211
- Tom!
- Get back!

518
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,732
Arghh!

519
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:21,174
Turn the pressure up!

520
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:28,779
Sea water!
Two-thirds of the Earth is covered with it.

521
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:37,374
You hunt and you search
and all the while the answer's right in front of you!

522
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:44,334
<i>A simple method had been found
to destroy the triffids.</i>

523
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:47,972
<i>Sea water, from which life
on Earth had sprung,</i>

524
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:51,132
<i>became the means of
preserving life on Earth.</i>

525
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:53,655
<i>Mankind survived</i>

526
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:57,290
<i>and once again had reason to give thanks.</i>
