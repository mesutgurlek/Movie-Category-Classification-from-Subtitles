1
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,362
Please, don't leave me in here.

2
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,506
Jake, I promise I won't be long.

3
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,007
She'll kill me
before you get back.

4
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,044
You're very safe here.

5
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,342
All right? Nobody's gonna harm you.

6
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,146
We're only locking the door

7
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,814
because we're worried
you might try and leave again.

8
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,324
I left because she was in here.

9
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,529
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

10
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,064
I promise you, Jake,

11
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,935
I would never let
anything bad happen to you.

12
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,736
Jake, I'm not trying to punish you,

13
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,804
but I have to be sure that you're safe
while I tend to other patients.

14
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,879
You see that camera up there?

15
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,688
Someone will be watching you
the whole time.

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,723
That won't stop her.

17
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,664
You have got to get some rest.

18
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,904
She killed my whole family.
She's gonna kill me.

19
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,603
- She's gonna kill me.
- Hey, easy.

20
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,974
Please. Please don't leave.

21
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,208
I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,752
Nobody should have to go through
what you've been through.

23
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,248
It doesn't matter.

24
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,117
I'm already dead.

25
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,193
I'll be back as soon as I can.

26
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,332
No. No.

27
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,390
She's here.

28
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,996
No. She's here! Let me out! She's here!

29
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,398
Dr. Sullivan, you'd
better get down there.

30
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,459
Another nightmare?

31
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,265
Sorry to wake you.

32
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,465
It's that same dream again?

33
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,476
Go back to sleep.

34
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,846
It was left on my desk to shame me.

35
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,273
It never stops.

36
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,479
"BIZARRE DEATH FOR
AMERICAN TRAGEDY SURVIVOR"

37
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:20,157
We'll move.
We can leave Tokyo if you want.

38
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,223
It's not just about what happened today.

39
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,526
What makes you sure this is part of it?

40
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:32,434
If you follow it from the beginning,
it's all connected,

41
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,902
and now it's in Chicago.

42
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,836
This happened in Chicago?
Then it has nothing to do with us.

43
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,171
Yes, it does.

44
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,050
I can't hide from this anymore.

45
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,686
Naoko, you're upset. People are talking.

46
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,748
Let them talk.

47
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,485
I told you, it's not about
what happened at the office.

48
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,896
Naoko! Naoko!

49
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,396
I understand your feelings,

50
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,163
but it's out of your control.

51
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,133
People are dying.

52
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,575
There's nothing you can do about it.

53
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,980
There is. There is!

54
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,611
Wait, hey. What about me?

55
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,779
Watch out for the fire alarm.

56
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,321
There's a closet wall, too.
Where're your keys?

57
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,506
- How many have we done it in?
- A lot.

58
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,987
You do know the only
reason I'm dating you

59
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,821
is 'cause you have the keys
to a whole apartment building, right?

60
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,356
I don't have the keys to anything.
My brother does.

61
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,228
You know the only reason I'm dating you

62
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,564
is 'cause I need a fashion model
for my designs.

63
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,833
You know I'm cool with that.
You can dress me up.

64
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,670
I'm really happy we're
doing this together.

65
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:28,736
Yeah. New York's gonna be awesome.
They have no idea what's about to hit them.

66
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,306
- Wait till you see what's about to hit you.
- Nice.

67
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,480
What?

68
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,356
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

69
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,328
What apartment is this?

70
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,864
Fuck, this is where that family...

71
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,066
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay.

72
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,684
- Rose, why so many dolls?
- It's a going away party.

73
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,627
- For who?
- Lisa.

74
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,631
Rose?

75
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,998
- Is it time for your medicine?
- No, I'm okay.

76
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,811
I'm letting Lisa take two of my dolls
with her on the trip.

77
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,509
- Are you?
- They wanna see the world.

78
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,384
And what about you, Rose?
Do you want to see the world?

79
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,888
I'm gonna when Lisa gets famous.

80
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,526
Hey. Hey, just put it
out of your mind, Lis.

81
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,726
Okay? Forget about it.
We're out of here soon enough.

82
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,428
Yeah, but I knew them.

83
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:03,338
I know you did, but it's the past,
and the past can't hurt you.

84
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,535
Okay?

85
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,607
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

86
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,350
There she is.

87
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,584
Lisa!

88
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,854
Hi, Rose.

89
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,398
- Hey, Gretchen. Where's Max?
- Right behind you.

90
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,934
- Thanks for watching her, Gretchen.
- Always a pleasure.

91
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,430
Rose is an angel.

92
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,868
How's the painting going?

93
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:39,741
Well, the arthritis makes it hard.
I use more ointment than paint these days.

94
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,005
- Bye, Rose.
- Bye.

95
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,740
- Have a good party.
- I will.

96
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

97
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,719
You're late.
I had to ask Gretchen to look after Rose.

98
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,187
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

99
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,884
- What?
- Cough them up.

100
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,328
We just needed a little privacy.

101
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,659
You're leaving town with the guy.
Can't it wait?

102
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,857
Wait, where are you going?

103
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,992
Well, now that I've got the keys,
I can do some things that need to get done.

104
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,400
Okay.

105
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,532
Oh, no.

106
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,022
- What's with Max today?
- He doesn't like people moving.

107
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,393
He doesn't like people moving out.

108
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,600
- Do boys like Mr. Potato Head?
- I guess.

109
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,848
Come back in, Rose.

110
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,422
I left him a toy.

111
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,655
- Who?
- The boy.

112
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,197
- What boy?
- I think he's new.

113
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,699
No, there's no new boys here.

114
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,870
- Where are you going?
- Can't leave a toy in the hall, Rose.

115
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,874
- Max'll have a fit.
- It's for the boy.

116
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,078
Where did you put it?

117
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,083
A toy'll make him feel better.

118
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,099
Well, I guess these belong to you.

119
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,934
Yeah. I really wish
I could convince you guys to stay.

120
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,372
- We're gonna miss you around here.
- Well, it's best for Brenda.

121
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,934
She's been having a rough time
since that family died.

122
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,444
A change of scene might help.

123
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,414
Well, if there's ever anything I can do
to help out,

124
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:04,012
a landlord recommendation
or anything at all, you know who to call.

125
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,421
Tell Lisa and Rose we said bye.

126
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,791
Mr. Praski, I didn't know you were
coming by. I was just seeing...

127
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,629
Two more tenants off.

128
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,464
Yeah, they were good ones.

129
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,403
- Reporters still hassling you?
- No, sir. I've been keeping them out.

130
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,065
Good, good.

131
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,042
Max, there's something
we gotta talk about.

132
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,842
I've been riding the contractors
like you said. I'll push them harder.

133
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:33,475
I've been thinking. Maybe it's time
to bring in a management company.

134
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:38,022
Someone to help put things back on track.
It's nothing personal.

135
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,591
I've got some prospects lined up.

136
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,819
- And there's a woman coming by.
- Yeah?

137
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,863
Yeah, I mean,
she sounds really eager to rent.

138
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,761
Don't let her get away, Max.

139
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,357
We got money flowing
in the wrong direction.

140
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,477
"You are charming
and wise beyond your years."

141
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,375
That's a compliment, not a fortune.

142
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,919
What's yours say?

143
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:15,258
Tell you what, I'll set up your bed
while you take a bath.

144
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,918
How's that sound?

145
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,167
You used to love taking a bath.

146
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,231
Half the water ended up on the floor.

147
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:34,044
I'll get a towel.
God knows where the mover put the box.

148
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,856
Brenda!

149
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,862
Brenda!

150
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,795
- How do I look?
- Like a crazy guy.

151
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,896
Everything changes today, Rose.
I can feel it. Can you feel it?

152
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,634
I don't feel it.

153
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,577
Come on, don't say that.
You have to think positive.

154
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,805
Okay.

155
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,746
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

156
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,580
Attagirl. Wish me luck.

157
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,313
Good luck!

158
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,386
- You must be Naoko.
- Naoko.

159
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:36,160
Naoko, sorry. I'm Max.
Glad you made it okay.

160
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,032
- I'm sorry if I kept you waiting.
- No.

161
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,664
- Good then. Shall we get started?
- Yes.

162
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:43,900
Okay.

163
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,505
There is an elevator right there,

164
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,381
but it's old and most tenants
just use the stairs.

165
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,249
More communal.

166
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:01,486
Yeah, sorry about the mess.
We're in a transitional phase,

167
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,928
as you can see. 303 is down here.

168
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,568
Now this'll all be fresh paint before
you know it. It should be really nice

169
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,538
before you know it.
Really nice. Sorry about the mess.

170
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,974
You know, you're lucky. This is the first
floor to get the makeover treatment.

171
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,535
The owner's sinking a lot
into restoration. Every detail.

172
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,081
Here we are.

173
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,480
Okay.

174
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:36,951
Now, as you can see,
sizeable living room,

175
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,654
bright open plan.

176
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:44,361
In here, we've got the dining room,
kitchen, and even a little sun room there.

177
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:50,264
- Do you live here, as well?
- Me and the girls. Two sisters.

178
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,837
So I'll be right downstairs
if you need anything.

179
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:59,116
- How many others in the building?
- It's a quiet building.

180
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,278
There's hardly a peep out of anyone.

181
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,986
Now, there are three bedrooms,
if you wanna follow me.

182
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,829
Hi.

183
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,509
- May I?
- No, you may not.

184
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,441
You need to learn to share.

185
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,913
Guys, this is Naoko, potential neighbor.

186
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,779
Just grabbing an application.

187
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,253
Welcome, potential neighbor.
I'm Lisa, and this is Rose.

188
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,554
Rose. Like the flower.

189
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,854
If you see stuff for Rose sitting
outside, bring it in, okay?

190
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,394
Okay, sorry.

191
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,766
- So, where are you moving from?
- I'm from Tokyo.

192
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,359
- Here you go.
- You have a lovely family.

193
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,665
Thanks.

194
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,287
- I need that?
- No, ma'am.

195
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,886
The doctor just wanted to make sure
I could read the instructions.

196
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,393
It's okay.

197
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,623
The kids wear these at the hospital
all the time.

198
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,059
Can I breathe underwater with that?

199
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,834
You need a scuba tank for that.

200
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,033
I could go in a shark cage.

201
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:09,275
You could, but I'd be careful.
Sharks have a taste for little girls.

202
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:15,285
Look, I'm just gonna put this in the closet,
and we're never gonna talk about it again.

203
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,718
Come here.

204
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,918
Things'll get better. I promise.

205
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,556
Not always.

206
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:28,256
- What do you mean?
- Things don't always get better.

207
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,028
Like for those people,
the ones that died.

208
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,131
That's different. Entirely different.

209
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,805
Do you miss them?

210
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,947
I miss every tenant that leaves.

211
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,883
We take care of everyone here
in our own way.

212
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,482
You take their money.

213
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,429
That's part of our way.

214
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,162
Come here, shark bait.

215
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:16,070
Showed Rose the oxygen thing.
She wanted to go scuba diving.

216
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,510
- You tell her it was just a precaution?
- Yeah.

217
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:26,422
- So, New York's a crazy place.
- Well, so is Chicago, right?

218
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,319
I just worry, you know.

219
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,985
I'm gonna be fine.

220
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,621
Yeah, but aren't there fashion jobs here?

221
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,200
It's not about the job.
It's the internship.

222
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,269
If I could swing a scholarship from this,

223
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,066
then we can use the rest of my college
fund to pay for Rose's medical bills.

224
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,300
- I don't know.
- I'm just trying to help.

225
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,610
Look, if you wanna help,
you could stay here.

226
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,272
Okay, put off the internship.

227
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,441
Go when things are stable.

228
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,048
Max, my being here
isn't gonna change anything.

229
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,122
We need you, Lisa.

230
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,191
Now is all that matters.

231
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,493
Rose is getting worse.
Okay, the building is going to hell.

232
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,993
I may lose my job.

233
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,593
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,967
Would it have made a difference?

235
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,815
Aunt Diane's been floating the offer
for us to move in.

236
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,754
- With her five cats?
- It's more like eight.

237
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,255
And I know we joke, but it's now
becoming our only option here.

238
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,126
Rose hates it there.

239
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,935
I can't do this alone.

240
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,406
If things work out,
I could make us stable.

241
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,343
Rose has her checkup,

242
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,890
and then I'm taking her to the park
to feed the ducks.

243
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,422
You can meet us there later if you like.

244
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,593
Hello?

245
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,364
Hello.

246
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,542
We don't allow reporters in here.

247
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:10,239
I'm not a reporter.
I have permission from the manager.

248
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,509
The manager's my brother.

249
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,643
You must be Lisa. I'm Dr. Sullivan.

250
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,245
The boy who lived here
was a patient of mine.

251
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,482
Jake.

252
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,393
- How is he?
- I'm sorry, I thought...

253
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,820
Jake passed away.

254
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,593
What? How?

255
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:35,030
Actually, we're not quite sure,
to be honest with you.

256
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:43,973
He said a lot of things
about the night that his family died.

257
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,546
So I guess I just wanted
to come and see for myself.

258
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,717
Are there any other boys living
in this building?

259
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,119
No, Jake was it.

260
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,617
Why?

261
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:00,191
He talked about a boy, seeing a boy here.

262
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,533
He was terrified of him.

263
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,830
My sister saw a boy recently.

264
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,427
Here?

265
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,933
Maybe I could talk with her?

266
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,536
She isn't really a fan of doctors
to tell you the truth.

267
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,808
So, Jake...

268
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,943
How long ago?

269
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,520
Not long.

270
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,988
The service is tomorrow. At Lakemore.

271
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,956
Hey, there you are.

272
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,029
This was the last place
I thought you'd be.

273
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,563
Andy.

274
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,361
- How you doing?
- Andy.

275
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,230
This is Dr. Sullivan.

276
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,071
Hi.

277
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:46,638
Hey, if you're thinking of renting, this is a...
You know, it's a good place.

278
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:50,339
- Good people.
- She was Jake's doctor, Andy. He died.

279
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,780
Shit.

280
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,352
I'm sorry.

281
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,522
- I thought you were just here...
- It was nice meeting you.

282
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,251
Nice to meet you.

283
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,464
- You ass.
- How was I supposed to know?

284
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:12,835
Anyway, I thought that kid survived
that whole thing.

285
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,434
- What happened to him?
- She didn't say.

286
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,804
- I don't want to think about it.
- Wait, wait, wait.

287
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,877
I've got some time before work.

288
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,539
- You are unbelievable.
- What?

289
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,977
Not on this floor.

290
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,649
Then... Then where?

291
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,189
There's an empty on four,
but I'd have to go sneak the keys.

292
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:38,422
Okay, so grab the keys,
and I'll meet you on four.

293
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,058
Fine.

294
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,633
Okay.

295
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,549
Busted.

296
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,323
Rose, will you go to your room
for me, please?

297
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:15,666
Lisa, we talked about this.
I can't watch Rose and you.

298
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,565
- I don't need to be watched.
- Of course not.

299
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,804
Come on, Max, give me a break.

300
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,735
I'll give you a break
when you start acting like an adult.

301
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,042
Fine. Whatever.

302
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,445
I won't be your problem
much longer anyway.

303
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,451
Is that how you see it?
Or is it that we won't be your problem?

304
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,079
Oh, my God.

305
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,678
You scared the shit out of me.

306
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,717
What are you doing up there?

307
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,556
Hey, you coming up or what?

308
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,101
You could have come inside.

309
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,534
I didn't really feel comfortable.

310
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:24,597
Well, I've always found funerals
more for closure than comfort.

311
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,234
Hey, there's something
I wanted to ask you.

312
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,279
Yeah, sure, what is it?

313
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,913
The boy that Jake talked about.

314
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,379
- Did he ever describe him?
- Why? Did your sister see him again?

315
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,617
No. Actually, I think I might have.

316
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,088
Why was he so afraid of him?

317
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,625
I never fully understood.

318
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,798
The boy played a role
in the alternate theory Jake created

319
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,873
in order to deal with
the death of his family.

320
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,242
There's something at my office
that I'd like you to see.

321
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,214
It may help answer
questions for both of us.

322
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:10,379
And I can drive you
back home if you like.

323
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,615
- Okay.
- Okay, good. I'm just right here.

324
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,579
And now you can go around there.

325
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,719
There you go.

326
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,919
You shouldn't be up there.

327
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,360
You should be down here
doing your homework.

328
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:28,656
Max.

329
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,626
Rose?

330
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,433
Rose? Come here. It's all right.

331
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:38,968
Hang on.

332
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,313
Hang on, Rose.

333
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:56,952
Hang on. I got you. I got you, babe.
Okay, here we go. Come on.

334
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,925
The woman's name is Kayako Saeki,

335
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:08,027
and the father is Takeo,
and the boy is Toshio.

336
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,967
That's him. That's the boy.

337
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,073
Maybe they knew Jake from somewhere?

338
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,843
Did they say anything?
Did you talk to them?

339
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,286
They're dead.

340
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,782
Dead?

341
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,217
It happened in Japan.

342
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,760
Years ago.

343
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:35,897
Father murdered his wife and son
before hanging himself.

344
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,233
Did you know a girl named Allison Fleming
who lived in your building,

345
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,534
the one who went missing?

346
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,577
Not really.
She was always away at school.

347
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,643
Jake thought she brought
something back with her,

348
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,183
something dark that changed her.

349
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:58,049
Allison visited the house
where the Saeki family died.

350
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,516
I wanna show you something.

351
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,264
This is footage
from my very first session with Jake.

352
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,427
At the time,
his stepmother was the primary suspect.

353
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:17,268
My job was to evaluate
his mental condition.

354
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,203
<i>I'm not making it up.</i>

355
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,302
<i>I don't believe you, Jake.</i>

356
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,903
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

357
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,878
<i>You see her when no
one else is around.</i>

358
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,785
<i>She's real.</i>

359
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,685
<i>Well, I don't see her.</i>

360
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,282
<i>- She's real.</i>
<i>- Describe her again.</i>

361
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:45,399
<i>She... She has black hair,</i>
<i>and it hangs over her face.</i>

362
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:54,007
<i>All over, on her body, there's...</i>

363
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,242
<i>There's blood.</i>

364
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,184
<i>There's blood all over her body?</i>

365
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:07,181
<i>And it's like she's dead.</i>

366
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,721
I reasoned he'd witnessed his
stepmother kill his sister and father.

367
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,532
Unable to cope with what he saw,

368
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:22,538
he invented these gruesome ideations
of a boy and a woman

369
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,038
in order to disassociate himself
from the truth.

370
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,134
But I saw the boy myself.

371
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,638
Yeah, I was wrong.

372
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,444
Unimaginably wrong.

373
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,656
You never told me how he died.

374
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:49,162
Our surveillance system shows him
reacting to a hallucination.

375
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:55,128
Only somehow that hallucination
broke nearly every bone in his body.

376
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,614
Max?

377
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,487
- Where have you been?
- I was with Andy.

378
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,692
Rose was in the hospital.

379
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,059
What?

380
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,230
Oh, my God.

381
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:25,662
Why?

382
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,964
Doctor said she overexerted herself.

383
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,234
- Doing what?
- I don't know.

384
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,209
She was playing.

385
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,043
I told you she's getting worse.

386
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,683
Yeah, but I thought the new medicine
was supposed to help...

387
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,513
It's not enough.

388
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,680
She may have to start wearing
the oxygen thing.

389
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:51,184
I guess I'll keep you updated
when you're gone.

390
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,355
I'll be calling. Every day.

391
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,657
It's better than nothing.

392
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,937
Why don't you tuck her in?

393
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,336
Make the most of your last day?

394
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,375
Hey, Rose. How you doing?

395
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,851
- Don't stop.
- I know.

396
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,722
Until you're asleep.

397
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:36,033
I love you. You know that?

398
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:07,526
Rose? Rose, what's wrong?

399
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,031
- What is it, Rose?
- The boy, he's here.

400
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,897
- Where?
- In my room.

401
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,401
No.

402
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,103
No.

403
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,090
There's nothing there.

404
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,719
You wanna sleep in my room tonight?

405
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,657
Okay.

406
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,000
Ben! Ben, open the door!

407
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:07,133
Ben, help me! Open the door, please!

408
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:11,874
Ben! Please, help me! Help me, Ben!

409
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,327
Can I go play in the snow
when we get there?

410
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,556
Sorry, the snow's all gone.

411
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,933
Let's get you buttoned up, though.
Let's go.

412
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,464
Hi. Naoko, right?

413
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,077
I was wondering if we could talk.

414
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,579
Yeah, we were just about to go
to the park if you want to come.

415
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,481
- Yes, I would like that.
- Okay.

416
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:58,027
It's easy sometimes to forget
how sick she is.

417
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:02,194
I understand.
On the outside, she is okay,

418
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,268
but on the inside,
things are getting worse.

419
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:13,500
It may sound strange
but a place can get sick the same way.

420
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:16,502
I don't follow.

421
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,244
I know what happened in your building.

422
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,785
Guess you changed your mind
about moving in?

423
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:26,913
No.

424
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,460
What happened in your building
is the reason I'm here.

425
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:09,423
Shit.

426
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:16,137
In Japan, there is another place,
sick because of what happened inside.

427
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,797
What happened?

428
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:24,037
A husband killed his wife and only child,
then himself.

429
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:29,077
An evil started with their deaths
but has spread.

430
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:34,346
Now it gathers here in your building.

431
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,352
- Can I go play on the swings?
- Yeah, go ahead.

432
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,200
Who are you?

433
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,872
The woman who was killed,

434
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,871
she was my sister, Kayako.

435
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,264
Kayako and I had a difficult life.

436
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,807
<i>Our mother was an</i> itako,
<i>someone who can commune with the dead.</i>

437
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:09,448
<i>From the time we were very young,</i>
<i>our mother taught us the old ways.</i>

438
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,987
For me it was frightening.

439
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,918
<i>For my sister, it was a nightmare.</i>

440
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,623
<i>Those possessed came to my mother</i>
<i>to be healed.</i>

441
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:28,664
<i>My mother took the evil from them</i>
<i>and fed the spirits to Kayako.</i>

442
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,598
<i>It silenced them,</i>

443
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,709
but my sister was changed forever.

444
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,957
Gretchen? Got a spill out here.

445
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:05,369
Gretchen?

446
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,592
Gretchen?

447
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,437
Gretchen?

448
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:59,224
When my sister was killed,
a <i>ju-on</i> was born.

449
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,930
In English, it is something like a curse.

450
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:08,126
- And now you think the curse is here?
- I am sure of it.

451
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,170
Well, then why would you come here?

452
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:14,072
- To put an end to it.
- How?

453
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:18,805
A simple ceremony in the place
where the curse was reborn.

454
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,040
The boy's home.

455
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:25,317
But I cannot do it alone. I need you.

456
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,048
You and Rose.

457
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:34,324
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
for what you've been through. I am.

458
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,262
And I believe that you want to help,

459
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:39,699
but this ceremony or whatever,
we can't be a part of it.

460
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:43,000
If the curse is not stopped,
more people will die.

461
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,438
- You must understand.
- I'm sorry.

462
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,843
Come on, Rose. Time to go. Let's go.

463
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,189
Let's go home now. Get some lunch, yeah?

464
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,854
- Max. Hey, we need to talk.
- Get Rose out of here.

465
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,930
- Why? What's going on?
- Just do it.

466
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,089
Okay.

467
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,877
What happened?

468
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:26,977
Max.

469
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,610
Are you okay?

470
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,050
Look, I think we might
need to get out of here.

471
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,086
I talked with Naoko today.

472
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,130
- Wait, you talked to Naoko?
- Yeah.

473
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,099
She thinks we might be in danger.

474
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:48,736
That's nice.

475
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,403
She doesn't have time
to sign her credit application

476
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,738
but she's got time to tell you
that we're in danger?

477
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:57,438
Are you even listening to me?
I'm saying that I'm worried.

478
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,075
What have you got to be worried about?

479
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:04,811
You're out of here soon.
It's not your problem now, is it?

480
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,126
<i>Miss Saeki is not
answering in her room.</i>

481
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,256
<i>We'll leave a message for her</i>
<i>at the front desk.</i>

482
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:37,051
- This is what you wanted.
- Yeah, I did. I do.

483
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,679
Do you want to tell me what changed?

484
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,891
- Andy...
- You said it yourself, Lisa.

485
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:47,622
If things work out in New York,
it's only gonna help Rose.

486
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,860
- It's just with...
- What? Gretchen dying?

487
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,595
Yeah.

488
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,331
- Yeah. She was a nice lady.
- You don't think it's strange?

489
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,104
What? All those people dying?

490
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:02,409
Yeah, it's a tragedy. But...

491
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,541
You can't let it stop you from living.

492
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,681
I mean, it's over.

493
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,551
- I'm not so sure that's true.
- Thanks.

494
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:23,798
Look, the thing with that kid,
it's creepy, yeah.

495
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,701
Scary? Okay, maybe.

496
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:32,772
- But real? No way.
- You don't know that.

497
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,338
You're just seeing connections
you want to see.

498
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:39,074
It all leads back to those murders
in Japan. It's all connected.

499
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,549
- Lisa, like, please.
- You're not even listening to me.

500
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:46,616
You know what?
You're just anxious about leaving.

501
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,348
All right? And I get that.

502
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:53,089
Hey, we're doing this together, though.

503
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,731
I'm not going to New York, Andy.

504
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,105
I'm sorry, but my family needs me.

505
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,972
- What? Just like that?
- Sorry.

506
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,317
Okay. Okay.

507
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:22,789
If you're not going, I'm not going.

508
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,094
There's no reason for you to stay.

509
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,401
How could you say that?

510
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:42,270
Lisa, the reason I'm staying is
the same reason why I was going.

511
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,972
You.

512
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,299
Where's Max?

513
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:44,030
- Rose, where is he?
- He said he had to work.

514
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,906
He left you here alone?

515
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,411
When is he coming back?

516
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,277
Have you eaten anything?

517
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,409
I'm gonna make you something to eat.
How does that sound?

518
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,611
Okay.

519
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:03,149
- Can you believe this?
- Do you want me to stay here?

520
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,658
I can just call in sick.

521
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,229
It's not like they're expecting
me to work on my last day anyway.

522
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,355
No, it's okay. You should go.

523
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:12,832
I mean, if we're not going to New York,
you might as well keep your job.

524
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:16,098
Anyway, I'm here.
I'm gonna make her some dinner.

525
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,704
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

526
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:22,741
Okay.
I'll give you a call when I'm off work.

527
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,945
I love you.

528
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,388
I love you, too.

529
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,929
Bye.

530
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,471
See you.

531
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:58,705
Okay.

532
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:14,053
Hey.

533
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:21,661
Hey.

534
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:42,715
Fuck.

535
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,435
You don't have to pick that stuff up
by yourself.

536
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,977
I'll get somebody in here to clean it out
when things get back to normal.

537
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,073
I've been over this,
trying to make it work,

538
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:44,278
but I gotta switch things up.

539
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,588
I'm going with
the management company option.

540
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,892
They start the first of the month.

541
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:56,995
You can stay, of course,

542
01:03:57,099 --> 01:04:00,000
but you gotta pay rent
like everybody else.

543
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,503
Might be temporary. Who knows?

544
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:06,404
What am I supposed to do now, Mr. Praski?

545
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:11,178
- How am I gonna take care of my family?
- Listen, business is business, kid.

546
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,681
Then fuck business, and fuck you.

547
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:18,978
Look, you don't gotta like the news, kid,
you just gotta take it.

548
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,062
It didn't have to be like this.

549
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,043
Where were you last night?

550
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,448
Manual labor. It's a bitch.

551
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,888
You left Rose alone.

552
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,757
- She can't be alone ever.
- I know that.

553
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,497
But I don't have Gretchen
to count on anymore, now, do I?

554
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:52,438
Listen, things are happening
and I think we should leave.

555
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,903
You're always making plans now,
aren't you?

556
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,707
I don't understand.

557
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,973
People are dying and you're
acting like nothing is happening.

558
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:05,543
How do you want me to act, Lisa?
Gretchen was old. Old people die.

559
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:08,652
Is that what you said to Rose?

560
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:13,619
I have been saddled with Rose
since Mom and Dad died. Not you, me.

561
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,264
She is not your problem!

562
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,266
What is wrong with you?

563
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:22,159
Not a goddamn thing, that's what.

564
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,005
I'm young, healthy.

565
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:27,507
I got all the time in the world
since I was just fired.

566
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,311
Yeah, what, are you surprised?

567
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,540
Surprised that I couldn't manage
a full-time job

568
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,912
while raising a
chronically sick 8-year-old?

569
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:36,882
You should have said something.

570
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:41,218
Gee, I wish I had. Wait, I did,

571
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:45,316
but you were too busy fucking Andy all over
the goddamn building to listen to me.

572
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:48,955
Max, please, can we just all go?
I mean, if we don't have to be here.

573
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:54,128
We're not going anywhere, sis.
But you, maybe it's time you go.

574
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:58,469
Max, what are you talking about?
What are you doing?

575
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,973
Max!

576
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:04,177
Stop. Max! What are you doing?

577
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:09,012
Max! Stop! Let me in!
You can't lock me out!

578
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:13,452
No, Max. You can't lock me out. Stop.

579
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:45,146
- What's going on?
- Go to your room.

580
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:50,882
- Where's Lisa?
- Go to your fucking room.

581
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:20,817
<i>- Cademan Clinic.</i>
- Dr. Sullivan, please?

582
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,759
<i>- She's not available.</i>
- Can I leave a message for her?

583
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:28,428
<i>I'm sorry, but there's been an
incident here at the clinic.</i>

584
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:31,056
- Excuse me?
<i>- Dr. Sullivan...</i>

585
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,027
<i>- Dr. Sullivan has passed away.</i>
- What?

586
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,604
<i>Dr. Sullivan is dead.</i>

587
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:21,912
I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.

588
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,452
We'll leave, then.

589
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:38,693
We'll leave. I'll go get Max and Rose
and we won't come back.

590
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:41,998
It's too late. It is a part of you now

591
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,597
and only a matter of time.

592
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,177
Before I die?

593
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,884
And Rose? Max?

594
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,351
Everyone.

595
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:08,094
Your sister, where is she?

596
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,589
She's with Max.

597
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,736
You said he was angry, aggressive.

598
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:22,032
He was. I mean, he is.

599
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,041
You cannot leave her with him.

600
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,107
Max would never hurt Rose.

601
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:33,817
A great fury is at work.
It has hold over your brother.

602
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:37,187
I don't believe that. He loves her.

603
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,820
Max may not be Max anymore.

604
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,732
I can help Rose but I
need her to be with us.

605
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:52,599
He'll never let that happen.

606
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:55,938
Then we cannot let that decision be his.

607
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:58,805
Okay.

608
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:08,586
All right, wait here.

609
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:28,768
Rose.

610
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,744
Rose. Come on.

611
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,131
Come.

612
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,015
Rose. Come.

613
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,538
Okay. Now what?

614
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:39,541
It's time.

615
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,950
No matter what you hear,

616
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,767
no matter what you see,

617
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:06,039
you must not interfere.

618
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:23,085
It's okay, Rose. It's like a prayer.
I'm right here.

619
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,505
What was that?

620
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:39,927
The blood of my sister.

621
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,169
- What are you doing?
- She needs to drink.

622
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,539
- Drink what?
- Please, it won't hurt.

623
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:53,638
- You didn't say anything about this.
- We are running out of time.

624
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:56,610
The curse must be contained.

625
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,265
Please, Rose, you can end it.

626
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:17,566
- You can make the bad go away.
- Come on, Rose. Let's go.

627
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,534
Come on.

628
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:22,868
Max.

629
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:00,714
Please, don't do this.

630
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,989
You have to understand.
There has been so much death.

631
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,065
Max, no.

632
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:26,766
Hurting me won't help.
I mean no harm to Rose.

633
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,942
The curse is doing this to you.

634
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,903
Leave us alone.

635
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,942
Come on, Rose. What is it?

636
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:10,131
No, no, no, no, no.

637
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:16,929
Rose.

638
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:24,576
Rose? Rose?

639
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:29,645
Oh, God, Rose, what did you do?
What did you do?

640
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:33,085
Okay, come on.

641
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:39,084
Max.

642
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:48,830
Oh, God.

643
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:51,538
No, Max.

644
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:57,903
Max.

645
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:16,555
Rose needs help, okay?
You have to help her, please.

646
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:18,790
Max!

647
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:24,267
Please. Max, please, we need you!

648
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,968
Come on, Rose. Help me out.

649
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,358
Stay with me, Rose.

650
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,808
Rose, stay with me. Please.

651
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:14,220
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe, Rose.

652
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,555
Are you okay?

653
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:25,928
Okay. Okay. All right.

654
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,359
Are you okay?

655
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:37,971
It's gonna be okay now, all right?
It's gonna be okay.

656
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:28,529
What the...

657
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:54,645
No. No.

658
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:04,923
Max? Rose, I have to go.

659
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,761
Here, this is gonna be here
if you need it, all right?

660
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:11,999
But just rest. You're okay now.
Just rest, all right? I'll be back.

661
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:31,249
Max?

662
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:10,658
We're gonna ride together
in the ambulance. Okay?

663
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:15,429
- I'll be with you the whole time.
- I'm scared.

664
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:20,307
I'm not gonna leave you.

665
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:25,606
Everything's gonna be okay.
Nothing can hurt us anymore.

666
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:28,846
All right?

667
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,947
As long as we stay together,

668
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,721
everything will be all right.

669
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,863
Okay? We just gotta stick together.

670
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,035
