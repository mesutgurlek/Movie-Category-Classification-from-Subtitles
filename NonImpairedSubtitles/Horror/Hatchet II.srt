There was a man named
Thomas Crowley.

He lived out there in
Honey Island Swamp

with his wife Shyann.

No kids, just the two of them.

would come by to tend to her.

How could you know?

331
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,745
How do you know
that my dad was involved?

332
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:06,520
Because if I had been brave enough,
I would have been out there too.

333
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,688
I'm an old acquaintance of Samson.

334
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,562
- When Crowley came after us last night--
- You saw him?

335
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,963
Yes.

336
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,063
He looked at me

337
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,470
like he knew me.

338
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,703
Perhaps he could sense
who you really were.

339
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,974
Perhaps it was all on your mind.

340
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:34,213
Victor Crowley is what's known in
the paranormal world as a repeater.

341
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,915
His tragic and untimely death
has left him forced to relive

342
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:43,826
that moment night after night,
over and over.

343
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:50,392
All he knows is the fear and
revenge towards anybody who
steps foot in that swamp.

344
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,165
You knew all this was real

345
00:22:53,205 --> 00:23:00,543
yet you still sent a tour boat
full of innocent people in there?

346
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,069
For what?

347
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,405
For what?
For money?

348
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,644
Shaun.

349
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,347
He wasn't supposed
to get that close.

350
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,380
He wasn't supposed
to stop for nothing.

351
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,450
Now I've had boats go into
that swamp for months now,

352
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,190
two months now,
with no worries.

353
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,562
Besides you knew the legend.

354
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,091
You went in there knowing
the story as did your father,

355
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:24,693
I went in--

356
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,034
who more than anybody
should have known better.

357
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,870
I went in there to find them

358
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,638
and I did!

359
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:37,273
Not many people have seen
the face of Victor Crowley

360
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,180
and lived to tell about it.

- Take me back there.
- What?

366
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:01,063
I can't leave them there.
Please.

367

Please.
I just wanna take them home.

368

I just wanna bury my family.

373

And if I can take that
monster out with me,

374

then all the better.

375
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:38,066
You can't kill him.

376
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,168
He'll just be reborn.

377
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:44,774
He's supposed to return to the
state he was when he was killed.

378
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:49,082
You can't kill a ghost.

deep into his fucking face!

Or would you rather I go to the police and
tell them about your swamp tour business?

the bodies of a boat full of tourists
