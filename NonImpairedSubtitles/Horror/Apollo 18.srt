1
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,515
There's just a lot
at stake here, you know?

2
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,060
<i>We're talkin' nation
versus nation,</i>

3
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,352
<i>and the race is still on.</i>

4
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,523
<i>There's lots to discover
out there, man.</i>

5
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,568
<i>I guess the call came in
on a Friday.</i>

6
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,031
Nate and I were
at Ben's for a barbecue.

7
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,994
<i>Um... Just a few beers,
you know, maybe more than a few.</i>

8
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,452
<i>With Ben's cooking,
you definitely need a few.</i>

9
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,625
<i>Nate took the call.
It was Milton,</i>

10
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,838
<i>and Milton said
18 was back on,</i>

11
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:28,427
but it was classified,
DOD, top secret.

12
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,683
Asked, you know,
"Are you OK with that?"

13
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,640
And he was like,
"Are you kidding me?"

14
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,515
<i>[man] I come from a family
of military pilots.</i>

15
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,685
Duty can sometimes
outbalance a private life.

16
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,151
<i>Make choices,
keep moving forward.</i>

17
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,317
<i>NASA already has something
like 800 pounds of rocks.</i>

18
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:52,079
So why we need more, I don't know, but,
hey, if it means a trip to the moon...

19
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,743
<i>Placing cameras. We got these
Westinghouses all over the place.</i>

20
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,878
<i>[John] Well, I think the way it's being
explained is they're using</i>

21
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,463
a Saturn V to launch
a classified DOD payload, uh,

22
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,846
which is meant to be very large,
very heavy, and, uh...

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,599
<i>...apparently unmanned.
- [Indistinct]</i>

24
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,351
Apparently.

25

<i>[Nate] Placing these

26

Part of some early warning

27
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,567
<i>against the Soviet Union.</i>

28
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,230
<i>These PSD5s are kind of like
high-tech radar scanners,</i>

29
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,741
<i>they should pick up and track
anything we can't.</i>

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,574
<i>Gotta keep a little eye
on the Russians, there.</i>

31
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,613
Would've been nice
to tell my wife.

32
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,034
<i>Laura had been by my side
the whole time, and, uh...</i>

33
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,705
...she thinks I'm off doing a training
exercise with the Japanese space agency.

34
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,922
<i>Ryan, my boy, would've been nice to tell
him his old man's goin' to the moon.</i>

35
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,553
<i>I would've loved to have
brought him a souvenir.</i>

36
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,760
<i>Maybe a moon rock.
I don't know. Maybe one day.</i>

37
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,847
<i>[John] Ban was always first in class,</i>

38
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,477
<i>and I was always right at his heels.</i>

39
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>Yeah, I'll admit, I'm a little jealous
that he'll be moon-walkin' with Nate</i>

40
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,309
<i>while I'll be all by my
lonesome, piloting the orbiter.</i>

41
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,356
My job is, essentially, to make
sure I bring us home safely.

42
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,610
<i>Look, let's face it, these
missions are result-oriented,</i>

43
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,451
and, uh, we can't afford
to fail here, now can we?

44
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,287
<i>[Ben] Things can go wrong,

46

00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,953
I'm going to have to mark
this one contaminated.

301
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,785
I don't understand.
How did it get there?

302
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,576
- I don't know.
- No, really, Ben, how'd that get there?

303
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,790
I don't know.

304

[Ben] Houston? Do you copy?

308
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,268
I think we lost them.

309
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,062
[Nate] Probably got
some comm blockage.

310
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
These are some big craters.

311

[Nate] Five days, ten hours,
40 minutes since liftoff.

Commander Nathan Walker.
We're on EVA-Two.

313
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,823
Initiating day two receiver setup.

314
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,587
Activating PSD5 transmission signal.

This is Liberty, over.

317
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,808
Still down.

318
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,892
[Ben] There is something
with that frequency.

319
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:08,434
Comm shouldn't be cuttin' out
like that, not for this length of time.

320
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,319
[Nate] Where are you goin'?

321
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,861
[Ben] What the hell?

322
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,697
- Nate.
- [Nate] What is it?

323
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,742
[Ben] Tracks.

324
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,332
[Nate] What?

325
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,838
[Ben] No, that's impossible.

326
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,999
These aren't ours.

[Nate] Houston, this is 18.
Do you copy?

331
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,568
Houston, this is 18. Do you read?

332
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,031
[Ben] John's on the backside.
No comm from him, either.

333
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,868
Well, let's see where they lead.

334
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,496
[Ben] Impact crater.

335
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,836
You feel that?

336
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,467
[Nate] Yeah. Temperature dropped.

337
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,090
[Ben] Look at the footprints.

338
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,769
It doesn't make sense.

339
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,430
I think he was
just walking in circles.

340
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,315
[Nate] Disoriented.

- [Ben] Oxygen dep?
- [Nate] I don't know.

342
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,067
They go off in this direction.

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,623
Get up here!

344
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,554
[Nate] Holy shit.

345
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,731
[Ben] it's Russian.

346
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,483
What the hell?

347
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,413
[Ben] How could there be Russians
on the moon and nobody knows about it?

348
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,126
[Nate] We're on the moon
and nobody knows about us.

349
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,258
[Ben] Something's not right.

350
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,718
[Nate] I'm gonna look inside.

351
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,358
Lights are off.

352
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,678
[Nate] Somebody lost it in here.

353
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,770
This place is trashed.

354
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,448
Their systems aren't
that different from ours.

[Beeping, whirring]

Oxygen reserves are good.

357
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,835
Can't tell if she's
fully operational, though.

358
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,045
- [Ben] Where the hell did they go?
- [Nate] I don't know.

359
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,883
[Ben] I'm gonna take a look around.

360
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,763
[Nate] But stay close.

361
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,016
Those Russians could be anywhere.

362
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,645
What the hell?

363
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,230
There's blood. A lot of it.

364
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,030
Somebody got hurt pretty bad.

365
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,956
[Ben] I don't like this.

366
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,302
I think I see something
inside the crater.

367

[Flash charging]

368
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,472
I'm goin' down.

369
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,984
[Nate] Wait, Ben. The suits
aren't ready for that kind of cold.

370
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,985
[Ben] It's OK,
the crater isn't so deep.

371
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,823
- [Flash charging]
- [Ben] it's so cold.

372
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,489
I just see rocks.

373
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,752
The ground, it's, uh...
it's different.

374
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,003
It feels... softer.

375
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,009
[Nate] Get out of there.

376
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,602
[Ben] Oh, God...

377
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,520
So cold.

378
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,939
- [Nate] Get out of there! Ben!
- [soft chittering]

379
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,075
[Ben] OK, yeah, all right.
I'm headin' back up.

380
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,282
[Ben] Holy shit! [gasping, panting]

381
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,373
[Ben] I found him!
I got the cosmonaut!

382
00:26:56,532 --> 00:27:01,003
[Panting] it's OK. I'm all right.
I'm on my way up!

383
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,713
- [Nate] You all right?
- Yeah, I'm warmin' up.

384
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,177
Oh, Christ.
What the hell happened here?

385
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,510
[Nate] Maybe the other cosmonaut?

386
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,642
[Ben] You think he killed him?

387
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,648
There's a rip.

388
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:31,071
[Nate] What are you doing?
Get your hand out of there.

389
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,570
[Ben] Wait a minute,
there's something...

390
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,613
[Nate] Get away from him!

391
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,578
[Ben] What the hell was that?

392
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,760
It was a rock.

393
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,340
Must have happened
when I was dragging him out.

394
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,850
- I don't know.
- [Nate] Let's get out of here.

395
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,601
All right, we're almost
at the point of no return, Ben.

396
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,731
If we don't go now,
we'll end up just as dead.

397
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,108
[Static]

398
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,362
I don't like this.
Someone died up here...

399
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,242
Enough.

400
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,501
This is a secure line.

401
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,961
I'm just talking to you, right,
Tommy?

402
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,717
<i>[Thomas] That's affirmative, Nate.</i>

403
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,721
The Russians have been to the moon.

404
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,598
<i>[Thomas] Say again?</i>

405
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,510
The Russians have landed
on the south pole.

406
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,475
We found their LK Proton Lander,

407
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,357
but it didn't end well
for the cosmonaut.

408
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,190
<i>- You find a crash site?
- They didn't crash.</i>

409
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,114
We found his body in a crater.

410
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,318
<i>You found a dead cosmonaut?</i>

411
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,328
You tellin' me you didn't know this?

412
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,375
We land less than two clicks
from a Soviet LK,

413
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,207
and you expect me to believe
you didn't know they were here?

414
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,463
<i>You know they scrubbed their
manned flight program in'69,</i>

415
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,502
<i>That's the official word.</i>

416
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,510
Did you know they were here?

417
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,346
<i>- Tommy?
- This is a DOD mission, Nate.</i>

418
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,517
<i>I'm just briefed in on what I need
to know. That's all I can tell you.</i>

419
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:32,359
You get that little prick
from DOD to give me a call.

420
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:36,697
<i>Get some rest. I'll get the DOD
over here and we'll talk to you soon.</i>

421
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,864
- [Nate] Tommy's a straight shooter.
- No.

422
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,533
I knew something was wrong
from the beginning.

423
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,452
[Nate] All right, what are you thinking?

424
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,168
DOD takin' over,
lyin' to our families.

425
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,877
Then they're rushing us
up here for what?

426
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,293
What, to set up
some listening devices?

427
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,929
[Nate] Yeah. Makes no sense.

428
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,841
Come on, think about Watergate, Nate.
I mean, that was our president,

429
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:05,479
for Christ sakes, and you don't think
that DOD would just lie to us?

430
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,810
[Nate] So, what are we
doing up here then?

431
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,393
What are we really doing?

432
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,526
[John] Well,
it's kind of spooky, really.

433
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,955
Strange beauty on the backside.

434
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,164
I don't know if it's my
mind playin' tricks on me,

435
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,331
but every so often you look
out these little windows and...

436
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,841
...get this sense that something
might be lookin' back...

437
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,593
...back at you.

- What?
- Look at this!

444
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,884
The flag's gone.

445
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,594
[Ben] No, this isn't right.

446
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,100
[Nate] Houston, this is 18, over.

447
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,016
Houston, Liberty.

448
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,399
Did you see anything unusual
on the Westinghouse last night?

449
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,979

00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,719
<i>a minimum of ten, 12 hours?</i>

456
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,215
<i>- [Nate] What are you thinkin', John?
- [John] There's no way.</i>

457
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,429
<i>He couldn't carry that kind of oxygen.</i>

458
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,435
So how could he survive?

459
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,105
<i>[John] Maybe there is no he.</i>

460
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,436
[Nate] You saying the Soviets
flew a one-man mission?

461
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,567
<i>[John] Wouldn't be the first time.</i>

462
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,321
If there's one cosmonaut,
who took the flag?

463
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,108
Who killed the other cosmonaut
that we found?

464
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,494
[Nate] We need to get
DOD on the line. Now.

465
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:53,829
<i>[Man] We suspected the Soviets might
be there, but we had no confirmation.</i>

might be disguising missions</i>

467
00:33:56,326 --> 00:34:00,627
<i>- as routine satellite launches.

468
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,760
<i>National security. We play our cards
pretty close to the vest, Commander.</i>

469
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,295
<i>I'm sure you can understand.</i>

470
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,636
Maybe a little too close.

471
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,558
<i>We were concerned they might get
their eye in the sky up there first.</i>

472
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,938
<i>It would be
a national security disaster.</i>

473
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,316
So where the hell's
this other cosmonaut?

474
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,403
What, they're just
gonna leave him here?

475

there was only one cosmonaut.</i>

you boys home again.</i>

So that's it?

479

Let's focus on getting home.
We'll ask questions later.

494
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,089
- I've got a major power glitch.
- We're losing the descent oxygen.

495
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,132
- We got a leak somewhere!
- I'm gonna try and isolate the tanks

496
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,643
and see if I can stop it.
Houston, do you copy?

497
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,020
- Repeat, Houston, do you copy?
- Engine arm off!

There's no way to tell

It's shredded.
