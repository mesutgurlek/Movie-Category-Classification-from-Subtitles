1
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:45,464
That is the ugliest thing
l've ever seen in my whole life !

2
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,392
It certainly is. Who sent it ?

3
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,529
That's strange. It doesn't say.
Where could it have come from ?

4
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,009
I don't like it. It's staring at me.

5
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,845
It's probably
one of Uncle Arthur's little jokes.

6
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,939
I don't think it's funny at all.

7
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,727
Darling, l'm just going
to have a shower.

8
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,198
Be there in a minute.

9
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,231
Claudia, I told you
not to leave your toys lying about.

10
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,575
Good God ! You are hideous.

11
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,407
- Claudia.
- What ?

12
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,217
I have a bone to pick you with you,
young lady.

13
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,584
We had an agreement, didn't we ?

14
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,591
But, Daddy, I didn't leave it there.

15
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,128
In a civilized society,
our word is our bond.

16
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,288
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,865
Just because it's your birthday...

18
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,526
that doesn't mean
that you can relinquish all...

19
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,201
Richard, what was that ?

20
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,159
You killed my mommy and daddy.

21
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,769
And now you're pissing your pants

22
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,361
you're pissing your pants

23
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,270
you're pissing your pants

24
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,534
Wake up ! You're pissing your pants !

25
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,981
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

26
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,182
<i>what you've all been waiting for...</i>

27
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,583
Shitface !

28
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,786
And the greatest ventriloquist
in all of England :

29
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,326
the psychotic Psychs !

30
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,472
This grotesque abomination...

31
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,212
He ain't even anatomically correct.

32
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,486
Don't laugh.
It's a serious condition.

33
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,259
Six years ago, I found it
in a cemetery back in the States.

34
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,298
Little fucker
tried to rip me throat out.

35
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,057
I was trying to give you a hug.

36
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,072
<i>I don't know much about myself.</i>

37
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,808
<i>I know l'm an orphan.</i>

38
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,637
<i>I know l'm a freak.</i>

39
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,683
<i>And, of course,
I know that l'm Japanese.</i>

40
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,879
<i>But why do I have
such terrible nightmares ?</i>

41
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,653
<i>Filled with hate and blood and guts.</i>

42
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,784
<i>l'm not like that at all.</i>

43
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,756
<i>I wouldn't even hurt a fly.</i>

44
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,263
<i>There he goes, back to his family.</i>

45
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,334
<i>I envy him.</i>

46
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,272
<i>Sometimes I wonder
about my own parents.</i>

47
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,874
<i>Were they Zen masters ?</i>

48
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,042
<i>Did they serve the emperor ?</i>

49
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,946
<i>Sometimes I wonder what
my mom and dad were really like.</i>

50
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,949
So, you don't believe
in Santa Claus ?

51
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,226
Trust me, honey, tonight
l'm going to make you believe.

52
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,164
You wait and see what Santa
is bringing you, you naughty girl.

53
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,328
No, I can hear you fine.
You're not breaking up.

54
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,503
Sheila, I just said
you're not breaking up.

55
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,204
You're breaking up with me ?

56
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,539
Wait, you're breaking up with me
on Christmas Eve ?

57
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,012
Sheila, you have got to be
fucking kidding me !

58
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,858
Well, that's just great.

59
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,797
God !

60
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,757
I knew it !

61
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,030
You're not real.

62
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,133
You were never real.

63
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,499
You know what
that kind of disappointment...

64
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,303
can do to somebody ?

65
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:23,382
Do you have any idea
how that can fuck with your mind ?

66
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,145
fuck with your mind !

67
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,014
fuck with your mind !

68
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,388

fuck with your mind !

71
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,321
Chucky is broke again.
This is bloody ridiculous.

72
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,253
Cut !

73
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,722
Kill the snow.

74
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,562
Get off me.

75
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,433
- Tony, what was that ?
- l'm sorry, it's...

76
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,007
This is unprofessional,
and I can't work like this !

77
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,871
No, Jason, l'm sorry. Please wait.

78
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,774
We're here in Hollywood,
where production is underway...

79
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,848
<i>on the new horror flick,
Chucky Goes Psycho.</i>

80
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,975
The film tells the urban legend
of Chucky and Tiffany...

81
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,953
two dolls supposedly possessed
by serial killers.

82
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,286
The dolls were found at the scene
of a string of real-life murders...

83
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,451
which remain unsolved to this day.

84
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,157
You guys, I think Tiffany's left arm
is loose again.

85
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,064
Yeah, l'm looking for Jennifer.

86
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,436
Does anyone have a 20 on Jennifer ?

87
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,532
<i>Check the catering truck.</i>

88
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,408
Jennifer. I got you a Skinny Quick.

89
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,814
Miss Tilly,
we're ready for you on set.

90
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,489
- Jennifer, I am so proud of you.
- For what ?

91
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,986
For sticking to your diet.

92
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,228
Thank you.

93
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,505
What's going on in the world today ?

94
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,276
Julia Roberts is getting $25 million
for her next film.

95
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,574
Julia Roberts. l'm so tired
of hearing about Julia Roberts.

96
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,046
You know, I should have played
Erin Brockovich.

97
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,879
I could have
done it without a Wonderbra.

98
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,215
Julia stole that part
right out from under me.

99
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,548
And you know how she did it ?

100
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,123
She slept with the director.
That's what I think.

101
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,055
Jennifer, you know that's not true.

102
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,186
How come I don't ever get
any of the good roles anymore ?

103
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,992
How come nobody takes me seriously ?

104
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,166
- Nice tits.
- Thank you.

105
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,833
Look at me. l'm an Oscar nominee,
for Christ's sake.

106
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,463
Now l'm fucking a puppet.

107
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:32,271
l've got no fan mail, no paparazzi,
no stalkers.

108
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,113
Well, there must be something
l'm right for ?

109
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,306
Let's see.

110
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,278
Hip-hop superstar
turned director, Redman...

111
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,479
is still looking
for the right actress...

112
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,525
to take the female lead
in his upcoming Bible epic.

113
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,186
That sounds good. What's the role ?

114
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,157
The Virgin Mary.

115
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,632
- What's so funny ?
- Nothing.

116
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,167
It's perfect.

117
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,761
It's just what I need
to reinvent myself.

118
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:04,809
The Virgin Mary. I always loved
the way she wore robes...

119
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,004
and her hair off her face,
kind of like this.

120
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,411
Joan, get Morty on the phone...

121
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,644
and tell him I need to take
a meeting with this Redman.

122
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,379
- Right away.
- Okay.

123
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,022
<i>That's a wrap for Access Hollywood.

Scary ?

Let's rehearse, shall we, all right ?

133
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,540
Hello.

134
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,717
Look, you got to learn
to tap into your killer instincts...

135

00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,299
I could do it faster,
I could do it slower.

160
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,803
- I could do it as a rap.
- No.

161
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,736
You already showed me
a side of the character...

162
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,538
- that l've never seen before.
- Thank you.

163
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,139
But I think l'm going to have to go
with my first choice.

164
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,651
Thanks for coming by anyway.
I mean, really, l'm a huge fan.

165
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,278
I really want to work with you
one day. We should call...

166
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,290
Excuse me, I hope
you don't mind my asking...

167
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,520
- but who is your first choice ?
- Julia Roberts.

168
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,930
But thanks for coming by, anyway.

169
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,521
Listen, Red.

170
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,764
l've been giving
a lot of thought to this project...

171
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,202
and I have a lot
of interesting ideas...

172
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,898
about the character.

173
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,599
I was thinking...

174
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,509
maybe you would like to discuss it
in a more intimate setting.

175
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,876
Just the two of us.

176
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,952
I didn't know you were
that passionate about the role.

177
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,252
Oh, yes, l'm very passionate.

178
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,996
So, shall we say my place ?

179
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,457
8h00 ?

180
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,789
Pardon me, sir.

181
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,298
Sorry.

182
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,372
Sorry, sir.

183
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,501
Don't mind me.

184
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,811
Excuse me.

185
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,745
Oh, dear.

186
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,097
Mom ?

187
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:10,866
Dad ?

188
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,939
l've dreamed of this moment
all my life.

189
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,041
I know this must come
as quite a shock.

190
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,750
It's going to be an adjustment
for all of us.

191
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,747
Look, I still have the necklace
you left me.

192
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,592
l've always wanted to know,
what do these words mean ?

193
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,729
ls it our family motto ?

194
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,596
Please say something.

195
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,232
It's because of the way I look,
isn't it ?

196
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,642
For pity's sake, please wake up.

197
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,641
"Wake up" ?

198
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,878
ade due damballla...

199
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,148
"Awake."

200
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,417
- Tiff ?
- Chucky ?

201
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,524
- Who the hell are you ?
- Shitface.

202
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,701
Now, what kind of a name is that ?

203
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,238
Where are your mother and father ?

204
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,071
Judging from that face,
my guess is they're hiding.

205
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,042
Shut up, you asshole.

206
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,479
Well, come on. It looks like
the kid fell off the ugly tree...

207
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,107
and hit every branch
on the way down.

208
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,752
I mean, you got to feel bad
for the parents.

209
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,290
I wonder what they must look like.

210
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,030
Oh, my God.

211
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,145
What ? No.
You didn't... We didn't...

212
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:39,121
Sweetface, come to Mommy.

213
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,327
What's going on ?

214
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,767
- Where are we ?
- In Hollywood.

215
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,069
I saw you on the telly.

216
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,143
Chucky, wake up.

217
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,604
Look at us. We've had makeovers.

218
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,941
We're movie stars.

219
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,245
- Shit. Barbie mode.
- No, they're puppets.

220
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,251
They don't walk and talk
by themselves.

221
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,258
Listen, if you want them to work...

222
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,886
l'm going to have
to take them apart.

223
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,342
- ls Mommy ill ?
- The courts thought so.

224
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,314
Heads up !

225
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,307
They're stark raving mad !

226
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,257
Hey, you're pissing your pants.

227
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,430
Chucky, she just had an accident.

228
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,933
You mean, "he" had an accident.

229
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,535
Don't look at me.

230
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,617
See, what did I tell you ?

231
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:27,047
A beautiful little girl.

232
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,457
What ? Are you blind ? That's my boy.

233
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,256
He just hasn't had
his growth spurt, yet.

234
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,725
Don't worry about it, Son.

235
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,134
You're a late bloomer, that's all.

236
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:43,105
And it's high time
that you had a real name.

237
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,539
Let's see.

238
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,542
I think l'm going to call you...

239
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:49,739
Glen.

240
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,708
What kind of a name is that
for a girl ?

241
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:58,846
Don't listen to him, honey.
From now on, your name is...

242
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,985
Glenda.

243
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,995
Run, Glenda.

244
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,303
Jeez, what a mess.

245
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,711
There you are, Mr. Goodbar.

246
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,465
Jennifer Tilly.

247
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,756
Hello.

248
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,560
Oh, my God. You look so real.

249
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,664
You look so real.

250
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,108
You are cuter
than my last boyfriend.

251
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,541
I think we make a lovely couple.

252
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,719
Jennifer. Miss Tilly,
were you having an affair with him ?

253
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,492
I don't know
what you're talking about.

254
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,626
<i>Pete Peters, Celebrities Revealed.
Jennifer, what did you see ?</i>

255
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,260
You want me to draw you a picture ?

256
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,396
Would you ?
Somebody give her a piece of paper.

257
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,600
Look, l'm not gonna
draw you a picture, okay ?

258
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,473
Don't feel bad.
You're an actress not an artist.

259
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,739
What were you doing
when you saw the body ?

260
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,314
No comment.

261
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,350
Jennifer, I love you.

262
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,378
Jennifer I love, you.

263
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,051
ls it true that you and Redman
are in talks...

264
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,651
about you starring in his new movie ?

265
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,497
Yes. As a matter of fact,
that is true. I have...

266
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,999
- Can I have your autograph ?
- Okay, sure.

267
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,501
Hold on, you forgot the head.

268
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,810
Excuse me.

269
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,579
Jennifer, how old are you really ?

270
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:40,981
Paparazzi scumbag !

271
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,418
What year were you born ?
Give us the exact date.

272
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,183
- I want to sit up front with you.
- Sure.

273
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,089
Hey, you okay ?

274
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,595
Yeah, I am now.

275
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,979
So, are you a pair
of ninja assassins ?

276
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,483
What ?

277
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,192
Are you hit men for the yakuza ?

278
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,627
We're not from Japan.
We're from Jersey.

279
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:31,229
Just think, Jennifer Tilly
is playing me in a movie.

280
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,668
It's absolutely perfect casting.

281
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,239
But that voice !

282
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,242
I know,
she sounds just like an angel.

283
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,276
Now, l've got it all figured out.

284
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,644
l'm going to transfer myself
into Jennifer...

285
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,411
and you're going to
transfer yourself into Redman.

286
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,850
l'm down with that.

287
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,547
We'Il ditch these plastic bodies
once and for all...

288
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,124
and we'Il be
Hollywood's hottest couple.

289
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,419
What about me ?

290
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,963
Don't worry, Glenda.
l've got that figured out, too.

291
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:02,032
You're going to be a real live girl.

292
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,925
- Boy.
- How ?

293
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:08,136
Well, l'm not getting pregnant
again, l'Il tell you that much.

294
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,968
My mother always told me :

295
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,668
"Once is a blessing.
Twice is a curse."

296
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,245
Well, that would explain
your sister.

297
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,577
The only sensible option
is a surrogate mother.

298
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,384
HEY !

299
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,230
Jennifer, I have something important to say...

300
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,959
Hold on a second, Sweetheart.

301
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,595

the victim's body.</i>

307

308

Listen, Joan, I need you
to do something for me.

313
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:10,197
I need you to get me a bottle of
champagne and bring it by my house.

314

Jennifer, what are you up to ?

318
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,674
Thank you, Joan.

319
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,722
Come on, Stan, it's just business.

320
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,524
He'Il be out of there by midnight.

321
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,700
Oh, my God, she's a complete slut.

322
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,252
Nighty-night, Glenda. Sleep tight.

323
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,387
Leave it on.

324
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,791
Sweetie, there's nothing
to be scared of.

325
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,494
Your daddy and I will be right here.

326
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,066
Why do you kill people ?

327
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,306
- Excuse me ?
- Why do you kill ?

328
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,204
It's a hobby, really.
It helps us relax.

329
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,216
Am I going to be a killer ?

330
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,981
Of course. It's been
a family tradition for generations.

331
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:41,088
But violence is bad, isn't it ?
They said so on TV.

332
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,725
Not "violence."

333
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:46,263
"Violins." Violins are bad.

334
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,765
That screeching music's
gonna ruin the goddamn country.

335
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:53,499
Chucky, Glenda's right.
It's time we owned up to it.

336
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,329
We have a problem with killing.

337
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:59,937
I don't have "a problem"
with killing.

338
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,871
I like a little killing
now and then.

339
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,278
What's wrong with that ?

340
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,874
Killing is an addiction,
like any other drug.

341
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,449
But we're parents now.
We have to set a good example.

342
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,189
Let's quit, Chucky, right now.
Cold turkey.

343
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,696
You have got to be kidding.

344
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,827
Promise me, Chucky, no more killing.

345
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,162
No.

346
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,238
No more killing.
We can't do it anymore.

347
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,830
- A thousand times no.
- We have the future to think of.

348
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,807
- We have a child !
- Fine !

349
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,575
All right, already. I promise.

350
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,714
Thank you, doll baby.
You're a sweetheart.

351
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,809
Now we really will be
the perfect family.

352
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,422
Did you hear that ?

353
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:57,130
Maybe you should forget the director
and fuck the exterminator instead.

354
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,895
So, how do I look ?

355
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,864
- Never mind.
- Jennifer, this is beneath you.

356
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,741
Think about what you're doing.
What are people gonna say ?

357
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,935
Who cares what people say ?

358
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,649
- But don't you see how evil this is ?
- I don't wanna hear it.

359
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,547
You're prostituting yourself
so you can play the Virgin Mary.

360
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,451
Joan, I don't wanna hear it.

361
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,615
This is so evil.

362
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,786
- You're going to hell.
- No.

363
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,590
<i>Hell would be ending up
on Celebrity Fear Factor...</i>

364
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,460
in a worm-eating contest
with Anna Nicole Smith.

365
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,659
Which you'd win.

366
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,104
He's here.

367
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,633
Let yourself out the back.

368
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:44,441
And while you're at it, why don't
you leave your key on the counter ?

369
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,016
What are you saying ?

370
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,585
Well, you think l'm so disgusting.

371
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,779
You think l'm going to hell.

372
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,148
l'm only trying
to survive here, Joan.

373
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,385
God knows I wouldn't want
to drag you down with me.

374
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,462
l'm saying you're fired.

375
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:25,482
Now, in artificial insemination,
timing is everything.

376
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,390
So you'Il have to hurry.
That shouldn't be a problem for you.

377
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,826
Yeah, just don't let that player
get into her pants.

378
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,864
I don't want him
touching my woman...

379
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,491
- till l'm him and you're her.
- Right.

380
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,772
Aren't you going to give me
a hand here ?

381
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,856
Too tall.

382
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,224
Lezbos.

383
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,361
Done her.

384
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,804
Here we go.

385
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,208
Come to papa.

386
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:03,847
Cheers.

387
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,886
You know, I wasn't bullshitting
when I told you I was a fan.

388
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,128
That's so sweet, Redman.

389
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,722
Which of my films is your favorite ?

390
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,299
That movie when you and that chick
was making out.

391
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,301
<i>Bound. Everybody likes that one.</i>

392
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,200
You still in touch with homegirl ?

393
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,272
- Gina ?
- Yeah.

394
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,137
Yeah, sure, we're friends.
Close friends.

395
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,144
Very close friends.

396
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:32,772
Maybe, the three of us
could hang out together some time.

397
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,746
You know,
I would really like that a lot.

398
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,846
Okay. l'Il see
if I can make it happen.

399
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,925
- Bottoms up, baby.
- Skol.

400
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,990
I was wondering...

401
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,463
what's it gonna take
to make you see me as a virgin.

402
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,794
Well, you tell me.

403
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,497
A masturbating midget ?

404
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,241
Get it, mini-meat.

405
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,423
Sweet Jesus,
God bless the little people.

406
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,529
- I don't know if I can do this.
- Why not ?

407
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:07,435
- What will people say ?
- Man, fuck what people say.

408
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,378
Know what l'm saying ? This
was meant to be, baby, for real.

409
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,644
Know how I know ?
Because the man upstairs told me so.

410
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,480
- Really ?
- Hell, yeah.

411
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:20,183
Look, Mel Gibson ain't the only one
God's been talking to in Hollywood.

412
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,783
He personally told me
that you was my Virgin.

413
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,818
Well, I guess...

414
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,202
What the hell ?

415
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,203
Pig.

416
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,735
And you...

417
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,475
You should be ashamed of yourself.

418
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,676
Where's your self-respect ?

419
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:51,788
You know what my mother used to say
about dirty girls ?

420
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,891
She said,
"You can always smell it...

421
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,660
"on girls who sell it."

422
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,926
By the way, Miss Tilly,
can I have your autograph ?

423
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,465
l'm a big fan.

424
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,534
What am I supposed to do with this ?

425
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,651
Now, Miss Tilly,
I know you're frightened.

426
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,663
You're probably even wondering
if you've gone completely insane.

427
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,859
But I promise you,
tomorrow you're going to wake up...

428
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,664
and this will all seem
just like a bad dream.

429
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,207
In the meantime,
we can do this the easy way...

430
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,873
or the hard way.

431
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,310
It's really up to you.

432
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,388
No wonder her career's in trouble.

433
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:08,426
Check it out, Tiff.
Look at the size of his feet.

434
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,662
You know what they say.

435
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,461
Fuck, she's fat.

436
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,732
I can't believe it.
She's not even pregnant yet.

437
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,715
Paparazzi scumbag.

438
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,792
Looks like you've got
everything under control.

439
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,920
l'Il just leave you to it.

440
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,102
Motherhood is so beautiful.

441
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,268
No.

442
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,421
Sorry, just messing with you.

443
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,657
What time is it ?

444
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,366
Time to get dressed.

445
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:26,535
We are going to have our own
boys' night out, just you and me.

446
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,134
How does that sound ?

447
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,907
- Where are we going ?
- Hunting.

448
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,818
I can't see anything.
Maybe we should slow down ?

449
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,927
No ! You're doing great.

450
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,528
Son of a bitch !

451
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,237
Up yours, asshole !

452
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,078
- What ?
- Not you, Son. Come on, floor it !

453
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,828
Oops ! I did it again.

454
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,445
Jesus Christ !

455
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,312
No !

456
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,443
Attaboy !

457
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,751
- No, I didn't.
- And I thought you weren't ready.

458
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:28,052
Kid, you're a fucking natural !

459
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,988
But he hit the shelf.

460
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:34,053
And don't worry about your mother.
It will be our little secret.

461
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,200
Say "cheese."

462
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,718
Good morning.

463
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,131
Hi.

464
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,361
We must have really got wired
last night.

465
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,526
Yeah.

466
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,501
Redman, did we...

467
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:20,070
- You don't remember ?
- No. It's all a blur.

468
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,636
What about you ?

469
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,474
I kind of remember
you screaming a lot.

470
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,282
Yeah, I seem to remember that, too.

471
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,819
I tend to have that effect on women.

472
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,317
- Really ?
- Yeah.

473
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,689
Wait, I do remember...

474
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,822
I had the strangest dream.

475
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:45,326
I dreamt my guardian angel
came to me.

476
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:49,171
She had the sweetest voice
I have ever heard.

477
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,101
She told me to respect myself.

478
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,772
And then she asked for my autograph.

479
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,515
Let's see."Step Number One :
Admit I have an addiction."

480
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,915
Okay, check.

481
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,453
"Step Number Two :

482
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,251
"Give myself over
to a higher power."

483
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,086
Whatever.

484
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,427
Here we go."Step Number Nine :

487
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,578
<i>- Hello ?
- Good morning.</i>

488
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,985

490
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,092
Mrs. Bailey, my name is Tiffany Ray.

491
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,921
You don't know me...

492
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,330
but a few years ago,
I killed your husband.

493
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,598
And I am so very, very sorry.

494
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,237
<i>What is this,
some kind of sick joke ?</i>

495
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,342
No, l'm completely serious.

496
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,036
But I want you to know
l'm in recovery now...

497
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,443
and I have put all of that
behind me.

498
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,948
<i>I don't know who you are...</i>

499
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,612
Thank you, Mrs. Bailey.
Have a nice day.

500
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,224
I feel better already.

501
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,677
Morning, Stan.

502
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,748
Wasn't there something important
you wanted to tell me ?

503
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,013
Well

504
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,414
The thing is, Jennifer...

505
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,290
l'm sorry.
I don't know what's gotten into me.

506
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,094
So you were saying...

507
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,436
- Forget it.
- Okay.

508
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,569
Now, let's see.

509
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,042
What should we do today ?

510
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,640
l'm pregnant.

511
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,276
Redman, I said l'm pregnant.

512
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,577
Congratulations.
Who is the baby's daddy ?

513
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,314
Don't even look at me.

514
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:55,384
I haven't slept with anyone else
to advance my career lately.

515
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,518
- Who are you kidding ?
- It's true, Redman. Look...

516
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,732
I know I come off all slutty, but
that's for my image. It's just...

517
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,935
Do you think anyone would cast me
in these sexpot roles...

518
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,835
if they knew I hadn't been laid
in a year ?

519
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,968
I haven't even slept
with my driver yet...

520
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,067
and I think he really likes me.

521
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:19,410
That's all very touching and shit.
But l'm telling you, it can't be me.

522
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,710
Why not ?

523
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:24,844
I had a vasectomy as soon as I got
to Hollywood. I ain't no idiot.

524
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,722
That is impossible

525
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,622
Hey Jennifer !

526
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,754
I hate to break it to you. But I
can't hire you if you're pregnant.

527
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,231
That is ridiculous.
The character is pregnant.

528
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:38,733
Yeah, I know...

529
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:41,599
but I have a very specific vision
of Mary.

530
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:45,240
And what can I say ?
She gots to be hot.

531
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:52,875

l'm going to have a slip.

<i>In fact, l'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.</i>

541
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,057
<i>Just last week, I had a slip.</i>

542
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,597
<i>- Really ?
- Yes.</i>

543
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,298
<i>And believe you me,
it was not pretty.</i>

544
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,393
It never is, is it ?

545
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:51,099
<i>In fact, it took me three hours
just to clean up the mess.</i>

546
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,074
God, don't remind me.

547
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,770
<i>But l'm not beating myself up
over it.</i>

548
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,008
<i>- You know why, Tiffany ?
- Why ?</i>

549
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:03,013
<i>Because Rome wasn't built in a day.</i>

550
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:06,753
You're right.

551
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,625
You are absolutely right.

552
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,896
Hello ? Speaking.

553
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,406
When was this ?

554
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,676
All right, I know.
I understand who you are.

555
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:30,405
I just don't know
how you got my phone number.

556
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,312
Because it is
a private, unlisted phone number.

557
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,946
Pete Peters ?
Yeah, I saw him yesterday.

558
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,081
No, I don't have
any relationship with him.

559
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,286
He is a firking paparazzi that is
trying to get pictures of me...

560
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,659
in compromising positions.

561
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:50,296
Yeah, l'm with Redman.

562
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,731
Redman, he's a director.

563
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,804
Oh, yeah. Well, he's a rapper, too.

564
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,370
He is a rapper-director, okay ?
He's a hyphenate.

565
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:04,474
Bye-bye.

566
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,850
Jennifer...

567
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,615
Do you mind ? l'm on the phone.

568
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:25,968
There's been another murder.
What ? No, I told you where I was.

569
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,697
I was right here all night
with Redman.

570
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,002
What ? I don't...

571
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,267
You're not telling me l'm a suspect.

572
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:40,442
All right, l'Il be fine.
l'm on my way.

573
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,842
l'm leaving.
You can let yourself out.

574
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,855
By the way, Redman, drop dead.

575
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,265
Oh, Glenda.

576
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,928
Glenda, honey. Everything is okay.

577
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:04,971
It was just a little slip.
There's no need to tell your daddy.

578
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,609
It will be our little secret, okay ?

Yes, he is.

stop doing that ?

Doing what ?

608
00:56:00,087 --> 00:56:02,317
Imitating me.
I do not sound like that.

We decided,
for the sake of our child...

628
00:57:26,374 --> 00:57:29,343
we weren't going
to do this shit anymore !

629
00:57:29,443 --> 00:57:31,274
No, you decided.

630
00:57:31,412 --> 00:57:34,779
Just like you decided
our son was a girl.

631
00:57:34,882 --> 00:57:37,680
- He is a girl !
- He is a boy, God damn it !

632
00:57:37,785 --> 00:57:41,949
And he is the most promising killer
I have ever seen.

633
00:57:42,056 --> 00:57:46,220
You should have been there, Tiff.
You would have been so proud of him.

634
00:57:46,394 --> 00:57:49,557
- I want a girl !
- I want a boy !

635
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:52,030
You are tearing me apart !

636
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,825
What about what I want ?

637
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,035
- What ?
- What ?

638
00:57:57,204 --> 00:57:59,968
Doesn't what I want
mean anything at all ?

639
00:58:01,742 --> 00:58:04,609
Okay, interesting. Tell us.

640
00:58:05,012 --> 00:58:07,207
What do you want, Sweetface ?

641
00:58:07,848 --> 00:58:11,841
I think I want to be a boy.

642
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:15,153
Yes ! In your face, lady !

643
00:58:15,556 --> 00:58:18,582
But being a girl would be nice, too.

644
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:21,821
Well, which is it ?

645
00:58:22,196 --> 00:58:25,029
l'm not sure.
Sometimes I feel like a boy.

646
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:27,594
Sometimes I feel like a girl.

647
00:58:29,203 --> 00:58:30,534
Can't I be both ?

648
00:58:30,638 --> 00:58:34,597
- Well, some people...
- No way.

649
00:58:34,775 --> 00:58:37,209
But one thing I do know for sure.

650
00:58:37,345 --> 00:58:39,506
I don't want to be a killer.

651
00:58:40,381 --> 00:58:43,782
Glenda. Glen. Whatever.

652
00:58:43,985 --> 00:58:45,782
l'm so proud of you.

653
00:58:46,153 --> 00:58:47,916
No matter what happens...

654
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:51,480
we'Il deal with it together,
as a family.

655
00:58:51,826 --> 00:58:53,259
<i>Okay, Okasan.</i>

656
00:58:54,895 --> 00:58:56,055
Wait a minute.

657
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:59,132
l'm not going to let you
poison our son's mind...

658
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:01,929
with your touchy-feely,
1 2-step bullshit.

659
00:59:02,036 --> 00:59:05,062
If you two don't want
to kill anymore, that's your loss.

660
00:59:05,172 --> 00:59:08,141
But don't look down your noses
at me.

661
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:11,801
l'm not ashamed to be a killer.
l'm proud of it.

662
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,139
It is not an addiction.
It is a choice.

663
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:19,308
And it is not something that you
should have to hide in a closet !

664
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:29,088
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, God.

665
00:59:31,399 --> 00:59:33,890
Well, well, well.

666
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:36,868
Looks like Miss High and Mighty...

667
00:59:36,971 --> 00:59:38,962
ain't so perfect after all.

668
00:59:39,073 --> 00:59:40,870
It was just a little slip.

669
00:59:40,975 --> 00:59:43,603
Rome wasn't built in a day,
you know.

670
00:59:44,278 --> 00:59:46,803
Besides, the fucker
really had it coming.

671
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:55,881
- Well, what about my body ?
- l'Il take care of it.

672
01:00:02,696 --> 01:00:05,722
Jennifer, I love you.

673
01:00:06,534 --> 01:00:07,865
I love you.

674
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,437
This is Stan.

675
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:14,534
Hello, it's Jennifer.

676
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:19,277
<i>Stan, baby, I need your body.</i>

677
01:00:20,915 --> 01:00:22,644
l'Il be right there.

678
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:33,187
Jennifer, if anything happens to me,
I want you to know...

679
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:40,125
They really do make a cute couple,
don't you think ?

680
01:00:40,234 --> 01:00:42,930
- It's like my mother always said...
- Christ !

681
01:00:43,037 --> 01:00:44,902
Enough with your mother, already.

682
01:00:45,005 --> 01:00:48,771
I killed that bitch 20 years ago
and she still won't shut up.

683
01:00:53,614 --> 01:00:56,879
There, there. It won't be long now.

684
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:19,836
Who is it ?

685
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:23,169
It's that nosy bitch, Joan.

686
01:01:24,211 --> 01:01:26,076
l'Il take care of her.

687
01:01:26,213 --> 01:01:30,479
I wouldn't want you to violate
your delicate sensibilities.

688
01:01:56,544 --> 01:01:57,772
Jennifer ?

689
01:02:04,418 --> 01:02:05,544
Jennifer !

690
01:02:41,088 --> 01:02:41,918
Jennifer.

691
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:53,155
Oh my God

692
01:03:00,975 --> 01:03:01,942
Jennifer ?

693
01:03:03,911 --> 01:03:05,742
Look out behind you !

694
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,570
Joan !

695
01:03:09,516 --> 01:03:10,483
No !

696
01:03:23,464 --> 01:03:24,556
Dang !

697
01:03:27,468 --> 01:03:30,028
Look, l'm not going to
give you crap.

698
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,773
Nobody is perfect, Tiff.

699
01:03:34,575 --> 01:03:37,339
I got a few skeletons
in the closet myself.

700
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:44,406
See ?

701
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,518
Come on, Tiff.

702
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:49,418
How long did it take
to build Rome, anyway ?

703
01:03:56,664 --> 01:03:57,756
Glen ?

704
01:03:57,965 --> 01:04:00,627
Guess again, Daddy.

705
01:04:01,902 --> 01:04:03,233
Glenda ?

706
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:06,698
That's my name.
Don't you wear it out.

707
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:09,038
Shit.

708
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:14,311
What did I miss ?

709
01:04:14,415 --> 01:04:18,408
Nothing much. I just fired Joan.

710
01:04:22,756 --> 01:04:27,022
Looks like you win after all, Tiff.
Congratulations.

711
01:04:27,161 --> 01:04:28,924
You both win.

712
01:04:29,129 --> 01:04:32,064
l'm a real lady-killer...

713
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:34,066
if you catch my drift.

714
01:04:34,168 --> 01:04:37,433
l'm a bona fide bonus baby.

715
01:04:40,174 --> 01:04:43,666
Jesus Christ, Chucky,
what did you do to him ?

716
01:04:43,844 --> 01:04:47,507
What did I do ?
At least I spent time with the kid.

717
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,113
Glen, wake up.

718
01:04:51,685 --> 01:04:55,348
Stop it, Mommy.
You'Il wrinkle my dress.

719
01:04:55,889 --> 01:04:59,086
And how do you like it ?
I made it myself.

720
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,892
Like mother, like daughter, right ?

721
01:05:02,896 --> 01:05:07,196
Like mother, like daughter.
Get it ?"Mother and daughter."

722
01:05:09,503 --> 01:05:11,471
I said, wake up ! Right now.

723
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:23,408
Mom ? Dad ?

724
01:05:37,731 --> 01:05:39,062
What am I ?

725
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,878
Push, Miss Tilly. Push.

726
01:05:52,279 --> 01:05:55,146
I am pushing,
you little star-fucker !

727
01:05:57,017 --> 01:05:59,485
Pay no attention
to little Miss Potty Mouth.

728
01:05:59,586 --> 01:06:01,144
She's hormonal.

729
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:07,888
My God. It's coming.

730
01:06:07,995 --> 01:06:10,122
I can see its little head.

731
01:06:18,205 --> 01:06:19,604
What is it ?

732
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:23,868
It's a boy.

733
01:06:23,977 --> 01:06:26,537
- A boy.
- Thank God.

734
01:06:27,181 --> 01:06:28,910
Give me my baby.

735
01:06:30,517 --> 01:06:32,212
I want my baby.

736
01:06:45,499 --> 01:06:49,196
Chucky, we're not done here yet.

737
01:06:49,303 --> 01:06:51,601
- What ?
- Jennifer isn't done.

738
01:06:51,705 --> 01:06:53,798
We've got another one here !

739
01:06:54,274 --> 01:06:56,401
Push, Jennifer ! Push !

740
01:06:57,511 --> 01:06:59,103
Push it out ! Push !

741
01:07:03,317 --> 01:07:04,875
What's this one ?

742
01:07:07,821 --> 01:07:11,052
- It's a girl.
- Groovy.

743
01:07:22,769 --> 01:07:24,327
Chucky, it's time.

744
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:28,837
ade due damballla.

745
01:07:28,942 --> 01:07:31,877
Give me the power, I beg of you.

746
01:07:31,979 --> 01:07:34,539
Chucky, first he has to choose.

747
01:07:34,948 --> 01:07:36,973
I beg your pardon.

748
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:39,448
Sorry. She has to choose.

749
01:07:39,553 --> 01:07:42,386
- We don't have time for this shit !
- Wait, Chucky.

750
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:44,916
We have a son and a daughter.

751
01:07:45,392 --> 01:07:47,656
Glen and Glenda.

752
01:07:47,761 --> 01:07:51,390
Don't you get it ?
Maybe they don't have to choose.

753
01:07:54,301 --> 01:07:55,859
Help !

754
01:07:55,969 --> 01:07:58,028
Hurry, Chucky ! Do the chant.

755
01:07:58,138 --> 01:07:59,935
- Do it now !
- Help us !

756
01:08:00,807 --> 01:08:03,674
What are you standing there for ?
Do the chant !

757
01:08:07,981 --> 01:08:10,279
What are you waiting for ? Do it !

758
01:08:10,918 --> 01:08:12,351
Do the chant !

759
01:08:14,054 --> 01:08:15,043
Do it !

760
01:08:15,155 --> 01:08:18,318
Everybody just shut up !

761
01:08:19,226 --> 01:08:21,319
I have had it ! That's it !

762
01:08:22,062 --> 01:08:24,690
There is a limit
to how much I can take.

763
01:08:24,932 --> 01:08:26,661
What are you talking about ?

764
01:08:26,767 --> 01:08:30,032
Look around you, Tiff. This is nuts.

765
01:08:30,137 --> 01:08:33,504
And I have a very high tolerance
for nuts.

766
01:08:33,707 --> 01:08:35,868
If this is what it takes
to be human...

767
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:39,945
then I would rather take my chances
as a supernaturally possessed doll.

768
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:41,639
It's less complicated.

769
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:45,184
- You can't be serious ?
- As a heart attack.

770
01:08:45,285 --> 01:08:46,343
Think about it.

771
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:49,286
What is so great
about being human, anyway ?

772
01:08:49,389 --> 01:08:51,789
You get sick. You get old.

773
01:08:52,025 --> 01:08:55,984
You can't get it up anymore.
l'm not looking forward to that.

774
01:08:56,563 --> 01:09:00,329
But I want to be Jennifer Tilly.

775
01:09:01,635 --> 01:09:03,466
I want to be a star.

776
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:06,231
And I don't want to be
your chauffeur.

777
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:09,241
As a doll, l'm fucking infamous.

778
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:13,237
l'm one of the most
notorious slashers in history.

779
01:09:13,413 --> 01:09:15,142
And I don't want to give that up.

780
01:09:15,282 --> 01:09:18,513
I am Chucky, the killer doll !

781
01:09:18,685 --> 01:09:20,118
And I dig it !

782
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,881
I have everything I want :

783
01:09:26,026 --> 01:09:27,755
a beautiful wife...

784
01:09:30,297 --> 01:09:32,128
a multi-talented kid.

785
01:09:32,432 --> 01:09:34,992
This is who I am, Tiff.

786
01:09:35,636 --> 01:09:37,001
This is me.

787
01:09:38,005 --> 01:09:42,032
Chucky, I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

788
01:09:42,275 --> 01:09:44,835
I don't know
who the fuck you are anymore.

789
01:09:45,112 --> 01:09:47,580
But it's not enough for me.

790
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:50,114
I want more.

791
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:54,087
- What are you saying ?
- It's over.

792
01:09:55,856 --> 01:09:58,552
You've got to
get out of here, Sweetface.

793
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:02,419
l'm leaving you, Chucky,
and l'm taking the kid.

794
01:10:02,963 --> 01:10:07,059
Nobody leaves me. Nobody !

795
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:10,031
No !

796
01:10:16,777 --> 01:10:21,043
Jennifer. I... love

797
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:23,042
I... love

798
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:25,176
Stan, tell me. Tell me.

799
01:10:25,752 --> 01:10:27,720
- I love...
- What ?

800
01:10:47,741 --> 01:10:48,867
Jesus.

801
01:10:54,848 --> 01:10:56,213
Oh, my God.

802
01:10:56,683 --> 01:11:00,016
My babies. Give me my babies.

803
01:11:09,629 --> 01:11:11,597
I just want to know where they are.

804
01:11:11,698 --> 01:11:13,598
They're fine.
They're in the maternity ward.

805
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,190
All right, was that so hard ?

806
01:11:15,302 --> 01:11:17,827
The important thing to think
about now is getting well...

807
01:11:17,938 --> 01:11:20,168
so you can get on
with your life and your career.

808
01:11:20,273 --> 01:11:22,503
I don't care about my career.
I want my babies.

809
01:11:22,609 --> 01:11:25,169
l'm working on it,
but you're not making it easy.

810
01:11:25,278 --> 01:11:27,746
I already talked to the cops.
They cleared me.

811
01:11:27,848 --> 01:11:29,281
They know you're not a killer.

812
01:11:29,382 --> 01:11:31,612
They didn't say
you were mentally competent.

813
01:11:31,718 --> 01:11:34,516
What do you expect,
after the story you told them ?

814
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:35,918
It's true.

815
01:11:36,323 --> 01:11:40,089
Yeah, well, I suggest from now on
you keep that to yourself.

816
01:11:43,063 --> 01:11:44,655
We'Il talk later.

817
01:11:48,502 --> 01:11:50,333
Try to get some sleep.

818
01:12:58,905 --> 01:13:03,001
Wish me luck, Sweetface.
Mommy is going to be a star.

819
01:13:19,726 --> 01:13:23,355
I can't think of a thing to say.
Fuck it !

820
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:27,999
ade due damballla.

821
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:30,865
Give me the power, I beg of you.

822
01:13:30,937 --> 01:13:34,134
Leveau mercier du bois chaloitte.

823
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:37,643
Sequoise entienne mais pois de morte.

824
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:40,305
Ade du damballa...

825
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:45,340
Switch ! Switch ! Switch ! Switch ! Switch...

826
01:13:49,623 --> 01:13:52,854
Nobody leaves me. Nobody.

827
01:14:19,252 --> 01:14:22,983
I want you to be a good girl...

828
01:14:23,924 --> 01:14:27,325
or boy. Whatever.

829
01:14:29,663 --> 01:14:33,394
Don't make the same mistakes
your mom and dad made.

830
01:14:36,236 --> 01:14:37,965
Especially your dad.

831
01:15:25,585 --> 01:15:26,779
Let's go.

832
01:15:42,736 --> 01:15:43,760
Glenda ?

833
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:47,465
No, Dad ! It's me ! Your boy !

834
01:15:47,607 --> 01:15:50,075
Your chip off the old block !

835
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:56,540
Are you proud of me now, Daddy ?
Are you ?

836
01:16:08,528 --> 01:16:12,430
Attaboy, kid. Attaboy.

837
01:16:33,019 --> 01:16:34,452
There, there.

838
01:16:38,491 --> 01:16:39,981
It's all right.

839
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:45,789
It's going to be all right.

840
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:20,298
Yesterday, she gave Dana Shelton
a bloody nose...

841
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,664
and took pictures of it
for Show and Tell.

842
01:17:22,769 --> 01:17:24,703
She called the cat the "C" word.

843
01:17:24,804 --> 01:17:27,637
And l'm pretty sure she's been
taking money from my purse.

844
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:28,866
That's ridiculous.

845
01:17:28,975 --> 01:17:31,637
Glen, he is an angel.
An absolute dream.

846
01:17:31,945 --> 01:17:33,378
But Glenda...

847
01:17:33,713 --> 01:17:37,410
she's a bad girl, Miss Tilly.
A very bad girl.

848
01:17:37,817 --> 01:17:39,808
l'm not listening to this.

849
01:17:41,821 --> 01:17:43,118
I hate that thing.

850
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:45,191
Some of the kids
really want to see her.

851
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,918
- Miss Tilly.
- What ?

852
01:17:47,026 --> 01:17:51,486
- l'm afraid of her.
- Fulvia, it's only a doll.

853
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,059
I was talking about Glenda.

854
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,836
Just exactly
what are you trying to say ?

855
01:18:03,877 --> 01:18:05,640
I can't work here anymore.

856
01:18:05,745 --> 01:18:07,906
- What ?
- l'm sorry, I just can't.

857
01:18:08,114 --> 01:18:10,514
If you only saw the way
she looks at me...

858
01:18:10,617 --> 01:18:12,847
with such hate.

859
01:18:15,722 --> 01:18:18,953
All right, Fulvia,
if that's what you want.

860
01:18:20,593 --> 01:18:22,083
We'Il miss you.

861
01:18:22,395 --> 01:18:25,831
Thank you, Miss Tilly. God bless.

862
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:05,167
<i>Mom got her wish.
She's a bright shining star.</i>

863
01:19:06,072 --> 01:19:08,199
<i>Now we're the perfect family.</i>

864
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:11,473
<i>l've learned a lot about myself.</i>

865
01:19:11,578 --> 01:19:14,979
<i>I know l'm not alone.
I know l'm not a freak.</i>

866
01:19:15,648 --> 01:19:18,208
<i>And even though
we had our differences...</i>

867
01:19:18,318 --> 01:19:20,878
<i>I know my dad really loved me.</i>

868
01:19:23,423 --> 01:19:25,789
Glen, sweetheart, come over here.

869
01:19:27,827 --> 01:19:30,591
Here, sweetheart, look.
Here's another one.

870
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:33,624
- Who is it from, Mommy ?
- I don't know.

871
01:19:34,734 --> 01:19:37,760
Let's see. It doesn't say.

872
01:19:38,338 --> 01:19:40,568
Strange. It doesn't say who it is.

873
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:43,665
Bye, sweetheart. Don't run so fast.
You're going to trip.

874
01:19:43,776 --> 01:19:48,577
So anyway, he determined
that he was going to go off...

875
01:23:03,409 --> 01:23:05,809
<i>I just love this movie. Don't you ?</i>

876
01:25:54,981 --> 01:25:58,610
<i>I can't think of a thing to say.
Fuck it !</i>

877
01:26:06,859 --> 01:26:08,053
<i>Oh, God !</i>
