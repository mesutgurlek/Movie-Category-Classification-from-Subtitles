1
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,320
Can I have some money?

2
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,120
I said, ‟Can I have some money?”

3
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,500
Kid, how many times do I have to tell you?
I don´t have money.

4
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,630
With a car like this?

5
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,380
Do you know how many days I worked
to buy this car?

6
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,120
- Whose cat is that?
- It´s mine.

7
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,200
2,191 days.

8
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,280
Dearest ladies with families...

9
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,990
you care for your households,

10
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,160
you care for your children,

11
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,630
your husbands.

12
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,250
And your husband brings home the money.

13
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,130
Congratulations.

14
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,700
But be prepared.

15
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,880
One day, everything changes.

16
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,290
Your husband leaves you,

17
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,530
finds himself a new wife.

18
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,780
A different woman, a younger woman.

19
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,450
Or perhaps,

20
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,420
your husband has a stroke and dies.

21
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,660
These things happen.

22
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,280
What´s with you? Open the door.

23
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,950
Don´t count the things you´ve lost.

24
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,370
Let´s count what´s still left.

25
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,240
Look, Hossein,

26
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,320
I help you, don´t I?

27
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,630
I give, you take.

28
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,960
Does that seem right to you?

29
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,740
I swear to God...

30
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,570
on my mother´s grave, I´ll pay you.

31
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,780
Are you a junkie?

32
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,040
Answer me.

33
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,700
I´m sick, I´m sick.

34
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,540
You´re a junkie.

35
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
Your promises mean nothing.

36
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,780
Who made him a junkie?

37
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,240
What´s your cat´s name?

38
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,280
Is it a boy or girl?

39
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,580
Mr. Cat! Mr. Cat!

40
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,000
He´s really fun.

41
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,570
He´s really fun.

42
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,420
Look, your father is a normal man.

43
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,120
Gambler, enjoys women.

44
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,580
Takes medicine for his pain.

45
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,490
You see?

46
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,070
Completely normal. All right?

47
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,370
However, the things your father likes,
he can´t afford.

48
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,660
Right?

49
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,870
No.

50
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,570
It´s my car, not his.

51
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,740
Do you even realize
how much your father owes me?

52
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,990
I gave you money last week.

53
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,880
Business is business.

54
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,250
Hello?

55
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,460
Come up here.

56
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,130
I need you.

57
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,830
I want to get really wasted.

58
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,910
We´ll tell Omid to drive.

59
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,330
I don´t get it.
Why do they keep having costume parties?

60
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,460
Seriously.

61
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,820
So what are you going to wear?

62
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,450
Excuse me, Miss Shaydah?

63
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,710
I´m sorry, Miss Shaydah?

64
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,420
Sorry to bother you,
but this is going to take some time to fix.

65
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,710
Go ahead.

66
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,880
Then do you mind
leaving me alone in here to work on this?

67
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,240
What for?

68
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,320
Your mother and father.

69
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,420
I´ll call you right back.

70
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,530
My mother and father?

71
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,450
What if they knew you were alone
with a boy in your bedroom?

72
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,130
- Are you serious?
- It´s inappropriate.

73
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,530
What a gentleman.

74
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,960
My knees are weak.

75
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,710
See my car?

76
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,320
Well, get in.

77
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,540
- How old are you now, Atti?
- Give me my cut.

78
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,210
Take it easy.

79
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,660
Come on, how old are you?

80
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,700
- Thirty.
- Thirty.

81
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,700
You´re getting old.

82
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,880
Don´t you want kids?

83
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,790
Women want kids, don´t they?

84
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,420
Get out.

85
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,210
- I want my cut.
- You´re light.

86
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,130
- Give me my cut.
- Get out.

87
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,290
- I´m not light.
- You think I´m joking?

88
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,320
Get out! Get out of here!

89
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,500
Next time you focus on your job.

90
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,950
Understand?

91
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,170
And quit your crying.

92
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,410
Hag!

93
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,410
Now what?

94
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,880
Come on.

95
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,240
Want a line?

96
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,790
Leave a message, hooker.

97
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,030
It´s Arash, I´m outside.
I´ve got something for you.

98
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,570
Look, I want my car.

99
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,120
I should die and leave you in peace.

100
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,960
Here, drink some water first.

101
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,160
You know what would hit the spot?

102
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,240
Driving in a convertible.

103
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,160
What fun we´d have.

104
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,290
For God´s sake,

105
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,950
let´s talk for a minute.

106
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,290
You don´t talk to me.

107
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,780
You don´t look at me.

108
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,660
How much have I given you?

109
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,630
Should I add it up?

110
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,500
What do you want, Hossein?

111
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,580
Let´s talk a little,
be close to each other.

112
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,120
When you find some money,
come find me.

113
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,670
All right?

114
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,950
Blind cat.

115
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,240
Are you a good boy?

116
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,660
Answer me.

117
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,920
Are you a good boy or not?

118
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,070
Yes.

119
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,920
Don´t lie.

120
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,450
Are you a good boy?

121
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,330
Yes.

122
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,710
I´ll ask you one more time.

123
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,670
Tell the truth.

124
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,910
Are you a good boy?

125
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:51,790
I can take your eyes
out of your skull

126
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,040
and give them to dogs to eat.

127
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,790
Till the end of your life,

128
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,700
I´ll be watching you.

129
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,620
Understand?

130
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,750
Yes.

131
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,200
Be a good boy.

132
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,530
Dad...

133
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,870
I brought you soup.

134
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,030
What do I want soup for?

135
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,870
Don´t you see me?
Do you see me here?

136
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,380
Where´s your loyalty?

137
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,710
I´m sick. Sick!

138
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,630
I need my medicine!

139
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,750
His father is lying here like this,
and he´s only thinking of himself.

140
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,670
Arash, look at you.

141
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,080
This is Shirin.

142
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,410
Hey.

143
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,960
Listen, we heard you have X.

144
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,540
Our friend told us to find Dracula.

145
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,780
It´s on me.

146
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,740
Really?

147
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
To your health.

148
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,380
Your costume is really fun.

149
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,070
- Are you scared?
- Very scared.

150
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,620
And you? Are you scared?

151
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,030
So this is your new job?

152
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,870
- Give me another one.
- One is enough.

153
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,630
- Give it.
- One is enough.

154
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,290
Open your mouth.

155
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,040
Are you scared?

156
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,530
This pill is nothing without you.

157
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,660
It needs you.

158
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,620
Arash!

159
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,120
Look how chic he is now.

160
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,130
Arash, are you okay?

161
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,250
Arash?

162
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,290
Arash?

163
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,530
I´m lost.

164
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,330
Where are we?

165
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,790
Bad City.

166
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,240
Bad City?

167
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,240
I live in Bad City.

168
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,500
This doesn´t look like Bad City.

169
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,040
Does it?

170
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,990
It´s not familiar.

171
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,950
I´m Dracula.

172
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,210
Don´t worry, I won´t hurt you.

173
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,330
Can I ask you something?

174
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,580
Why are you here?

175
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,960
Both of us...

176
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,960
Both of us are here.

177
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,240
I´ve never felt like this before.

178
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,210
Give me your hand.

179
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,740
You´re so cold.

180
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,320
Let´s sit.

181
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,660
You can´t sit here.

182
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,370
My house is near here.

183
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,040
You can sit there.

184
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,250
I can´t, I have to sit.

185
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,950
What´s with you?

186
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,660
You look funny.

187
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,490
I´m tired.

188
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,670
Yes, I can see that.

189
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,880
Where were you in the middle of the night?

190
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,670
With a girl.

191
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:24,280
What girl?

192
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,860
I don´t know her name.

193
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,580
You don´t know her name.

194
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,620
Who´s her family?

195
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:42,870
I don´t know.

196
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,920
‟I don´t know, I don´t know.”

197
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,250
Are you an idiot now?
Have you become an idiot?

198
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:58,290
Yep, he´s an idiot.

199
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,920
Congratulations, handsome.

200
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,420
Why are you following me?

201
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,210
What do you want?

202
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,780
Where did you get this?

203
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,700
Girl, where did you get this?

204
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,240
Have one.

205
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,910
They´re sweet.

206
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,410
What are you following me around for?

207
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,500
Are you religious or something?

208
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,030
No.

209
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,910
Look who found her tongue.

210
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,910
You want to do what I do?

211
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,380
It´s not easy.

212
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,820
If that´s why you´re following me around,
I´m not a teacher.

213
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:19,660
You don´t like what you do.

214
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,620
You´re watching me?

215
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,160
At night.

216
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,670
So...

217
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:43,670
what did you see
all this time watching me?

218
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,670
You´re sad.

219
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,500
You don´t remember what you want.

220
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,170
You don´t remember wanting.

221
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,990
It passed long ago.

222
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,830
And nothing ever changes.

223
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,070
Idiots and rich people

224
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:24,320
are the only ones who think
things can change.

225
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:32,120
You´re saving your money.

226
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,200
For what?

227
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,370
Are you a thief?

228
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,130
No.

229
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,210
So what are you?

230
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:10,990
MEET ME AT THE POWER PLANT
TOMORROW AT 10:00 P.M. — DRACULA

231
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,790
Are you hungry?

232
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,630
I brought you a hamburger.

233
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,130
You don´t like hamburgers?

234
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:44,320
I never met someone
who didn´t like hamburgers.

235
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:51,740
I don´t know your name.

236
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,210
You don´t know me.

237
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,460
Obviously. We just met.

238
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,530
What was the last song you listened to?

239
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,950
‟Hello,” ‟Hello.”

240
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,320
Lionel Richie.

241
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,880
Sad.

242
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:27,540
Sad songs hit the spot, don´t they?

243
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,450
I know something else about you.

244
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:40,920
Your ears aren´t pierced.

245
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,790
They´re pretty.

246
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:00,410
They´re for you.

247
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,450
Too bad you can´t wear them.

248
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:21,070
Seriously?

249
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,040
Are you sure?

250
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,460
Did it hurt?

251
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,880
- You don´t have to.
- Do the other one.

252
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,920
- Forget it.
- Do it.

253
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,420
It´s done.

254
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:46,030
What lucky earrings.

255
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,870
I´ve done bad things.

256
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,130
I´m bad.

257
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,380
Obviously.

258
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,790
You don´t know the things I´ve done.

259
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,990
And you don´t know the things I´ve done.

260
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,880
If there was a storm coming right now,

261
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,290
a big storm, from behind those mountains,

262
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,280
would it matter?

263
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:49,530
Would it change anything?

264
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,070
Did you come here to watch me?

265
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,130
Are you watching me?

266
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:42,950
What do you want?

267
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:44,570
What?

268
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,170
What? What do you want?

269
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,490
You´re still torturing me?

270
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,990
You left me here alone.
Now you´re back again.

271
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,290
What the hell do you want from me?

272
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,950
Leave me alone! You ruined me!

273
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:29,120
This is the life you left me!

274
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,960
Leave me alone!

275
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,620
What the hell do you want from me?

276
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,420
What are you doing?

277
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:39,880
Come here, look.

278
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,540
Look at its eyes. It´s your mother.

279
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:45,490
- Have you lost your mind?
- Do you see its eyes?

280
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,780
It´s your mother. Look, look.

281
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:50,450
Look at this place.

282
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,630
Why do you do this?

283
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,420
Can you tell me?
How much of this am I supposed to take?

284
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:59,580
- What do you want me to do?
- You´re supposed to be my father!

285
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:11,370
I don´t even know what I´m doing anymore.

286
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:15,210
I don´t know what I´m doing anymore!

287
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:17,540
You want your medicine?

288
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:21,040
Here.

289
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,780
Take it and get out of this house.

290
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:37,200
Take it and leave this house,
and don´t come back.

291
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:42,070
Take the cat with you.
I don´t want it anymore.

292
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,620
I want you to dance for me...

293
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:13,320
like the old days.

294
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,530
I want...

295
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,490
I want to watch you.

296
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:42,790
Atti, sweetheart...

297
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,410
come here.

298
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:51,210
Let´s be together.

299
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:54,540
Sit right here.

300
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,120
Let´s have a good time.

301
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,790
No, I don´t want to.

302
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:01,070
I said I don´t want to, Hossein.
I don´t want to.

303
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:05,070
Atti, sit down.

304
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:07,570
I said, ‟Sit down.”

305
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:12,750
We´re going to have a good time.

306
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,070
I said, ‟I don´t want to.”
Do you hear me?

307
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,450
Let´s have a good time.

308
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,380
Do you hear me, Hossein?

309
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,280
We´re going to have a good time together.

310
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,320
Let´s go.

311
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,530
You have to leave.

312
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,830
Take that thing with you.

313
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:29,740
Boy, if you saw something,
you have to tell me.

314
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:30,870
Understand?

315
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:35,630
- Did you see something?
- No.

316
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:37,790
Did you see someone?

317
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:38,910
No.

318
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:41,450
Did you see someone?

319
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,040
- Who was it?
- I don´t know.

320
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,450
Who was it?

321
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,290
What do you mean, you don´t know?

322
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,070
Who was it?

323
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:51,870
I don´t know.

324
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:33,410
We have to go.

325
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:39,920
Pack your things.

326
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:45,330
Do you have a bag?

327
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,330
Look, I can´t stay here.

328
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,830
We´ll get in my car and go.

329
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,070
Let´s leave Bad City.

330
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,490
Come with me.

331
01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:22,370
Don´t leave me.
Don´t leave me alone.
