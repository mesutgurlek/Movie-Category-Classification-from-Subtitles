1
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,191
What is to do?

2
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,317
You cut yorself or summat?

3
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,198
Who is that yelling blue mirder?

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,236
Angus.

5
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,994
You would think he found
the missing link or something!

6
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,720
Do not worry.

7
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,950
It is only an old fossil.

8
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,555
It will not bite.

9
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,273
Sexy beast, is he not?

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,350
The cave man, I mean.

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,069
If that is a primitive man,

12
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,072
it looks like a dinosaur sat on him.

13
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,358
It is a dinosaur, I think.

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,193
Oh, go pull the other one.

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,114
Our Dad had a cow looked like that once,
called Bessie.

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,395
I reckon that is Bessie.

17
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,357
Silly moo.

18
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,750
That is not a cow, it has got no homs!

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,751
Oh, Me spotted dick!

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,160
Let us see what she looks like.

21
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,710
Even if it is not a cow,

22
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,678
I bet it is no dinosaur, neither.

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,194
I am afraid you are right.

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,236
Is it not?

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,110
It cannot be.

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,360
Come over here.

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,553
You see those stones?

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,318
You mean those flint. The archaeologist?

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,278
Still playing "happy families"
at your age?

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,556
Not since we lost Mum and Dad, no.

31
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,039
Well that layer of flints represents
one thousand years.

32
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,315
How do you know that?

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,153
There was a convent on this site.

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,152
It had just been built
when the Domesday Book was written.

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,196
Ten sixty-six.

36
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,316
William the Conquerer.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,675
Close. Ten eighty-six.

38
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,638
And what do you deduce from that?

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,791
Well, Mister Smart the Schoolmaster,

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,112
I deduce that your old skull
dates back from Roman times

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,998
because that is nearly twice as deep.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,196
You are not as daft as you look.

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,191
Watch it!

44
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,555
And to prove it,

45
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,832
these coins, found
at the same level as the skull,

46
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,310
bear the stamp of Marcus Perusias

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,757
of Mercia in two eight-six A.D.

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,355
And where, pray, is Mercia?

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,560
You are sitting on it.

50
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,792
And Romans did not keep
pet dinosaurs, I take it.

51
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,510
No. They missed each other
by about twenty-five million years.

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,354
Well if it is not a dinosaur, what is it?

53
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,913
I do not know.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,037
Maybe I will find out
when I have excavated further.

55
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,110
Tomorrow.

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,917
What?

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,751
Tomorrow!

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,752
It is time to get ready
for the party now.

59
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,638
It will be dark in no time, anyway.

60
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,280
What party? No one has invited
me to a party, have they?

61
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,875
Well, no, not in a manner of speaking,

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,679
but they have invited me and Eve,

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,955
and since the truck has packed up,

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,520
we need someone to escort us.

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,351
What about supper?

66
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,716
Oh, you will get plenty to eat at party.

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,759
Our other guests are going
to take pot luck down at the pub.

68
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,835
- Hi, Mary!
- And miss one of our Mary's hot dinners?

69
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,831
How did you talk them out of that?

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,637
Bribery.

71
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,792
Me and Eve promised them a hot
water bottle each when we got back.

72
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,156
- Mary, you are having me or.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,994
They are cute. You might get one,
too if you play your cards right.

74
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,116
Happy families.

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,520
Turn the water off, will you?

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,756
Come on, Dina.

77
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,720
You are going to make history.

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,871
"One, two, three, four...

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,117
"John Lampton went a fishing once,

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,919
a fishing in the weir.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,992
"He caught a fish upon his book

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,833
he thought looked mighty queer.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,116
"Now what the kind of fish it was,

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,839
John Lampton couldn't tell.

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,914
"But he didn't like the look of it,
so he threw it down a well.

86
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,872
"Now the worm got fat and growed

87
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,952
and growed and growed an awful size.

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,520
"With great big teeth
and a great big mouth

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,637
and great big boggle eyes.

90
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,760
"And when at night it crawled
about a' lookin' for some booze.

91
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,800
"If it felt dry upon the road,
it milked a dozen coos.

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,560
"This fearful worm would often feen
on calves and lambs and sheep,

93
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,429
"And swallow little babes alive
when they laid down to sleep.

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,514
"So John set out and caught the beast
and cut it in two halves.

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,432
"And that soon stopped it eating babes

96
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,671
and sheep and lambs and calves.

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,435
"So now you know how all the folks
on both sides of the weir.

98
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,434
"Lost lots of sheep and lots
of sleep and lived in mortal fear.

99
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,512
"So drink the health of brave Sir John

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,398
who kept the babes from harm.

101
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,392
"Saved cows and calves by making halves

102
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,472
of the famous Lampton Worm."

103
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,358
"So drink the health of brave Sir John

104
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,352
who kept the babes from harm.

105
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,238
"Saved cows and calves
by maing halves

106
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,232
of that famous Lampton Worm!

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,239
Why all the fuss over a moldy worm?

108
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,595
Moldy nothing!

109
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,194
He is out local hero!

110
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,511
Have you not heard
of the Lampton Worm before?

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,875
And brave John Lampton?

112
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,952
Not before tonight, no.
I cannot say I have.

113
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,030
He is an outcomer.

114
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,873
Way out. The Orkneys.

115
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,360
He is staying with us.

116
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,874
As a paying guest.

117
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,189
How very convenient.

118
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,432
- Welcome to Lampton Hall, Mister?
- Flint.

119
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,351
Angust Flint.

120
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,271
The archaeologist.

121
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,714
I am James Lampton.

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,677
The landlord.

123
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,558
Ah, The Lampton Worm!

124
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,995
I did not mean.

125
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,514
I am sorry.
I meant you must be connected.

126
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,239
Well, distantlu, we are.

127
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,515
Sir John Lampton was a valiant knight

128
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,398
who slew the local dragon.

129
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,551
For centuries my ancestors
have immortal-ized the occasion

130
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,836
with an annual banguet for the locals,

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,639
usually with tankards
of Mead and Morris dancing.

132
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,030
This year, which is my first as Lord
of the Manor,

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,955
as it were, I thought we would hit
the worm with a little ra ra rock.

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,599
Are you really digging up
my farm yard?

135
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,796
- Yours?
- Yeah.

136
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,190
The Trent girls are my tenants.

137
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,599
- I am sorry, I...
- I do not give a damn.

138
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,511
Have fun.

139
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,195
I suppose diggin in cow dung is fun. Is it?

140
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,112
It depends on what you find underneath.

141
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,352
Well look, if you find any ghastity belts,
for God's sakes let me know.

142
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,999
The maids here are always
getting into trouble.

143
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,197
We have the nost terrible
staff problem these days.

144
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,078
I will, but I do not expect to.

145
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,913
It is the site of an old convent.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,400
Good Lord! Whatever next?

147
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,551
I think I might have found your worm.

148
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,472
Or its ancestor.

149
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,153
I unearthed skull this afternoon on the site

150
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,232
of what I suspect to be a Roman villa.

151
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,754
So you really are an archaologist?

152
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,559
I am a student an archaeologist?

153
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,075
I am writing a paper for my graduation
on the Romans of Mercia.

154
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,957
Why pick Lampton?

155
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,917
There was quite a large

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,673
Roman settlement here,
according to the records.

157
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,753
And you have dug up our worm?

158
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,151
It is closer to Tyrannosaurus
Rex than a worm, I reckon.

159
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,357
Well you must not take
the word "worm" too literally.

160
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,760
It is an adaptation of the Anglo Saxon

161
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,991
"wyrm' meaning dragon or snake.

162
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,595
The Gothic "waurms", it is all the same word.

163
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,560
So the common earth worm was not always
the lowly creature it is today.

164
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,394
Remember that the next time you bisect one
with your shovel.

165
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,596
Want some more?

166
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,314
It is very tasty.

167
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,958
Well good!

168
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,838
So you have taken to our local speciality.

169
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,718
Picked earth worms
in aspic is not to everyone's taste,

170
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,120
I can tell you.

171
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,190
Cheer up, Angus.

172
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,270
We are going home.

173
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,591
- And we are going to dance.
- Right.

174
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,153
Eve will not
have to come back alone, will she?

175
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,037
Of course not.

176
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,113
James will fetch her back in his posh car.

177
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,510
I swore I would never
come this way again mysell.

178
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,920
And I would not, neither,

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,151
if it were not for me brae Scotch lad.

180
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,993
Scots, please. Scotch is a drink.

181
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,117
I would not say "no" to one just now.

182
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,680
Brrr! It is chilly.

183
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,351
My Mum and Dad used to come this way home.

184
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,317
From the pub.

185
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,040
It is a neat short cut. Or was.

186
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,756
Nobody uses this at night now.

187
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,799
Not since they disappeared.

188
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,394
What do you mean, disappeared?

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,719
It was last year.

190
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,632
They left the pub as usual.

191
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,996
They set off through the grove and then,

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,113
well, it is as if they were
just swallowed up.

193
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,317
You mean they vanished with no trace at all?

194
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,232
No sign of a struggle? Nothing?

195
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,436
Nothing?

196
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,000
There were search parties.

197
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,275
Tracker dogs.

198
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,350
Nothing.

199
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,596
I still cannot believe they are gone.

200
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,912
I have a feeling
they have been spirited away.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,753
They will come back again some day.

202
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,230
And in the meantime,
you are both running the guest house?

203
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,551
Until something better comes along.

204
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,359
Looks like something had for Eve.

205
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,999
You mean James?

206
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,355
Some hopes.

207
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,590
They are just good friends.

208
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,399
In the old fashioned sense.

209
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,597
He is a proper fly-by-night, that one.

210
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,194
Never here.

211
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,311
Still, he was kind to us when,
when we were.

212
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,629
Orphaned.

213
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,554
Sourds funny, does it not?

214
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,394
Was there no one elso to help?

215
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,231
If you are trying to ask me

216
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,357
if I have got a boyfriend, the answer is no.

217
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,033
Not now.

218
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,875
He killed himself on a motorbike,
daft bugger.

219
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
My God, that scared me.

220
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,475
It is only a car.

221
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,631
Driving in the dark without headlights?

222
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,551
There is moonlight.

223
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,393
To a deserted house?

224
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,790
Did the police look there? For your parents?

225
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,758
First place they did look.

226
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,752
I want to go home.

227
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,596
Hello, Mary.

228
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,796
Hello, Erny.

229
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,190
What are you doing here at this time of night?

230
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,873
Enjoying a cup of tea...

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,354
brewed by one of your guests

232
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,636
before he went to bed
with a hot water bottle.

233
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,632
Seems he was tired of waiting.

234
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,636
What is up?

235
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,393
You have not found?

236
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,189
It is our Dad's.

237
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,799
Where did you find it?

238
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,314
I thought it might be.

239
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,957
It was found in Stone Rigg Carvern.

240
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,954
By a pot holer.

241
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,438
Was there anything else?

242
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,795
Not so far.

243
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,560
It was taked last summer.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,593
Is there any hope?

245
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,592
We are resuming the search in the morning.

246
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,909
I will join you.

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,957
Pick me up on your way.

248
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,235
Right.

249
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,919
Well, if you are all right then,
I will be off.

250
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,556
Thanks, Ermy.

251
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,874
I saw a sterange car with hooded lights
in the grove near Temple House.

252
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,634
Oh, well, I suppose I had better take a look.

253
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,392
"Bang" goes another early night.

254
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,509
Good night, Mary.

255
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,195
Good night.

256
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,557
Good night.

257
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,359
I will be along tomorow as well.

258
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,510
It is tomorrow.

259
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,551
Hello, Charlie.

260
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,040
Erny here.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,400
I am up at Temple House.

262
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,752
There is an intruder on the premises.

263
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,797
Get over here as quick as you can.

264
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,111
How can I? You got the can.

265
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,510
I know I have the car. Get taxi.

266
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,115
I arrested him for drunken driving!

267
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,669
You have plucked him up for drunken driving?

268
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,956
I do not believe it!

269
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,793
I am having my dinner!

270
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,758
I do not care if you are in the middle
of your supper!

271
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,320
But my turkey will be ruined!

272
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,995
Fuck the Kentrcky Fried Tutkey
and get on your bike!

273
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,117
I can't! My pump is broke.

274
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,350
I see.

275
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,957
Well, you can take your bicycle pump
and shove it up your ass!

276
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,760
Can I help you?

277
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,559
Lady Sylvia.

278
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,317
I have been stung by a snake!

279
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,312
Snakes bite.

280
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,675
Bees sting.

281
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,513
Yeah, it would not be a bee this time of year.

282
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,875
Hardly a snake, either.

283
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,952
It is probably a nettle.

284
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,633
Come inside and I will take a look at it.

285
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,597
Thanks.

286
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,191
Anyway, I need someone
to help me fix my lights.

287
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,511
I cannot find my wretched fuse box.

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,150
There.

289
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,756
Now, if what we see them do
in the adventure films is correct,

290
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,917
you shoukd suffer nothing worse
than a swollen ankle and a slight headache.

291
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,798
So it was a snake bite, then?

292
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,677
Despite the fact the little fellow

293
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,877
should have been hibernating, yes.

294
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
I just hope it was not too late.

295
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,834
Perhaps we should phone the hospital.

296
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,994
They would only amputate.

297
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,040
What you need is another brandy.

298
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,510
No, I should not. Not on duty.

299
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,193
Purely medicinal.

300
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,431
Anyway, you cannot be on duty
at this time of night.

301
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,311
Very well.

302
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,629
Thanks, Your Ladyship.

303
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,154
Will your colleague be in to join us?

304
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,199
No.

305
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,431
He is having trouble with his bicycle pump.

306
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,753
He does not know what he has missed.

307
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,077
Thanks.

308
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,120
Tell me.

309
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,352
Why were you playing
"Peeping Tom" on my property?

310
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,080
I thought you were being burgled.
Your Ladyship.

311
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,152
What with a flashing light

312
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,960
and a strange car being sighted in the grove.

313
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,230
That I change my car as regularly
as a snake sheds its skin.

314
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,154
Yes, but we were not expecting
you back untill spring.

315
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,151
As usual.

316
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,959
It is spring! Look!

317
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,952
Here is to the first swallow.

318
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,837
Cheers.

319
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,150
Cheers.

320
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,830
Who on earth could be prowling around
the grove at this time of night?

321
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,513
Tell me who reported me?

322
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,557
One of the Trent girls.

323
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,517
Mary.

324
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,718
Where her parents not supposed
to have vanished there?

325
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,759
I am surprised she would ever dare
to set foot in the place again.

326
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,036
She had a Scots lad for company.

327
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,835
Really?

328
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,151
He is joining the search party
in the morning.

329
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,594
What search party?

330
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,800
Something has been found
in Stone Rigg Cavern.

331
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,394
And what was that?

332
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,551
Joe Trent's watch.

333
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,791
And was he on the chain?

334
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,999
Hello! Anyone in?

335
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,959
I hope the kettle is on!

336
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,834
Well I love Mister Flint's hole.

337
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,070
It is rather fascinating.

338
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,552
They have found our dad's watch.

339
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,351
Where?

340
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,194
Stone Rigg Cavern.

341
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,800
Mary and Angus have gone over there
with a search party.

342
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,997
But only nutty pot-holers go down there.

343
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,679
It is supposed to be dangerous as hell.

344
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,830
I know that!

345
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,834
Do you want me to drive you over?

346
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,274
There is no point now.

347
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,952
Besides, it is too late.

348
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,952
We will never catch up with them.

349
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,316
I will just have a lie down
until they get back.

350
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,391
Right.

351
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,911
I am a bit tired myself.

352
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,593
How could you keep me up all night?

353
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,712
Dancing, for God's sake.

354
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,793
I have the camera in the car, thought

355
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,712
I might take a few shots
of the excavation before I go.

356
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,597
Well take care. I will call later.

357
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,553
Not too much later.

358
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,311
Eve.

359
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,595
Eve!

360
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,557
Are you all right?

361
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,198
What happened?

362
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,760
I am all right. Do not fuss.

363
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,275
Just blacked out, that is all.

364
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,157
All right.

365
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,594
Can you make the stairs?

366
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,431
Of course I can!

367
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,034
What do you think I am, a blooming invalid?

368
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,594
That is it.

369
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,875
Very slowly.

370
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,317
Here.

371
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,797
Now what happened up there?

372
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,155
You had better tall me.

373
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,956
Well, I saw some stuff...

374
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,637
on the wall under the crucifix.

375
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,191
So, so I went to wipe it off.

376
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,354
And that is all. All that I remember.

377
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,556
Yeah, justtry harder.

378
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,120
What else did you do?

379
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,119
Nothing. I told you.

380
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,390
I put the watch in my pocket.

381
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,153
The watch. You mean your father's watch.

382
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,469
Yes.

383
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,318
I put it in my pocket,

384
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,156
and then I started going up the stairs.

385
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,112
- And then.
- It was not like that just now.

386
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,111
I remember now.

387
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,429
After I passed out.

388
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,954
I remember.

389
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,120
A serpent.

390
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,634
A horrible thing!

391
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,357
Towering above me.

392
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,238
Coiled around a crucifix.

393
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,640
Was it white?

394
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,597
Like the one in the yard?

395
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,511
What?

396
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,397
Just relax.

397
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,675
Was it like the one in the excavation?

398
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,592
There is no snake there. What do you mean?

399
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,319
- Come with me.
- No!

400
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,392
Come on, it is just a mosaic.
It cannot harm you.

401
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,914
- No!
- It is very important you see it.

402
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,677
Was it like that?

403
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,354
He must have uncovered it this morning

404
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,239
before going off with Mary on the search.

405
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,518
It was not there yesterday
when he found the skull.

406
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,354
And that was the dinosaur business
you were on about last night?

407
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,752
Where is it now, the skull?

408
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,752
It is in his room.

409
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,956
Let's have a look.

410
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,870
Spring cleaning?

411
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,236
Oh! My God!

412
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,954
If you are looking for what
I think you are looking for,

413
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,110
I left it on the desk.

414
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,951
No.

415
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,474
Eve has has a bad trip.
What do you mean?

416
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,995
Well she will tell you all about it.
Just do not rush her.

417
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,117
I am going to go now,
but I will come back later.

418
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,759
If you find the missing skull, let me know.

419
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,638
Are you not going to ask what happened?

420
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,552
I saw it in your faces.

421
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,150
Well, it all started...

422
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,280
when we found your note,
and I went upstairs for a lie down.

423
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,192
Excuse me.

424
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,953
You couldn't drop me off
at Lawdale Youth Hostel, could you?

425
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,958
If you are going that way.

426
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,997
Or if you are broken down,
perhaps I coukd help.

427
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,594
No, I have not broken down.

428
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,149
I am snake watching.

429
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,914
I am not going to see much if
this keeps up, am I?

430
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,560
All right, then. Hop in.
Put your rucksack in the back.

431
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,551
Oh, thanks.

432
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,154
Thanks very much.

433
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,953
That is some system you have got there.

434
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,679
How do you rate the music?

435
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,752
I am not really into head banging.

436
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,877
Are you into any sort of banging?

437
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,751
I am not bad on the mouth organ.

438
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,631
You are sweet.

439
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,597
What is your name?

440
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,591
Kevin.

441
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,717
My mates call me "Kev".

442
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,234
Look, Kev, you are soaked.

443
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,472
We are passing my door.
Why do you not come in and dry off?

444
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,279
It will be getting dark, soon.

445
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,829
A big boy like you afraid of the dark?

446
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,558
No,

447
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,519
I just do not want to be late for my dinner
at the youth hostel, that is all.

448
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,559
Do not worry.
You will leave me well satisfied.

449
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,959
That is very kind.

450
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,269
Kind nothing.

451
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,556
If you do not get out of those wet things,
you will catch your death.

452
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,960
I will not hear another word.

453
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,953
Down you go.

454
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,599
Yes! I am home!

455
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,635
I am hungry.

456
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,756
Me, too.

457
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,115
Dinner will not be long.

458
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,837
Meantime, let's have some music.

459
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,999
That is enough of that, Kevin.

460
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,151
That sort of music freaks me out.

461
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,434
Well, the water should be not enough now.

462
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,480
So it is a nice bath for you,
and then, dinner.

463
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,913
And after that?

464
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,674
The experience of a lifetime.

465
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,319
I can forget the hostel, then?

466
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,516
Of course you can!

467
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,557
I would not dream of letting you go, now.

468
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,757
They are not expecting you, are they?

469
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,396
No!

470
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,596
Well, then!

471
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,751
There. That is just a sample.

472
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,513
Bath time!

473
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,958
I bet your girlfriend does not do this for you.

474
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,396
No. Nor my Mum, neither.

475
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,631
Oh. I remind you of your mother, do I?

476
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,757
No. Not exactly.

477
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,753
It is just that you are so considerate.

478
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,596
There.

479
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,591
Thank you.

480
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,399
Oh, I have not finished yet.

481
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,755
Stand up.

482
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,955
Come on.

483
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,157
I am not going to bite you.

484
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,036
My. You are a fine, growing boy.

485
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,752
My God, Kevin. You do have appalling B.O.

486
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,518
Save your breath. You have halitosis, too.

487
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,837
No use in even attempting to scream, my boy.

488
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,551
You see, your vocal chords are paralyzed.

489
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,314
In fact, your entire nervous system is paralyzed.

490
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,030
You are a vegetable,
metaphorically speaking, of course.

491
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,157
The god is not a vegetarian.

492
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,711
Now, if you are sitting comfortably,

493
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,157
I shall tell you why you must not be afraid to die.

494
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,120
To die so that the god may live
is a privilege, Kevin.

495
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,920
If you know anything at all about history,

496
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,040
you will know that human sacrifice...

497
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,876
is as old as Dionin himself.

498
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,398
Whose overy death is a re-birth...

499
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,757
into a god ever mightier!

500
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,439
Shit.

501
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,712
How remiss of me.

502
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,790
I should have turned the lights off.

503
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,351
I shall have to take precautions, Kevin.

504
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,750
Actually, I am doing you a favor.

505
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,359
Good evening. What can I do for you?

506
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,195
Well, forgive me for dropping in like this,
but you are not in the book.

507
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,317
If you mean the phone book, no, I am not.

508
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,756
Why? Is this a survey or something?

509
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,035
Not really, no.

510
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,919
I hear you are having trouble with a snake.

511
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,151
You must be from the council, then.

512
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,550
No. I have just seen Erny's ankle.

513
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,756
You are a doctor.

514
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,878
No, forgive me. I am your neighbor.
James Lampton.

515
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,476
And you are going to uphold family tradition
and slay the beastie!

516
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,233
How incredibly romantic!

517
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,756
Well, actually,
I was going to suggest I send my man around

518
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,559
to cut the grass and scotch the fellow.

519
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,835
Splendid!

520
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,355
And talking of Scotch,
may I offer you a drink?

521
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,955
- Thank you. I would like that, uh,
- Sylvia.

522
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,679
And I am James.

523
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,390
- Come in, James.
- Thanks.

524
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,836
Well it is strange we are unaquainted,
all things considered.

525
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,956
Is it?

526
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,952
You spend most of your time abroad,

527
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,475
and I virtually hibernate in the winter.

528
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,870
So perhaps it is not really so strange.

529
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,553
Well, maybe things are due to change.

530
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,950
I expect to be around
a gerat deal more now that I have

531
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,037
come into my inhertance, as it were.

532
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,554
Well, I will drink to that.

533
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,275
Thanks.

534
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,280
Name your poison.

535
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,237
Well, I will join
you in a small glass of brandy, if I may.

536
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,754
Do you have children?

537
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,230
Only when there are no men around.

538
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,755
Some people enjoy playing themselves
at cards or even chess.

539
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,355
My passion is snakes and ladders.

540
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,160
Playing with oneself cannot
be much fun, surely.

541
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,960
It depends on who is around
in the way of a pariner.

542
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,592
Fancy a game?

543
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,158
No, thanks.

544
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,357
I think I have had enough
of snakes for me week.

545
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,351
Cheers.

546
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,760
Cheers.

547
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,958
Last night we celebrated the slaying
of the Lampton Worm.

548
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,316
So this morning
the whole district has a hangover.

549
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,551
I would have invited you
if I had know you were back.

550
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,999
How did you know I was back?

551
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,198
Oh, yes, Ernest must have told you.

552
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,795
Yes. I bumped into him down in the village.

553
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,917
Poor old Erny.

554
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,880
Somehow I can never bring myself
to call him by that name.

555
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,112
Far too "matey"
for a policeman, do you not think?

556
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,236
Yes.

557
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,151
How is he?

558
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,152
Well he is fit as a fiddle, thanks to you.

559
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,720
You might have been stugn yourself.

560
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,791
No, there was nothing to worry about.

561
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,678
It was just a little love bite.

562
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,991
He told me that they

563
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,118
were resuming the search
for the Trent girls' parents.

564
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,760
Yes. It was a total washout, I am afraid.

565
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,231
Oh, poor darlings.

566
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,960
Yes. I was thinking
of dropping in to see them.

567
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,112
I got to know them quite well at the time
of the disapearance.

568
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,399
It really must have been
a terrible loss for them.

569
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,871
"To lose one parent
would be regarded as misfortune.

570
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,397
"To lose both looks like carelessness."

571
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,950
Well, it is hardly a comedy
of manners, is it?

572
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,678
I am sorry,

573
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,559
I was thinking
of our poorunfortunate policeman,

574
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,314
and Wilde's play,
"The Importance of being Ernest"

575
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,390
popped into my mind,

576
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,153
and that wonderfully wicked line.

577
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,835
Look, sometimes
when life become too painful,

578
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,991
the only thing to do is laugh at it.

579
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,433
Of course
I sympathize with those poor girls.

580
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,513
I could have bitten my tongue immediately.

581
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,718
I am sorry, you will have to forgive me.

582
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,270
I have had a rather trying couple of days.

583
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,150
What with the business
of the discovery of the watch,

584
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,232
Ernest and his snake bite,

585
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,437
I loathe snakes!

586
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,557
I have a morbid fear of them.

587
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,039
The Legend of the Lampton Worm terifies me,

588
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,829
and I could never have come to your party
in a million years.

589
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,355
Well then why do you torture
yourself palying snkes and ladders?

590
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,557
I really do not know.

591
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,710
It is a campulsion.

592
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,920
As a child, I was in a coma for ten days
as a result of a snake bite,

593
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,118
and ever since
I have had a revulsion for them.

594
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,396
And also a terrible lascination.

595
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,869
I am afraid I am a bit of a schizophrenic.

596
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,794
Well you woukd have to be to paly snkes
and ladders with yourself.

597
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,759
Look, I would like to help.

598
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,560
That is very sweet of you,
but I do not see how you can.

599
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,235
Well, perhaps by making you face your fears.

600
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,073
Come to terme with them.

601
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,358
I thought that is what I was doing
with my silly game.

602
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,958
Rosebud.

603
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,190
I beg your pardon?

604
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,271
I am sorry.

605
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,431
I am little tired just now.

606
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,954
If you will excuse me.

607
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,316
Of course. Forgive me.

608
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,357
May I see you again?

609
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,557
Yes. I would like that very much.

610
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,557
She is still feeling bit queezy,

611
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,678
so the doctor gave her a sedative
and sent her to bed.

612
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,320
She will be right as rain tomorow, I an sure.

613
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,039
Well then send her my love in the morning.

614
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,395
Righty ho!

615
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,278
No I am going to get an early night myself.

616
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,316
I am fairly knackered.

617
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,598
Me, too. I am up in spiral.

618
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,434
Maybe we should meet up for a drink tomorrow.

619
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,718
That would be nice. Sweer dreams.

620
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,519
You, too. Good night.

621
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,758
Confound it, Peters.

622
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,552
You have broken my dream.

623
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,917
Beg pardon, my lord.
Perhaps it is all for the best.

624
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,514
Yes.

625
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,872
I am not going
to make it to the breakfast table.

626
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,917
Please, could you just bring
me a cup of coffee?

627
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,114
Very well, my lord.

628
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,190
My God!

629
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,114
What do you make of that?

630
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,311
One would appear to be a facsimile
of the other, my lord.

631
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,673
Well do you not find that surprising?

632
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,194
Not so, my lord.

633
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,397
Legend has it that Stone Rigg Cavern

634
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,597
was the lair of the Lampton Worm.

635
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,319
Well that is news to me.

636
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,156
I suppose I have not been
there since childhood.

637
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,311
Draw me a bath, would you, Peters?

638
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,790
Very well, my lord.

639
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,349
Thanks, Angus.

640
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,351
Here we go again.

641
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,920
Wait and see.

642
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,673
I think you will find the path goes
all the way up through

643
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,752
the woods right up to the cavern.

644
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,796
How do you know?

645
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,349
You said you had not been
here since you were a child.

646
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,636
Only in my dreams.

647
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,235
This place is becoming like a second home!

648
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,720
Speak for yourself.

649
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,757
We have been through this place
with a fine tooth comb

650
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,877
and found nothing more
significant than bat shit.

651
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,633
It is a complete waste of time.

652
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,712
What on earth do you hope to find?

653
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,995
The Lampton Worm.

654
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,275
You are crazy.

655
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,396
He is potty!

656
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,630
Possibley.

657
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,837
But your father's watch
was found in this cave.

658
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,593
The very place where my ancestor is reputed

659
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,956
to have done battle with the worm.

660
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,235
Let's have some of that tea, Mary.

661
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,390
It is for later.

662
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,596
We have Scotch for later.

663
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,558
That is scarcely a logical connection.

664
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,394
Anyway, Sir John Lampton
made halves of the worm.

665
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,870
Ah, but what happens
when you slice a worm in two?

666
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,360
Don't be dafe!

667
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,671
Anyway, that was hundreds of years back.

668
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,831
That is like saying "yesterday"
in archaeological terms.

669
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,149
Is that not so, Angus?

670
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,197
He has a point there.

671
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,430
Here. Have your tea.

672
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,830
You will be saying
it is the Loch Ness Monster next.

673
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,639
Out for a stroll.

674
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,552
Scores of people have seen it, too.

675
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,472
Ay. On the way home from the pub.

676
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,075
Look, it is just feasible that,
given the right conditions,

677
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,879
a species long considered
extinct could survive.

678
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,758
In water, that is possible, I will grant you.

679
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,638
But a land based creature,
no matter how cunning,

680
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,189
would be sighted either feeding
or stalking its prey.

681
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,111
That is true.

682
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,554
That is how they will catch the yeti.

683
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,235
What has all this got to do
with our dad's watch?

684
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,357
I do not know. Nothing probably.

685
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,516
There. That is where they found the watch.

686
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,432
Yes, and what is that?

687
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,034
It says "cave drawing".

688
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,157
It is a primitive drawing etched
on the wall over there.

689
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,516
Must have been a lavatory wall. Disgusting.

690
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,398
Kinky lot, primitive man.

691
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,596
Have you not heard of it?

692
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,956
Surprosed, you being a local lad and all.

693
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,236
No, my parents never really encouraged
me to come here.

694
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,073
Maybe that is why!

695
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,991
I would like to see it.

696
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,673
It is not worth looking at.

697
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,910
Come. I will show you.

698
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,480
I will stay here.

699
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,916
Me, too. Fancy a sandwich, Eve?

700
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,515
Lovely place for a picnic.

701
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,829
All right, then.

702
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,350
Cood heavens.

703
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,199
So they had women's lib even in those days.

704
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,919
That is one way of looking at it.

705
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,560
My guess is that it is some sort
of fertility symbol.

706
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,919
Or a signpost?

707
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,960
Satisfied?

708
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,111
Well, I have heard of penis envy,
but that is ridiculous.

709
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,555
Scarcely that.

710
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,757
Half male. Half female.

711
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,071
Capable of the ultimate self-fulfillment.

712
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,958
Like hermaphrodite.

713
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,599
Or the common earthworm.

714
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,034
Or even the Lampton Worm.

715
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,349
That would explain how it might survive

716
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,794
over hundreds or thousands of years.

717
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,234
This is daft.

718
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,472
We could have stayed at home by the fire
with a good biology book.

719
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,279
I am freezing. Can we go now?

720
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,158
I just want to take a look at the place
where the watch was found.

721
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,357
We have looked there a hundred times.

722
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,999
Well, let us make it a hundred
and one and call it quits.

723
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,560
We should have called it quits yesterday.

724
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,194
All right, so they found the watch there.
What of it?

725
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,954
Chances are it was hidden
away here by someone.

726
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,679
Someone who thought it would never be found.

727
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,910
And you are dragging in dragons

728
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,396
and worms and serpents and Lord Knows what.

729
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,994
Next, you will
be suggesting those poor folk

730
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,959
were gobbled up in here by some
of Loch Ness Monster!

731
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,111
- That is horrible!
- Who swallowad everything but the watch!

732
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,634
I cannot believe it!

733
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,359
No, it swallowed the watch, too.

734
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,750
And passed it, undigested.

735
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,631
Are you out of your mind?

736
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,235
Was there any trace of excrement nearby?

737
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,593
You have completely flipped, man.

738
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,750
Was there?

739
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,671
Of course not.

740
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,717
It was found
in a shallow subterranean spring.

741
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,836
Where does it come from?

742
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,512
I do not know.

743
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,354
It just bubbles through a narrow
fissure in a rock fall.

744
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,556
Too small for anyone or anything
to pass through?

745
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,474
Too small for anything much
larger than a watch, yes.

746
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,552
Take me there, please.

747
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,040
Well I do not know.

748
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,076
This is crazy.

749
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,833
Where did you get such an idea?

750
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,512
I do not know.

751
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,115
Please, let us just have one more final
look, while we are here.

752
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,754
I do not want to go.

753
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,194
Then I will not go.

754
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,475
Then none of us should go.

755
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,313
Mary knows this place better than anyone.

756
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,390
Look, you go along, Mary.

757
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,551
One of us should be home getting
the visitor's teas ready.

758
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,075
You know how they go on
if it is not on the table waiting.

759
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,310
You sure you will be all right?

760
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,800
Stop your mothering.

761
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,439
Right, then, I suppose if I do not go,

762
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,273
I will never hear the last of it.

763
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,714
We will not be long.

764
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,757
Keep the cozy on the pot.

765
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,197
Thanks, Eve.
I will bring you back a diamond.

766
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,351
Take care, now. Watch yourself

767
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,912
Eve.

768
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,640
Oh, Eve.

769
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,789
Eve, I feel so silly.

770
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,631
I saw a little kitten up here
that could not get down,

771
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,473
so I climbed up.

772
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,716
Now it is gone,

773
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,190
and I do not scem to be able
to get down myself.

774
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,951
If you could just stretch up your hand,

775
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,553
that is it, and I will steady myself.

776
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,760
Thank you.

777
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,437
You look tired, Eve.

778
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,159
Do you want to rest?

779
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,959
You are weary.

780
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,519
Come with me.

781
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,594
Come with me and take your ease
at Temple House awhile.

782
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,239
Come with me.

783
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,551
It is no distance at all.

784
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,111
Your time has come, Eve.

785
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,800
Disrobe.

786
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,037
Do you believe in reincarnation, Eve?

787
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,319
I do. But then, I am immortal.

788
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,710
And I have seen the same souls

789
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,157
inhabit different beings throughout history.

790
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,910
I have seen you before, Eve.

791
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,117
Many centries ago.

792
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,830
In the time of my lover,
the great Emperor Carousias.

793
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,515
Yes, I can see you now, on your knees,

794
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,832
blindly worshipping your false God.

795
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,352
Fancy praying to a God who was nailed
to a wooden cross.

796
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,353
Who looked up his brides in a convent.

797
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,198
Did they really enjoy themselves?

798
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,354
Poor little virgins,
masturbaying in the dark.

799
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,237
And then in penance

800
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,960
for their sins indulging in flagellation

801
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,874
until their bodies wept tears of blood?

802
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,517
Captive virgins, hmmm?

803
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,990
In the hands of an impotent god.

804
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,240
Dionin will have none of that Eve.

805
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,356
As you should have learned when your Order

806
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,720
attempted to build a convent
over my sacred temple.

807
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,392
That is enough.

808
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,357
We do not want you to catch your death.

809
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,116
Just yel. Do we, love?

810
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,395
Come here.

811
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,480
Dionin has a propensity fof virgins, Eve.

812
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,950
Just like your falsc God.

813
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,516
Problem is, they are so hard to come
by these days.

814
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,557
Aren't they, Eve?

815
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,195
And you see, only vitginsare really

816
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,910
eligible for human sacrifice.

817
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,911
Those who have been sullied
are merely offered...

818
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,437
to satisfy his voracious appetite.

819
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,555
I wonder what your fate will be, Eve.

820
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:06,511
Yes. You have been a good girl, Eve.

821
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:13,153
You will have the honor
of being sacrificod to Dionin alive.

822
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,197
Now.

823
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,436
Where did you tell the others
you were going?

824
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,072
I told them
I was going home to get the tea.

825
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,755
They must be wondering
what has happened to you.

826
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,679
You will telephone the farm
and tell your sister...

827
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,911
what shall we tell your sister.

828
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,360
Tell her you are at Darby central

829
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,671
about to catch the next train to London.

830
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,759
Tell her the strain
of it all has been too nuch for you,

831
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,716
and you are going away

832
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,559
Tell her not ot worry,
you will contact her soon.

833
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,869
Right. The telephone is on the bar.

834
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,713
Make the call now.

835
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,751
And make it convincing.

836
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,352
Hello. Mercy Farm.

837
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,751
Hello, Mary. This is Eve.

838
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,480
Mary, I am at Darby Central.

839
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,756
I have got to get away for awhile.

840
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,116
Eve, what is wrong?

841
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,600
Nothing.

842
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,711
It is just that
I cannot take the strain of it all.

843
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:39,355
I am going to London
for a few days' peace and quiet so...

844
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,591
oh, Mary!

845
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,558
Eve, what is wrong? Tell me.

846
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,996
- Don't go! I will come and.
- Dionin!

847
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,680
Dionin!

848
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,195
What was all that about?

849
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,679
I do not know.

850
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,718
She said she was at Darby Central,
on her way to London.

851
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,280
Whatever for?

852
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,114
Wants to get away, she says.

853
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,998
But it is just not like her.

854
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,639
And that scream!

855
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,714
Dionin! Why did we leave her?

856
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,870
Shall I ring the station?

857
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,360
I do not like to fuss.

858
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,159
No, I think we had better, Mary.

859
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,357
She may have had another attack.
Do you have the number?

860
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,760
I will do it.

861
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,639
There is a Ray somebody there at enquiries.

862
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,949
Dionin.

863
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,430
Where did she pick that up, I wonder?

864
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,351
Well she was muttering something like

865
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,113
that when I found her upstairs yesterday.

866
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,556
Dionin was a pagan snake god.

867
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,359
Well why did you not say so before?

868
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,318
You have only just
mentioned it yourself, man.

869
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,834
Well, I have only just remembered it.

870
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,434
Hello, Enquiries?

871
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,512
Is that you, Ray?

872
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,035
Ray, Oh, yes, yes. I meant Roy.

873
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,557
It is Mary Trent, here. Mercy Farm.

874
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,757
Yes, yes. Bed and breakfast.

875
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,559
Oh, you were here last summer.

876
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,757
Easter. Easter, of course.

877
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,116
Yes, I would love to Ray Roy.

878
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,793
But listen.

879
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,280
I do not have much time.

880
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,158
It is about Eve.

881
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,959
My sister, yes.

882
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,350
Could you take a look on the platform?

883
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,560
Well she has just rung me
from the station and we got.

884
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,711
No. No, no. The Landon side.

885
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,190
Yes. We got cut off.

886
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,194
Well I have to speak to he before
she catches the London train.

887
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,352
Yes. Yes. It is most important.

888
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,669
Thank you.

889
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,559
And if she is not there?

890
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,675
Hello.

891
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,559
I can give her the message.
Mary is not here just now.

892
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,157
I see.

893
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,916
Well, if you do catch sight of her, perhaps you
could give us a ring here at Marcy Farm.

894
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,195
Thanks very much.

895
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,714
No sign of her.

896
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,399
The train has just gone.

897
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,119
We could have saved ourselves the trouble.

898
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,520
She has not taken a thing.

899
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,910
And I cannot see the clothes
she was wearing anywhere.

900
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,229
So she never came back.

901
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,754
Somebody has got her.

902
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,400
They are holding her against her will. I know it.

903
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,517
You know no such thing. Take it easy.

904
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,511
Look,

905
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,478
have you ever known
her to behave like this before?

906
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,710
Of course not!

907
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,439
Or ever mentioned this word "didonin"?

908
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,352
No! Never!

909
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,796
Well then, her disappearance could,
conceivably,

910
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,236
have something to do with this pagan god.

911
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,039
You are bonkers.

912
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,349
We should phone the police.

913
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,999
Wait, Mary. Let's hear what he has to say.

914
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,549
Well, I do not know exactly
what I have got to say,

915
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,916
this is just going
to be off the top of my head.

916
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,071
Come on, man.
If you have something to say, say it!

917
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,470
All right. You find a skull.

918
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,313
A prehistoric skull.

919
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,518
Is it conceivable that it could heve been
the skull of a giant snake?

920
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,159
Aye. It is possible, but...

921
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:54,957
Okay.

922
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,111
And before it has been properly identified,

923
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,111
it disappears.

924
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:58,838
It was stolen.

925
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,036
Very possibly.

926
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,032
And on the same site, you uncover a mosaic

927
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,351
of a giant snake dating
from the Roman occupation.

928
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,116
Well, there could be a connection,
if that is what you are driving at.

929
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,432
The Romans often assimilated
ethnic religions into their own.

930
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,877
The skull could well have been venerated
into their own.

931
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,350
What does all this have to do with Eve?

932
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,511
Quite a lot when you consider
that hallucination.

933
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,160
Aye. She saw a snake then, right enough.

934
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,359
And a cross. Do not forget that.

935
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,352
She does not go to church
or any of that stuff,

936
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,318
but she is quite religious, is Eve.

937
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,359
It seems to me that there is some kind
of confliet going on here.

938
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,433
And if Angus is right,
and it is also the site of a convent,

939
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,992
then it is a conflict between Christianity
and some early pagan cult,

940
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,073
possibly even involving humansacrifice.

941
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,719
The cave drawing would indicate that.

942
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,120
You are not suggesting E...

943
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,554
Which way would Eve have walked home?

944
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,915
Through the grove, of course.

945
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,434
It is the only footpath.

946
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,432
And why is Temple House so called?

947
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,432
Everyone knos that from school.

948
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,079
It was the site of an old temple.

949
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,719
It is obvious from the name!

950
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,951
The same way it is obvious
that Stone Rigg Cavern

951
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,236
has something to do with the Lampton Worm.

952
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,720
Maybe there is a connection.

953
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,393
You will be saying
there is a connection between

954
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,518
all this and Erny's snake bite next.

955
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,398
And snakes and ladders.

956
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,154
What do you mean, snakes and ladders?

957
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,916
Lady...

958
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,320
Sylvia...

959
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,119
Marsh.

960
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,112
I have switched on the front lights, my lord.

961
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,796
The men have carried the loudspeakers
up to the tower, my lord,

962
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,395
commected the extension cable as instrued.

963
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,315
The equipment has been tested,
and would appear to be in working order.

964
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,438
So if there is nothing further
you require tonight, then sir I will be...

965
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,840
Peters, I am completely at a loss.

966
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,879
I could have sworn that somewhere
in his North African collection,

967
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,474
my father had something
that sounded suspiciously

968
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,438
like the music of a snake charmer.

969
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,912
Yet all I can find is this solitary
disc labelled "Turkish Charmers".

970
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,151
Could it be this, do you think?

971
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:56,317
That certainly conjures to mind,
a Turkish Charmer, my Lord.

972
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,555
One of the feminine gender
your father encountered in Istanbul.

973
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,553
She was what is euphemistically known
as a belly dancer?

974
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,918
May we try the "B" side, my lord?

975
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,157
Well, what do you think?

976
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,960
I recall His Lordship's very words.

977
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:29,069
"That would charm the Lampton Worm
itself out from its hole, Peters.

978
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:36,670
I remember it worked extremely well with
a King Cobra, my lord.

979
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,118
Well then put your bicycle clips on,
Peter I am expecting company.

980
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,796
Angus, what is it? Come on!

981
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,030
This is bizarre!

982
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:51,712
What?

983
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,597
This.

984
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,353
It is only a statue.

985
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,033
Loads of people have them like that.

986
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,554
Not one that has him.

987
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,960
Marcus Carousias. The rebel emperor.

988
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,316
He is the one on the coins
you found on the dig.

989
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,516
Aye.

990
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,716
So?

991
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,150
He certainly would have known about
this pagan religion,

992
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,757
may even have been involved.

993
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,870
And what is he doing in Lady Sylvia's hall?

994
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,993
What is it?

995
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,594
It is a mongoose.

996
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,119
Traditional enemy of the snake.

997
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,559
Mum!

998
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,915
Mum!

999
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,030
Hello James. Is that you.

1000
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,715
No? Oh, I see.

1001
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,599
Look, could you please
give him an urgent message.

1002
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,160
Yes, sir.

1003
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,639
Yes. Very good, sir.

1004
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,040
I will inform His Lordship right away.
Will you.

1005
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,600
Was that for me? Was that Mister Flint?

1006
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,400
Well, judging from his accent,
it might very well have been, sir.

1007
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,632
But the gentleman hung up before
I could ascertain.

1008
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,870
What did he say exactly?

1009
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,000
"It is working like a charm.

1010
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,833
Take care. She is on her way."

1011
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,512
Great!

1012
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,273
Great, great, great.

1013
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,955
I have locked up for the night, my lord.
Will that be all?

1014
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,076
You mean you have closed the front door?

1015
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,560
And locked it as usual, my lord.

1016
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,109
But I deliberately left it open,
so would you kindly go and unlock it,

1017
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,510
and then tell the chambermaids
to lock themselves in their rooms.

1018
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,274
Unlock the front door
and lock up the chambermaids.

1019
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,920
Very well, my lord.

1020
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,515
Hello, police. Give me the police.

1021
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,671
Well yes of course it is an emergency.

1022
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,513
Lampton Hall.

1023
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,559
Yes, this is Lord Hampton.
And could you please.

1024
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,357
Hello.

1025
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,159
Angus. Yes.

1026
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,550
Yes, it did work up to a point.

1027
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,109
Yes, I got her,
but not before she got Peters.

1028
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,715
And it is not who we were expecting, either.

1029
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,112
How did you guess?

1030
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,714
What?

1031
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,110
Oh, my God.

1032
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,954
What, her own daughter?

1033
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,191
Yeah. Yeah, is she all right?

1034
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,875
Yes, I extracted the poison before
it could do any harm.

1035
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,917
She is in bed now, resting.

1036
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,515
But it is evident her poor mother
was less fortunate...

1037
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,717
for when the venom attacks
the nervous system,

1038
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,315
the victim appears to be affliced
with a form of vampirism.

1039
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,672
So, if we are going to combat this thing,

1040
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,114
I am going to need a little time
for research.

1041
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,680
You going to be all right up
there on your own?

1042
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,519
Yes, I will be all right, thank you.

1043
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,829
You carry on with your research by all means,

1044
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,958
I have a few theories of my
own I would like to put into practice.

1045
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:04,712
Yes, that is correct.

1046
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,156
You do not hear music
playing in the background.

1047
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,435
Well, we had a power cut.

1048
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,160
I expect the record player turned
itself off automatically.

1049
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,756
Right. If it makes you happy, I will check.

1050
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,910
Thanks for the warning.

1051
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,754
I think we probably have another
reptile loose on the premises.

1052
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,150
Yeah, look, do not keep asking if
I am going to be all right.

1053
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,640
Of course
I am bloody well going to be all right.

1054
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,951
The police are on their way,
if that is any comfort.

1055
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,030
Yeah. And you take care.

1056
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,554
Take care of Mary.

1057
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,591
I will do my best. Bye.

1058
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,718
Mary, can I come in?

1059
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,035
Mary, your mother is at rest.

1060
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,439
I have been half ecpecting you.

1061
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:33,911
We need you.

1062
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,559
To identify the body.

1063
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,993
Why? You have known her yourself for years.

1064
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,800
I know, Mary,
but we have to do it by the book.

1065
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,439
It must be next of kin.

1066
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,390
I am expecting Angus back any moment.

1067
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,470
We will not be long.

1068
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,359
You can always call him from the station
if you are worried.

1069
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,919
I will get my coat.

1070
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,480
It must have been around midnight
I got the call.

1071
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,836
"Emergency, Lampton Hall".

1072
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,157
Came in just as I was going off duty.

1073
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,799
As ussual.

1074
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,998
Alway catch you just as you are about
to get your head down.

1075
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,674
I thought it might
be a simpke breaking and entering.

1076
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,759
A wonder they have not been burgled,

1077
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,513
all those valuables up there.

1078
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,719
Certainly was not expecting to find
a couple of corpses, I can tell you.

1079
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:38,512
Peters had a broked neck, and your mother,

1080
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,472
well I suppose you could
say she had been fatally wounded.

1081
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,399
But what really happened?

1082
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,914
What about James?

1083
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,754
He was unharmed, if that is what you mean.

1084
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,956
But where is he now?

1085
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,918
He is helping with our enquiries.

1086
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,719
You mean he is locked up?

1087
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,952
We can get to the bottom of it, yes.

1088
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,590
His present story needs a great deal
of verfication.

1089
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,194
Will I be able to see him.

1090
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,749
That depends.

1091
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,672
When we get to the station

1092
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,199
I want you to put
out a missing person' s call for Eve.

1093
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,475
Eve?

1094
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,075
Oh, no! What has happened, love?

1095
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,354
Where are er going?

1096
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,397
This is not the way to the police station!

1097
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,756
We are picking up Lady Sylvia Marsh
on the way.

1098
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,638
Because of allegations brought by Lord James,

1099
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,712
we are bringing her in for questioning.

1100
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,950
I see.

1101
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,195
Now. Tell me more about Eve.

1102
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,755
If you do not mind,
I would rather wait until we get to the station.

1103
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,990
Of course.

1104
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,599
You rest easy, lass.

1105
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,990
Will you not come in?

1106
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,394
Can I stay here?

1107
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,472
She sounded a bit edgy on the phone.

1108
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,155
Seeing you will reassure her, like.

1109
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,916
Right.

1110
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,195
Watch those cylinders.

1111
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,919
That gas is toxic.

1112
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,912
And be very careful with the pump.

1113
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,956
If anything happens to that,

1114
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,157
we will not be able to force
the gas through the fissure.

1115
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,800
Light, please. Thank you.

1116
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,600
Right, now follow me and keep close.

1117
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,990
It is my belief that then is some form
of crature,

1118
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:06,278
probably carniverous,
trapped beneath us in a subterranean cave.

1119
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,829
When I adjust the burner,
we will smoke him out.

1120
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,351
From now on,
everyone is to maintain absolute silence.

1121
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:24,351
Oh, Dionin, who dwelt in peace
in the Garden of Eden.

1122
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,717
Dionin, who gave us the gift of know ledge,

1123
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,919
Dionin, who suffered the wrath
of the false God,

1124
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,279
Dionin, who was driven
from Eden by the fales God,

1125
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,479
Dionin, who was trodden underfoot
by the son of man,

1126
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,554
Dionin, who returned to the darkness,

1127
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,475
Dionin, whose kingdom is darkness,

1128
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,395
Dionin, who makes safe our darkness,

1129
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,632
Dionin, who is darkness,

1130
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,871
Dionin, the immortal,

1131
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,159
accept this, our sacrifice,

1132
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,950
Darkness eternal,

1133
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,839
Dionin!

1134
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,072
Dionin who came forth from the darkness,

1135
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,358
Dionin who dwelt in peace
in the Garden of Eden,

1136
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,152
No time for ritual, no time for ceremony.

1137
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,316
You go on. I am going back.

1138
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,153
What are you doing?

1139
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,954
No! Angus!

1140
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,554
And run like hell!

1141
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,356
Holy shit!

1142
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,634
What are you doing?

1143
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:03,157
Just in case there is a scratch
that gets infected by the venom.

1144
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,152
I had it analyzed.

1145
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,794
This is the antidote.

1146
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,760
What if it does not work?

1147
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:19,038
Well it worked on me all right,
though by Jesus it took its time.

1148
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,157
I thought I was goner.

1149
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,953
You stay here.

1150
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,872
I am going to phone for an ambulance.

1151
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,990
Thanks.

1152
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,150
Where would you say that was?

1153
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,833
Looks like it is over the grove, somewhere.

1154
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,039
Do you think it could be over Temple House?

1155
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:47,792
Could be.

1156
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:48,950
What are you up to now?

1157
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,191
Now it is a pint at the local.

1158
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,351
Tell the chaps, I will catch you up.

1159
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,874
Just back from the Highland Games?

1160
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,429
You picked a fine time to go pot holing.

1161
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:14,954
I have developed rather a taste for it.

1162
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,235
Might even go back tomorrow.

1163
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,151
With more smoke?

1164
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,000
Dynamite, I thought.

1165
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,594
I have saved you the trouble.

1166
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,955
Damn!

1167
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,074
I wanted to do a good deed,
like bold Sir John.

1168
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,594
You smoked out the worm and saved our skins.

1169
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,909
That should do you.

1170
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,751
The girls are both okay. Do not worry.

1171
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,999
So how did you know it was there?

1172
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,036
Well it was the watch.

1173
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:35,951
Since it disappeared in the vicinity

1174
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,030
of Temple House and reapppeared

1175
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,873
in the cavern, there had to be a connection.

1176
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:39,916
Underground.

1177
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,237
The rockfall that trapped the creature
centuries ago proved

1178
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,516
to be a refuge as well as a prison.

1179
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,875
It survived.

1180
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,758
Thanks to the likes of Lady Sylvia,

1181
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,910
whose final human sacrifice was herself.

1182
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,519
Well that is real devotion for you.

1183
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:01,356
Aye. She is gone for good now,
and her final acolyte along with her.

1184
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,556
Poor Erny.

1185
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,435
So she got him, too?

1186
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,715
He told Mary you were locked
up in the police ststion.

1187
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,314
That is a lie.

1188
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,436
I split before he came.

1189
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,989
The whole place was becoming
like a reptile house.

1190
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,356
Anyway, I would never have gotten my act
together in a prison cell.

1191
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,678
I suppose it is all going to take
a little bit of explaining.

1192
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,599
It seems we both
have a little explaining to do.

1193
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,910
Perhaps we should give ourselves up together.

1194
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,993
Well, yeah, but after we have had a drink
with the girls, do you not think?

1195
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,196
Where are they, by the way?

1196
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,078
I guess they are in the local
hospital by now.

1197
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,310
In the hospital?

1198
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,675
Just a precaution in case of delayes shock.

1199
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:35,910
Do not be alarmed.

1200
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,156
By Christ, have I am tale to tell you.

1201
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,709
I can hardly wait.

1202
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,153
Send them my love if it is.

1203
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,756
Hello, Mercy Farm.

1204
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,956
Angus Flint speaking.

1205
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,440
Oh, hello. Mister Flint.

1206
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,318
It is Derby Hospital research lab, here.

1207
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,154
I had almost given up hope.

1208
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,836
Yes, we have been rining you on
and off for over an hour.

1209
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,960
No, my name is Nurse Gladwell,
I am Doctor Blake's assistant.

1210
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,159
No, he has gone home.

1211
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,796
Well it is just to say there has been
a silly mistake.

1212
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,155
It is my fault, really.

1213
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,153
You were given the wrong serum.

1214
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,351
It is for the relief of arthritis.

1215
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,557
No, it is no good for snake bites at all,

1216
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:29,350
but we will not be getting many
of them this time of year, will we?

1217
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,912
I have your antidote here.

1218
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,313
You can collect it tomorrow.

1219
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,914
And if at the same time you could.

1220
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,311
There we are.

1221
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,720
Give her in.

1222
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,550
So was that the hospital?

1223
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,790
Hospital?

1224
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,919
Yeah. You thought it might be the girls.

1225
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,320
No. It was not the girls.

1226
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,470
Good.

1227
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,959
Well, I do not know about you,
but I am famished.

1228
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,520
Shall we stop on the way for a bite?

1229
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,600
Why not?

1230
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,477
Right.
