Miss Mason.

4
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,173
Since your listening skills
are so adept,

5
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,342
perhaps you could tell me how many
molecules of oxygen

6
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,594
a molecule of haemoglobin can hold
in the blood for transport.

7
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,763
- Four.
- And haemoglobin is what?

8
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,224
The iron-containing
oxygen-transport metalloprotein

9
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,143
- in the red blood cells of vertebrates.
- Anywhere else?

10
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,979
In the tissues of some invertebrates.

11
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,440
Do not bring cell phones
into my classroom.

12
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,568
- No, sir.
- It is very fucking rude.

13
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,115
Now, back to where we left off.
Amputation reattachment.

14
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,617
- An amputated arm...
- [vibrating]

15
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,744
...can be surgically reattached
if the patient receives

16
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,205
surgical attention within four hours.

17
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:49,752
An amputated hand within eight,
amputated fingers within 12.

18
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,298
So, four, eight, 12.

19
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,390
Dr. Grant, I am so sorry.
I'm really embarrassed about that.

20
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,810
Surgeons don't have the luxury about
being sorry about anything, Mary.

21
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,437
I have enough useless twats in my class.
I'm not gonna abide by one of my

22
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,148
- promising students falling asleep.
- I am so sorry.

23
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,110
- I was up all night studying.
- Uh-huh. That's what they all say.

24
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,488
- I was suturing a turkey.
- Uh-huh. Did you eat it afterwards?

25
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,283
It wasn't an eating turkey.

26
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,162
I see great potential in you, Mary,
if you stop fucking up in my class.

27
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,581
I will.

28
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,585
Good surgeons don't
make any mistakes, Mary.

29
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,589
[woman] Miss Mason, it says here
that you've been late on a payment.

30
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,758
[Mary] I know, I called last Friday
and I put $40 in my account.

31
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,678
[woman] It does say here that
you did make a payment on Friday.

32
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,848
- But $40 isn't usually enough...
- No one said that my service

33
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,433
was gonna be cut off,
and when I called on Friday,

34
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,018
- they said everything was fine.
- [alarm chirping]

35
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,353
[woman] They obviously made a mistake.

36
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,065
I want you to know that this is
something we don't usually do.

37
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,986
I'm going to restore your service
without a reconnection fee.

38
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,864
When will you be able
to make your next payment?

39
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,825
- Um...
- [engine starting]

40
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:09,707
I should be able to put some money
on it in... let's say two weeks.

41
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,919
How much do I have to put on
to keep me in the clear?

42
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,924
You are three months behind,
$364 should be enough.

43
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,927
OK. Um, what's the least
that I could put on it?

44
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,680
- $364.

[Mary] Yeah, well, that's
'cause my phone got cut off.

What? Your phone is cut off? When?

[speaks foreign language]

Sometime this afternoon, I think.

00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,603
But everything's fine now.
It's all figured out.

[woman speaks foreign language]

53
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,565
I have a little.
I can go in the bank tomorrow.

54
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:21,278
No. No, no, no. It's, uh...
I don't need it, Nana.

55
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,323
The, uh...
I've already talked to the bank.

56
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,909
The phone company just made a mistake.

57
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,620
- So everything's OK.
- Oh, good.

58
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,873
Is everyone being nice to you
in the school?

59
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,002
Nobody's trying to lie down
with your boyfriend?

60
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,629
I don't have a boyfriend.

61
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,466
And it doesn't really happen
in med school anyway.

62
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:47,471
[woman on speaker] Well, I was watching this
show, and this blonde was trying to make love

63
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,350
to all the boys, and when her friend
find out, she made up a story

64
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,104
so everyone would think she was the one
making love to everyone.

65
00:05:55,272 --> 00:06:00,651
I didn't know that happened. Everyone
today is just taking off their clothes,

66
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,780
saying, "Let's make love."
Like it's nothing.

67
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,867
Well, I'm sure that was
just the show, Nana.

68
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,953
They have to do that
so that people will watch it.

69
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,165
They won't wanna watch
if nothing shocking happens.

70
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,460
They never have that sort of thing
in Budapest.

There was a road, where the women
would be on the corner.

- This is my resume.

I didn't know if you needed one or not.

80

You don't need it to work here,
but it is nice to find out

some of your dirty secrets.

- Surgeon.

00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,441
- You any good?
- I'm very good.

86
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,696
And I'm also very broke
and I need to make money, so...

00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,448
Direct. I like that.

00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,829
So... Mary.

89
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,124
Now comes the unpleasant portion
of the interview.

90
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,545
You're not fat under there, are you?

91
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,339
No. Starving student.

92
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,677
If you don't mind... Mary. Please.

93
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,978
Appropriate?

94
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,986
Very appropriate.

95
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,155
Rad.

96
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,159
Why don't you try a little walk.

97
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,665
You might wanna walk
a little sexier, Mary.

98
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,001
How about a massage? Come on.

99
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,801
Not through the jacket.

100
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,770
Yeah... A little harder, Mary.

101
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,940
Oh, yeah...

102
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,737

- Keep going.

Lance, can't you see
I'm doing an interview?

104
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,159
[Lance] Black's not coming back.

105
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,496
What do you mean
Black's not coming back? Call him.

106
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,499
I called his cell phone
six fucking times.

107
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,459
Fuck!

108
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,463
Wait right here.

109
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:04,770
Mary, what level are you at
to becoming a surgeon?

110
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,022
I'm... still a ways off.

111
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,609
I have a residency programme to complete,
but I've done almost all the...

112
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,611
Do you wanna make five grand?

113
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,657
- What do I have to do?
- No questions asked.

114
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,245
After you're done, I hand you $5,000
and you don't have to show me your tits.

115
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,914
What do you want me to do?

116
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,294
[groaning] You know what?
Fucking forget it!

117
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,338
I'll do anything you want
for 5,000 cash tonight.

118
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,883
Follow me.

[man whimpering, panting nearby]

120
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,972
Oh... Hang on. You good?

121
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,891
- Yes.
- Go.

122
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,938
[whimpering, sobbing]

123
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,525
Yeah, we'd prefer it if Rat
was not to die tonight.

124
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,820
He's already been drugged up,
so feel free to just dig right in.

125
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,405
Whoa...

126
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:02,870
I'm no expert on the subject here,
but I think that time might be an issue.

127
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,955
Here you go.

128
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,807
It's OK. Shh...

129
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,060
Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine.

130
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,605
Shh... OK.

[phone ringing]

140
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,042
I think you've been calling
the wrong number.

141
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,420
[woman]
You don't even know who's calling.

142
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,801
- Who's calling?
- My name is Beatress.

143
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,262
I'm quite sure
I don't know any Beatress,

144
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,265
and this isn't a Dr. Mary's number
that you're calling anyway.

145
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,684
But I said Dr. Mason.

00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,773
Fuck.

- [man] Hi. I've been trying to call you.

149
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,454
Sorry, I was on the other line.
What's up?

150
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,830
The mall locked us out.

151
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,958
There's no more scheduled shifts
until we get this sorted out.

152
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,212
- What happened?
- I haven't been able to pay the rent.

153
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,465
They got tired of waiting.
Poof, they locked us out.

154
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,718
So... that's it? [sighs]

155
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,179
Pretty much.
I'll call you if anything changes.

156
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,306
I'm really sorry, Mary.

157
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,727
[sniffling]

158
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,110
[intercom buzzing]

159
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,121
[sighing]

160
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:41,505
- Yes?
- [woman] A package. Mary Mason.

161
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,840
What? I'm Mary Mason.

162
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,510
I need you to sign for a package.

163
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,929
Fine. 211.

164
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,709
You didn't really leave me
much choice.

165
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,753
- Who are you?
- You can put the bat down, Dr. Mason.

166
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,298
I'm completely harmless.
My name is Beatress Johnson.

167
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,384
- We spoke earlier.
- How do you know where I live?

168
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,220
It's on your resume.
It's a pretty impressive resume,

169
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,389
with all that doctor stuff on it.

170
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,725
Must be expensive.

171
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,686
Listen, I'm just a desperate woman
looking for help.

172
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,146
[dry chuckle]

173
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:43,191
Well, if you need some kind of help,
I suggest you go to a hospital.

174
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,902
- What if they refuse to help us?
- Then call your HMO.

175
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,864
- Get it figured out, I don't know!
- It's not a financial issue.

176
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,159
Money, I got lots of. I'll give you $200

177
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,828
if you just let me say what I'm gonna
say, and I'm gonna say anyway.

178
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,582
- And then you'll leave?
- Mm-hm. You'll never see me again.

179
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,419
- Can I see the money?
- Hm.

180
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,845
What do you see when you look at me?

181
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,933
You kind of resemble Betty Boop.

182
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:23,607
- Kind of?
- Well, it's a little uncanny.

183
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,277
I'm lucky enough to be able to afford to
make myself look on the outside

184
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,529
the way I feel on the inside.

185
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,324
Fourteen different surgeries
to get me to look like this.

186
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,869
Some gone out of the country
to find the best doctor for the job.

187
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,789
In my travels,
I met another girl like me.

188
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,000
But she hasn't been able
to find someone to finish her.

189
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,587
- I wanna hire you.
- Well, I'm not a doctor.

190
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,883
- I told you that.
- I wanna pay you $10,000, cash.

191
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,469
That ought to solve
your money problems for a while.

192
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,388
Especially with what Billy
gave you last night.

193
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,306
I'm not doing what
I did last night again ever.

194
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,935
I'm not asking you to.
She's just... she's a nice girl

195
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,604
who wants an unconventional operation.

196
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,401
- How unconventional?
- She just wants some skin removed

197
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,570
for, um... cosmetic reasons.

198
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,990
My niece, she's a receptionist
at a veterinary clinic.

199
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,743
We can use the operating room
after hours.

200
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,628
I obviously do not have...

201
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,382
...any kind of insurance package
for this kind of thing.

202
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,592
And I can't guarantee
that the skin removal

203
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,221
- will produce the desired effects.
- I'll give you two grand

204
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:40,350
- just to show up.
- What time does the clinic close?

205
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,768
[giggling]

206
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,148
[phone ringing]

207
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,693
- Hello?
- [Dr. Grant] You missed class.

208
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,195
I hope it wasn't our conversation
the previous day that made you

209
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,781
think there are better things to do
than attend my lecture.

210
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:59,244
No, I had some family matters
to attend to yesterday.

211
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,330
You gave me your word that you
weren't gonna fuck up any more.

212
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,874
I'm not. I won't.

213
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,210
Your actions show that your word
is worth fuck all.

214
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:11,173
You miss another lecture, you can
find another class to not attend.

215
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,647
[sighing]

216
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,234
Thank you for coming, Dr. Mason.

217
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,237
Beatress, I think we need
to talk about this.

218
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,531
I know.
It's crazy to think that anybody

219
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,951
has that much disposable income,
but I love her.

220
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,329
I just don't want
to see her suffer any more.

221
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,247
[scoffing]

222
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,541
Yeah, she's really suffering.

223
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,251
Tessa, honey, don't be a cunt.

224
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,797
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about that.

225
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,174
She's at that difficult age where
if she's not high all the time,

226
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,260
she's just a little bitch
to everybody. [chuckles]

227
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:05,101
Ten thousand dollars,
and two for showing up.

228
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,897
- Hm. That's one less tit job this year.
- Shut the fuck up, Tessa.

229
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,317
I don't see why you have to pay for it.
She's already had a billion dollars

230
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,779
worth of surgery. Why doesn't her bitch
pay for it like all the other ones?

231
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,616
Tessa, if you're not nice
to Auntie and her friends,

232
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,661
it's not gonna snow
for a very long time.

233
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,705
Like there isn't some jippo already
in your purse.

234
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,250
What exactly does she want me to do?

235
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,796
I think she can probably
explain it best to you herself.

236
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,354
Hi.

237
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:53,692
Oh. Hello, doctor.
Thank you so much for coming.

238
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,152
Yeah.

239
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,655
OK, um...

240
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,493
So what are we doing here?

241
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,453
Um...

242
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,082
I don't think it's really fair that God
gets to choose what we look like

243
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,877
on the outside, do you?

244
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,213
I'm sorry, that's not
really a fair question.

245
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,009
It'll probably surprise you,
but I've never had any

246
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,178
of these surgeries
to become a sexual object.

247
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,807
- You don't work with Beatress?
- Oh, no.

248
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,019
I'm a fashion designer.
Ruby ReaIGirl designs.

249
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,186
Oh.

250
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,231
No one looks at dolls
in a sexual manner.

251
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:38,028
- Do you know why?
- I don't know why...

252
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,156
Guess it's 'cause they
don't have all their parts.

253
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,284
Exactly. You understand perfectly.

254
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:48,079
A doll can be naked
and never feel shy

255
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,166
or sexualised or degraded.

256
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,876
That's what I want.

257
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,589
OK, I'm sorry, I'm not really
understanding you.

258
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,759
Just take these off,

259
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,721
and seal up this as much as possible.

260
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,307
Take off the extra bits too.

261
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,271
Can you excuse me for just a moment?

262
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,282
- She really wants this?
- Oh, yes.

263
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,660
She's dedicated her whole life to this.

264
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,080
Something wrong?

265
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,208
Nope.

266
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:53,019
All right. I'm going to have you
count backwards from 100 for me.

267
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,940
Starting now.

268
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,151
- [air hissing]
- One hundred, 99,

269
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,448
98, 97, 96...

270
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,743
[classical music plays]

271
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,521
She's gonna be sore and in a lot of
pain, mostly in the genital region.

272
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,107
I suggest you get her something
with codeine in it.

273
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,568
- That shouldn't be a problem.
- OK.

274
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,279
She's at serious risk for infection
if she doesn't keep

275
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,447
the surgical areas clean
and go see a doctor to make sure

276
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,117
she's healing properly. An untreated
infection, something like mastitis,

277
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,370
- could kill her.
- I have a private doctor for check-ups.

278
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,498
- I'll take her there.
- OK. She is also gonna be very groggy.

279
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,459
You should take her somewhere
where she can heal and rest up.

280
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,337
And walking is going to be painful.

281
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,465
- Thank you so much, Dr. Mason.
- Oh.

282
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:14,554
Please do not give my name or
information to any of your friends. OK?

283
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:18,600
Oh, of course not. This was
an exceptional circumstance.

284
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,976
Good. Good luck.

285
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:26,149
Wait. What should I tell Ruby to call
you for her website when she updates

286
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,402
- the body mod community?
- Make something up.

287
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,664
[gagging]

288
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,419
[vomiting, coughing]

289
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:55,011
[Mary] I want you to know that
the surgery was a complete success.

290
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,180
The scarring should be minimal.

291
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:01,309
But I'm gonna prescribe you with
scar reduction gel to ensure that.

292
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:05,188
You may still be feeling a stretching
or pulling sensation

293
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:08,900
near the incision area,
and that is perfectly normal.

294
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,445
I'm also gonna book an appointment for
you to see your doctor in two weeks,

295
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,031
just to make sure everything's
healing properly.

296
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,824
Good.

297
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,370
[inaudible whispering]

298
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,874
Miss Mason, would you please go
tell the family in the waiting room

299
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,210
their father's had a heart attack.

300
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,008
Residents, what do we know?

301
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,595
One of the most important parts of the
healing process is the relationship

302
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,806
the patient feels with their doctor.

303
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,059
A good, composed and confident
bedside manner can be the difference

304
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,980
between a frightened patient
and a calm and confident patient.

305
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,983
Assess what they need to hear
and then tell that to them

306
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,568
in a reassuring manner.
How did that go, Miss Mason?

307
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,697
- They were upset.
- Understandably so.

308
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,074
I want you to go back there
and tell them that he died.

309
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,701
[student chuckles]

310
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,250
Hone this skill, because it's something
you'll need perfected.

311
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:10,920
Especially by the time you have
to start delivering bad news.

312
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,215
All right, people, we have rounds to do.
Quick ten minute break,

313
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,509
then I expect to see everyone
back here bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

314
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,345
and ready to take on new patients.
Thank you.

315
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:22,223
[gasping, sobbing]

316
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,523
I'm very impressed with
what I've been seeing, Mary.

317
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:34,068
I can't wait to see how you perform
when you start cutting into people.

318
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,029
You're gonna be a great slasher.

319
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,614
- Pardon me?
- Sometimes we call surgeons slashers.

320
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,284
You must have heard that.
You do develop a grim sense of humour

321
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,661
when you cut into people
on a daily basis.

322
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,165
And the adrenaline rush you get
from slicing into a human being

323
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,543
may help you through
your most sleep-deprived days.

324
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,795
Works better than espresso.

325
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,133
I'm at the hospital doing
a residency programme

326
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,634
- with Dr. Walsh.
- [coughing over phone]

327
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,888
- [Nana] Dr. Grant?
- No, Dr. Walsh.

328
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:04,057
He's the resident surgeon
who's teaching us.

329
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,186
Oh, good. I caught you at a good time.

330
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,606
- How are you, sweetie?
- Um...

331
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:15,109
Nana, would you mind if I gave you
a call back when I get home?

332
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:19,489
OK, sweetheart. You just don't
worry about me, OK?

333
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,825
- [speaks foreign language]
- [responds in foreign language]

334
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:26,162
Can I help you? Beatress.

335
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,374
What are you doing here?

336
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,919
Oh. You said not to call.

337
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,880
Showing up is worse than calling.

338
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,674
By a lot. [forced chuckle]

339
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,761
- How did you find me?
- Oh, I just looked up the name

340
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,680
of your school on your resume,
and then I called your school to find out

341
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,101
where the hospital was at that you
were doing your residency.

342
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,312
And then I just decided to come here
and show up and wait.

343
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,648
- What is this?
- [giggles]

344
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,276
- You do know what it is, then.
- Mm-hm.

345
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,153
- OK.
- Ruby designed it for you special.

346
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,948
She wanted to say thank you.
She was gonna drop it off herself,

347
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:06,202
but I said I'd deliver it.
I know you don't want strange looks.

348
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,579
Yeah...

349
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,542
Well, tell her thank you for me.
Truly.

350
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:16,337
- She really didn't have to do that.
- Oh, she wanted to do it.

351
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,756
To say thank you.
You should check out her website,

352
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,426
she puts up all kinds
of new pictures.

353
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,306
[giggling]

354
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,351
I bet you're glad
Ruby didn't show up.

355
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,563
- Yeah. I'm gonna go now.
- OK.

356
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,566
If you ever want to get together
for coffee or something, sometime,

357
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,735
- just girls' night...
- OK. I'll keep that in mind.

358
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,904
- OK.
- OK.

359
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,865
My treat.

360
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,241
[indistinct whispering]

361
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,743
- Festivities. It's gonna be...
- Festivities.

362
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,834
I couldn't find any patients
needing surgery on the break,

363
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,421
- so I grabbed a coffee instead.
- Ah, surgeon humour.

364
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,549
I was honestly looking.
How was your break, Mary?

365
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:02,884
- Good.
- Good.

366
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:07,013
Mary, I'd like to talk to you about
something without the others around.

367
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,807
- What?
- Some of the surgeons

368
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,268
from the hospital are getting together
tonight for drinks.

369
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,521
We're wondering if you'd
be able to attend.

370
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:19,066
For drinks? With... other surgeons?

371
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,694
Yes, at Dr. Grant's home.
Do you have the address?

372
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,156
No. I don't have the address.

373
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,325
I'll email it to you.
You'll come then?

374
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,578
I would love to.
Does he know you're inviting me?

375
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,330
It was his idea.

376
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,166
Come around ten. We should have
everything at a good pace by then.

377
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,001
- OK.
- Good.

378
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,212
Come on, we have rounds to do.
Cunts and runts.

379
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,256
[humming indistinctly]

380
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,269
[keys tapping]

381
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,649
[soft typing]

382
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,748
[soft chuckle]

383
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,796
[rock music playing]

384
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,798
[slow electronic music playing]

385
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:15,016
- You must be Mary Mason.
- Good guess.

386
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,727
- Why don't you come in?
- Thank you.

387
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,482
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

388
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:38,998
- Here we are. Hm.
- Wow. It's beautiful.

389
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,876
I'll go get us some drinks.

390
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,045
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

391
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,976
- Mary Mason. [chuckles]
- Thank you.

392
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:03,105
- I feel like I know you from somewhere.
- What did you say your name was?

393
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,483
Have a drink. [laughs]

394
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:15,576
- Um, are you a surgeon at the hospital?
- I'm a fuckin' motherfucker.

395
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,287
- [laughing]
- [chuckles]

396
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:22,708
No, seriously, babe,
I cut people up for a living.

397
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,380
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
[loud laughter]

398
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,924
- Dr. Black, I see you've met Mary.
- Hi.

399
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,802
I'm done, Walsh.

400
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,888
- Enjoy the party, sweetie.
- Thank you.

401
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,433
Hi, Dr. Walsh.
It's so great to see you.

402
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,310
- How are you?
- Very well, Mary. Thank you.

403
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:45,231
It's so nice you were able to attend.
What a pretty dress.

404
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,526
- Things must be paying well.
- It was a gift from a friend.

405
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,569
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

406
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,155
Have some drinks.
Everyone's all over the place.

407
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,991
Some men are out in this area
using it as, I don't know,

408
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,662
some sort of a lobby. And everyone else
is in the other rooms.

409
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,414
I'll go let Dr. Grant
know that you're here.

410
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,873
Thank you.

411
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,681
Well, I hope you finished all your
studying before you came here.

412
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,100
Dr. Walsh runs us
pretty hard in rounds,

413
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,894
so if you don't learn to cram it all in,
you fall behind.

414
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,312
Mm-hm.

415
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,774
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

416
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,365
- Don't fuck up.
- I don't intend to.

417
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:40,161
- I've been working very hard.
- And?

418
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:44,039
- And I won't fuck up.
- No. Never.

419
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,626
Everything else is forgivable
if the work is good.

420
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,589
You mean, like, as a person?

421
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,550
I never... thought of it like that.

422
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,720
Isn't the work just as much
a part of yourself?

423
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,723
What do you think, Mary?

424
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,185
I don't really know.
[clearing throat]

425
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,062
You have to think for yourself, Mary.

426
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,648
No one is gonna hold your hand
through this life.

427
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:14,528
Everyone here is just
out for themselves.

428
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,074
So how are those turkeys coming along?

429
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:23,913
Quite well. It's really helping me
with my suturing technique.

430
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,832
Yeah. It's an old pro's secret.

431
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,293
Let me just take that for you, Mary.

432
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,421
Hope our party's matching up well
to the ones you usually attend.

433
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:37,384
I don't usually attend parties
with doctors and surgeons.

434
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,762
We do do things a little differently.

435
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,643
- He's kind of odd.
- Mm-hm.

436
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,103
Most microsurgeons are.

437
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,774
Did you know in his spare time he likes
to paint people being eaten

438
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,860
by different animals?
Usually a bear.

439
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,862
You're kidding.

440
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,406
Oh, no, I'm not.

441
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,452
I would never kid about something
as fucked up as that.

442
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,995
I hate people who
exaggerate their stories

443
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,623
just to make them sound
more interesting.

444
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:13,128
[distorted] So, Mary, I noticed that you
were doing better financially.

445
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,715
Nice new clothes, brand-new stethoscope.

446
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,386
I never thought I'd see you
at one of these.

447
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,140
- I'm sorry, what?
- Whoa, whoa...

448
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,563
- I don't feel good.
- Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

449
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,276
OK, OK. Maybe you just need to lay down
on your back for a moment.

450
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,570
Hm? Whoa, whoa.

451
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,617
- That would be good.
- There you go.

452
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,286
- No good.
- Oops.

453
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,955
Just keep going. There you go.

454
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,666
Lay down on a nice bed here,
you'll feel much better.

455
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:55,170
Take it easy, take it easy. OK.

456
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,923
Let's go this way, come on. Come on.

457
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:01,176
Just turn yourself around.
There you go.

458
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,012
- Lay down.

to have something against him.

00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,708
but you don't scare me, Dr. Mason.

620
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,794
- The thugs at Bourbon are scared of me?
- Mm-hm.

621
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,462
Even Billy.

622
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,465
I must be a monster.

623
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,301
You're not. You're a creative artist.

624
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,638
And no one ever understands artists
and their work.

625
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,640
Usually you have to wait
till you're dead.

626
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,143
Then everyone goes around saying
what geniuses you are.

627
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,314
Ruby's been out of town
for a little while.

628
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,650
But she wanted me
to give you something.

629
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,988
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

630
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:10,992
She gets bored very easily.
She's a very strange girl.

631
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,422
I didn't know Ruby had a boyfriend.

632
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,468
She has many.

633
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,636
That's of her husband.

634
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,270
I found what I was looking for.

635
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:43,191
- What is it?
- It's your Sistine Chapel.

636
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,276
Looks like something that could have
been sent over email.

637
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:49,197
Hm. They run the largest body modification
website in the world.

638
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,324
- Abstrakt.me.
- I've heard of it.

639
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,869
'Course you have. They also have
a magazine by the same name

640
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,623
and they feature all kind
of strange and wonderful things.

641
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:03,377
They want you to work on them ever
since they saw the work you did on Ruby.

642
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,380
- They want me to work on them?
- Mm-hm.

643
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,883
They're gonna be in town for one week.

644
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:13,054
I'm sure Billy wouldn't mind you
using his office to meet with them.

645
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,352
- Thanks for this, Beatress.
- [chuckles] Good luck.

646
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,448
[pop music playing inside]

647
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,585
[music continues]

648
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:07,358
- [flesh tearing]
- [screaming]

649
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,860
[screaming]

650
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,925
May I offer either one of you a drink?

651
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:37,555
- [heavy accent] Candy apple martini.
- [heavy accent] I'll have the same.

652
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:42,059
- Nothing for me, thanks.
- Oh, come on. Don't make us drink alone.

653
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,187
I'll have the same.

654
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,410
Oh. Ruby. Very pleased
with how she worked out.

655
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:02,330
Is that how you found me?
Through her website?

656
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:05,750
How we first heard about your work, ja.

657
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:10,379
Finding you was a different matter.
Your work is easily accessible online.

658
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:14,008
You might say you're somewhat
of a celebrity.

659
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:16,260
Bloody Mary.

660
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,598
Bloody Mary? That's online?

661
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:23,684
Don't worry. We would
never dream of betraying our

662
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:28,856
doctor-patient confidentiality
by giving out your full name.

663
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:31,692
But we will be asked
about our procedure.

664
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,819
People will have lots of questions.

665
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,988
You should get
a website for your work.

666
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,282
We can take care of that for you.

667
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:46,874
Consider it a thank you gift
for agreeing to see us.

668
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:52,755
Do you feel... connected
to anyone, Mary?

669
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:56,008
No.

670
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,803
Most people attracted
to this culture don't.

671
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:04,058
At least you can feel
connected to yourself.

672
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:07,895
I guess everybody feels
connected to themselves.

673
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,231
Ja und nein.

674
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:16,112
I have the benefit of being connected
to myself...

675
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,408
...und my sister.

676
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:26,414
But I know that connection may
or may not last beyond this existence.

677
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:30,126
We never want to lose
that connection, Mary.

678
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:34,755
Maybe we'll die together and face
whatever's to come together.

679
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,759
Maybe not.

680
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:42,596
But should anything ever happen
to one of us before the other,

681
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,266
we never want to lose that connection.

682
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:48,894
We want you to take off our left arms
and exchange them with one another.

683
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,273
That shouldn't be a problem.

684
01:00:56,737 --> 01:01:02,742
We also want you to strengthen
our connection with ourself.

685
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:07,788
It's a bit more complicated
than an appendage exchange

686
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:12,585
and somewhat difficult to put
into words, but we feel that image

687
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:18,132
best describes the
reflection we... desire.

688
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:22,136
Of course, the amount you need
for compensation is not an issue.

689
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,140
How's Friday?

690
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:48,788
- What's that?
- It's my blueprint.

691
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:59,006
- Goddamn waste of time, if you ask me.
- I didn't.

692
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,842
Thank you for letting me use your club.

693
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,804
Don't mention it.

694
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,894
I need help.

695
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,482
You ain't kidding.

696
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,110
It's a big job, they need to be
operated on at the same time.

697
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,195
Do you know anyone that's good?

698
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,493
[sighing]
I know someone that's just awful.

699
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,286
Who owes me.

700
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,251
Thanks.

701
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,549
Don't mention it.

702
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,678
[clattering]

703
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,394
[heavy accent] Yeah, that's good.

704
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:58,941
When you wake up,
you will be connected to yourselves,

705
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,860
and to each other.

706
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,404
Thank you, doctor.

707
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:10,494
Now, I would like you...

708
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:14,748
...to close your eyes, breathe deeply,
count backwards from 100.

709
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,168
- [air hissing]
- Just relax,

710
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,920
and it should take effect immediately.

711
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,641
[speaking foreign language]

712
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:36,604
What's that?

713
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,023
- Twins, ja?
- Yeah.

714
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,821

[moaning whimper]

721
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,264
Hello, Dr. Grant.

722
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,643
It's been a while.

723
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,520
Mm-hm.

724
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,899
Oh, what's that?

725
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:30,319
[chuckling] I couldn't hear you
'cause your mouth is sewn shut.

726
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,364
I know.

727
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:38,661
Yes, you must be terribly uncomfortable.

728
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:42,665
We're just gonna take a few pictures
of you today.

729
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,294
For my website. Mm-hm.

730
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,465
For my brand-new website.

731
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:55,177
Because everyone needs
their own website these days.

732
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:59,682
And they can scan these or something.

733
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:01,475
[sobbing whimper]

734
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,144
That one probably could
have been done better.

735
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:07,147
[singsong] Looks a little bit infected.

736
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:12,236
Well...

737
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:18,117
- That one healed nicely, though.
- [whimpering]

738
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:21,620
You really should have seen it tonight.

739
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:25,416
My work is getting
consistently stronger.

740
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,461
Comparatively to the work
I've done on you.

741
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:33,340
It's rather crude, but then again...

742
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:34,842
[camera clicking]

743
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:39,513
...you were never something I was
excessively proud of before, were you?

744
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,562
Oh, really.

745
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,939
So unattractive.

746
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:54,361
So... [clearing throat]

[sobbing]

748
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:05,122
What we're going to do with you today?

749
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:12,921
I have been asking myself
why your right ear still exists.

750
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:17,718
Hm...

751
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:21,013
That one's not very good.

752
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:27,227
Maybe redo that one
on the other side.

753
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,815
Practice makes perfect,
and surgeons...

...or whatever it is I do now,

755
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,488
can't afford to make mistakes.

- [sobbing]
- Hm...

[whispers] That definitely needs to go.

What the fuck?!

760
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,933
It's OK, dude.

761
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,353
I'm gonna get you down, OK?
I'm gonna call the fucking cops.

762
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:13,482
- OK.
- [sobbing]

763
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:17,778
Fuck!

764
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,948
[screaming] Fuck!

Hey, Lance, can you give
Mary a call, please? I missed it.

[slow music playing]

776
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:11,201
I figured you hadn't eaten.

777
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,787
So I picked up a few options.

778
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,998
Not sure what you're in the mood for.

779
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:34,599
You upset?

780
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,603
Of course I'm upset.

781
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,313
About the two dead guys?

782
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:42,941
It affects me.

783
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:52,284
A few years back, this fucking kid
breaks into my mom's house.

784
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:56,955
One of those B and E motherfuckers.

785
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:01,418
She hears somebody downstairs, and...

786
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:05,505
...she grabs her umbrella,
and heads on down.

787
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:11,136
What the fuck she thought she was gonna
do with that umbrella I'll never know.

788
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:15,682
But she heads downstairs,

789
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:19,352
and he grabs the fucking umbrella,

790
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,856
and beats the fucking shit
out of her with the goddamn thing.

791
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,527
Punctures her eye socket,

792
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,946
fractures her jaw,

793
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,324
breaks three of her ribs.

794
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:36,620
And the little fucker kicks her cell
phone just far enough out of her reach

795
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:39,664
so she can't call for help.

796
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,875
And then he leaves her there to die.

797
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,003
They find her three days later.

798
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:48,381
She's in the hospital
for four fucking months.

799
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,926
What I wouldn't give
to have known you back then

800
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:53,762
when I found that little motherfucker.

801
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,852
Don't you ever
devalue what you do, Mary.

802
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,729
You make sure they deserve it,

803
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:06,399
and don't waste a minute of your time
thinking about them after you're done.

804
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:15,283
Is that a milkshake?

805
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,911
I got chocolate and vanilla.

806
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:22,541
You don't seem like a vanilla.

807
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,638
Thank you, Lance.

808
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,562
It's really good.

809
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:59,911
Good morning, ladies.

810
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:30,442
[Mary] This is about you and how you
can best express yourself to the world.

811
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,236
There are numerous procedures
outlined here, but please,

812
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:35,197
don't feel limited to them.

813
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:39,242
The most important thing is that
you're happy and comfortable

814
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,328
with yourself.

815
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,872
I know you may have come up against
some harsh criticisms

816
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,624
and judgments in the past.

817
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,419
But you can feel confident that you're
free of all such notions here.

818
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:52,881
I can assure you that you'll
receive your procedure

819
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,675
in a safe and supportive environment.

820
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,928
And at a reasonable cost.

821
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:01,306
It is difficult to put a price
on feeling complete, though.

822
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:02,432
Isn't it?

823
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,434
You know what I'd really like
to have done next, Mary?

824
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:07,896
Pull your pants up now.

825
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:11,691
I will give you some antibiotics.
It should clear that up for you.

826
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:14,110
I thought when you said "no sex"
it meant no sex.

827
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:17,364
- Not masturbation as well.
- Well, you would think common sense

828
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,699
would tell you that masturbating
during the healing process

829
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:22,869
could result in some tearing of skin.
But...

830
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:25,372
...guess I wasn't clear enough with you,
penis guy.

831
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,415
[phone ringing]

832
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,251
Excuse me.

833
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:32,629
- Hello?
- Hi, Mary? It's Detective Dolor.

834
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:35,799
I was wondering if I could come up
for a bit and have a word.

835
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,218
Of course.

836
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:42,013
You need to leave right now. Yep.
Gotta go. Thanks. Oh!

837
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,350
- Pills, jacket on you.
- Thanks. So if I take these,

838
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:46,685
- it'll clear up?
- Yep. Mm-hm.

839
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,896
Absolutely clear it up.
Just leave it alone.

840
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:52,565
- OK.
- OK. Out you go.

841
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:57,362
- I'll call you when I'm healed up.
- OK.

842
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:20,093
[chirping]

[clearing throat]

845
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:35,942
Hello, detective.

846
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,821
Was that your boyfriend?

847
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,448
One of them.

848
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:46,619
Lovely new place.

849
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:49,456
It's much nicer an area
than the last place, eh?

850
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:51,333
I like it.

851
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:55,628
Can I get you a glass of water
or something?

852
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,297
Sure. Yeah.

853
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,551
So did they find Dr. Grant yet?

854
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:03,803
Not exactly, no.

855
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,932
Now we can't seem to locate
Dr. Walsh either.

856
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,729
Really? That's awful.

857
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:15,190
Did he have anything to do
with Dr. Grant's disappearance?

858
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:18,360
No, but they are related.

859
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,571
You see, these two doctors were involved
in hosting sex parties.

860
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:24,407
The girls involved were drugged
and videotaped.

861
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:28,453
- Did you know about this?
- No.

862
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,290
I think you do, Mary.

863
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,959
All those girls Dr. Walsh mentioned
were on the tapes.

864
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,800
Was I on the tape?

865
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,229
No.

866
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:56,856
But I do think you were
at one of those parties.

867
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:02,529
And I think Dr. Grant is a monster,
and that he really hurt you.

868
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:07,575
You're the victim here, Mary,
but I can't help you at all

869
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,036
if you won't let me.

870
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:12,497
- Come on. How close am I?
- You know what?

871
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:16,209
There's a terrible chip in that glass.
I'm gonna get you a new one.

872
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:21,047
You just wanna run away from it all,
don't you, Mary?

873
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:25,009
Believe me, I do understand you,
more than you know.

874
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:33,393
You know, I really don't feel
comfortable talking about this.

875
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:36,479
But if anything changes,
I'll be sure to let you know.

876
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,693
I don't want you to be
another sad story, Mary.

877
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:44,737
You really think about it, yeah?

878
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,366
Next time I see you,
I wanna know,

879
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:50,869
I'm gonna to find out
what's really going on with you.

880
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:54,581
There's really not all that much to me.

881
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:58,251
I find that hard to believe, Mary.

882
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,421
Thank you for your hospitality.

883
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,841
Goodbye, Mary.

884
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,824
Hey, Nana.

885
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:32,660

These new girls, you know?

891
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:37,517
They don't even bring resumes or anything.

892
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:39,310
You got a minute?

893
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:43,648
Yeah, Mary. For you
I have several minutes. Fuck!

894
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:51,698
You OK?

895
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:56,119
Dr. Walsh is missing.

896
01:21:56,287 --> 01:21:59,539
You wouldn't happen to know anything
about that, would you?

897
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:02,875
No, I don't know anything about that.

898
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:06,504
All right, I might have had
something to do with it.

899
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,550
But I had the best of intentions, Mary,
I swear.

No.

902
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:44,626
You want me take care of that for you?
I owe you one.

Uh...

904
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:49,672
- No, we're just gonna scare him.
- I can scare him.

905
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,887
I'll let you know if I need backup.

Excuse me. I need to powder my nose.

939
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:08,319
she's not coming in.

940
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:11,197
I would have preferred a little closure,
but hey, you know?

941
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:14,033
That's dancers for you.

942
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:19,538
I didn't think
she had the balls for that.

943
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:24,794
But guess people can surprise you.

944
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:29,673
You ever been to LA?

945
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:35,721
- No.
- You ever wanted to go to LA?

946
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:39,934
I was thinking I need a change of pace,
you know? Just...

947
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:43,729
...take a couple weeks off
and drive down.

948
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:51,612
So, what you do is you drive
from Seattle to Redding.

949
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,698
Stay the night. The second day,

950
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,992
you drive on into LA.

951
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,869
You don't have to kill yourself
on the second day, you know.

952
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:01,789
You know, you could stop in Sacramento.

953
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:05,376
On the second day, stay there
the night, and the third day...

954
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:09,380
Show up in LA, nice and well rested.

955
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:13,092
Sounds like it'd be a lot easier
to take a plane.

956
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:15,719
Oh, no.

957
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,849
No, Mary, driving down's half the trip.

958
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:25,187
You should come with me.
We could...

959
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:29,525
We could leave tomorrow.
Or tonight.

960
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,781
I'll think about it.

961
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:40,494
Maybe I need a change of pace too.

962
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,165
Thanks for the drink.

963
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,961
Uh, call me. Let me know.

964
01:31:49,129 --> 01:31:51,255
I will.

965
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:53,132
Bye, Billy.

966
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:56,635
Goodbye, Mary.

967
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:00,806
[phone ringing]

968
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:02,474
[silencing phone]

969
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:08,105
[phone ringing]

970
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:10,816
[silencing phone]

971
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:31,837
[phone ringing]

972
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:38,677
Yes, Beatress?
You quit the club, I know. What?

973
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,304
[Beatress crying]
He wanted to know...

974
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:44,850
- Excuse me, I can't hear you.
- [Beatress sobbing]

975
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:46,018
Beatress?

976
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:48,103
[gasping]

977
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,232
[muttering] I'm sorry, Mary.

978
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,943
[whispers] Ruby's husband.

979
01:32:55,362 --> 01:32:58,364
He wanted to know who you were,

980
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:00,449
and where you lived.

981
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,619
I didn't wanna tell him.

982
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:07,957
He forced me.

983
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:10,626
He started to hurt me.

984
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:15,589
[gasping] I'm so sorry, Mary.

985
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,384
[gasping]

986
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,557
[grunting]

987
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,568
[voice echoing]
I didn't know Ruby had a boyfriend.

988
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:43,492
[spitting, gasping]

989
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,911
[panting]

990
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:54,378
[gasping]

991
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:03,178
[classical music playing]

992
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,725
[clattering]

993
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,832
[gasping]

994
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:02,423
[classical music continues, no audio]
