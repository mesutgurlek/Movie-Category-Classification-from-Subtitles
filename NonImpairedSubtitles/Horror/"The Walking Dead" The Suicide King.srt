Hurry!

00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,095
You guys, go ahead.
I'm gonna lay down some cover fire.

I'll be right behind you.

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,513
You wanted your brother.

- You can't go.

12

Let me go.
Philip.

13
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,167
- Stay out of this.
- He's my friend.

14
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:20,536
It's not up to me anymore.

15
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:23,389
- The people have spoken.
- What?

16
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,375
I asked you where
your loyalties lie.

<i>Well, prove it.</i>

Prove it to us all.

- Brother against brother.

You really think this
asshole's gonna let you go?

Just follow my lead,

Now we got a problem here.
I need you to back up.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

- He tried to kill me!

- If it wasn't for him--
- He helped us get out of there.

Yeah, right after he beat
the shit out of you.

- Enough!

you've gone native, brother.

No more than you hanging out
with that psycho back there.

Oh, yeah, man.
He is a charmer, I got to tell you that.

90

Been putting the wood
to your girlfriend Andrea.

Andrea's in Woodbury?

Right next to the Governor.

Merle:
Yep, she does.

98
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:54,029
Her and blondie
spent all winter

Mm-mmm-mmm.
Yeah.

101
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,270
My Nubian queen here
had two pet walkers.

No arms, cut off the jaws,

- Kind of ironic now that
I think about it. - Shut up, bro.

Hey, man, we snagged them
out of the woods.

106
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:15,517
Andrea was close to dying.

Oh, man, look at this.
Pathetic.

- Merle, shut up!

Shut up yourself!
Bunch of pussies you roll--

Barely a week.

124

To be honest, we never thought
we'd see another baby.

I'm sorry.

Man, you people have
been through the mill.

Haven't we all?

133

It's only getting
worse out there.

less like the living.

You're the only decent folks
we've come across.

You've been out there
all this time?

Our neighbor Jerry, he was one
of those survivalist nuts.

140
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,246
Everybody on the block
thought he was crazy.

Always preparing
for the end of the world.

- Who knew?
- Jerry knew.

143
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:31,286
He had a bunker under
his shed in the backyard.

144
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:34,957
Sasha and I stayed there
until we ran out of supplies.

145
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,260
Allen and Ben were the first
two people we ran into

146
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:40,229
when we finally crawled
up out of that hole

147

around Jacksonville.

148
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:43,866

she, uh...

153
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:04,052
We'll see that she has
a proper burial.

154
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:07,589
I appreciate you
taking care of us.

155
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,525
For a while, we didn't know
who we were dealing with.

156
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,528
Neither did we.

157
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,597
We've had our problems
with people.

158
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:17,632
I must be the first
brother in history

Like I said, we have
a much larger group.

164
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,389
A close-knit group.

165
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:45,093
I wouldn't get
too comfortable here.

166
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:49,831
We wouldn't be a problem.

167
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:51,833
It's not up to me.

168
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:54,937
Then who?

169
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:59,707
Please, you can see
what kind of people we are.

170
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:06,181
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

171
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,188
Rick:
<i>It won't work.</i>

172
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:15,657
- Daryl: It's gotta.
- It'll stir things up.

173
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:18,226
Look, the Governor is probably on
the way to the prison right now.

174
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:20,395
Merle knows how he thinks
and we could use the muscle.

175
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:22,230
I'm not having him
at the prison.

176
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:24,599
Do you really want him sleeping in the
same cell block as Carol or Beth?

177
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,268
- He ain't a rapist.
- Well, his buddy is.

178
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,170
They ain't buddies no more.
Not after last night.

179
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,838
There's no way
Merle's gonna live there

180
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,873
without putting everyone
at each other's throats.

181
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:33,808
So you're gonna cut Merle loose and
bring the last samurai home with us?

182
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,344
She's not coming back.

183
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,579
She's not in a state
to be on her own.

184
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,582
- She did bring you guys to us.
- And then ditched us.

185
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,385
<i>- At least let my dad stitch her up.</i>
<i>- She's too unpredictable.</i>

186
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:46,121
That's right.
We don't know who she is.

187
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:48,190
But Merle, Merle's blood.

188
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,359
No, Merle is your blood.

189
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,760
My blood, my family
is standing right here

190
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,562
<i>and waiting for us</i>
<i>back at the prison.</i>

191
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:56,798
And you're part of that family.

192
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:01,269
But he's not.
He's not.

193
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:05,340
Man, y'all don't know.

194
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,579
Fine.
We'll fend for ourselves.

195
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,415
That's not what I was saying.

196
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,250
No him, no me.

197
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,952
Daryl, you don't
have to do that.

198
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:20,288
It was always Merle
and I before this.

199
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:22,524
- Maggie: <i>Don't.</i>
<i>- Glenn: You serious?</i>

200
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,394
- You're just gonna leave like that?
- You'd do the same thing.

201
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,595
What do you want us
to tell Carol?

202
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:29,731
She'll understand.

203
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,705
Say good-bye
to your pop for me.

204
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:39,841
Daryl, are you serious?
Daryl!

205
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,245
Hey. Hey.

206
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:45,280
There's got to be another way.

207
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:49,784
Don't ask me to leave him.

208
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,753
I already did that once.

209
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,893
We started something
last night.

210
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:01,696
You realize that, huh?

211
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:04,699
No him, no me.
That's all I can say.

212
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:11,839
Take care of yourself.

213
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,976
Take care of
lil ass-kicker.

214
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:16,644
Carl.

215
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:21,116
He's one tough kid.

216
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:29,924
Daryl!

217
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,327
Come on, bro.

218
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,178
We patch you up
and then you are gone.

219
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,176
Where'd they say
we could bury her?

220
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,379
Back of the field
near the other graves.

221
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,882
Hey.
Wait a minute.

222
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,384
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

223
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,185
Losing my grip here.

224
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,655
Come on, put her down.

225
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,127
Okay.

226
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,345
Golden opportunity.

227
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,247
For what?

228
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,949
Little kid and a woman.

229
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,220
Ask them for a hand,
get a hold of those weapons.

230
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,724
- What? - We do it quick, they'll
never know what hit them.

231
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,894
- No. Whoa, whoa.
- We're out here to bury Donna.

232
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,229
And we will, after.

233
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,499
- Shut up.
- Look at this place.

234
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,333
It's secure.

235
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,770
- These are good people.
- This will be easy.

236
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,773
A little kid, a woman, a girl
and a one-legged old man.

237
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:16,442
Don't forget about the convict.

238
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,677
You gonna smash the
baby's head with a rock?

239
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,079
- What is your problem?
- How about a little common decency?

240
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,382
This isn't what we do.

241
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,485
Allen: You're living
in the past, Ty.

242
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,621
So are you.
This is survival

243
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,255
of the fittest,
plain and simple.

244
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,025
In here we live, out there we die.
<i>( gate opens )</i>

245
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,461
And I am not waiting around
for the rest of their group

246
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,496
to roll in here and throw
us out on our asses.

247
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,466
- Not a chance.
- How do you know that's gonna happen?

248
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,502
Got some tools for you.

249
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,143
It's much appreciated.

250
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,211
Yeah, we'll take it from here.

251
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,049
You don't need no help
with the body?

252
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,418
No, we'll manage.

253
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,987
Let us know if you
need anything else.

254
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,956
Thank you.

255
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,101
<i>( gate shuts )</i>

256
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,326
Get the brakes.

( snarling )

258
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,501
I got it.

( grunting )

260
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,330
You didn't kill him.

261
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:24,003
That's not why we went back.

262
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:27,907
No. That's right.
You went back for Daryl.

263
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:31,410
And now he's gone again
and the Governor is still alive.

264
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,779
- Daryl was the priority.
- I should have been there with you.

265
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,782
- You were in no condition.
- <i>But my girlfriend was?</i>

266
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,352
- Glenn, this isn't about us.
- I should have been there.

267
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,055
Hey, hey, you didn't come back with
us 'cause you could barely walk.

268
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,090
- What about her?
- What about me?

269
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,026
- Do you know what he did to her?!
- Leave it alone!

270
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:49,662
- Do you know?
- Let's go.

271
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:03,141
After all that effort,
all the risk we took,

272
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,578
Daryl just takes off
with Merle?

273
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,881
Well, he had his reasons.

274
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,850
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that, Rick.

275
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,553
Doesn't change the fact that
we're up to our necks in shit.

276
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:17,690
You want me to turn the car
around, beg him to come back?

277
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,558
Throw down a welcome mat
for Merle?

278
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,994
This is the hand
we've been dealt!

279
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,964
Let's just get this out
of here and get back.

280
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:28,667
Get some rest.
We can talk it out there.

No, you guys do all the
talking you want. I'm done.

Nine.

Stevens has it covered.

So where is he?

00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,892
- In his apartment.
- And?

288
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:57,062
He wouldn't open the door.
Said he was in the middle of something.

Oh, my God.

325

Help him.

326
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:56,815
Somebody, please?

00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:40,304
It's so quiet.

333
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:47,545
It's easy to forget how loud
the world used to be.

( laughs )

335
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:52,717
I used to complain
about it all the time.

336
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:55,185
Traffic, construction,

337
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:58,456
car alarms, noise pollution.

338
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:00,424
Oh.

339
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:05,463
What I wouldn't give
for the sweet sound

340
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,465
of a jumbo jet.

341
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:12,803
It'd be even sweeter
if we were all on it.

342
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:22,713
Your mom was proud of you.

343
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:29,687
For what?
Being mean to her?

344
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:33,457
No, you can't think about that.

345
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,893
It's all I think about.

It's them.
Hurry.

349
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:59,883
- Drive 'em up. I'll meet you there.

350
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:02,052
Thank God.

351
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:08,826
- Where's Hershel?
- He's in the cell block.

352
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:10,561
Carol:
<i>Where's Daryl?</i>

353
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,064
It's all right.
He's alive.

354
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,935
We ran into his brother.

355
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,572
They went off.

356
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:26,644
He left?

357
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:33,317
Daryl left?

358
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:36,286
He's gone?

359
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:40,624
Is he coming back?

360
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,168
- Hey.
- Gone?

361
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:54,638
And Oscar?

362
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:58,442
No.

<i>( door opens )</i>
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

364
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:31,442
What the hell was that?

365
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:34,244
You put a round in a man's head
in front of all those people

366
00:25:34,245 --> 00:25:36,346
and just take off?

367
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:38,916
- You have to talk to them.
- Why?

368
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:42,386
They're panicking. They were ready
to charge through those gates.

369
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:44,121
So let 'em.

370
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,324
Those people won't last a day.

371
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,259
Those people have had it easy.

372
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,796
Barbecues and picnics.
That ends now.

373
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:54,231
Don't blame them for
the mess that you created.

374
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:55,900
They're scared.

375
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:58,035
Well, I'm through
holding their hands.

376
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:01,305
We're at war.
I should have seen that.

377
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:05,443
So why was Daryl here?

378
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:07,511
Was he part of the assault?

379
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,915
Why?
Why would he do that?

380
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,850
He came for his friends.

381
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,985
The other people you know.

382
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:17,087
Glenn and Maggie.

383
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:19,356
Merle scooped them up
on the run.

384
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:22,827
Was holding them to find out
where his brother was.

385
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:28,365
My-- my friends are still alive
and we're shooting at each other?

386
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:29,934
You're trying to execute them?

387
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:32,102
Your friends killed
six good people.

388
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:34,371
Crowley, Tim, Gargulio,

389
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:36,674
Eisenberg, Bob Adams.

390
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,375
Haley.

391
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:42,513
That man out there,
Rich Foster, he makes seven.

392
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:44,915
So that's what
your friends did.

393
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:48,752
Why didn't you
tell me they were here?

394
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:51,321
You kept that from me
while we were...

395
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:57,628
You're just a visitor here.

396
00:26:57,629 --> 00:26:59,897
Just passing through.

397
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:02,432
So why should I tell you?

398
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:09,473
Don't do that.

399
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:12,376
Don't drive me out.
Not now.

400
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:13,978
( knocks ) What is it?

401
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:16,614
The whole town
is out on the street.

402
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:18,482
It could get ugly again.

403
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:34,431
Take your sister inside.

404
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:50,414
Go on.

405
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,821
You came through, like always.

406
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,026
Sounds like we have
a new problem on our hands.

407
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:04,227
- Yeah.
- You get a good look at him?

408
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:10,500
He had Daryl and Merle
pitted against each other.

409
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:14,337
A crowd cheering for them
to fight to the death.

410
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:18,375
What kind of a sick mind
does that?

411
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:21,211
The kind this world creates.

412
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:26,750
What's wrong?
The baby?

413
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:28,786
No, the baby, she's healthy.

414
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:32,189
Eats like a horse,
sleeps like a rock.

415
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,524
So what is it?

<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

a chatterbox, is he?

418
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:13,430
Be patient.

419
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:16,566
When he's ready,
let me do the talking.

420
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:28,045
She kind of has Lori's eyes.

421
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,280
Don't you think?

Milton:
Everyone, if I could--

00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:12,005
if I could have your attention.

427
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:15,409
- Everyone.
- All right, everybody shut up!

428
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,545
Thank you.

429
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:19,847
The biters on the perimeter
have been dispatched.

- The fences have been repaired.
- For now.

Where's the Governor?
( crowd murmuring )

432
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:28,188
His-- his condition is...

00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:29,690
<i>unsteady.</i>

434
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,359
The wound he suffered--

- Our friends were killed, man.
- He shot Richard.

438
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:43,303
You're right, Karen.
You're right.

439
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:46,574
Every one of us has suffered.

440
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:49,877
We don't even have
funerals anymore because

441
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:52,380
the death never stops.

442

<i>We're never gonna be the same.</i>

<i>Ever.</i>

444
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:03,591
So what do we do?

445
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:07,395
We dig deep and we find
the strength to carry on.

446
00:31:08,663 --> 00:31:11,298
We work together
and we rebuild.

447
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,801
Not just the fences,

448
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:17,070
the gates, the community,

449
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:19,640
<i>but ourselves.</i>

<i>they will write about Woodbury.</i>

00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:29,884
- <i>Yeah, they will.</i>
<i>- Woodbury.</i>

455
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:32,887
We persevered.
( all agreeing )

You've got a knack for that.

459
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:02,917
Just trying to do my part.

460
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:06,119
Sophia used to wake
the neighbors.

461
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,956
3:00 AM.
Like clockwork.

462
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:14,695
Ed stayed at a friend's most
nights till she calmed down.

463
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:20,835
I always wanted a child.

464
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:28,843
She wouldn't have made it
if Daryl hadn't been here.

465
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:31,812
He couldn't stand
to lose anyone else.

466
00:32:31,813 --> 00:32:34,014
Sounds like him.

467
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,651
I don't see why
he had to leave.

468
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:39,653
Merle sounds like a jerk.

469
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:44,157
Men like Merle
get into your head.

470
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:48,562
Make you feel like
you deserve the abuse.

471
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:52,132
Even for Daryl?

472
00:32:55,003 --> 00:32:57,638
I'm hardly the woman
I was a year ago,

473
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:59,540
but if Ed walked through
that door right now

474
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,375
breathing and told me
to go with him,

475
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:03,744
I'd like to think
I'd tell him to go to hell.

476
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:08,448
You would.

477
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,486
It doesn't matter.

478
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:18,025
We're weak without him.

479
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:20,528
We'll get through this, too.

480
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,431
Tyreese and his friends
seem capable.

481
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:28,335
I'm pissed at him for leaving.

482
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:30,871
Don't be.

483
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:34,008
Daryl has his code.

484
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:36,343
This world needs men like that.

485
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:41,381
( Judith crying ) ( chuckles )

486
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:45,786
Oh. Hello.

487
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:51,592
- There.
- She fits perfect.

488
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:53,093
Yeah.

489
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:55,596
Wait.
You cozy in there?

490
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:57,598
Yes.

491
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:06,840
You got worked over good.

492
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:10,110
Surprised no bones were broken.

493
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:12,546
It's courtesy
of Daryl's brother.

494
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:32,399
You two all right?

495
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:41,408
Thanks for looking out for her.

496
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,644
If anything...

497
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:50,084
I'll go check on her.
You need something else?

498
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:54,154
Okay.

499
00:35:00,662 --> 00:35:03,097
Same thing goes for you.

500
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:07,034
If anything worse than this
had happened to you...

501
00:35:10,304 --> 00:35:12,840
You're like my own son, Glenn.

502
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:30,557
<i>You got something</i>
<i>needs looking at?</i>

503
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,294
Is Glenn all right?

504
00:35:37,331 --> 00:35:39,800
Go see.

505
00:35:57,618 --> 00:36:00,754
You two seem to be
holding something back.

506
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:05,726
You want to tell me
what happened?

507
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:17,171
I rest easy knowing
you can handle yourself.

508
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:21,942
You've got
your mother's spirit.

509
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:24,778
And her stubbornness.

510
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:32,452
You hungry?

511
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:35,789
No.

512
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,628
Hey.

513
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:47,267
Don't disappear on me.

514
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:14,557
She's out like a light.

515
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:17,493
Must be days since she slept.

516
00:37:20,764 --> 00:37:23,032
You look pretty shot yourself.

517
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,001
How long before she can travel?

518
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:26,535
Have to keep an eye on her.

519
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,372
Pretty sure she has
a concussion.

520
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:32,041
Couple of days if she's up.

521
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:44,820
Whenever Tomas went off,

522
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:47,991
Oscar always stood up
for me, you know?

523
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:52,061
He was my friend.

524
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,530
He went out fighting.

525
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,968
So what now?

526
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:01,404
You think the Governor
will retaliate?

527
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,706
- Maggie: Yes.
- Glenn: Let him try.

528
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:05,508
Sounds like he's got
a whole town.

529
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:07,543
We're outnumbered
and outgunned.

530
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:09,745
We could use
some reinforcements.

531
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:26,396
<i>( door opens )</i>

532
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,375
I'm Tyreese.

533
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:46,549
Sasha, Allen, Ben.

534
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,953
How'd you get in?

535
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,756
Fire damage to the administrative
part of the prison.

536
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:55,491
Wall's down.

537
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,927
That side's completely
overrun with walkers.

538
00:38:57,928 --> 00:38:59,495
How'd you get this far?

539
00:38:59,496 --> 00:39:02,898
We didn't.
We lost our friend Donna.

540
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:04,934
Carl: They were lost
in the gyms.

541
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:07,836
- You brought them here?
- Hershel: <i>He had no choice.</i>

542
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,510
I'm sorry about your friend.

543
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:16,946
We know what that's like.

544
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:19,115
Hershel said you could
use some extra hands.

545
00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:21,584
We're no stranger to hard work.

546
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:24,720
We'll go out and get our own
food, stay out of your hair.

547
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:27,290
You got a problem with another
group, we'll help with that, too.

548
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,992
Anything to contribute.

549
00:39:34,764 --> 00:39:36,599
No.

550
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,335
Sasha:
<i>Please.</i>

551
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,504
It's like "10 Little
Indians" out there.

552
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:43,906
It's just us now.

553
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,610
No.

554
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:49,678
Hershel:
<i>Let's talk about this.</i>

555
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,048
- We can't just keep--
- We've been through this.

556
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:56,719
With Tomas, Andrew.
Look what happened.

557
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,389
- Carol: Axel and Oscar weren't like them.
- And where's Oscar now?

558
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:11,400
I can't be responsible.

559
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:15,204
You turn us out,
you are responsible.

560
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,340
Hershel: <i>Rick.</i>

561
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:23,846
You've done so much for us.

562
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:26,649
I appreciate that.
We all do.

563
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,917
We owe you our lives.

564
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:31,920
We've done everything you asked

565
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:34,524
without question.

566
00:40:34,525 --> 00:40:38,827
And I'm telling you,
you're wrong on this.

567
00:40:38,828 --> 00:40:42,331
You've got to start
giving people a chance.

568
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:09,158
( sighs )

569
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:11,227
Yeah.

570
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:27,710
No, no.

571
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:30,713
No, no, no, no.

572
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:34,917
No.

573
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:38,688
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

574
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:44,893
Why are you here?

575
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:47,530
- What do you want from me?
- Dad?

576
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:50,666
Why are you-- no.

577
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,775
I can't help you.
Get out!

578
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:02,211
- Tyreese: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Get-- get out!

579
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:04,447
Tyreese: Hey, come on.
Whoa, it's all good.

580
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:06,515
Sasha:
What are you doing?

581
00:42:06,516 --> 00:42:08,317
Hey, easy, Rick.
There's no need to--

582
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,220
You don't belong here!
Get out! Please!

583
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:13,055
- Relax, brother. Relax.
- Get out! Get out!

584
00:42:13,056 --> 00:42:15,090
Tyreese: <i>We'll leave.</i>
<i>We're going.</i>

585
00:42:15,091 --> 00:42:16,925
Okay? Ain't nobody
got to get shot here.

586
00:42:16,926 --> 00:42:18,994
- We're going.
- What are you doing here?!

587
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:22,164
- Okay, we're going.
- Just go! Go! Go!

588
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,766
Come on, come on.

589
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:44,787
