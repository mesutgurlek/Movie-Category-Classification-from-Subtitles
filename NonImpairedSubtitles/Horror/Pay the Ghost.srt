1
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:42,655
Mother!

2
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:41,628
Mom.

3
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:43,596
Hey.

4
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:46,264
There's something
outside my window.

5
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,800
Oh, baby,
you're having a nightmare, huh?

6
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:52,135
Okay.

7
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:53,869
Let me put you back to bed.

8
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:56,270
I want Daddy to do it.

9
00:03:57,372 --> 00:03:59,292
How 'bout we wait
for him together, huh?

10
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,407
Come on in. Bring Bear.

11
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,246
I gotcha.

12
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:09,813
We'll keep each other safe.

13
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:32,832
Shit.

14
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,188
Hi.

15
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:33,656
Did you figure it out?

16
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:34,890
What?

17
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:37,044
What you're gonna
be for Halloween.

18
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:38,459
Maybe.

19
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:39,893
But you're gonna have to

20
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:41,694
wait until tomorrow to find out.

21
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:44,029
I'll be a pirate.

22
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,298
Ah, good choice.

23
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:48,765
Mom helped me pick it out

24
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,633
after we got the pumpkin.

25
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,469
Mom said she'd carve it with me,

26
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,737
but I wanted to wait for you.

27
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:56,804
Oh,

28
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,171
Well...

29
00:05:58,173 --> 00:05:59,405
We'll do it tomorrow,

30
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,873
just before we go trick
or treating, okay?

31
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,206
Promise?

32
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:04,640
I promise.

33
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:07,409
Now, go back to sleep.

34
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,146
Oh, and Dad...

35
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,680
Yes?

36
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:16,547
Can you check
outside my window?

37
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:17,914
I saw something.

38
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,150
Sure.

39
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,492
Nope, all clear.

40
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:33,760
I love you, Dad.

41
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,062
I love you too, son.

42
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,733
I'm sorry.

43
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:46,629
I'm getting tired of
going to bed without you.

44
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,703
If they're on the fence,
I'm going to have to

45
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:51,338
publish another article
as soon as I can.

46
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Are they on the fence?
- I don't know.

47
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,008
Just seems like I would've
received a letter by now.

48
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:03,078
Charlie wanted to wait
up for you tonight.

49
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,147
I think,

50
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,549
if you don't carve that
pumpkin with him tomorrow,

51
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:12,417
he's going to disown you.

52
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:14,952
Can he do that?

53
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:18,254
I think he'd have a case, yeah.

54
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,754
And what about you?

55
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:23,190
Are you ready to disown me, too?
Huh?

56
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:31,895
Can I take that as a no?

57
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:35,097
I don't want you to think
I'm not mad at you, okay?

58
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,975
<i>"My darling,
my darling, I see it aright.</i>

59
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,577
<i>Tis the aged gray willows
deceiving thy sight."</i>

60
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:53,277
<i>"I love thee!"</i>

61
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:57,113
<i>I'm charmed by thy
beauty, dear boy!</i>

62
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:00,949
<i>And if thou'rt unwilling,
then force I'll employ."</i>

63
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,751
<i>"My father, my father,
he seizes me fast,</i>

64
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:06,553
<i>For sorely the Erl-King
has hurt me at last."</i>

65
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:10,256
<i>The father now gallops,
with terror half wild,</i>

66
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,525
<i>He grasps in his arms
the poor shuddering child,</i>

67
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,895
<i>He reaches his courtyard
with toil and with dread,</i>

68
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:22,033
<i>The child in his arms
finds he motionless, dead.</i>

69
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,036
Pretty good, huh?
- Chuckling)

70
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,170
Kyle.

71
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,305
Who is this, uh, Earl Linking?

72
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:30,773
And his creepy daughters.

73
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,374
We don't know for sure.

74
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:35,443
They might be creatures
out of northern mythology.

75
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:36,944
Or some Celtic lore.

76
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:38,778
Or they simply stepped out

77
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,647
of Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe's nightmares.

78
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,416
But when you go out tonight,

79
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,584
spare a thought for Lovecraft.

80
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,585
For Stoker, for Poe...

81
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,720
And for Goethe's Erl-King.

82
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:52,287
'Cause they were
all bound by one

83
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,789
great, and noble objective.

84
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,658
To scare the living
shit out of you.

85
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:00,827
Happy Halloween.

86
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,780
Hello, hello, hello!

87
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:24,948
Hey, Mom.

88
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:26,649
Where's my little pirate?

89
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,251
Mom, check it out.

90
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,924
Wow, that's a great
indoor activity.

91
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,446
Yeah.
- You...

92
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:39,959
You look amazing.

93
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:42,261
He's on fire, huh?

94
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:44,263
He's so excited.

95
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:46,098
The pirate looks perfect,

96
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,499
thank you very much.

97
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:48,833
And we'll see you
tomorrow, yeah?

98
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:49,834
Oh, yes.

99
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:50,901
Happy Halloween!

100
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:52,870
Happy Halloween
to you, too, Rosa.

101
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,903
When's Dad coming home?

102
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:57,305
He should
be on his way right now.

103
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,506
Rosa take you to art class?
- Yeah.

104
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:00,740
I wanna see.

105
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:04,509
Charlie, that's really scary.

106
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,313
You wanna tell me about that?

107
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:13,282
That's the thing
I saw outside my window.

108
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:15,657
I thought you told
me you couldn't see it?

109
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:17,151
I kinda saw it.

110
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:19,151
It just kinda looked like that.

111
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,420
Can we go, already?

112
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,654
Where's Dad?

113
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:46,540
Yeah?
- Hannah...

114
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:50,209
Oh, Michael,
come here, come here.

115
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:52,177
Come, look at this.

116
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,945
It washed ashore last
week on Jones Beach.

117
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,149
What are those, Latin numerals?

118
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,784
Exactly. It's an M and a D,

119
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,485
and possibly a C.

120
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:05,719
Sixteen hundred.

121
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,321
They used to engrave ships
with the year they were built,

122
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:10,122
which means this piece
of driftwood was once

123
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:11,823
part of the body of
a ship that helped

124
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:14,325
settle this city 400 years ago.

125
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:16,247
That's quite
something, isn't it?

126
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,027
And so's this.

127
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:26,100
"Dear Professor Lawford."

128
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,868
Congratulations, Mike!

129
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:29,935
You've come a long way from that

130
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:32,837
arrogant Yank who drank
himself out of Heidelberg.

131
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,799
Thanks for
recommending me, Hannah.

132
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:37,741
You deserve it,
more than anybody.

133
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:43,111
I've gotta go,

134
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:45,354
I have a very important
appointment with a pirate.

135
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,190
Hey.

136
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:12,504
God, it was the most incredible
exhibit I've ever seen.

137
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:14,732
And they, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

138
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:16,974
Easy on the candy,
all of you, please.

139
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,909
Maybe Dad
called and you missed it.

140
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,410
I will try him again.

141
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,828
<i>Hi, it's Mike, leave a message,</i>

142
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,896
<i>I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.</i>

143
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,399
Hey.

144
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,100
You okay?

145
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:55,102
Did you see it, Mom?
- Did I see what?

146
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:57,069
The bird.

147
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,036
The bird?

148
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:01,404
No.

149
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:03,072
No, I don't.

150
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,886
<i>I think I'll
be Robin Hood next year.</i>

151
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:21,321
He steals from the rich
and gives to the poor.

152
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:23,990
Well, that is
very noble, my little man.

153
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:26,358
And I bet he keeps
a little extra on the side

154
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,426
just to himself.

155
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:29,493
I see.

156
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,065
Mom, can we go to
the carnival, please?

157
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,800
No, not this year, my man.

158
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:43,336
I'm sorry, it is late, and
you have school tomorrow.

159
00:13:43,338 --> 00:13:45,737
Come with me.
Come on, come on my prince.

160
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,939
I said, Draw, partner!

161
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,274
Dad!

162
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:52,742
You're a cowboy!

163
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,076
I couldn't find my cowboy hat,

164
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:55,210
but boy, you guys look great.

165
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,744
You make a great pirate,
Charlie.

166
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:57,911
Where were you?

167
00:13:58,245 --> 00:13:59,445
Mom said you were
gonna meet up with us.

168
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,248
I apologize, my phone died.

169
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:03,174
Come on, let's go to bed.

170
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:04,448
Mom,

171
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,849
can we go to the carnival,

172
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:07,750
just for a bit, please?

173
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:09,785
Oh, let me take him.

174
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:11,786
Just give us a half an hour.

175
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:14,754
Come on, Kristen.
- Okay, okay.

176
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,021
Okay, but
would you do me a favor

177
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,055
and put him to bed, tonight?

178
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,289
He is hopped up on enough sugar

179
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,624
to last him until Christmas

180
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,893
and I have to finish some
client designs tonight.

181
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,575
Of course.
- All right.

182
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:25,894
I got it.

183
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:27,194
You got what?

184
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:28,929
Drum roll, please.

185
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,098
I got tenure.

186
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,868
Oh, my God!

187
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,036
Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you!

188
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,405
Does this mean that we can go?

189
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:43,873
Yes, it means you can go.

190
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:46,681
It means that we will
celebrate tonight.

191
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,342
Everything's going
to be better now.

192
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,077
You boys have fun tonight.

193
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:51,744
Come here.

194
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:53,578
Candy please, young man.

195
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:56,746
Come on, already.
- Hey, let's do it.

196
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:58,774
Hey, Professor?
- Uh huh?

197
00:14:58,915 --> 00:14:59,915
Keep your chaps on, yeah?

198
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:00,916
Yeah!

199
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:02,017
Let's go, Dad.

200
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,317
Smile, Dad.

201
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,319
You having fun?

202
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:45,153
This is awesome.

203
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,630
You see those skeletons?

204
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,264
Pretty scary, huh?

205
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:08,304
Charlie?

206
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:13,542
Okay.

207
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:16,444
All right?

208
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:20,233
I'm sorry we didn't
carve pumpkins together.

209
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:21,715
It's okay.

210
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:23,416
I know you got a
lot of work to do.

211
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:24,450
No, it's not okay.

212
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:26,018
I promised I'd be there,

213
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,686
and promises dads make to
their sons are special things.

214
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,441
You know you're
the most important

215
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:31,767
person in the
world to me, right?

216
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:33,154
Yeah.

217
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:35,555
Let's get some ice cream!

218
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:40,391
Hey.

219
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:42,459
Charlie.

220
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,260
Charlie.

221
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:45,742
I really need you
to stay close to me,

222
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:47,094
and I need you to look
where you're going, okay?

223
00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:48,462
Let me, let me take that.

224
00:16:49,997 --> 00:16:51,130
Come on.

225
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,132
What kind of ice
cream do you want?

226
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:56,300
Swirled cone with
rainbow sprinkles.

227
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:57,367
Sounds good.

228
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:15,881
Dad,

229
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,417
can we pay the ghost?

230
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,184
Pay the what?

231
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:22,318
Next.

232
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:24,853
Right, uh, yeah, a swirled cone

233
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:26,321
with rainbow sprinkles, please.

234
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:27,822
Okay. Six bucks.

235
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:29,223
Yeah.

236
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:31,091
Keep the change.

237
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,162
Charlie?

238
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,896
Charlie!

239
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:42,398
Next!
- Did you see where my son went?

240
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:43,998
Uh-uh.

241
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,098
Charlie.
- Who's next?

242
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,200
Charlie!

243
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:52,802
Where are you?

244
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:56,605
Charlie!

245
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:05,179
Charlie!

246
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:09,382
Charlie.

247
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:11,951
Hey!

248
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:14,052
Let him go!

249
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:15,719
What are you doing?

250
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:17,554
Charlie!

251
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:19,921
Charlie, where are you?

252
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:23,857
Charlie!

253
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:29,929
This is my son's hat!

254
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:31,985
The boy that was
wearing this hat,

255
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:33,397
did you see him?
- Sir, are you okay?

256
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:34,599
My son was wearing this hat!

257
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,031
Sir... Hey, Buddy!
- Charlie!

258
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,732
Officer, Officer,
this is my son's hat.

259
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:38,899
He's missing!

260
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,066
When did you see him last?

261
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,333
He was right here by
the ice cream truck,

262
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:42,400
he was right next to me.

263
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:43,701
Have you tried calling him?

264
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,668
He's seven years old,
he doesn't have a phone.

265
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,902
Sir, do you live around here?

266
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:48,103
Maybe he just went home.

267
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:06,653
Charlie!
- Mike what's wrong?

268
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,687
Is he here?
- What's wrong, what's wrong?

269
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,855
Where's Charlie?
Where's Charlie!

270
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,690
I was holding his hand,
I looked everywhere!

271
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,012
What are you telling me?
Are you saying you left him?

272
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:18,227
Jesus Christ, Mike!

273
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:21,563
Charlie!

274
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,766
Charlie!
- Charlie!

275
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,138
Charlie!
- Charlie!

276
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:31,638
Charlie, where are you?

277
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,439
Charlie!

278
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,407
Can you hear me?

279
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,019
<i>Any problems at home?</i>

280
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,507
Any reason why Charlie
might wanna run away?

281
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:52,855
No.

282
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,856
Okay.

283
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:56,556
We've issued an Amber Alert,

284
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:58,691
sent Charlie's stats
out over the wire.

285
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:00,859
Every cop in Arizona'll
look out for him.

286
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:03,528
Usually these cases are
solved within 24 hours.

287
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,896
So, try and sit tight.

288
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,106
Go home to your wife,
we'll be in touch.

289
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:42,830
Good night.

290
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:49,602
Good night, sir.

291
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:13,590
Anything?

292
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,051
Kristen?

293
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,187
How could you lose him?

294
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:00,395
Charlie!

295
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:03,163
Charlie...

296
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,332
Oh.

297
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:11,803
Where have you been?

298
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,705
Do you see it?

299
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,073
See what, Charlie?

300
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:19,374
At the window.

301
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:34,488
There's nothing there.

302
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:36,489
Look again.

303
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:56,966
<i>Dad!</i>

304
00:27:06,874 --> 00:27:09,242
<i>Dad!</i>

305
00:27:48,978 --> 00:27:50,044
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>

306
00:27:50,478 --> 00:27:51,444
<i>the voice-mail of
Kristen Lawford.</i>

307
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:53,486
<i>Please leave me a
message, and I'll get...</i>

308
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,980
<i>During a late night travel.</i>

309
00:27:55,982 --> 00:27:58,015
Where does Ichabod Crane
find himself,

310
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,383
but in Sleepy Hollow.

311
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:03,018
With just the very name,

312
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,153
Irving establishes
the mood and tone,

313
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:09,689
foreshadowing the
horror which is to come.

314
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:26,738
Thanks.

315
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:30,808
How are you holding up?

316
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,878
Can't motivate myself.

317
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:37,546
Can't motivate my students.

318
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:42,416
You know, Charlie would've
been in second grade now.

319
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:46,185
All I had to do was protect him.

320
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,187
Isn't that what a father does?

321
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,322
He protects.

322
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:54,491
I couldn't even do that.

323
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:56,885
Mike, listen to
what you are saying.

324
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:59,027
You can't keep
beating yourself up.

325
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,561
It won't bring him back.

326
00:29:02,163 --> 00:29:03,863
My son isn't dead.

327
00:29:04,331 --> 00:29:05,564
I feel him.

328
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,833
And until I know
what happened to him,

329
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:11,735
I am not going to
stop looking for him.

330
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:17,040
Would it help if you took
another leave of absence?

331
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:20,676
No. Please, I need this.

332
00:29:21,878 --> 00:29:23,758
Just try to hang
in there, Mike.

333
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:35,854
Taxi!

334
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:37,421
Taxi, yo!

335
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,193
Mike Hi, Rhonda, new fliers.

336
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:47,795
Mike, we still have
that pile from last time.

337
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:49,395
Is Detective Jordan around?

338
00:29:49,796 --> 00:29:50,896
Uh...

339
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:53,798
He's kinda busy right now.

340
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,899
I'll just be a second.

341
00:29:58,235 --> 00:29:59,868
Hi, Mike Lawford's coming in.

342
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:06,773
Detective Jordan
Jesus, Mike, you can't just

343
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:08,608
come into my office
any time you want to.

344
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,982
On October 30th of last year,
there was an offender.

345
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,844
Colin O'Malley, he was
released from Rikers Island.

346
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,880
He served 15 years
for kidnapping,

347
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:19,482
abducted a neighbor's
kid on 10th and Avenue A.

348
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,816
I'll double check that.

349
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:23,651
October 28th, Maxwell Porter
was released from Sing Sing.

350
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:25,319
They let this guy go,
- Mike...

351
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:27,287
three days before
Charlie disappeared.

352
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:28,454
He only did seven years.
- Mike...

353
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:30,189
Seven years!

354
00:30:30,523 --> 00:30:32,023
For abducting and molesting

355
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:33,991
an eight year old
boy on Stanton.

356
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:35,158
I will double check it, Mike.

357
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,325
You'll double check it?

358
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:37,426
Yes!

359
00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:41,796
Every, and I mean every
registered offender,

360
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,497
in every borough and
surrounding county

361
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:44,831
has been double
and triple checked.

362
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,032
Now you know this.

363
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:47,432
Now, I'll take a
look at these names

364
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:48,714
just in case we
missed something.

365
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,500
But the fact still remains,

366
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,134
that you're the last person
to be seen with your son.

367
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:53,668
Oh, my God.

368
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,270
You keep pointing
the finger at me

369
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,038
'cause you haven't found
jack shit all year.

370
00:30:58,305 --> 00:31:00,105
Well, in three days
it's Halloween again!

371
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:01,206
And every child will be out,

372
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,307
and every predator knows it,

373
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:04,008
and one of them took my son.

374
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:05,862
And this is what you
guys do, isn't it?

375
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:08,170
'Cause you're too fucking
lazy to do your jobs.

376
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:14,014
Lazy?

377
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:15,248
This is Charlie's file, Mike.

378
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:16,795
And this is just
what's on paper.

379
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:18,682
Computer's got at
least 20 times that.

380
00:31:18,684 --> 00:31:20,684
Each week I put
it out over NCIC.

381
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:23,286
Child abuse squad,
human trafficking, FBI.

382
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:25,621
I am in constant contact
with all of them.

383
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:28,356
NYPD may be a lot
of things, Mike,

384
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:30,758
but one thing we
are not is lazy.

385
00:31:34,162 --> 00:31:35,428
Now is there anything else?

386
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:39,932
Find my son.

387
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:30,846
Charlie!

388
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:35,616
Hey, hey, stop!

389
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:38,051
Hey!

390
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:39,152
Charlie!

391
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:41,787
Charlie!

392
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:47,291
Charlie!

393
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:51,595
Hey, wait!

394
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:03,606
Charlie!

395
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,374
Stop!

396
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:07,809
Hey!

397
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:09,877
Hey!

398
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,046
Hey!

399
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:14,147
Let me in, let me in.

400
00:33:18,484 --> 00:33:20,451
Charlie. Charlie!

401
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:24,821
Charlie!

402
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:26,788
Charlie.

403
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,391
Charlie!

404
00:35:41,276 --> 00:35:42,409
Excuse me.

405
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,144
Hello?

406
00:35:45,912 --> 00:35:47,012
Hi.

407
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:50,815
Uh, outside, on the wall,

408
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,083
it says, "Pay the Ghost."

409
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:54,750
What are you talking about?

410
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,151
Uh, the graffiti.

411
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:57,984
"Pay the Ghost."

412
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:02,641
Does anyone know
what that means?

413
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:43,992
Cover the fires!

414
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:45,492
Cover them.

415
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:01,338
What was that?

416
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:03,039
Nobody knows.

417
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:08,711
She always comes out
just before Halloween.

418
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,322
What does "Pay the Ghost" mean?

419
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,316
I saw it written outside.

420
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:23,822
Come with me.

421
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:52,416
What does it mean?

422
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:55,251
Just what it says, I guess.

423
00:38:10,698 --> 00:38:13,933
Time's up, you need to leave.

424
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:28,647
Kristen.

425
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:31,121
I really...
I really need to talk to you.

426
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:32,982
It's not a good time.

427
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,470
I've got some client
designs I gotta finish.

428
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:38,719
Please.

429
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:50,228
So, when I saw it,
on the wall, the graffiti,

430
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,763
I remembered something
that Charlie said to me,

431
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,531
on that day, just before he...

432
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,299
Yep.
- He asked me,

433
00:38:56,533 --> 00:39:00,069
"Dad, can we pay the ghost?"

434
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:04,205
Okay.

435
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:06,359
So, what are you
telling me, Mike?

436
00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:09,208
I mean, we're in a city that's
full of graffiti, right?

437
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:12,256
Did he ever say
anything like that to you?

438
00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:18,915
Kristen, have you
been hearing anything,

439
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:21,950
or seeing anything
that might make you

440
00:39:22,351 --> 00:39:25,653
think or feel that
Charlie might be

441
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,421
trying to communicate with you?

442
00:39:28,623 --> 00:39:29,623
I don't know what's
happening to me,

443
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,691
but I really think that Charlie

444
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:34,392
might be reaching out to me.

445
00:39:34,394 --> 00:39:36,026
Okay, I can't do this with you.

446
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:37,127
Kristen...

447
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:39,381
I can't do this.
- Kristen, please!

448
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:43,765
Kristen!

449
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,200
Kristen!
- I can't do this.

450
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:47,568
I know how it sounds,

451
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:49,436
but isn't it possible?

452
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:50,803
Have you seen him?

453
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:53,404
Have I seen him?

454
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:55,939
I see him every day.

455
00:39:56,373 --> 00:39:57,406
I see him on the street,

456
00:39:57,408 --> 00:39:58,807
I see him in the subway,

457
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:00,908
I see him in his little school
when I pass his friends.

458
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,542
I see him when
I'm in the grocery store.

459
00:40:02,544 --> 00:40:05,444
But every time I get closer,
it's not him.

460
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:06,944
It's never him!

461
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:11,247
You had to take him
to that stupid fair.

462
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,550
He was my boy.
- I know.

463
00:40:16,518 --> 00:40:18,452
He was my son.
- I know.

464
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,753
He was...
- I know.

465
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:23,255
Then why didn't you protect him?

466
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:42,739
<i>Look how tall that guy is!</i>

467
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:48,076
Smile, Dad.

468
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,643
<i>You having fun?</i>

469
00:40:50,778 --> 00:40:52,078
<i>This is awesome.</i>

470
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,412
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

471
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:47,463
Kristen.

472
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:53,735
Are you all right?

473
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:55,235
I need to talk to you.

474
00:44:56,303 --> 00:44:58,904
Um, I think you were
right about Charlie.

475
00:44:59,472 --> 00:45:02,206
I think he is trying
to reach out to us.

476
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,409
Come on in.

477
00:45:07,978 --> 00:45:09,311
What if I'm imagining it?

478
00:45:09,313 --> 00:45:10,612
Maybe this is all in my head,

479
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:11,713
maybe it's just...

480
00:45:11,914 --> 00:45:12,980
No.

481
00:45:12,982 --> 00:45:14,381
You didn't imagine it.

482
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:16,248
You didn't.

483
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,381
It's real.

484
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,651
I've been doing some research.

485
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,555
Pick a date.

486
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,323
Any one.

487
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,524
Charlie's birthday.

488
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,691
Perfect.

489
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:35,661
These are all the
children who went missing

490
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:39,063
on July 15th in New York City
over the last six years.

491
00:45:39,831 --> 00:45:41,398
Most of them have been found.

492
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:42,898
Now let's try your birthday.

493
00:45:45,768 --> 00:45:47,168
Most of these children, too.

494
00:45:47,836 --> 00:45:49,403
But if you try Halloween?

495
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:57,442
Only about half of
the missing children

496
00:45:57,444 --> 00:45:58,743
have been recovered.

497
00:45:59,878 --> 00:46:01,278
Why are you showing me this?

498
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,947
What if all of these
missing children,

499
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:07,549
on Halloween, in New York City,

500
00:46:08,484 --> 00:46:09,784
what if they're all connected?

501
00:46:10,285 --> 00:46:12,245
What if there's
something behind it?

502
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,087
How would we find out?

503
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:19,657
I have the address
of Alexis Moldanado,

504
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:22,126
she disappeared on
Halloween two years ago.

505
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:24,567
I think we should go
talk to her family.

506
00:46:44,379 --> 00:46:45,479
Hello?

507
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:48,781
Hello?

508
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:03,092
Excuse me.

509
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,596
Mister Moldanado?

510
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:12,812
We wanted to ask you
about your daughter.

511
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:14,834
You see,

512
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:16,968
our son is missing, too.

513
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,911
Just give me some
fucking money, man.

514
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,576
He was taken
last year on Halloween.

515
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,413
<i>Gracias, amigo.</i>

516
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:35,917
I gotta pay the ghost.

517
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:37,978
Did your daughter say that?

518
00:47:42,022 --> 00:47:43,088
I was there,

519
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:45,756
at Devon Bodega.

520
00:47:47,692 --> 00:47:48,958
And she said to me,

521
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,429
<i>"Papa, podemos pagar
nosotros a phantasma."</i>

522
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,430
"Can we pay the ghost?"

523
00:47:58,032 --> 00:47:59,265
I was distracted.

524
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:02,033
I can't remember
she's in front of me.

525
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:06,137
Next thing I know,
she's just gone.

526
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:09,039
And one year after,

527
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:11,607
I started to hear things.

528
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,544
And then I see her.

529
00:48:15,546 --> 00:48:16,878
It's just flashes.

530
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,379
It's real quick.

531
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,414
But she's there.

532
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,949
It's her, I know it's her.

533
00:48:26,718 --> 00:48:27,884
What happened?

534
00:48:33,223 --> 00:48:34,322
It stopped.

535
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:38,125
Just like that.

536
00:48:40,695 --> 00:48:41,995
She disappeared on Halloween

537
00:48:41,997 --> 00:48:43,229
two years before Charlie.

538
00:48:43,231 --> 00:48:44,730
Just before she vanished,

539
00:48:44,732 --> 00:48:46,565
she said to her father,
"Can we pay the ghost?"

540
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:48,266
Now that,
is exactly what Charlie

541
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:50,167
<i>said to me before
he disappeared.</i>

542
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:51,401
What the hell
you talking about?

543
00:48:51,403 --> 00:48:52,468
<i>Look it up.</i>

544
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,634
On every other
night of the year,

545
00:48:53,636 --> 00:48:55,402
more missing children
are eventually found.

546
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:56,302
But on Halloween it's different.

547
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:59,271
On Halloween, more missing
children are never found.

548
00:48:59,538 --> 00:49:00,638
<i>I know how I sound,</i>

549
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,360
<i>but there is
something different,</i>

550
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:05,107
something mysterious out there,

551
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,409
and it's taking
children on Halloween.

552
00:49:07,743 --> 00:49:10,063
I'm sorry, Mike, but I really
don't have time for this.

553
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:16,949
He believe you?

554
00:49:19,085 --> 00:49:20,185
Would you?

555
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:31,161
Carol,

556
00:49:31,562 --> 00:49:33,195
I need you to search
the city database.

557
00:49:33,197 --> 00:49:35,063
I need a printout of all
the missing children cases

558
00:49:35,065 --> 00:49:37,765
from October 31st in
the last five years.

559
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,887
Just get me the ones
that haven't come back.

560
00:49:45,072 --> 00:49:47,606
Well, you're home.

561
00:49:50,276 --> 00:49:51,376
Want to come in?

562
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:54,177
It's your house, too.

563
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:57,880
Order dinner, have some wine.

564
00:49:58,081 --> 00:49:59,214
Sure.

565
00:50:55,935 --> 00:50:57,000
Mrs. Wen?

566
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:58,667
NYPD.

567
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:00,341
It's about your daughter, Mia.

568
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:02,768
You find something about Mia?

569
00:51:04,303 --> 00:51:05,569
Can we talk in private?

570
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,004
Just for a minute.

571
00:51:18,648 --> 00:51:19,914
Mrs. Wen, it's possible

572
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:22,221
that there may be a
link to another case.

573
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:24,309
It may help us find
out who took Mia.

574
00:51:27,353 --> 00:51:30,722
Two days ago,
something else happened.

575
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:32,690
Tell me.

576
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:34,391
I saw her.

577
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:36,426
Mia?

578
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,262
It was late at night,
I was closing store.

579
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,131
And I think to hear
Mia's voice calling,

580
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:47,066
"Mama..."

581
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:50,435
I ran through traffic
to get to her,

582
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:53,771
but when I arrived,
Mia was gone.

583
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:57,639
Is it possible that
you just imagined it?

584
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,941
It must have
been somebody else.

585
00:52:01,342 --> 00:52:03,976
Mia would not have
run away from me.

586
00:52:04,644 --> 00:52:05,744
What does that mean?

587
00:52:06,045 --> 00:52:07,311
What you heard her calling?

588
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:10,380
"Mama..."?

589
00:52:10,382 --> 00:52:11,547
Yes.

590
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:14,715
Mama, save me from the ghost.

591
00:54:18,251 --> 00:54:19,850
I don't know.

592
00:54:20,618 --> 00:54:23,953
They were wearing old costumes.

593
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:25,954
Was Charlie one of them?

594
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:29,790
I mean, there were so
many of them, I don't know.

595
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:35,295
Maybe it's time to bring
someone into the house.

596
00:54:36,197 --> 00:54:39,532
Like a psychic or a
medium or something.

597
00:54:41,968 --> 00:54:43,768
Those people are frauds.

598
00:55:16,129 --> 00:55:18,330
On the phone I asked if
you could locate an object?

599
00:55:18,332 --> 00:55:19,898
Yes, uh...

600
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,980
He used to take this
everywhere with him.

601
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:25,369
He still sleeps with it.

602
00:55:27,105 --> 00:55:28,171
He used to.

603
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:35,410
So, how does this work?

604
00:55:39,314 --> 00:55:42,015
It's about tapping into the
right frequency, that's all.

605
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,685
If something was here,
I won't need to find it.

606
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,320
I just need to let it find me.

607
00:56:27,522 --> 00:56:29,623
No, nothing.

608
00:56:30,024 --> 00:56:31,691
Is there any other rooms

609
00:56:31,693 --> 00:56:34,960
that he spent a significant
amount of time in?

610
00:56:35,194 --> 00:56:37,762
When we first moved in
he had a hard time sleeping.

611
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:40,109
He spent a lot of time
in our room, sure.

612
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:13,224
It's here.

613
00:57:13,558 --> 00:57:14,624
What's here?

614
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:17,926
It has all the children.

615
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,480
What children?
Do you... Charlie?

616
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:10,034
She saw it.

617
00:58:10,568 --> 00:58:12,409
The thing that
takes the children.

618
00:58:12,468 --> 00:58:13,734
The thing that has my son.

619
00:58:13,736 --> 00:58:15,577
That thing that has your son.

620
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,404
You told me that woman was
flying around your ceiling.

621
00:58:18,406 --> 00:58:20,606
I believe in facts, logic.

622
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:22,473
And all I know is that a lot of

623
00:58:22,475 --> 00:58:23,941
bad shit happens
around you, Mike.

624
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,942
And until I figure out what
the hell happened around here,

625
00:58:25,944 --> 00:58:27,443
don't be leaving
town any time soon.

626
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:28,777
I'm sorry, are you implying

627
00:58:29,078 --> 00:58:31,198
that my husband had
anything to do with this?

628
00:58:32,214 --> 00:58:33,347
I'm just doing my job.

629
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:41,353
I'm really sorry.

630
00:59:06,178 --> 00:59:07,378
I can't sleep.

631
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:09,712
Can you?

632
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:11,913
Yeah, I'm gonna try.

633
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,716
I'm just gonna...

634
00:59:17,317 --> 00:59:18,550
I'll be downstairs.

635
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:20,651
Hey, Mike...

636
00:59:21,285 --> 00:59:22,351
Mike.

637
00:59:24,954 --> 00:59:26,020
Good night.

638
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:48,717
Kristen?

639
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:07,800
Hey...

640
01:02:08,101 --> 01:02:09,167
Kristen?

641
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:10,734
You okay?

642
01:02:15,305 --> 01:02:16,738
I'm cold, Dad.

643
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:19,040
It's cold here.

644
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:21,575
Charlie?

645
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:23,542
She's coming, Dad.

646
01:02:24,977 --> 01:02:26,077
I'm scared.

647
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:28,546
Please save me.

648
01:02:34,419 --> 01:02:35,519
I will.

649
01:02:36,621 --> 01:02:37,721
I will, Charlie.

650
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:40,389
Tell me where you are.

651
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,428
Kristen!

652
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,218
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

653
01:03:13,153 --> 01:03:14,219
It's okay.

654
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,353
What happened?

655
01:03:16,954 --> 01:03:18,187
You were cutting yourself.

656
01:03:19,656 --> 01:03:20,789
You don't remember?

657
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:23,491
No.

658
01:03:23,493 --> 01:03:24,859
I heard Charlie's voice.

659
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,027
He said, "Come and save me."

660
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,528
Where? Where is he?

661
01:03:39,805 --> 01:03:41,672
Mike, what is that?

662
01:04:28,817 --> 01:04:30,250
Jesus Christ.

663
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:44,896
It doesn't
appear to be Greek or Roman.

664
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:47,364
Interesting.

665
01:04:52,803 --> 01:04:54,069
"The Celtic Goddess,

666
01:04:54,303 --> 01:04:55,903
the most revered of
all Celtic symbols."

667
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:57,746
There were no Celts in America.

668
01:04:58,206 --> 01:04:59,472
And their original culture

669
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:01,859
ceased to exist over
1.000 years ago, so...

670
01:05:02,007 --> 01:05:04,675
There was a small group of
Celtic reconstructionalists

671
01:05:04,677 --> 01:05:06,309
that immigrated from Ireland.

672
01:05:06,543 --> 01:05:08,877
New York was a big
trading post by then.

673
01:05:08,879 --> 01:05:10,078
What happened to them?

674
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:17,083
The influenza epidemic
in New York, 1679.

675
01:05:17,085 --> 01:05:20,052
"When it struck,
it devastated the population."

676
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:22,421
Some colonists
accused an Irish woman

677
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:25,590
of using black magic to bring
about the deadly epidemic.

678
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:27,458
"They burned her at the stake."

679
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,127
Does it say in
there what her name was?

680
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,528
Not in this document,

681
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,062
but I'm sure I could find it.

682
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:35,763
I'll check the archives tonight.

683
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,065
This happened when New York

684
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:41,068
was still a rural
settlement, 300 years ago.

685
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,671
At that time, the trading
post would've been

686
01:05:44,673 --> 01:05:46,506
just along this park, right?

687
01:05:47,241 --> 01:05:48,441
Yes.

688
01:05:49,576 --> 01:05:51,610
There's an old
church in that area.

689
01:05:51,612 --> 01:05:53,678
Saint Joseph's. It's here.

690
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:56,747
A small Irish community
still gathers there each year

691
01:05:56,749 --> 01:05:59,750
to celebrate Halloween
in the Celtic tradition.

692
01:05:59,752 --> 01:06:01,818
Tonight.
- Can we go there?

693
01:06:02,019 --> 01:06:04,180
What do you think you're
going to find there?

694
01:06:06,356 --> 01:06:07,422
I don't know.

695
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:10,558
Happy Halloween, Jordan.

696
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,659
What've you got for me?

697
01:06:11,893 --> 01:06:13,193
You're not gonna believe it.

698
01:06:13,195 --> 01:06:15,115
Got a real trick
or treat for you.

699
01:06:15,295 --> 01:06:16,862
You ready for this?

700
01:06:28,106 --> 01:06:29,467
What the hell am I
looking at, Ray?

701
01:06:29,606 --> 01:06:32,174
Her organs or what's
left of them anyway.

702
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:35,022
It's like she's
been set on fire,

703
01:06:35,577 --> 01:06:39,512
from the inside,
like spontaneous combustion.

704
01:07:49,045 --> 01:07:50,178
Excuse us.

705
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:54,415
Hello, welcome, welcome.

706
01:07:54,849 --> 01:07:57,010
I don't think I've seen
you folks here before.

707
01:07:57,016 --> 01:07:58,916
We were wondering
about the song.

708
01:07:59,384 --> 01:08:00,851
Can you tell us about it?

709
01:08:00,853 --> 01:08:02,118
Of course.

710
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:04,680
It's the Portal song,
it's played during Sawan.

711
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,940
It's meant to honor and
welcome the spirits.

712
01:08:07,222 --> 01:08:08,589
This place was home

713
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:11,023
to the first Sawan
celebration in the country.

714
01:08:11,025 --> 01:08:12,357
The first Halloween.

715
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:14,958
Our son was abducted
last year on Halloween.

716
01:08:15,793 --> 01:08:17,293
I'm sorry to hear that.

717
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,028
For almost a year after he
disappeared, there was nothing.

718
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:23,030
Then two days ago,
we began to hear his voice.

719
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,765
Moments when we could see him.

720
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:27,567
I'm just a school
teacher from Bayside.

721
01:08:27,968 --> 01:08:30,436
We get together here
every Halloween for fun.

722
01:08:31,037 --> 01:08:33,972
I'm truly sorry, but I don't
know anything about your son.

723
01:08:33,974 --> 01:08:35,373
No, no, please.

724
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:36,740
No, wait, please

725
01:08:37,141 --> 01:08:39,181
can you tell us about
the Celtic Goddess?

726
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:41,242
I did something to
myself last night

727
01:08:41,244 --> 01:08:42,910
without having any memory of it.

728
01:08:46,015 --> 01:08:47,336
Do you recognize this symbol?

729
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:57,122
This is the waxing moon.

730
01:08:57,323 --> 01:08:59,891
You can tell because
the crescent faces left.

731
01:08:59,893 --> 01:09:01,259
It means Maiden.

732
01:09:01,693 --> 01:09:02,693
And the waning moon?

733
01:09:02,695 --> 01:09:04,327
The crescent faces right.

734
01:09:04,329 --> 01:09:06,228
It means Crone.

735
01:09:06,495 --> 01:09:09,463
It's the most devastating
of all the Pagan symbols.

736
01:09:10,164 --> 01:09:11,264
Why?

737
01:09:11,598 --> 01:09:12,931
It is said that hate made her

738
01:09:12,933 --> 01:09:14,853
forget her true
nature as a mother.

739
01:09:15,768 --> 01:09:17,235
Could she have taken our son?

740
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:20,904
It is believed that
there was one day a year,

741
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,306
when the Crone could take
someone to the other side.

742
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:26,175
The final day of Sawan,

743
01:09:26,177 --> 01:09:28,610
when the boundary between
the two worlds dissolves

744
01:09:28,612 --> 01:09:32,613
and she returns to take three
children on Halloween night.

745
01:09:32,615 --> 01:09:34,681
So, the Crone is a ghost

746
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:36,582
and you pay the ghost
with your child.

747
01:09:36,584 --> 01:09:39,284
That's why the
children burn dolls tonight.

748
01:09:39,752 --> 01:09:42,487
It's an offering,
so they won't be taken.

749
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,589
So, if our son was taken,

750
01:09:46,691 --> 01:09:48,458
does it mean that he's dead?

751
01:09:49,026 --> 01:09:50,126
All that I can tell you is

752
01:09:50,128 --> 01:09:51,894
that at the beginning of Sawan,

753
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,396
as the door between the
two worlds slowly opens,

754
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:56,598
only the children
taken the previous year

755
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,933
can still reach
out to this world.

756
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:01,502
And they are the only
ones who can be saved.

757
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:04,904
But only until midnight,
that's when the portal

758
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:06,639
between the two
worlds closes again.

759
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:07,973
Two hours.

760
01:10:08,607 --> 01:10:10,541
Where, where do we find him?

761
01:10:10,543 --> 01:10:13,110
Legend says that in the
days before Halloween,

762
01:10:13,112 --> 01:10:16,512
the Crone can be heard
crying for her lost children.

763
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:18,813
The crying woman.

764
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:21,181
I know the place.

765
01:10:21,549 --> 01:10:23,716
That's why I saw him,
he tried to show me.

766
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,150
To bring me there.

767
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:42,032
All right.
<i>- Mike.</i>

768
01:10:42,034 --> 01:10:43,366
Yes, Hannah?

769
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:45,634
I found her name.
Annie Sawquin.

770
01:10:45,935 --> 01:10:47,635
Her name was Annie Sawquin.

771
01:10:48,003 --> 01:10:49,103
Tell me.

772
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,104
She was a young widow
with three children,

773
01:10:51,106 --> 01:10:53,172
living on the first
New York settlement.

774
01:10:55,843 --> 01:10:57,809
Get inside! Now, children.

775
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:00,744
<i>On Halloween night of 1679,</i>

776
01:11:00,746 --> 01:11:03,012
<i>an angry mob
approached her home.</i>

777
01:11:10,018 --> 01:11:11,952
<i>The influenza outbreak
had infected</i>

778
01:11:11,954 --> 01:11:13,286
<i>most of the settlement,</i>

779
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,087
<i>and many people
blamed Annie's family</i>

780
01:11:15,089 --> 01:11:17,255
<i>because of their Celtic beliefs.</i>

781
01:11:18,423 --> 01:11:20,257
<i>The crowd broke
into their house,</i>

782
01:11:20,259 --> 01:11:22,025
<i>looking to punish
her and the children</i>

783
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,993
<i>for the misery
they were suffering.</i>

784
01:11:26,396 --> 01:11:27,462
No!

785
01:11:29,865 --> 01:11:31,665
Where's the young'uns, Annie?

786
01:11:31,966 --> 01:11:33,132
No!

787
01:11:40,305 --> 01:11:41,471
Mother!

788
01:11:46,075 --> 01:11:47,708
<i>But ultimately,
they were discovered</i>

789
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,242
<i>and captured by the mob.</i>

790
01:11:54,147 --> 01:11:56,948
On the same night, they
burned them at the stake.

791
01:11:58,984 --> 01:12:01,251
<i>As the children
cried out for mercy,</i>

792
01:12:01,253 --> 01:12:03,953
<i>their mother was forced
to watch on in horror.</i>

793
01:12:05,456 --> 01:12:06,988
<i>With her last breath,</i>

794
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,057
she swore to return
every year on that day

795
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,559
and replace her three
slaughtered children

796
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:13,993
<i>with those from the living.</i>

797
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:17,796
<i>That's all the
information I have, Mike.</i>

798
01:12:17,798 --> 01:12:20,064
Thank you.

799
01:12:28,472 --> 01:12:29,637
Watch out!

800
01:13:52,544 --> 01:13:53,777
It's 10:15.

801
01:13:54,078 --> 01:13:55,044
You need you
to go find Charlie.

802
01:13:55,046 --> 01:13:56,612
He needs you, I'm fine.

803
01:13:56,813 --> 01:13:58,213
Stay here, buddy,
we're gonna get you fixed up.

804
01:13:58,215 --> 01:13:59,816
Only when I know
you're all right.

805
01:14:01,049 --> 01:14:02,449
She going to be okay?

806
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:04,116
She'll be fine, sir.

807
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:06,670
We're gonna need to do
some X-rays, though.

808
01:14:07,686 --> 01:14:08,952
Let me clean that up for you.

809
01:14:09,386 --> 01:14:10,586
Police are on their way.

810
01:14:11,854 --> 01:14:12,954
Go.

811
01:14:15,057 --> 01:14:16,290
Hey!

812
01:15:16,714 --> 01:15:17,780
Hello?

813
01:15:19,149 --> 01:15:20,349
Anybody here?

814
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:22,483
Hello?

815
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:23,862
Anybody?

816
01:15:33,627 --> 01:15:34,793
Somebody there?

817
01:15:50,974 --> 01:15:52,541
Can somebody help me?

818
01:15:58,014 --> 01:15:59,347
Why is everybody gone?

819
01:15:59,781 --> 01:16:00,847
It's Halloween.

820
01:16:01,114 --> 01:16:02,581
Ghosts are all out.

821
01:16:03,783 --> 01:16:05,183
Why'd you come back?

822
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:06,650
I need your help.

823
01:16:06,984 --> 01:16:09,652
How do I find the crying woman?

824
01:16:10,353 --> 01:16:11,920
What do you want from her?

825
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:13,755
My child back.

826
01:16:16,925 --> 01:16:18,225
Give me your watch.

827
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:24,430
You wanna cross over to
the other side or not?

828
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:32,737
You can see?

829
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,239
I'm blind as a bat.

830
01:16:36,608 --> 01:16:37,708
Not deaf.

831
01:16:39,944 --> 01:16:41,044
Take me to her.

832
01:16:50,054 --> 01:16:51,553
The portal is open.

833
01:16:52,021 --> 01:16:54,589
What you're looking for
is on the other side.

834
01:16:55,691 --> 01:16:57,925
You better be back
before midnight.

835
01:16:58,326 --> 01:16:59,426
What happens then?

836
01:16:59,693 --> 01:17:00,926
Halloween's over.

837
01:17:01,193 --> 01:17:05,129
You're not back,
you'll be trapped in there.

838
01:17:08,032 --> 01:17:09,198
Oh, wait.

839
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:11,633
Might need this.

840
01:17:12,668 --> 01:17:14,068
A lot more than I do.

841
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:03,804
You will pay!

842
01:19:11,077 --> 01:19:12,911
Annie Sawquin.

843
01:21:34,183 --> 01:21:35,249
Charlie?

844
01:22:19,594 --> 01:22:20,694
Charlie,

845
01:22:22,029 --> 01:22:23,162
I'm here, son.

846
01:22:23,696 --> 01:22:24,762
I'm here.

847
01:22:29,634 --> 01:22:30,834
Where are you, Charlie?

848
01:22:44,948 --> 01:22:46,048
My son.

849
01:22:47,617 --> 01:22:48,650
My boy.

850
01:22:48,652 --> 01:22:49,951
Is it really you, Dad?

851
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,452
I missed you so much.

852
01:22:54,621 --> 01:22:56,121
I'll take you home now.

853
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,893
Can we come, too?

854
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:07,296
This is Mia and Pablo, Dad.

855
01:23:07,563 --> 01:23:09,030
We were brought here together.

856
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,400
There's no time.

857
01:23:13,934 --> 01:23:15,167
We have to stay together.

858
01:23:40,457 --> 01:23:41,690
Come on, keep moving.

859
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:43,358
We're almost there.

860
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,353
Get behind me.

861
01:24:20,358 --> 01:24:21,691
Dad!

862
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:41,774
Dad!

863
01:24:48,414 --> 01:24:49,480
No!

864
01:25:01,724 --> 01:25:03,057
Help him!

865
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:43,155
Dad, the bridge!

866
01:25:44,123 --> 01:25:45,189
Come on!

867
01:25:53,297 --> 01:25:54,463
Let's go!

868
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:20,154
I got you.

869
01:26:29,831 --> 01:26:31,298
Put your arm around my neck.

870
01:26:45,646 --> 01:26:47,313
I got you, Dad.

871
01:26:56,656 --> 01:26:57,856
Let's go home.

872
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,706
Charlie?

873
01:27:16,974 --> 01:27:18,074
Mom.

874
01:27:31,487 --> 01:27:32,753
Come here.

875
01:27:33,154 --> 01:27:34,554
Oh, my goodness.

876
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:43,528
Where were you?

877
01:27:43,862 --> 01:27:45,028
Where were you?

878
01:27:45,329 --> 01:27:46,595
At the Halloween Fair.

879
01:27:47,196 --> 01:27:49,030
Dad and I had so much fun.

880
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:50,430
There it is.

881
01:27:51,732 --> 01:27:53,032
I thought I lost it.

882
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:57,235
He doesn't remember anything?

883
01:28:00,839 --> 01:28:03,707
Dad promised me next year
I can be a superhero.

884
01:28:03,709 --> 01:28:05,108
You'll be a superhero.

885
01:28:05,576 --> 01:28:07,496
You're gonna be a
great superhero.

886
01:28:08,378 --> 01:28:09,811
Why are you crying?

887
01:28:12,548 --> 01:28:13,948
I'm really happy to see you.

888
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,497
That's all, that's all.

889
01:28:15,883 --> 01:28:17,450
I'm just happy to see you.

890
01:28:19,986 --> 01:28:21,119
Thank you.
