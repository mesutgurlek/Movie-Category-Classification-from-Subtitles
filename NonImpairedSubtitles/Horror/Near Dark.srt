Wait up. Wait up!

469
01:02:07,663 --> 01:02:10,655
Back there,
You did good.

470
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,161
Thanks.

471
01:02:26,682 --> 01:02:28,172
Catch.

472
01:02:30,686 --> 01:02:32,176
All right.

473
01:02:36,192 --> 01:02:38,183
Shake?

474
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,191
Thanks.

475
01:02:47,703 --> 01:02:50,194
You bought yourself
Some time, son.

476
01:02:52,208 --> 01:02:55,211
Jesse, there's somethin'
I've been meanin' to ask you.

477
01:02:55,246 --> 01:02:58,703
- Yeah? What might that be?
- How old are you?

478
01:02:59,215 --> 01:03:01,206
Let's put it this way:
I fought for the south.

479
01:03:01,717 --> 01:03:03,844
The south?

480
01:03:06,856 --> 01:03:10,849
We lost.

481
01:03:14,864 --> 01:03:16,354
Hey, caleb, let's go out
And look at the night.

482
01:03:16,866 --> 01:03:18,857
All right.

483
01:03:22,371 --> 01:03:25,875
How about a little five-card
Russian roulette?

484
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:27,866
Why not, severen?

485
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,372
It almost feels like
You're one of us now.

486
01:03:34,884 --> 01:03:36,374
Yeah, it does.

487
01:03:37,887 --> 01:03:40,378
So what does that make me?
I ain't exactly sure.

488
01:03:44,393 --> 01:03:46,384
It's good, right?
I guess so, yeah.

489
01:03:48,397 --> 01:03:50,364
Do you miss the sun?

490
01:03:50,399 --> 01:03:52,890
It's been so long,
I can't really remember.

491
01:03:54,403 --> 01:03:56,370
How long?

492
01:03:56,405 --> 01:04:00,508
Spring, four years back,

493
01:04:00,543 --> 01:04:03,010
And i was in high school. Mmm.

494
01:04:03,045 --> 01:04:06,537
Homer said he was in fifth grade
And he needed help With his homework.

495
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,541
Little weasel.

496
01:04:11,554 --> 01:04:14,546
- Do you miss he day? - the day?

497
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,053
Nah. I can see better at night.

498
01:04:29,939 --> 01:04:32,931
Here we go.
I don't want this.

499
01:04:35,444 --> 01:04:37,435
Three cards.
How many you want, Little boner?

500
01:04:39,448 --> 01:04:41,950
How many for you,
You old saddle bum?

501
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:44,453
Three. Three. There you go.
One for her.

502
01:04:44,488 --> 01:04:47,922
Three for the dealer.

503
01:04:47,957 --> 01:04:50,459
Are you cheatin', Severen?
I ain't cheatin'.

504
01:04:50,494 --> 01:04:53,462
What's this then?

505
01:05:00,469 --> 01:05:02,460
Deal the cards.

506
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:04,963
I fold. I'm gonna taste the air.

507
01:05:06,475 --> 01:05:09,467
Watch the time, boy.
Deal the cards.

508
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:57,882
It's impolite to stare.

509
01:06:06,902 --> 01:06:09,370
Howdy.

510
01:06:09,405 --> 01:06:11,907

I tried callin' you.

539
01:08:04,954 --> 01:08:06,956
We've been out a lot
Drivin' in the truck,

540
01:08:06,991 --> 01:08:09,948
Tryin' to track you down. Dad.

Son?
Son?

543
01:08:15,965 --> 01:08:18,717
'Round and 'round
And 'round she goes.

544
01:08:18,752 --> 01:08:21,435
And where she stops,
Nobody knows.

545
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:24,962
It's about time For that big old wheel
To stop rotatin'.

546
01:08:26,976 --> 01:08:29,222
Who are these people?

547
01:08:29,257 --> 01:08:31,469
I'm with them now.

548
01:08:33,983 --> 01:08:35,985
Jesse, you let them go.

549
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,976

555
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:03,477
She's mine.

556
01:09:03,512 --> 01:09:06,003
You're gonna have to Give her back, son.
She's not yours.

557
01:09:06,515 --> 01:09:10,019
- I'm gonna nip her.
- You can't do that.

558
01:09:10,054 --> 01:09:12,486
I chewed mae.

559
01:09:12,521 --> 01:09:16,024
She went off
And chewed on you.

560
01:09:16,059 --> 01:09:19,528
Now i'm chewing
Your little sister.

561
01:09:19,563 --> 01:09:22,429

562
01:09:22,464 --> 01:09:24,932
You let her go or
I'm gonna have to hurt Your body, homer.

563
01:09:24,967 --> 01:09:28,470
- You're gonna have to hurt My body first.
- Hold on a second, pilgrim.

564
01:09:28,505 --> 01:09:30,472
Remember which side Of the bread
Your butter's on.

565
01:09:30,507 --> 01:09:32,992
Goddamn, this is my family!
Let 'em go!

566
01:09:33,027 --> 01:09:35,442
The question is whether
They'd let us go.

567
01:09:35,477 --> 01:09:39,481
They've been trackin' us.
Now they know our faces. I say kill 'em.

576
01:10:40,961 --> 01:10:44,572
I can't expect y ou To believe it.
I can't believe it myself.

577
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:48,148
I ain't a person anymore.

627
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,758
And now you're gonna
Have to pay.

628
01:20:58,793 --> 01:21:02,762
First, you're gonna
Give me back my spur.

629
01:21:02,797 --> 01:21:04,788
Then i'm gonna knock
Your tonsils out your asshole.

630
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,790
What do you think
Of them apples, huh?

631
01:21:17,812 --> 01:21:20,804
Stop! Stop!

632
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,287
Hey, mister...
Get the hell off my truck!

633
01:21:27,322 --> 01:21:29,313
- Keep goin'
Before you get killed. -

634
01:21:29,824 --> 01:21:32,327
I'm gonna give you
Till the count of five!

635
01:21:32,362 --> 01:21:34,818
One, two, four...

636
01:21:36,331 --> 01:21:37,821
Bull's-eye!

637
01:21:40,835 --> 01:21:44,327
Mister? Jesus.

638
01:21:44,839 --> 01:21:47,330
I'm sorry. Damn you.

639
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:51,334
Now come on!

640
01:21:54,349 --> 01:21:57,218
Come on, come on.

641
01:21:57,253 --> 01:21:58,344
Come on.

642
01:22:10,498 --> 01:22:12,489
Whoo!

643
01:22:14,002 --> 01:22:16,469
Whoo!

644
01:22:16,504 --> 01:22:20,497
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

645
01:22:24,646 --> 01:22:28,114
- Oh, shit. - hey, caleb?

646
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:30,151
Fasten your fuckin'
Seat belt!

647
01:22:39,027 --> 01:22:41,029
Son of a bitch!

648
01:23:00,782 --> 01:23:03,273
No! -

649
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:11,691
Whoo-hoo!

650
01:24:07,115 --> 01:24:09,106
It's time to pay The fiddler.

651
01:24:09,617 --> 01:24:11,084
Where's my sister, jess?

652
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:13,621
I taught severen
Everything he knew,

653
01:24:13,656 --> 01:24:15,612
But not everything I know.

654
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:20,617
The last sound that you hear
On your way to hell...

655
01:24:20,995 --> 01:24:22,986
Is gonna be your guts
Snappin' like a bullwhip.

656
01:24:23,498 --> 01:24:25,989
This ain't got nothin'
To do with my sister!

657
01:24:26,501 --> 01:24:29,003
You leave her out of this
And let her go!

658
01:24:29,038 --> 01:24:31,995
Jesse, let him come back.

659
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:36,500
It's too late for that, Mae.

660
01:24:42,016 --> 01:24:44,007
Goddamn, jesse,
Where's my sister?

661
01:24:54,896 --> 01:24:56,898
Everything is gonna be
All right.

662
01:24:56,933 --> 01:24:58,865
Don't be scared.

663
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:02,392
- I'm gonna take her back.
- Sure you will.

664
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:14,179
Caleb, look out!

665
01:25:14,682 --> 01:25:17,048
Jess!

666
01:25:17,552 --> 01:25:19,543
Hey!

667
01:25:27,061 --> 01:25:29,552
Go, caleb.
Make a run for it.

668
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:44,201
Come on, jesse!
Get in the car! Mae, come on!

669
01:25:48,216 --> 01:25:50,707
Hurry up!
Get in the car!

670
01:26:13,374 --> 01:26:15,365
Go on! Aah!

671
01:26:15,877 --> 01:26:18,869
Go on, honey. Go on. Run.
Run, sarah!

672
01:26:37,832 --> 01:26:40,199
No!

673
01:26:40,234 --> 01:26:44,227
No!

674
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:57,574
Block that sun out!

675
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:25,343
No!

676
01:27:25,378 --> 01:27:27,977
Mae!

677
01:27:30,718 --> 01:27:34,620
- no, homer!

678
01:27:47,635 --> 01:27:49,125
No!

679
01:28:01,649 --> 01:28:03,640
Caleb!

680
01:28:05,653 --> 01:28:07,382
Wait, sarah!

681
01:28:14,662 --> 01:28:16,653
My god.

682
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:21,158
Jesse.

683
01:28:55,436 --> 01:28:56,926
Roast.

684
01:28:57,438 --> 01:28:58,928
Fun times.

685
01:30:04,205 --> 01:30:06,696
Caleb, what's happening?

686
01:30:08,843 --> 01:30:10,333
I brought you home.

687
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:18,347
I'm afraid. Don't be.

688
01:30:18,382 --> 01:30:20,844
It's just the sun.
