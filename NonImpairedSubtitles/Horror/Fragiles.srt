0
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:14,601
Since the Mercy Falls Hospital,
ironically only a short distance

1
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,361
from the scene of the accident,
is on the point of closing down,

2
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,643
all the injured are having
to be accomodated

3
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:22,446
in the Saint James'Hospital,
in the centre of the island.

4
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,400
There is concern this may
overload the facilities,

5
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,479
since the number of injured
already stands at 35.

6
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,605
This figure
could raise considerably,

7
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:33,440
as rescue works continue
around the clock.

8
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:35,917
It is rumored that the death
toll could be as high as ten,

9
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:38,362
butas yet the official
authorlties have not issued

10
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:40,961
an official bulletin confirming
either the number of victims

11
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,322
or the possible causes
of this terrible accident,

12
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:45,836
by far the most tragic in
the history of the island.

13
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:49,039
A firdt appraisal by rail experts
seems to indicate that there was

14
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:52,438
no obstruction on the tracks
orfault with the rails,

15
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:55,115
which puts human error high
on the list of possible causes.

16
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:58,598
However, since the engineer is one
of the fatal victims, this will

17
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,043
only be determined after after an
investigation is been carried out

18
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:04,596
The island's chief industry
being turism,

19
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:07,440
it is feared that many of the
victims may be foreign visitors...

20
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:33,806
Susan.

21
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:36,399
What are you doing up?

22
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:38,843
She's coming.

23
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,757
I told you I didn't want
to talk about that any more.

24
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:45,800
But I can feel it.

25
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:48,517
Get back to bed.
This is our last night.

26
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:50,439
We'll all have left by tomorrow.

27
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:54,045
Come on.

28
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:48,357
- It hurts.
- We're gonna get you better.

29
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,716
What happened?

30
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:52,003
I don't know.
He suddenly started screaming.

31
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,202
Something's wrong, that's for sure.

32
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,483
I told you there's
something weird here.

33
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:58,724
- Why won't anyone listen?
- Susan, please.

34
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:03,841
One, two, three...

35
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:20,760
All right, very still, just
for a second, good boy.

36
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:26,843
You're sure he didn't
fall out of bed?

37
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,965
Of course I'm sure. If he had,
I'd have found him on the floor.

38
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,204
All right. Go.

39
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,278
Good boy, that's great,

40
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,040
you're being a very brave man.

41
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,797
Now we just need to do
the same again, all right?

42
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:49,796
Now, it's important you tell us
how this happened, OK?

43
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:53,080
I don't know.

44
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,441
No?

45
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:58,881
All right.

46
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:01,158
He's no idea,

47
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:02,966
or so he says.

48
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:07,965
Ah Christ!

49
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:10,764
- This doesn't make sense!
- No.

50
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:12,679
It doesn't. I told you!

51
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,201
It's all right.

52
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,035
All right, Simon.
Very still.

53
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,118
Miss Nichols!

54
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:17,921
- Hi.
- Amy?

55
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:19,884
- Yeah.
- Welcome to the island.

56
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:21,719
- Thank you.
- I'm Roy. Sorry I'm late.

57
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:24,321
I had to pick this up. If you
don't mind taking that actually

58
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,079
- and I'll take that.
- Sure.

59
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:27,919
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yeah.

60
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:31,045
They didn't tell me you were
American. Been in England long?

61
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:33,084
It's a long story.

62
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,444
I've got a film in the case
for the kids.

63
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:38,246
I get them sent over from this guy
over in Manchester once a week.

64
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,080
They're the real deal, y'know,
not some old videotape.

65
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:45,122
- D'you like them?
- Yeah, I suppose, if they're good.

66
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,086
Get ready for a long drive.

67
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,956
Mercy Falls is up North,
pretty out of the way.

68
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,681
Well, I guess it doesn't really
matter now anyway.

69
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:00,923
Actually we should have closed
down already a couple of days ago.

70
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,243
Most of the kids
have already moved

71
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,363
to St. James's in the centre
of the island.

72
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,163
But what with the train crash
and everything,

73
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:11,602
they've run out of beds

74
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,602
so we've got no option
but to wait.

75
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,718
Mrs. Folder will put you
in the picture.

76
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:20,719
She's our Senior Nursing Officer.

77
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,718
I'm sorry about the short notice.

78
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:44,957
One of our staff took unexpected
sick leave two nights ago

79
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,277
and I honestly didn't think
we'd have to replace her.

80
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:49,558
But, as you can see,
we're still here.

81
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:53,117
- Roy has brought you up to date.
- Yeah, more or less.

82
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,562
Anyway, I hope it'll only be
for a few days.

83
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,924
You can see for yourself,
we only have a skeleton staff.

84
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:04,040
It's not a comfortable
situation for any of us.

85
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,244
The remaining children
are upstairs.

86
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,967
The whole floor's practically
been dismantled.

87
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:11,163
We've only left
the bare necessities.

88
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:15,681
If you need to make a call,
you'll have to use your mobile.

89
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,958
The phones were cut off yesterday.

90
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,797
- Where do you want these?
- Over there, I'll be right down.

91
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,997
No button for the second floor.

92
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,445
Have they cleared it out already?

93
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:40,838
There wouldn't be much point in that.
It's been closed off since 1959.

94
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:45,476
If they didn't clear it then, I
don't see the point in bothering now.

95
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,998
It's been disconnected ever since.

96
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,760
Miss Pérez, this is Miss Nichols.

97
00:10:57,487 --> 00:10:59,842
She'll be taking over
the night shift until we close.

98
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,360
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

99
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:04,599
Miss. Pérez will fill you
in with what's going on.

100
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,564
- Put her in room seven.
- OK.

101
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:09,003
I'm needed downstairs.
If you'll excuse me.

102
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:12,082
- Call me Helen.
- Amy.

103
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:13,925
I'll show you around.

104
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:16,965
There's actually
not much left to see.

105
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:19,442
Yeah, that's what they told me.

106
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:25,845
This is the playroom.

107
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,080
As you can see, they've plenty
to keep them occupied

108
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:31,715
so they're usually
not much trouble.

109
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:35,041
In fact, they are
especially quiet today.

110
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,477
- Why?
- Visiting day.

111
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,644
Their parents have just left.

112
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:42,484
- How many children are still here?
- Just eight.

113
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,797
Lung cases.
I'll fill you in later.

114
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,322
I'd like to look at the case-studies
before I start working.

115
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,121
Relax, there's plenty
of time for that.

116
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,687
Come on, I want you
to meet the kids.

117
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,883
Children, pay attention.

118
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:02,720
I want you to meet Amy.

119
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,561
She's going to be your
night nurse until we leave.

120
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:06,921
Hi.

121
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,117
- Where's Susan?
- Susan had to go, sweetie.

122
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:16,445
How are you?

123
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:17,926
We're sick.

124
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,805
What's your name?

125
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:52,162
Maggie.

126
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:54,280
Reynolds.

127
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:57,197
Did you see your parents today?

128
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,203
I haven't got any.

129
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,245
Me neither.

130
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,678
These blocks must be a lot of fun
to keep you playing all by yourself.

131
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:14,925
They're not for playing with.

132
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:19,238
What are they for then?

133
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,759
Talking.

134
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,725
To who?

135
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:27,840
OK,

136
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:31,560
time to clear away.
Dinner'll be here in 5 minutes.

137
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,605
- I don't want to tell you twice.
- See you later, Maggie.

138
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,643
And you, put those back
where they belong.

139
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,647
I'm fed up of finding
blocks all over the place.

140
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:57,366
We put them all in here so the
other rooms could be cleared out.

141
00:13:57,527 --> 00:14:00,439
They get rowdy now and then, but
it actually makes life easier.

142
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,756
This is David.

143
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:03,042
- Hi, David.
- Hi.

144
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,561
And this is Richard. He's been
on the respirator for 3 weeks.

145
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:08,365
But he's getting better
every day,

146
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:10,245
- aren't you Richard?
- How often does it have to be checked?

147
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:12,046
Once in a while.

148
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:14,675
It's automatically controlled.
No need to be overly worried.

149
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:20,561
- Helen, give us a hand, will you?
- You were keen to get stuck in.

150
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:24,843
All yours.

151
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:28,405
Now, on three, OK?

152
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:31,923
One, two, three... There we go.

153
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:35,075
- I'm Amy, the new night nurse.
- Yes, I know.

154
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,005
Now you just get some rest, yeah?

155
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:41,200
Helen, Simon's got to go to
London tomorrow for some tests

156
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,404
so have him ready straight
after lunch.

157
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,876
- Welcome, Amy.
- Thank you.

158
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,278
So what happened to you?

159
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:52,918
Simon broke his leg the other night.
But he's doing fine now.

160
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:55,005
How did that happen?

161
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,958
Good question.

162
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:00,077
Another forty seconds.

163
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:17,715
Did anyone
hear me say "time's up"?

164
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:36,279
- That girl drives me up the wall.
- Who?

165
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,001
Maggie.

166
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,683
I see you found them.

167
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,237
They should keep you busy
for a while.

168
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:45,075
Yeah.

169
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:48,477
Matt. Lights out in 5 minutes.

170
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:51,636
OK.

171
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:56,401
If you need anything,
Matt's downstairs all night.

172
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,797
And Robert should
be here in a minute.

173
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:02,164
He's the night doctor. I'm sure
you two'll make a good team.

174
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:06,485
- Well, I'm off. Good luck.
- Thanks.

175
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,045
Maggie,

176
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,518
- what are you doing awake?
- I can't sleep.

177
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,479
It's pretty.

178
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:14,116
When I was a little girl
I used to have one too.

179
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,398
D'you know
what I used to call it?

180
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:21,363
Mister Sleepy.

181
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:25,557
Because it used
to help me go to sleep.

182
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:27,799
So come on now...

183
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,885
Charlotte...

184
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:35,880
Sorry?

185
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,360
The blocks.

186
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:40,683
They're for talking to Charlotte.

187
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,886
- Who's Charlotte?
- I think she's a girl.

188
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,805
Can't she talk?

189
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,003
No. She's different.

190
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:56,683
She's... mechanical.

191
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,085
Oh, a mechanical girl!

192
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,640
- What do you talk about?
- Nothing.

193
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,206
She hardly ever talks now.

194
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:14,483
Oh, well, then maybe
we should go and see her.

195
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,684
Do you know where she is?

196
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:20,646
Upstairs.

197
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,278
I didn't think anybody
could live upstairs.

198
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:35,439
I'll tell you what.
If this Charlotte comes back,

199
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:38,161
you and I can have
a word with her, OK?

200
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:40,156
OK.

201
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:43,405
Good night.

202
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:12,920
Shit.

203
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:29,597
It's OK, everyone back
to bed, let's go.

204
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:32,165
Let's go, honey, it's OK.

205
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:38,756
- Richard darling, it's OK.
- What was it?

206
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:42,005
I don't know, it was
the pipes or something.

207
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,045
It was her.

208
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:46,200
I told you.

209
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:50,160
She's angry.

210
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,401
I've been trying to call you
for the last ten minutes.

211
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,564
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

212
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:14,605
I heard something and
I thought maybe you heard it too.

213
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:17,596
- No, nothing.
- Really?

214
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:22,039
OK. So what am I supposed
to have heard?

215
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:27,604
I don't know, it sounded like it
was coming from the second floor.

216
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:33,195
- The second floor?
- It scared me and the children.

217
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:37,076
This is an old building. The
ceiling's full of ventilation pipes.

218
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:42,718
You'll get used to it.

219
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:47,199
- I can call Dr. Kerry if you like.
- No.

220
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,405
It's OK.

221
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,923
Oh, cool.

222
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,681
Hey you lot,
steady on, don't push.

223
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,639
Do we get to ride the helicopter?

224
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,525
I'm afraid not.

225
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:56,120
Hey Amy,

226
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:57,806
how's it going?

227
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,156
I'm showing that film
to the kids tonight.

228
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:05,042
It's the last one, so it's gonna be
pretty special. Hope you can join us.

229
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:07,444
Yeah, I'll be there.

230
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,285
Something the matter, Amy?

231
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:15,362
- I'm a little worried, I guess.
- Worried already? You just got here.

232
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:18,718
It's one of the little girls.

233
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:22,644
She's obsessed with the idea
that somebody's living upstairs.

234
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:25,082
Ah, don't tell me.
Charlotte again, right?

235
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,755
Hey, don't let it get to you.
It's not the first time.

236
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:32,199
Listen, I've been here
for donkey's years,

237
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:35,325
and there's always been some kid
who's sworn they've seen her.

238
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:37,838
She's practically an urban legend.

239
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:42,598
Don't worry about it too much.
I'll see you later.

240
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:16,004
I don't care about the helicopter,
I just want to leave, today.

241
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,556
You're going to have to wait
a bit longer. Be patient, OK?

242
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:20,319
- She's scared.
- No, I'm not!

243
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:23,126
Don't be silly.
What's there to be scared of?

244
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:25,841
- Last night.
- Why? What happened?

245
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:27,480
Nothing.

246
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:31,403
The pipes went crazy and we all
got a little scared, that's all.

247
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:36,238
- Feeling more relaxed?
- Yeah.

248
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:39,917
Maggie and I are getting
to know each other a little.

249
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:45,318
You know,
be careful with that girl.

250
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:47,478
She can be a bit... difficult.

251
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,243
Anyway, now you're here, do you
mind taking over for a second?

252
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:54,080
- Sure.
- Thanks.

253
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:56,960
Hey, Simon, let's get
your coat on. It's freezing.

254
00:27:57,127 --> 00:27:58,799
We ready to roll?

255
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:01,084
Yeah, almost we're ready to roll.

256
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:03,479
You must be Amy.

257
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:05,524
Dr. Kerry. Robert.

258
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:09,276
- Hi.
- Hi.

259
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:11,963
I thought you had the night shift.

260
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:16,086
Ah, well, I do. But I wasn't
going to let Simon here

261
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:18,283
sneak off without saying goodbye.

262
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:24,364
- We're old mates, aren't we?
- Yeah.

263
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:29,357
Matt tells me there was a bit
of a party here last night.

264
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,918
Oh, no, it was nothing.

265
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:33,960
It was... spooked.

266
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:37,080
Well, this place can be a little
spooky during the nights

267
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:40,877
but also incredibly boring,
so give me a bell next time.

268
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,958
- Helen, five minutes.
- OK.

269
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:48,407
Children, come
and say goodbye to Simon.

270
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,997
Have you ever been
in a helicopter before?

271
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,998
- No.
- Me neither.

272
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:02,006
- I'll see you later.
- After all I'm not going to the movie.

273
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,806
Ah, you won't miss much.
It's a load of rubbish.

274
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:07,885
- Yeah.
- You cheer up. You get better now.

275
00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:09,556
Yeah.

276
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:12,245
Amy!

277
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:16,363
Don't use the nurse's toilet,
there's no running water.

278
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:18,239
No shit.

279
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:36,685
Susan, are you alright?

280
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:41,440
No.

281
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:50,476
What's wrong?

282
00:29:51,887 --> 00:29:53,115
I don't know.

283
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,119
Hey! Roy!

284
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:10,362
Ah, there we go.

285
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:15,718
It's going the wrong way.

286
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:28,557
Don't worry.
It'll go back down in a minute.

287
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:33,479
Roy!

288
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,400
Simon?

289
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,205
What's wrong, Amy?

290
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:48,640
What the hell?

291
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:55,561
I'll go and get the key, OK?

292
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:57,606
You, you stay here.

293
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:59,200
Stay there.

294
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:04,563
- Simon, where's your inhaler?
- I want to get out!

295
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:06,604
No, Simon, where's your inhaler?

296
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:11,201
OK, it's OK,

297
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:14,518
Just breathe normally, it's OK.

298
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:21,447
What the fuck?

299
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:24,001
Oh shit!

300
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:37,043
- She wants to hurt me.
- What?

301
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:39,119
The mechanical girl.

302
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:41,240
Maggie told me about her.

303
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,285
For Christ sake! Don't move!

304
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:51,561
- We're coming up to get you, OK?
- Stay there, don't move!

305
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,041
Just hang on Amy! Hang on!

306
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:56,362
- What's going on?
- Just get Dr. Marcus.

307
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:05,040
- Amy...
- No, it's OK.

308
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:07,397
Stay still.
Oh my God.

309
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,239
Stay calm, Amy.

310
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:12,878
All right? Don't move, Amy.

311
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:16,278
For Christ's sake, don't move.

312
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:22,477
C'mon, downstairs, c'mon!

313
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,241
The kids have settled down at last.

314
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:41,077
- I'm sorry.
- Nonsense.

315
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:42,726
None of this was your fault.

316
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:46,762
I'm glad it wasn't me.
I don't know what I'd have done.

317
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:49,084
I got stuck in a lift once,

318
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:52,364
six whole hours!
And my mother was there with me.

319
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:55,525
- Lf you knew her, she...
- Miss Pérez,

320
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:59,278
- go look in on the children.
- I just did.

321
00:34:00,927 --> 00:34:02,599
Then do it again.

322
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,761
You should get some rest.
I'll work your shift.

323
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:12,201
No, I'm OK.

324
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:15,922
- Thanks.
- OK.

325
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:17,960
As you wish.

326
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,958
Some species...

327
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:46,716
Matt?

328
00:35:58,367 --> 00:35:59,482
Amy,

329
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:01,924
I know what you've done.

330
00:36:02,087 --> 00:36:03,725
What a day, huh?

331
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:08,036
Sorry, did I scare you?

332
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,080
What's up?

333
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:14,960
Nothing.

334
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:18,118
Nothing, it doesn't matter, I...

335
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,283
What are you doing?

336
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:25,436
Nothing.

337
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:28,798
Need a hand?

338
00:36:37,007 --> 00:36:39,726
How are you getting on
with the kids? All right?

339
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:43,004
Fine, yeah, everything's
going really well.

340
00:36:43,447 --> 00:36:45,278
Especially me and Maggie.

341
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:47,961
Yeah, you've really taken
a shine to her, haven't you?

342
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,678
She's an orphan, isn't she?

343
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:54,318
And cystic fibrosis.

344
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,364
Lucky draw.

345
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:58,837
- Yeah...
- It's really severe.

346
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:01,607
All we can do is to make it
as easy for her as possible.

347
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,200
I suppose...

348
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,963
the business with Susan
didn't exactly help.

349
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:09,686
What do you mean?

350
00:37:10,287 --> 00:37:12,881
Maggie was really fond of her

351
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:16,556
and she doesn't
make friends easily.

352
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:24,436
I'm feeling a little cold,
I'm going to go get a sweater.

353
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,520
Maggie!

354
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,957
- What are you doing here?
- Did you see her?

355
00:37:47,127 --> 00:37:50,164
Maggie, not again! We're not going
to talk about this any more.

356
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:55,204
But you went up in the lift.
You must have seen her.

357
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:58,643
I didn't see her, because
there isn't anybody to see.

358
00:37:59,287 --> 00:38:01,039
She doesn't exist.

359
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:02,962
Only here.

360
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:06,718
I'm not making it up, Amy.

361
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:10,722
She was the one who hurt Simon.

362
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:12,878
Nobody hurt Simon.

363
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:16,840
So why can't anyone
explain what happened?

364
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:22,285
Ask Susan.

365
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:24,479
She'll tell you.

366
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,966
Robert, I want you
to tell me what happened.

367
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:00,646
To Simon.

368
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:05,083
He fractured his femur.

369
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:07,318
Double fracture. Why?

370
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:11,364
Well, in this X-ray
there was one fracture.

371
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,446
Just one.

372
00:39:16,207 --> 00:39:19,483
This one was taken
3 minutes later. There are two.

373
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,199
How do you explain that?

374
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:26,046
Look, we don't know
what happened with him.

375
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:30,366
That's why he was under observation
and why he's been sent to London.

376
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:32,643
Susan left because
she was afraid, didn't she?

377
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:37,197
- Where are you going with this?
- Tell me.

378
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:46,197
OK, maybe she did.

379
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:19,119
Hi.

380
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:22,557
I'm sorry to bother you.

381
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:25,918
I wanted to talk to Susan.

382
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:37,919
It's all right.

383
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,166
Thank you.

384
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:45,566
Forgive her.

385
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,439
Are you a friend of Susan's?

386
00:40:48,327 --> 00:40:50,443
No. I actually don't know her.

387
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:52,325
I just wanted to talk to her.

388
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:54,843
I work at the hospital.

389
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:58,598
Susan died yesterday.

390
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:01,557
Her car skidded off the road.

391
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:03,844
It's a terrible tragedy.

392
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,519
I'm really sorry.

393
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:15,725
You're worried, too,
aren't you?

394
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:21,078
Susan was.

395
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:25,281
Ever since she was a little girl

396
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:27,961
she told me all her problems.
She trusted me.

397
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:30,598
But lately she'd become evasive.

398
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:34,125
I'd say she was scared
about something.

399
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,556
Well, Susan told me nothing.

400
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,959
Whatever it was,

401
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:44,000
she decided to look
for help of another kind.

402
00:41:45,607 --> 00:41:47,438
What kind of help?

403
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:49,965
Happy birthday, little princess.

404
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:54,281
It's taken me a long time
to find you, but here you are

405
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:58,606
and now that you're 16, the time
has come for you to be

406
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,116
completely under my spell.

407
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:06,158
Rose...

408
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,319
Rose!

409
00:42:19,527 --> 00:42:21,119
Don't touch anything!

410
00:42:21,327 --> 00:42:25,036
I won't let anyone interfere
in keeping her from dying.

411
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:37,999
I can't wait to see

412
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:41,796
your faces when I hand over
to you your daughter's body,

413
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,320
Rose.

414
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:52,847
Wake up, Rose.

415
00:42:57,047 --> 00:42:58,480
Wake up.

416
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,037
Good heavens, that's terrible.

417
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:22,438
I had no idea.

418
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,601
Why did you go and see her?
I don't understand.

419
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:33,761
I wanted to find out
what was she so afraid of.

420
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:36,878
What the hell
are you talking about?

421
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:40,156
You saw what happened in the lift.

422
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:44,320
- And I've heard things.
- Things?

423
00:43:45,127 --> 00:43:47,925
You're surely not talking
about ghosts?

424
00:43:51,687 --> 00:43:53,803
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like
to write a letter of condolence

425
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,446
to Susan's family.

426
00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:57,723
Do you know who Charlotte is?

427
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:02,642
One of the little girls,
Maggie talks about...

428
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:03,956
Miss Nichols,

429
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:07,597
Maggie is a very special little
girl as I'm sure you've realised.

430
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:11,006
If she wants to let her imagination
run away with her, let her do it,

431
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:13,158
but I think you're a little
too old for that, don't you?

432
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,836
I think somebody needs
to take responsibility.

433
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:18,805
Responsibility?
Don't make me laugh.

434
00:44:19,127 --> 00:44:21,243
Miss Nichols, I know
exactly who you are.

435
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:23,996
I'm sure you realise I would
not have employed you

436
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:25,919
without first looking up
your record.

437
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:29,684
So don't make me
regret my decision.

438
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:41,757
OK everybody, did you enjoy it?

439
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,562
Right, bedtime now.

440
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:47,521
Come on. All of you.
Come on, kids.

441
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:09,762
I can't believe it.
Maggie without her Mr. Sleepy!

442
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:18,125
- D'you know what I think?
- What?

443
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:20,881
I think the Prince saves her

444
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:23,682
because he's in love.

445
00:46:24,807 --> 00:46:27,799
- That's what I think too.
- That's why he kisses her.

446
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,395
But it has to be a love kiss.

447
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,725
A love kiss?

448
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:35,806
Yeah.

449
00:46:38,207 --> 00:46:41,119
How do you know when a kiss
is a love kiss?

450
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:45,087
'Cause it's on the mouth.

451
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:55,082
Did Simon come back?

452
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:01,925
Amy!

453
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:05,638
Don't touch her.

454
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,044
What's going on?

455
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:55,878
- You can ask the children.
- I already have, Amy.

456
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,765
And all they saw
was you panicking.

457
00:47:58,087 --> 00:48:01,318
- It's no wonder they were scared.
- Something happened in that room.

458
00:48:01,527 --> 00:48:03,324
- Why don't you believe me?
- I do,

459
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:06,400
but I'm also sure that there's
a reasonable explanation.

460
00:48:06,607 --> 00:48:09,201
- Maggie says she's seen her.
- Maggie is a kid, all right?

461
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,678
Maggie probably has seen her.

462
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:14,003
There was something
under that sheet!

463
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:16,243
Amy, you have got
to pull yourself together.

464
00:48:19,727 --> 00:48:21,638
The kids are fine now.

465
00:48:24,087 --> 00:48:26,760
- Unless you need anything else...
- No, it's fine, thanks.

466
00:48:26,927 --> 00:48:28,519
I'll be downstairs.

467
00:48:40,847 --> 00:48:42,883
If you want,
I can take over your...

468
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:45,958
They're probably not gonna help.

469
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:48,118
How the hell do you know,
you know nothing about me.

470
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:52,405
No, I don't. But I do know
what happened to you.

471
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,325
Folder told me.

472
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:58,638
And it was a mistake.

473
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,198
It was a mistake.

474
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:12,557
Yeah... That's
what I should have told...

475
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:15,762
- Come on...
...his mom. That it was a mistake.

476
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:20,198
No, it was
fucking negligence, Robert.

477
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:23,041
It was fucking negligence.

478
00:49:23,367 --> 00:49:26,598
- Shut the fuck... Don't touch me!
- It's a hard job,

479
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:28,883
God knows it's a hard job.

480
00:49:30,807 --> 00:49:33,116
And it can be a heartbreaking job.

481
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:38,603
And we're all gonna make mistakes,

482
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,327
I've made so many mistakes,
but you can't

483
00:49:41,487 --> 00:49:44,445
- lug them with you your whole life.
- No, please.

484
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:47,765
Please do not tell me
how to feel, OK?

485
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:51,403
All I'm saying is that maybe
that's what's making you scared,

486
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:53,797
the fact that you're worried
about doing something wrong.

487
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:06,845
Listen to me,

488
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:10,916
it's the first time you've been
back to work since it happened.

489
00:50:11,647 --> 00:50:14,719
It's completely natural
you might not be over it yet.

490
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,321
Are you suggesting that
I've been making all this up?

491
00:50:17,487 --> 00:50:19,284
That I have gone completely insane?

492
00:50:19,527 --> 00:50:23,202
I am saying that it's possible that
you're overprotecting the kids

493
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:25,279
because you're scared.

494
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:28,724
You're scared of yourself, I don't
know, I'm trying to figure it out,

495
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:30,957
and believe it or not
I'm actually trying to help!

496
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:32,685
Go to hell.

497
00:51:05,447 --> 00:51:07,244
It's really pretty.

498
00:51:09,287 --> 00:51:10,959
What is it?

499
00:51:14,247 --> 00:51:17,956
I'm afraid he won't answer you.
Adam is autistic.

500
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:21,560
He often isn't
really aware of us.

501
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:31,719
Father Tom rang
to say you might call.

502
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:35,682
And it's not like "Doubting Thomas"
to push people in our direction.

503
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:38,162
He told me that you
had spoke with Susan.

504
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:42,605
Susan came to see us
a few weeks ago.

505
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:47,281
Many people do when they're
frightened or need answers.

506
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:49,638
But it's not that easy.

507
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:54,238
Do you know what life is,
Miss Nichols?

508
00:51:55,127 --> 00:51:57,436
It's nothing more than a journey

509
00:51:57,727 --> 00:51:59,445
between two worlds.

510
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:01,643
Ours, the world of the living,

511
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:04,476
and the world of those
who have died.

512
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:10,127
You see, these two worlds
are separate.

513
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:13,724
Those of us in this world
cannot see the other,

514
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,083
however much we may wish to.

515
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:18,358
It's not for us, not yet.

516
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:21,005
But there are some who,

517
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:24,079
when they are drawing
near to the other world,

518
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:27,042
are able to glimpse things in it

519
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:30,324
that have come close to this one.

520
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:34,485
Susan was drawing near.

521
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:36,639
She was dying.

522
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:39,517
That's why she could see.

523
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:44,319
Charlotte...

524
00:52:45,487 --> 00:52:49,275
I'm afraid there is something in
that hospital from the other world

525
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,602
that, for some reason,
has come close to ours.

526
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:56,641
Something that doesn't accept

527
00:52:57,687 --> 00:52:59,325
or doesn't understand

528
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,398
that it has died.

529
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:05,403
Someone who's died in the hospital?

530
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:09,402
It's not where they died.
It's not even where they lived.

531
00:53:09,727 --> 00:53:11,604
It's much simpler than that.

532
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:15,962
They simply stay
near what they loved.

533
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,563
That's what keeps them here.

534
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:24,566
Oh, Adam!

535
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,637
Well, it seems he was
aware of you after all.

536
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:33,125
He's never given anyone
a present before.

537
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,475
There's someone else who says
that she can see her.

538
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:43,922
I know.
Susan told us.

539
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:47,800
That little girl needs your love,

540
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:50,242
she really needs it.

541
00:54:04,647 --> 00:54:07,320
- She has trouble breathing.
- That's right.

542
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:19,558
- Folder was looking for you.
- What's wrong?

543
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:21,925
Maggie...

544
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,398
Just a minute.

545
00:54:35,047 --> 00:54:37,242
That's all right.
She's stable now.

546
00:54:43,887 --> 00:54:45,684
She had another attack.

547
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,087
To be honest,
we're used to it by now.

548
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:11,236
Hi.

549
00:55:11,447 --> 00:55:13,517
Hi. How are you?

550
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:15,598
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

551
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:17,598
- I parked it outside.
- Thanks.

552
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:20,242
- Roy.
- Yeah?

553
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:23,087
Do you remember the children
you told me about, the ones

554
00:55:23,247 --> 00:55:25,203
who used to talk about Charlotte?

555
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:28,117
I need you to do me another favour.

556
00:55:31,487 --> 00:55:33,159
Amy...

557
00:55:34,807 --> 00:55:38,243
I don't know if this is right.
These files are confidential.

558
00:55:38,847 --> 00:55:41,566
- I don't care.
- OK, well...

559
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:47,004
The ones we're
looking for I think...

560
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,323
Marvin Jones.

561
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,439
That was years ago.

562
00:56:03,087 --> 00:56:05,476
He often used to talk about her.

563
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:07,319
I can still remember him.

564
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:12,322
Right little tearaway he was.
Died on the operating table.

565
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:14,925
Poor sod.

566
00:56:20,567 --> 00:56:23,604
Evelyn Thomas.
From back in the eighties.

567
00:56:27,887 --> 00:56:29,957
A real angel.

568
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:33,681
A "secret friend" she used to call her.

569
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,965
Forget it.
Doesn't matter.

570
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:47,078
Amy? Amy, what's going on?

571
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:49,438
I still don't know.

572
00:56:53,887 --> 00:56:55,878
Maggie, I'm going to ask you a question.

573
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,597
And I need you
to tell me the truth.

574
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:01,844
Now you promise?

575
00:57:04,247 --> 00:57:05,726
It's about Charlotte...

576
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,402
Have you really seen her?

577
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:49,164
We'll be leaving now.

578
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:57,444
- How are the children?
- They're with Helen.

579
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,162
They don't seem to be
aware of anything.

580
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:01,806
So much the better.
What about Maggie?

581
00:59:01,967 --> 00:59:04,879
She's fine.
We took her back to the ward.

582
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,476
She'll be more settled
with the others.

583
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,286
What now?

584
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:13,398
- How are you going to explain this?
- Oh, Miss Nichols...

585
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:15,956
This man is dead! And nobody
an explain how it happened!

586
00:59:16,127 --> 00:59:18,322
- What about Simon? And all the...
- Amy...

587
00:59:18,487 --> 00:59:20,125
I don't give a damn
what you think!

588
00:59:20,367 --> 00:59:23,006
We've got to get
those children out of here!

589
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:27,044
There is something evil
in that hospital.

590
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:30,765
We're all worried about what's
happened, we're doing all we can.

591
00:59:31,247 --> 00:59:33,477
You'd better get a grip on yourself.

592
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:36,962
Maybe I did make a mistake
with you after all.

593
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,277
- Jesus Christ!
- Amy.

594
00:59:40,087 --> 00:59:41,839
- Listen.
- What?

595
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,243
It's not gonna get better by
getting pissed off with everybody.

596
00:59:44,407 --> 00:59:46,762
Then what do you want me to do?
Stuff myself with pills

597
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:48,645
and pretend as if nothing's
happening like the rest of you?

598
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:50,838
Run away, like Susan?

599
00:59:51,247 --> 00:59:53,397
No, Robert, I'm not gonna do that.

600
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:56,243
I'm not gonna let those kids
down, not this time.

601
00:59:56,447 --> 00:59:58,438
I'm not gonna mess up again.

602
01:00:07,047 --> 01:00:08,446
Helen.

603
01:00:10,447 --> 01:00:12,438
What a pain, huh?

604
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:16,159
Y'know, it was fine
when I left this morning

605
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:18,358
and now look,

606
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:22,279
it's pouring down. All you get
here is rain, rain, rain.

607
01:00:22,727 --> 01:00:24,922
I wish I'd never left Madrid.

608
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:28,005
I've no umbrella. I've got
to walk all the way home

609
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,840
and the last thing I feel like is
washing this fucking dumb uniform.

610
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:32,679
Helen, for God's sake.

611
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:35,839
Don't you see what's going on?
Roy is dead.

612
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:44,079
You knew...

613
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:47,885
- Susan told you, didn't she?
- No.

614
01:00:48,807 --> 01:00:51,116
- You know, Susan was mad.
- No,

615
01:00:51,767 --> 01:00:52,995
she wasn't.

616
01:00:53,647 --> 01:00:57,481
Stop pretending that nothing is going
on. It's not going to help us.

617
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:00,000
Now please.

618
01:01:01,487 --> 01:01:03,603
Just cover for me.

619
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,237
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

620
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:23,276
Dr. Kerry said I could get up
whenever I want.

621
01:01:35,127 --> 01:01:36,685
There.

622
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:42,445
- How do you know?
- Susan told me.

623
01:01:52,247 --> 01:01:54,602
Maggie, you need to go to bed.

624
01:01:55,207 --> 01:01:57,721
No please, Maggie,
you're still not feeling well.

625
01:02:00,327 --> 01:02:02,557
Go.

626
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:27,923
Amy, run.

627
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,566
Run!

628
01:07:44,447 --> 01:07:46,881
- Get into bed.
- Where the hell did you both get to?

629
01:07:47,087 --> 01:07:48,884
- Where's Folder?
- She went home.

630
01:07:49,327 --> 01:07:52,080
- My Mr. Sleepy.
- Maggie, please, get into bed.

631
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:57,200
- Amy...
- Just stay here.

632
01:08:04,607 --> 01:08:06,837
Damn it, Robert, look at her.

633
01:08:07,247 --> 01:08:09,397
It's just a photo, Amy.

634
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:11,844
There are a lot of girls
called Charlotte.

635
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:13,685
The mechanical girl.

636
01:08:18,847 --> 01:08:20,405
Please.

637
01:09:03,447 --> 01:09:05,483
There is no Charlotte.

638
01:09:09,327 --> 01:09:11,397
Where's Roy's projector?

639
01:09:36,687 --> 01:09:38,518
What is this?

640
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:41,842
Osteogenesis imperfecta.

641
01:09:42,727 --> 01:09:45,195
Brittle bone disease.

642
01:09:46,447 --> 01:09:47,846
It's quite rare.

643
01:09:48,007 --> 01:09:51,477
A sort of mutation of the bone
tissue that causes it to diminish,

644
01:09:52,207 --> 01:09:54,880
the bones become abnormally fragile

645
01:09:55,087 --> 01:09:57,282
and extremely prone to fractures.

646
01:10:01,807 --> 01:10:03,206
Christ.

647
01:10:03,647 --> 01:10:06,525
They certainly didn't know
much about it in those days.

648
01:10:07,047 --> 01:10:09,766
The treatments were
fairly primitive.

649
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:19,405
Oh my God...

650
01:10:22,687 --> 01:10:25,440
Tantrums are pretty common
in these cases.

651
01:10:26,007 --> 01:10:28,316
Pain turns to rage.

652
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:31,806
Robert,

653
01:10:32,407 --> 01:10:35,444
I don't know how, but this
little girl is still here.

654
01:10:39,487 --> 01:10:41,796
- Please...
- No, Maggie was telling the truth.

655
01:10:41,967 --> 01:10:43,446
She did see her.

656
01:10:45,727 --> 01:10:47,524
And so did Susan.

657
01:10:49,567 --> 01:10:51,159
That's why she left.

658
01:10:52,287 --> 01:10:54,596
All right, so why just them?
It doesn't make sense.

659
01:10:54,847 --> 01:10:56,644
Susan was going to die.

660
01:10:57,127 --> 01:11:00,164
You have to be close to see,
and she was.

661
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,245
And Maggie...

662
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:05,919
You know.

663
01:11:11,247 --> 01:11:14,239
Think about it.
Think about everything that's happened.

664
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,201
She wants to make everybody
suffer the way she did.

665
01:11:17,567 --> 01:11:19,683
That's why she breaks things.
She is full of rage.

666
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:23,681
- It is happening again.
- Amy, this was forty years ago.

667
01:11:23,967 --> 01:11:26,925
- So why is it happening now?
- I don't know why.

668
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,562
But I know that she's here.

669
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,997
It's absurd, you can't ask me
to believe this...

670
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:36,203
I've seen her too.

671
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:40,840
- What?
- She was there.

672
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:45,717
Right before my eyes.

673
01:11:53,527 --> 01:11:56,325
Right, let's get out of here.

674
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:02,880
I'll call St. James's.
Marcus is there.

675
01:12:03,247 --> 01:12:06,080
I'll tell him it's an emergency.
They'll come and get us.

676
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,566
Oh Christ.

677
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:11,839
I want you upstairs with Helen,
and start to get the kids ready.

678
01:12:12,047 --> 01:12:14,242
- We're leaving.
- What's going on?

679
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:18,122
- Move! Fuck! I can't get a signal.
- Fuck!

680
01:12:18,287 --> 01:12:20,847
- It must be the storm.
- Fuck!

681
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,123
Folder lives just down on the beach.

682
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:26,676
- I could use her phone.
- No.

683
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:29,438
I'll go.

684
01:12:44,567 --> 01:12:46,444
Come on kids, put your coats on!

685
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:48,997
- Are we leaving?
- Yep, we are.

686
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:51,927
- Up in the helicopter?
- No. Not tonight, Nicholas.

687
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:55,402
- ¿Where's Amy?
- Maggie?

688
01:12:55,767 --> 01:12:57,519
Emma, come here!

689
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:01,636
- Helen...
- I'm coming, sweetie. Jimmy!

690
01:13:07,807 --> 01:13:10,116
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

691
01:13:10,527 --> 01:13:12,757
She's getting angry.

692
01:13:35,767 --> 01:13:38,998
Richard's hyperventilating.
He's gonna need a portable unit.

693
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:41,880
Try in the basement. I think there's
still some equipment down there.

694
01:13:43,967 --> 01:13:47,403
- I'll be back in a minute.
- I'm going to take this out.

695
01:14:00,127 --> 01:14:01,401
What are you doing here?

696
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:04,798
- Why aren't you with the children?
- We have to get them out of there.

697
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:08,363
You have to call St. James's
and tell them to come, now!

698
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,325
Have you gone insane?

699
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:13,001
Please...

700
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,080
OK.

701
01:14:26,207 --> 01:14:29,517
It's only the needle that's broken.
I'll get it out. Don't panic.

702
01:14:32,687 --> 01:14:34,439
Get back!

703
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,004
Get back, I said!

704
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,201
We've got it!

705
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:21,965
It's the glass girl.

706
01:15:22,847 --> 01:15:25,156
You should have worked it out.

707
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:29,196
- You should have listened to me.
- How did you expect me to?

708
01:15:29,727 --> 01:15:32,036
It's all so absurd.

709
01:15:34,407 --> 01:15:37,080
I had just arrived when it happened.

710
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:39,843
It was a scandal.

711
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:43,444
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Her nurse...

712
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,076
They brought her in
to take care of the girl.

713
01:15:47,367 --> 01:15:50,200
- What happened?
- I don't know exactly.

714
01:15:50,887 --> 01:15:53,162
The girl had started to improve.

715
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:56,881
The doctors were going
to send her to another hospital,

716
01:15:57,047 --> 01:15:58,605
but she had a sudden relapse.

717
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,481
It baffled everyone
until they found out.

718
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:03,646
What?

719
01:16:04,487 --> 01:16:07,559
The nurse was accused of
provoking the child's fractures.

720
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:12,082
She didn't want her to be taken
away, she'd become obsessed with her.

721
01:16:14,007 --> 01:16:16,567
An inquiry was conducted
and she was fired.

722
01:16:17,087 --> 01:16:20,204
She couldn't bear the idea of
being separated from the children.

723
01:16:21,287 --> 01:16:24,245
- And then it happened.
- What did she do?

724
01:16:26,767 --> 01:16:28,519
She suffocated her.

725
01:16:29,527 --> 01:16:33,281
She put on the orthopaedic limbs and
she threw herself into the lift shaft.

726
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:37,237
You can't imagine the uproar.

727
01:16:37,607 --> 01:16:40,360
At one point they were going
to close down the hospital.

728
01:16:42,487 --> 01:16:46,116
Eventually they just shut off the
second floor and it was all forgotten.

729
01:17:43,447 --> 01:17:45,756
Come on, come on! Fuck!

730
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:47,882
Helen?

731
01:18:49,487 --> 01:18:51,842
- Where have you been?
- Is everybody ready to go?

732
01:18:52,007 --> 01:18:54,726
Richard. Matt went to the basement
looking for a portable breathing unit.

733
01:18:55,127 --> 01:18:57,846
Please, stay with Richard.
Robert? Where's Robert?

734
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,436
I don't know!
I don't know where Robert is.

735
01:19:00,647 --> 01:19:02,842
I don't know where you were.
I don't know where anybody was.

736
01:19:03,047 --> 01:19:05,686
Just get the children out.
And stay together.

737
01:19:10,007 --> 01:19:11,360
Matt?

738
01:19:12,207 --> 01:19:14,960
- Amy.
- Robert, where were you?

739
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:16,686
It's not her.

740
01:19:17,607 --> 01:19:19,643
The girl's name was
Mandy Phillips.

741
01:19:20,007 --> 01:19:21,486
It's all there.

742
01:19:24,567 --> 01:19:27,035
Her nurse was called
Charlotte Rivers.

743
01:19:33,807 --> 01:19:35,206
She's different.

744
01:19:35,767 --> 01:19:37,564
She's mechanical.

745
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:41,877
They simply stay
near what they loved.

746
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:45,117
That's why it's started now.

747
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:47,726
Why?

748
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:51,443
She was causing the girl's fractures
so they wouldn't take her away.

749
01:19:53,047 --> 01:19:55,003
She's doing the same thing again.

750
01:19:57,007 --> 01:20:00,556
She's been here all these years
because she needs the children.

751
01:20:01,367 --> 01:20:03,676
Come on, let's go.

752
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:11,558
It started when they were
being transferred.

753
01:20:13,447 --> 01:20:15,119
Let's go!

754
01:20:17,087 --> 01:20:18,839
Helen!

755
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,966
What?

756
01:20:23,567 --> 01:20:25,797
OK. It's gonna be OK.

757
01:20:26,007 --> 01:20:28,999
- She won't let them leave.
- We've got to keep them here.

758
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:37,041
Come on.

759
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,203
Quick, run!

760
01:20:41,287 --> 01:20:42,686
- Helen, no!
- What?

761
01:20:42,847 --> 01:20:45,202
- Go back!
- Get them back here!

762
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:48,843
- We need to get out of here.
- Helen, you have to trust us.

763
01:20:59,807 --> 01:21:02,924
- We might be wrong about this.
- No!

764
01:21:18,287 --> 01:21:21,085
We received an emergency call
and we're going to evacuate.

765
01:21:21,367 --> 01:21:23,278
Robert, do something!

766
01:21:23,607 --> 01:21:25,199
You can't take these kids
out of here!

767
01:21:25,487 --> 01:21:27,557
No!

768
01:21:29,207 --> 01:21:31,437
I'm the responsible paediatrician

769
01:21:31,607 --> 01:21:34,041
and I'm telling you these kids
are in grave danger.

770
01:21:34,487 --> 01:21:36,557
- The oxygen pump, where?
- It's through here.

771
01:21:39,847 --> 01:21:41,326
Wait a minute.

772
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:44,397
Why isn't anything happening?

773
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:47,481
I don't know. I don't get it.

774
01:21:48,327 --> 01:21:50,238
Maybe it's okay.

775
01:21:50,527 --> 01:21:53,121
I'll take him now.
Come on...

776
01:22:00,007 --> 01:22:01,884
Dr. Kerry, please.

777
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:06,000
Where's Maggie?

778
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:08,519
I can't find her.

779
01:22:15,367 --> 01:22:17,562
Helen.

780
01:22:18,287 --> 01:22:20,039
Where's Maggie?

781
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:22,999
Helen, where is Maggie?

782
01:22:23,447 --> 01:22:25,802
She wanted her blanket.

783
01:22:30,127 --> 01:22:31,685
Oh my God.

784
01:22:32,207 --> 01:22:34,277
- Upstairs!
- What?

785
01:22:35,927 --> 01:22:38,282
That's why she's not doing anything.

786
01:22:39,847 --> 01:22:41,838
She's got Maggie.

787
01:23:01,967 --> 01:23:03,798
Maggie!

788
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:19,960
Amy!

789
01:23:21,447 --> 01:23:22,846
Amy!

790
01:23:27,767 --> 01:23:29,678
I wanted Mr. Sleepy.

791
01:23:30,247 --> 01:23:33,239
It's OK, angel, don't worry,
we're gonna...

792
01:23:35,567 --> 01:23:36,920
No!

793
01:23:38,207 --> 01:23:40,721
- She's not going to let me go...
- It's OK.

794
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:43,238
It's OK, Maggie.

795
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,604
Don't move.

796
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:55,642
No, no, it's going to be OK.

797
01:23:59,767 --> 01:24:02,839
Listen to me very carefully, you're
oing to have to stay here now.

798
01:24:03,927 --> 01:24:06,646
It's OK, honey.

799
01:24:07,447 --> 01:24:09,438
She's going to take
very good care of you,

800
01:24:09,607 --> 01:24:11,996
- she's very kind.
- No. Amy, please!

801
01:24:12,487 --> 01:24:14,682
You'll be very happy here.

802
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:19,842
Hold on to Mr. Sleepy.

803
01:24:20,247 --> 01:24:22,317
As tight as you can.

804
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:41,883
We found a male nurse
in the basement.

805
01:25:42,047 --> 01:25:44,277
He presents multiple
serious body fractures.

806
01:25:44,447 --> 01:25:45,721
He's still alive.

807
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:52,120
Maggie...

808
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:04,763
Maggie...

809
01:26:15,447 --> 01:26:17,438
No, please...

810
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,286
Amy!

811
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,758
No! She's...

812
01:26:28,327 --> 01:26:30,397
She's dead!

813
01:26:34,007 --> 01:26:36,237
I'll send someone up to help you.

814
01:26:43,527 --> 01:26:44,960
It doesn't matter.

815
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,556
It's over now.
The children...

816
01:26:48,927 --> 01:26:50,485
are gone.

817
01:26:52,447 --> 01:26:54,483
There's nothing to keep her here.

818
01:26:56,407 --> 01:26:58,204
She's gone.

819
01:27:05,207 --> 01:27:07,277
I saw her.

820
01:27:09,047 --> 01:27:10,878
I'm going to die.

821
01:27:14,407 --> 01:27:16,602
I don't care what you saw.

822
01:27:16,767 --> 01:27:19,327
I'm going to get you out of here, OK?

823
01:27:22,847 --> 01:27:25,759
She's lost a lot of blood.

824
01:27:26,327 --> 01:27:28,477
We need three units.

825
01:27:30,087 --> 01:27:31,839
She's not breathing.

826
01:27:32,567 --> 01:27:34,046
I have to defib.

827
01:27:36,527 --> 01:27:37,926
Ready?

828
01:27:38,127 --> 01:27:40,516
- Let's go.
- We're losing her.

829
01:27:47,487 --> 01:27:49,603
Charging two hundred.

830
01:27:49,967 --> 01:27:51,161
Clear, please!

831
01:27:53,247 --> 01:27:54,316
Jesus Christ!

832
01:27:54,487 --> 01:27:57,081
Three sixty and clear please.

833
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,199
Fuck.

834
01:28:01,767 --> 01:28:03,041
Right, CPR.

835
01:28:04,767 --> 01:28:06,485
Come on Amy!

836
01:28:09,887 --> 01:28:12,355
Come on Amy!

837
01:28:16,527 --> 01:28:18,483
Come on, Amy! Come back!

838
01:28:18,647 --> 01:28:20,319
It's useless.

839
01:28:20,727 --> 01:28:22,001
Ah Christ.

840
01:28:22,407 --> 01:28:24,204
Charging three sixty again.

841
01:28:26,007 --> 01:28:27,156
And, clear please.

842
01:28:28,447 --> 01:28:30,597
- Goddammit!
- She's dead.

843
01:28:30,807 --> 01:28:33,958
Fuck. Charging three sixty
again please, and clear.

844
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:39,565
Come on Amy!
Charging again at three sixty.

845
01:28:39,727 --> 01:28:41,558
- Let it go.
- Goddammit!

846
01:28:41,807 --> 01:28:43,479
Let's go.

847
01:28:46,847 --> 01:28:49,839
Charging three sixty again...

848
01:29:06,527 --> 01:29:08,404
Do you know what I think?

849
01:29:09,247 --> 01:29:12,284
I think the Princess

850
01:29:12,927 --> 01:29:15,395
needs a kiss to be saved.

851
01:29:19,407 --> 01:29:21,716
A love kiss.

852
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,405
Charging three sixty and,
clear please.

853
01:29:43,047 --> 01:29:44,560
Amy!

854
01:29:51,807 --> 01:29:53,559
How are you feeling?

855
01:29:56,207 --> 01:29:58,118
You've got some visitors.

856
01:30:05,367 --> 01:30:07,756
We saw the report on the television.

857
01:30:08,847 --> 01:30:11,680
The doctor told us
what happened to you.

858
01:30:13,767 --> 01:30:15,883
You've been very lucky.

859
01:30:17,087 --> 01:30:18,679
Why?

860
01:30:19,767 --> 01:30:22,281
- You're still here.
- No.

861
01:30:25,847 --> 01:30:27,678
Why did I see her?

862
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:32,237
I shouldn't have...

863
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:34,995
Sometimes it's better not to ask.

864
01:30:39,287 --> 01:30:41,847
I think she'd better
get some rest now.

865
01:30:44,687 --> 01:30:45,836
Bye.

866
01:30:50,967 --> 01:30:52,798
Robert?

867
01:30:55,807 --> 01:30:57,718
Has anyone else come?

868
01:30:58,487 --> 01:31:00,523
Not that I know of. Why?

869
01:31:07,287 --> 01:31:09,926
Amy, you can't blame
yourself this time.

870
01:31:11,447 --> 01:31:13,677
That girl needed you,

871
01:31:14,807 --> 01:31:17,002
and you were there until the end.

872
01:31:18,687 --> 01:31:20,359
And she knew it.

873
01:31:23,447 --> 01:31:25,119
I know.

874
01:31:31,287 --> 01:31:33,437
Don't go too far away...

875
01:32:00,887 --> 01:32:03,162
It's not where they died.

876
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:06,195
Nor even where they lived.

877
01:32:07,447 --> 01:32:09,836
It's much simpler than that.

878
01:32:11,087 --> 01:32:14,363
They simply stay
near what they loved.

879
01:32:17,647 --> 01:32:20,002
That's what keeps them here.

880
01:32:23,567 --> 01:32:25,683
And nothing else...
