1
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
So what do you think the dream means?

2
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,720
That your vagina
is completely disease-infested.

3
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,440
Shut up. For real.

4
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,080
Okay, babies...

5
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,520
"Babies are symbolic
of change and renewal.

6
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,960
<i>"If the baby is a stranger to you,</i>

7
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,440
<i>"it may represent something
developing within yourself</i>

8
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,880
<i>"that is not yet ready to be born. "</i>

9
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
And it doesn't say anything
about babies in formaldehyde.

10
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,920
Okay, what about dogs?

11
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,520
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

12
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,200
"In mythology, the dog was often seen
as a messenger of the dead. "

13
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,000
Then it just goes on and on about
some more psychobabble bullshit.

14
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,280
So, where are the kids?

15
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,600
<i>Did you have to, like, change diapers
and shit like that?</i>

16
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,000
Nope, the baby
was down when I got here,

17
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,400
and the four-year-old,
he conked out as soon as I read to him.

18
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,360
Do you think they have porn
in their DVD collection?

19
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,400
Like I really want to know
what Mr Newton beats off to.

20
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,640
Well, it's not Mrs Newton, that's for sure.

21
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,560
<i>- Case?
- Hang on.</i>

22
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,400
<i>Look in the mirror.</i>

23
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,600
<i>Some people are doorways.</i>

24
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,080
Matty? Matty, are you up?

25
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,600
Hey, Rom, I think one of the kids is awake.
I'm going to call you back, okay?

26
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,560
<i>Good luck.
- All right.</i>

27
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,680
Keep looking.

28
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,200
Matty?

29
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Keep looking.

30
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
Keep looking.

31
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,960
What are you doing, Matty?

32
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,280
Keep looking.

33
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,000
Matty!

34
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,240
Matty, stop that. We have to go to bed now.

35
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,200
Matty!

36
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,760
Jumby wants to be born now.

37
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,600
Are you sure you're all right?

38
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,840
Yeah, no, it's fine, it's not a big deal.

39
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,440
I'd feel better if you'd had
your eye checked out.

40
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,400
Okay, I will.

41
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,240
I'll see you guys later, okay?

42
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,480
Hey, Dad.

43
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,960
- Hi, Case. How was sitting?
- Good.

44
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800
There's cheesecake from La Scarola,
if you want.

45
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Mmm, no, thanks. I'm just...
I'm gonna crash. Good night.

46
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,200
Oh, my God!

47
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,400
He was shining a mirror in the baby's face.
And then he hit me.

48
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,080
Okay, that's creepy.

49
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,560
The kid's like four. I mean, he probably
didn't even know what he was doing.

50
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
It's bad luck, you know.

51
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,360
Newborns aren't supposed to see their own
reflection till they're at least a year old.

52
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,800
It means they'll die soon.

53
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
According to whom?

54
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,400
It's just one of those superstitions,
you know.

55
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
You're retarded. She's retarded.

56
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,720
It's not like I'm saying I believe it,
I'm just saying it's one of those things.

57
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,680
Okay, so as far as we know,
the universe is roughly 15 billion years old.

58
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,960
Right?

59
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,280
So, if the universe had a beginning,
what happened before the beginning?

60
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,760
Einstein would tell us
that there was no before,

61
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,400
because time itself did not yet exist.

62
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,400
So here's another question for you.

63
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,400
How big is the universe?

64
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,640
Does the universe
just keep going on forever?

65
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,560
And if it doesn't just keep going on forever,
then what's beyond the edge?

66
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,640
Maybe yes, maybe no. Here's the catch.

67
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,680
Since our universe began...

68
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,040
<i>Jumby wants to be born now.</i>

69
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,200
...back where you started.

70
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,360
It'd be like walking into a mirror.

71
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,200
Is everything all right, Casey?

72
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,040
Yeah, I... I just need to get some air.

73
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,920
So he texts me, like, the day after
we went out. And he put, "I miss you. "

74
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,320
But then when I text him back,
he never replied.

75
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,880
And that was like two days ago.

76
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,880
Case.

77
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
- There's something wrong with your eye.
- What are you talking about?

78
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,800
I don't know, dude, I think you should look.

79
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,720
It's called heterochromia.

80
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,440
Meaning one iris
is a different colour than the other.

81
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,680
Usually, it's congenital.
Sometimes it occurs after a blunt trauma.

82
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,560
On very rare occasions,
it might be indicative

83
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,760
of a malignant melanoma of the iris.

84
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,960
In order to rule that out, I'll just need
to take a few digital pictures.

85
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,360
Okay.

86
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,720
I'll go ahead an insert a speculum
in order to keep your eyelids open.

87
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Oh, God.

88
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,680
Just relax and everything will be fine.

89
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,040
Ooh!

90
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,200
All right, you're doing great.

91
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,480
Okay, go ahead
and rest your chin right here.

92
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,160
And keep your head very still
while we take a few pictures, all right?

93
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,880
- Okay.
- All right.

94
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Good. Good.

95
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,240
- So, does it hurt?
- Mmm-mmm.

96
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,480
I think the light's just a little bright
because of the eye-drops that he gave me.

97
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,160
Baby, thank you for coming with me.
I know I'm such a pain in the ass right now.

98
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,160
Mmm-hmm! Yeah, you are, yeah.

99
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,440
The good news is that my dad's not gonna
be home till tomorrow morning.

100
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,760
- Does that mean what I think it means?
- Yes.

101
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,600
Great, 'cause, you know,
'cause those glasses, they're just...

102
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,080
They're definitely giving me wood.

103
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,760
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

104
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,400
Hey. You all right?

105
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,240
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

106
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,200
<i>You know,
it really screws with your head,</i>

107
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,320
<i>what Mr Shields was saying.</i>

108
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,760
That the universe doesn't have an end.
I used to have nightmares about it.

109
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,600
That the world would just stop spinning,
and we'd just fall off out into space.

110
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,800
I'd get so upset by it,

111
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,360
that one day we'd just keep falling forever
and ever and ever. No?

112
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,080
Yeah. No, I mean, I still get that way
when I think about dying.

113
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,920
You know, me and just all
my thoughts ending.

114
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,120
So you don't think there's an afterlife.
No, why?

115
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,600
Because I don't feel her anywhere.

116
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,280
I mean, I remember the last time I saw her.

117
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,160
<i>We went to the hospital.</i>

118
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,040
<i>And she was just sitting there
staring out the window.</i>

119
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,720
<i>It was almost as if she was already gone.</i>

120
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,120
Did she say anything to you?

121
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,920
Well, she was adopted,

122
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,760
and I guess she found out
who her birth mother was.

123
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
<i>Then she died that night.</i>

124
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,960
You know, they say that it takes a really
long time when you hang yourself,

125
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,600
that some people have second thoughts.

126
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,520
<i>And then they can't do anything about it.</i>

127
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,840
God, I used to hate her for leaving us.

128
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,360
Hey.

129
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Come here.

130
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,680
What? What? What?

131
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,080
Inside! Inside the mirror! Inside...

132
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,560
I didn't see anything in the mirror.
What did you see, huh?

133
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,400
Mrs Byrne, what's going on?

134
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,080
It's the baby. She wasn't breathing.

135
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,920
No, please, don't take her!

136
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,320
She can't be dead!

137
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,120
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

138
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm sorry!

139
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,040
Well, we've gotten your lab results back.
And everything looks fine.

140
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,240
But there was one oddity.
Are you a twin by any chance, Miss Beldon?

141
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,120
No, I'm an only child.

142
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,200
Are you familiar with the term
"genetic mosaicism"?

143
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,960
Occasionally,
when you're dealing with twins,

144
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,240
the placentas can become fused

145
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,120
and a certain amount of blood
will be exchanged back and forth.

146
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,520
I suppose the emerging pigmentation
in your affected iris could be the result

147
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,120
of that foreign genetic strand.

148
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,720
Now I don't think it's anything
you need to worry about.

149
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,000
But you may wanna see a genetic counsellor,
just to be on the safe side.

150
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,040
Excuse me.

151
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,000
Case, what's up?

152
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,600
I just got back from the eye doctor,
and I got my test results back.

153
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,240
And?

154
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,360
Am I a twin, Dad?

155
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,560
Yes.

156
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,200
- Oh, my God.
- You had...

157
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
You would have had a brother.

158
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,960
Sweetheart, he died
while you were still in utero.

159
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,400
How?

160
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,960
- Case, it's a long time ago...
- Dad, I need to know.

161
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,960
It was a freak thing.

162
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,640
One of the umbilical cords
got twisted around his throat.

163
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,040
My cord?

164
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,440
So, my brother died?

165
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,800
Is that why Mom killed herself?

166
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,880
Your mother was clinically depressed.
Period.

167
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,840
The hard truth is that
some people come into this world

168
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,120
less equipped for life than others.

169
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,800
Like my brother?

170
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,560
He was never your brother, Case.

171
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,440
It was way too early
in the pregnancy for that.

172
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,760
- Did he have a name?
- Neither of you did yet.

173
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,560
We had nicknames for you, though.

174
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,680
What was his nickname?

175
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,000
Jumby.

176
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,680
I can't believe I let you
talk me into coming down here.

177
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,520
Look, my mom obviously thought
this woman was important.

178
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,120
I mean, why would she have kept
that article? And this creepy photo?

179
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,160
- The kid from your dreams.
- Yes.

180
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,520
Okay.

181
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,560
You know, Case, if this was me,
I would just take one of my mom's Xanax,

182
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,880
and I would just call it a day.

183
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,120
Okay, so just wait in the car.

184
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,080
No, no. This is way too bizarro
for me to miss out on.

185
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,760
Excuse me.

186
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,040
We're here to see Sofi Kozma.
We called earlier.

187
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,600
Yeah, if you could please sign in.

188
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,080
She is on the third floor, room 307.

189
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,520
Let's go.

190
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,480
God, it smells like diarrhoea in there.

191
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,920
Look at the munchkin lady.

192
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,280
That guy's wearing a diaper.

193
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
God, I never want to get old.

194
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,680
No one does. Mr Walker suffered a stroke.

195
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,200
Now he's paralysed from the waist down.

196
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,880
But he doesn't suffer much any more.
His mind is elsewhere.

197
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,160
It's very homey here.

198
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,320
It's tolerable. I've certainly endured worse.

199
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,160
What was over there?

200
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,400
Oh!

201
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,440
There used to be a mirror there.
I had it removed.

202
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,640
Are you a twin, Casey?

203
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,760
I was. I had a brother who died in the womb.

204
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,760
How did you know that?

205
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,600
I used to have a twin brother as well.

206
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,920
I can sense it sometimes in others.
Certain kind of manner.

207
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,200
I just recently found out about my brother.
And that's sort of what led me here today.

208
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,400
My mother's name was Janet Beldon.

209
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,560
She passed away a few years ago,
but I found this in her things.

210
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,320
Did you know my mother?

211
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,320
SOFl: No, I'm... I'm afraid not.

212
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,880
She never tried to contact you?

213
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
Well, this is her.

214
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,680
- Are you sure you've never seen her?
- I'm sorry, dear.

215
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,400
What about the boy in the reflection here.
Did you know him?

216
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,520
Get out!

217
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,800
- Get out!
- I'm sorry, what did I say...

218
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,760
Get out!

219
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,640
What the hell was that?

220
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,960
One second she's fine,
and then she does a bitch flip.

221
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,840
How did she know I was a twin?

222
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,480
She's crazy. She probably has Old Timer's!

223
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,040
No. No, she knew something.

224
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,080
Come on, get real.

225
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,480
- What if she does?
- She doesn't!

226
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,480
Okay, so, you had some weird dreams.

227
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,920
And then this thing happens with your eye,

228
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,840
and then you found out
you would have had a brother.

229
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,000
Believe me, that alone is enough
to send me into therapy.

230
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,840
But that's all we're talking about here.
Just some weird coincidences. Yes.

231
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,280
- No, what about the Newtons' baby dying?
- What about the Newtons' baby?

232
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
And what Matty said?

233
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,480
He said "Jumby," Romy. The nickname
that my parents used for my brother.

234
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,960
You're the superstitious one here.

235
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,840
You tell me there's not something
really going on. Because you know there is.

236
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,760
I'm not crazy, Romy.

237
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,120
But ever since
Matty freaked out that night, I...

238
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,960
I've been seeing things.

239
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,680
What kinds of things?

240
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,200
Do you believe in ghosts?

241
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,960
You know I do.

242
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,000
Do you think it's possible to be haunted
by someone who was never even born?

243
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,280
You owe me.

244
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,000
These things are not easy
to find these days.

245
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,160
Are you sure you want to see
what's on this?

246
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
I do.

247
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,920
Did it mean anything to you?

248
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,640
It was the hospital where my mom died.

249
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,240
Beyond that door,
that's where she hung herself.

250
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,720
I feel like she left all that stuff for a reason.

251
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,720
You know, like she was, I don't know,
trying to tell me something.

252
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,880
Oh, my God, you think I'm crazy, don't you?

253
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,520
No. No, I don't think you're crazy.

254
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,160
A little hormonal maybe,
but you're not crazy.

255
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
- Let's try to have some fun.
- Okay.

256
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,520
- Okay?
- Yes.

257
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,360
Hey, kids! Are we faded yet?

258
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,280
We're trying, but I'm gonna go to the bar,
if you girls want anything.

259
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,280
- I will have a vodka and Red Bull.
- Me, too.

260
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,400
No.

261
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,720
Aw!

262
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,640
Why can't I meet a nice guy like that?

263
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,480
Please, I set you up with Craig Finch
and you totally blew him off.

264
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,520
You wouldn't even talk to him.

265
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,840
Well, that's because
he's too dramatic.

266
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,360
Oh, my God!

267
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,080
Somebody, help me!

268
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,800
No!

269
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,600
Somebody, help me!

270
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,800
Casey.

271
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,520
Casey! Case! Hey, hey, hey!
What happened?

272
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,280
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

273
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,760
Case.

274
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Hey.

275
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,880
<i>Hey, girlie. You okay?</i>

276
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,240
I saw her.

277
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,600
<i>- Who?
- My mother.</i>

278
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,360
<i>You were drinking. You were buzzed.
It was just a hallucination, you know?</i>

279
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,240
This was different. She was there.

280
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,000
What if the same thing that happened
to my mother is happening to me?

281
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,240
What if I end up like she did?

282
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,360
<i>- Have you talked to your dad about it?
- He's out of town.</i>

283
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,360
<i>Casey, you are not going
to end up like her, okay?</i>

284
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,320
How do you know?
You can't have it both ways, Romy.

285
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,320
Either I'm actually crazy,
or something's coming after me,

286
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,560
and if that's the case, then...
Then I have to protect myself.

287
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,520
<i>Okay. Put a pair of scissors underneath
your pillow with the two points open.</i>

288
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Why?

289
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,440
Something my grandmother used to do,
she said it keeps evil spirits away.

290
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,760
<i>You're a freak, Romy.</i>

291
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,040
<i>Yes, but isn't that why you love me?</i>

292
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,800
Yeah, I guess so.

293
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,080
<i>- Good night.
- Good night, hooker.</i>

294
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,760
<i>- Hello?
I need to speak with you.</i>

295
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,040
Sofi?

296
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,040
<i>I'm sorry for what happened before,
but there are things you need to know.</i>

297
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,760
<i>You must come.</i>

298
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,160
<i>- It's after midnight.
- This can't wait.</i>

299
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,960
<i>I lied about knowing your mother.</i>

300
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,840
<i>She did come to see me,
just before she died.</i>

301
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,440
Oh, my God.
You're the woman she was talking about.

302
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,160
<i>- You're her mother.
- Yes.</i>

303
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,200
Why did you lie to me earlier?

304
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm sorry, I was just so startled.

305
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,360
Your mother never told me you were a twin.

306
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,120
But when I saw your eyes today, I knew.

307
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,200
The boy in that reflection,
that was your great uncle.

308
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,760
My twin brother, Barto.

309
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,040
He died in 1944,
when we were together in Auschwitz.

310
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,880
<i>We were taken to see the doctor in charge.</i>

311
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,440
<i>A man who was obsessed with twins.</i>

312
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,480
<i>He was very handsome. Very polite.</i>

313
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,480
<i>We thought we'd been rescued.</i>

314
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,080
<i>The Nazis believed that twins could
unravel the mysteries of genetics.</i>

315
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,000
<i>They conducted experiments on us.</i>

316
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,920
<i>Horrible experiments that blurred the line
between science and occult.</i>

317
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,160
<i>One of their obsessions was eye colour.</i>

318
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,240
<i>By trial and error, they attempted
to fabricate blue eyes from brown.</i>

319
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,880
<i>The injections were painful.</i>

320
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,960
<i>Some caused blindness.</i>

321
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,680
<i>Some caused death.</i>

322
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,880
Two days later, he came back, except...

323
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,560
It wasn't really Barto.

324
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,800
A doorway had been opened.

325
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,720
Something else was inhabiting his body.

326
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,720
Something else?

327
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,840
Have you ever heard of a dybbuk?

328
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,720
Mmm-mmm.

329
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,720
It is the soul of a dead person that
has been barred from entering heaven.

330
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,840
So it endlessly wanders the borderlands
between the worlds,

331
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,600
trying to find a new body.

332
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,080
Some people are doorways.

333
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,320
Yes. Especially twins.

334
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,360
Because what is a twin
but another kind of mirror?

335
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,040
And mirrors have always been doorways
to the other world.

336
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,880
What happened to your brother?

337
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,080
From the moment he came back,
I knew it wasn't Barto.

338
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,160
<i>A dybbuk had crossed over
and taken his place.</i>

339
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,320
<i>It had used his body to enter our world.</i>

340
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,360
<i>I killed it.</i>

341
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,840
It's been trying to find
its way back ever since.

342
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,400
Casey. The dybbuk's blood
is on our hands now.

343
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,480
This thing, this entity,
it tried to take hold of your unborn twin!

344
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,320
And when it couldn't have him,
it turned its gaze to the other child.

345
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,720
Me.

346
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,840
It's been circling you
ever since you were born, Casey.

347
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
<i>Why now?</i>

348
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,560
Why didn't this start happening before?

349
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,720
It takes time for it
to make its way from the other side.

350
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,680
It enters our world in stages. Always it
inhabits the helpless creatures first,

351
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,400
from insect to animal, slowly making its
way up the ladder of life forms.

352
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,080
- But a twin is what it most desires.
- How do I stop it?

353
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,920
Your mother asked the same question.

354
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,120
<i>I told her about the Sefer ha-marot,
the Book of Mirrors,</i>

355
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,040
which includes the rites of exorcisms.

356
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,680
There is a rabbi
who may be able to help you.

357
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,080
<i>Joseph Sendak. Find him.</i>

358
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,320
Please exercise care
when handling the manuscript.

359
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Thank you.

360
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,480
I guess most of you know me.
Each day is a struggle, you know?

361
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,560
I keep trying to do that searching thing.
Make a moral inventory of myself.

362
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,280
- Be fearless.
- Well, that's all we can ask.

363
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,200
Thank you for sharing, Rick.

364
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,240
All right, it looks like
we're about finished for the day.

365
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,880
We'll pick up where we left off next week.

366
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,200
If I'm not mistaken,
Henry's up to bat on doughnut duty.

367
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,520
Go easy on us, will you, Henry?
Throw in a few low-fat muffins.

368
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,760
- Excuse me, are you Rabbi Sendak?
- Yes.

369
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,720
Can you read this?

370
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:59,640
Well, the right hand text is Hebrew, so I can.
It's from the Kabbalah.

371
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,080
Jewish mysticism.

372
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,400
How did you come by this?

373
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,320
Look. I know that this is gonna sound crazy,
believe me.

374
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,400
But I need an exorcism performed.

375
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,480
I'm being haunted by something. I've...

376
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,720
- A dyb... A dyb...
- A dybbuk.

377
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Yes. A dybbuk. Yes.

378
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,520
Well, as for dybbuks,
there really is no such thing, Miss Beldon.

379
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,080
At least, not outside the realms of folklore.

380
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,440
You have to understand,
back in the Middle Ages,

381
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,360
things like spirits and demons
were really just a catchall

382
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,320
for conditions people weren't capable
of properly diagnosing.

383
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,640
Mental illness, as we know it,
didn't exist back then.

384
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,400
I'm not mentally ill, okay?
What's happening to me is real.

385
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,800
Even assuming it is,
what you're asking is beyond my expertise.

386
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,120
I've never performed an exorcism before,
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

387
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,560
Well, you could read the book.
It would tell you what to do.

388
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,120
And then what?

389
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,080
For a religious ceremony to be effective,

390
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,120
the person asking for help
has to actually believe

391
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,920
in the spiritual aid they're calling upon.

392
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,840
And I'm guessing you don't believe.

393
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,200
Look.

394
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,120
Maybe I could do a little research.
I could make some calls.

395
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,880
Okay.

396
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,280
- What about your book?
- Can you translate it for me?

397
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,520
Listen. My life depends on this.

398
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,760
So please. Please help me.

399
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
<i>Take this.</i>

400
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,080
It is the hand of Miriam.
It may offer some protection.

401
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,920
Stay away from mirrors.

402
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,200
<i>If you have any in your home
you must destroy them.</i>

403
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,000
<i>Burn the pieces of broken mirror
and then bury what remains.</i>

404
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,400
<i>Bells, wind chimes,
these are signs that the spirit is near.</i>

405
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,400
<i>You must be vigilant, Casey.</i>

406
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,960
It will seek to isolate you.

407
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,360
<i>To weaken your resolve.</i>

408
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,760
Can it be killed?

409
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,640
<i>It's already dead.</i>

410
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,600
<i>The best you can hope for
is to drive it back again.</i>

411
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,960
<i>There's no use
in trying to understand it, Casey.</i>

412
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,080
<i>It's not human any more.</i>

413
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,480
<i>It is an outsider now.</i>

414
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,320
<i>It is no longer of this universe.</i>

415
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,360
Oh, shit.

416
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,240
Oh, my God.

417
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,200
Oh, my God. Sweetie, are you okay?

418
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,160
He doesn't want you to help her.

419
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,960
If you try to help her, he'll kill you.

420
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,080
Fuck off, you little shit.

421
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,320
Oh, my God, Casey, I hit that kid
from across the street with my car,

422
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,680
but then he was okay. I don't know.
I don't know.

423
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,680
Something is seriously wrong with that kid.

424
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,240
Case, your eyes are getting worse.

425
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,800
I know.

426
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,080
Case? Dude, what's going on?

427
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,160
You haven't been to class,
you're not returning my phone calls.

428
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,200
- What happened to the mirror?
- I broke it.

429
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,680
Why?

430
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,840
Because Sofi told me to.

431
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,680
- Case, that hag from the old people's home?
- She's my grandmother, Romy.

432
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,320
What?

433
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,400
She told me the truth about everything.

434
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,720
My God.

435
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,160
It's real.
Everything that has been happening is real.

436
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,000
It's some kind of ghost
or demon or something.

437
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,400
And it tried to take over my brother,
and that's why my mother went crazy.

438
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,000
She knew
that it would eventually come after me.

439
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,800
- It wants to be reborn into this world.
- Case...

440
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,880
Listen to me, right now.

441
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,760
You have to stay away from me.

442
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,640
- What?
- It is not safe to be around me any more.

443
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,920
No, no, no. I am your best friend, okay?

444
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,360
And I am not gonna just abandon you.

445
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,680
Okay? It's okay.

446
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,600
Mom?

447
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,920
I am thankful to you, Eternal King,

448
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,760
who has mercifully
returned my soul within me.

449
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,360
Your faithfulness is great. Amen.

450
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,880
Eli?

451
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,320
Eli?

452
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,400
Eli?

453
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,760
Miss Beldon?

454
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,560
Miss Beldon, Sofi wanted you to have this.

455
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,040
- In case anything happened.
- Thank you.

456
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,880
<i>Dear Casey,</i>

457
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,400
<i>it has fallen upon you to finish
what began in Auschwitz.</i>

458
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,160
<i>Be careful. The dybbuk feeds on fear.</i>

459
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,560
<i>It has a taste for our family's blood now.</i>

460
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,840
<i>And it won't rest until it's had its revenge.</i>

461
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,040
<i>I tried to stop it,
and your mother did as well,</i>

462
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,520
<i>but she lost the battle.
She gave in to her fear.</i>

463
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,520
<i>Whatever happens, don't let it
turn you against yourself.</i>

464
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,400
<i>It will seek to isolate you</i>

465
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,160
<i>by attacking your friends, your family.</i>

466
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,240
<i>But it is you that it most desires.</i>

467
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,880
Get out of here! Go!

468
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,320
Maybe it's not even really after you.

469
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,760
<i>- It killed my mother.
- You don't know that.</i>

470
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,280
<i>Yes, I do. And now, it's killed Sofi, too.</i>

471
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,640
It's gonna take everybody that I love
away from me.

472
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,440
That's what it does.
It's gonna wear me down,

473
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,640
and then, when I don't have
any strength left to fight it,

474
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,480
that's when it's gonna come for me.

475
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,440
<i>- I don't know, maybe you should leave town.
- No, no, it wouldn't help.</i>

476
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,240
It's gonna follow me wherever I go.
It's gonna kill me, Romy.

477
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,360
Hold on for a second, dude,
someone's at my door.

478
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,160
No, no, no. Don't answer that.

479
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,000
<i>Casey?
- Mark!</i>

480
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,600
Meet me at Romy's house.
Something's wrong.

481
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,520
<i>- What? What are you...
- Do it! Go!</i>

482
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,320
- The doorway is open.
- What?

483
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,680
Romy!
- What? What?

484
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,960
She's not answering the door.

485
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,280
Go back! Around back!
Come on, come on, come on!

486
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,240
No!

487
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,440
- I told you not to help her.
- Please. Please.

488
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,080
All right, let's go. Here, come on.

489
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,840
Romy!

490
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,320
No! Mark, stop! Stop!

491
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,040
It's not in him any more.

492
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,240
Get Matty. Get Matty, let's go.

493
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,760
Let's go! Move!

494
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,480
Shit!

495
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,360
It's my fault.
It killed her because of me.

496
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,680
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

497
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,160
It's not like us. I don't even think
that it comes from the same universe.

498
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,840
- But you can sense when it's near?
- Yes.

499
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,760
It's getting stronger, Mark.
And I can feel it everywhere.

500
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,600
And I think that it's strong enough
to enter anyone now.

501
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,120
Even the dead.

502
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,520
- So no place is safe.
- No.

503
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,520
No, see, I don't think
that the world was ever safe.

504
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:21,640
I think that we were always just trying
to pretend like it was,

505
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,120
but it's not.

506
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,960
I like that. That's good.
That's what I need to see.

507
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,480
Why did you change your mind?

508
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,120
You know, I can't say
that I truly believe in what's afflicting you,

509
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,440
but I think you believe.

510
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,720
And if you're convinced
an exorcism is what you need,

511
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,520
then who am I to turn you away?

512
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,000
If you'd seen what I saw last night,
you wouldn't have any problem believing.

513
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,880
- So, why are we meeting here?
- Because we need backup.

514
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,640
I may be a man of God,
but I'm not a miracle worker.

515
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,920
Good to see you, Joe.

516
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,040
- This is Casey.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

517
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,520
- Mark.
- Hey, Mark.

518
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,320
And this is Arthur Wyndham.

519
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,840
He is an Episcopal priest
and a very, very dear friend of mine.

520
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,640
So you've done exorcisms?

521
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:28,040
No, I studied the phenomenon,
I did my dissertation on it back in college.

522
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,680
Just wait a second. I'm not looking
for a Christian exorcism here.

523
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,080
Fair enough.

524
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,960
But there are certain elements
to these kind of rites that are

525
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,960
pretty common to virtually all religions, and
it's these elements that I'm familiar with.

526
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:47,240
You gotta understand,
this thing that's after you,

527
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,800
if it exists, it predates religion.
It probably predates mankind.

528
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,840
It's not as if there's one kind of demon
that is vulnerable to Jewish prayer,

529
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,200
or another that's allergic to Christian
or Muslim. It doesn't actually work that way.

530
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,560
So the words in that book,
they can't help me.

531
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,880
No, no, no. On the contrary, I think that it
can, but not in a way that you might think.

532
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,000
Now you, you may not believe,

533
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,560
but your mother and your grandmother did.

534
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:19,440
And it's because of their belief
that these words give us the best shot

535
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,360
at driving this thing out.

536
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,560
I've translated what's in the book,

537
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,600
so I'll be leading the invocation and Arthur
and a few others will be assisting us.

538
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,480
Yeah. Yeah, but before we get started,

539
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:34,280
there's a few formalities
that we have to get out of the way.

540
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,400
Can I see your IDs, please?

541
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,960
I gotta verify that you're of legal age
to consent to this.

542
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,760
- All right.
- You kidding?

543
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,880
- No.
- No?

544
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:49,560
Not kidding. These are the forms, actually.
I don't know if they're legally binding,

545
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,880
but we're in murky waters here,
just in case something does go wrong.

546
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

547
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,880
- Great. So when do we do this?
- Tomorrow night. Sabbath.

548
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,960
- At your synagogue?
- Oh, no, no, no.

549
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,680
Given how unorthodox this all is,
I think we'll find another venue.

550
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,240
Yeah, yeah. Is there somewhere
that is particularly negative to you?

551
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,920
Somewhere that
you may have incurred a lot of pain?

552
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,800
- Hell of a place to get religious, Sendak.
- Cheery, isn't it?

553
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,720
This is Rick Hesse, he's an EMT.

554
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,320
I thought it would be a good idea
to have him here, just in case.

555
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,640
Nice to meet you.
- As for the other volunteers,

556
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,600
they've all been through some
kind of hardship and they're willing to help.

557
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,680
Now, typically, a Jewish exorcism rite
involves 10 people.

558
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,920
Why 10?

559
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,200
10 fingers, 10 commandments.

560
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,560
<i>10 is also the number of the Sephiroth,
which are the known attributes of God.</i>

561
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,360
The idea is that these 10

562
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,080
form a protective circle
around the afflicted person.

563
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,360
Yeah, once we get going,
Casey will stand in the middle of the circle,

564
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,880
Sendak will read the original text in Hebrew,

565
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,080
and the rest of you will follow me
in English, call and response format.

566
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:44,640
<i>Now the heart of the ceremony is Psalm 91.
Yoshev B'seter, the Psalm of Protection.</i>

567
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,280
<i>At the beginning and the end of
the invocation, I'll sound the shofar,</i>

568
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,360
which is an animal horn
used in religious ceremonies.

569
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,480
In this case, the sound is intended
to shock the spirit hiding within the victim.

570
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,080
Once the spirit is more compliant,
then we can start drawing it out.

571
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,920
That's when the rest of us
are the most vulnerable.

572
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:06,520
It wants Casey,
but it will take any port in the storm.

573
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,880
And remember, no matter what happens,
once we've begun,

574
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,280
the exorcism must be finished.
Any questions?

575
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,200
Yeah, why are they bringing in a gurney?

576
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:21,680
The gurney is for Casey's protection
as well as ours.

577
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:27,280
Sometimes people thrash out,
just a precaution. That's all.

578
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,800
All right then. Let's get started.

579
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,040
Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

580
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,560
I just want this to be over.

581
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,320
My name is Arthur Wyndham,
and this is the video record

582
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:59,440
of the attempted exorcism of Casey Beldon.

583
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,560
We have the permission of the ecclesiastical
authority who are praying for us.

584
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:10,240
Everyone participating tonight is here
of their own free will, including Casey.

585
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,200
- Agreed?
- Yes.

586
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,160
- Just for the camera.
- Yes, this is what I want.

587
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,600
Now, if... And this is a big if.

588
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:22,040
But assuming a spirit
actually manifests itself on your person,

589
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:26,520
it may take the shape of a kind of bulge
beneath the flesh.

590
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,880
Now try not to be alarmed by this.

591
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,920
Even though we're dealing
with a spiritual phenomenon,

592
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,560
the entity still needs to be housed
in some degree of physical mass.

593
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,760
So if your body produces a reaction like
that, it means what we're doing is working.

594
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,000
- I understand.
- All right.

595
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,360
Okay, so we're gonna
place this block in your mouth,

596
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,600
- so you don't bite on your tongue.
- Let's just get on with this.

597
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,280
Okay.

598
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,680
The circle is now made whole and sacred.

599
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,840
"In the name of Adonai, God of Israel.

600
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,040
"May Michael be by my right,
Gabriel at my left,

601
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,080
"Uriel before me, Raphael behind me.

602
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,120
"Beneath my feet the ground of God. "

603
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:04,040
"I say to you of the Lord
who is my refuge and my stronghold,

604
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,440
"my God in whom I trust,

605
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,520
"that he will save you
from the fowler's snare

606
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,880
"and destructive pestilence. "

607
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:26,880
"He will cover you with his feathers
and you will find refuge under his wings.

608
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,080
"His truth will be your shield and armour. "

609
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,880
Keep going.

610
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,120
Don't stop reading.

611
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,400
"You will not fear the terror of the night
nor the arrow that flies by day. "

612
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,840
<i>The doorway is open.</i>

613
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,680
Get me out of here! Come on!

614
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,440

No!

622
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,840
Baby, we gotta go. Get up, baby.
Come on. God.

623
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:35,200
Baby. Baby, you're hurting me. Mark, stop it.

624
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,520
Mark!
