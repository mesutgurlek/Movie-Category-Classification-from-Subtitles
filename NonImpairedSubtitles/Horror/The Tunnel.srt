00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,160
The New South Wales government

7
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,920
has unveiled a radical solution
to the water crisis.

8
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,120
It plans to tap into an abandoned
reservoir under the city.

9
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,640
$95 million will be spent

10
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,160
on a state-of-the-art water recycling
facility in the heart of Sydney.

11
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,000
My name is Natasha Warner

12
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,960
and I've worked in news and
current affairs for well over 10 years.

13
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,280
I knew that I wanted to tell stories.

14
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,840
I knew I wanted to
communicate to the public

15
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,560
and, um, that looked like
the perfect place for me.

16
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
REPORTER: The NSW Minister
for Water and the Environment

17
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
has been under sustained fire
for 12 months now.

18
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,800
Sydney's water reserves
are at an all-time low.

19
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
We are a progressive government
and in the face of climate change

20
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,400
we need to look at all possibilities,
and recycling water

21
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,880
is definitely the way of the future.

22
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,200
I first came across a story which was
focusing on the government

23
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,560
that had just announced
some water recycling plans

24
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,600
and they wanted to use
abandoned underground tunnels

25
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,800
in one of our biggest rail systems.

26
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,560
REPORTER: Thousands of people
pass through here each day

27
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,200
not realising the state government's
solution to the water crisis

28
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,840
is beneath their feet.

29
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,600
The plan is to build
recycling infrastructure

30
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,120
to make use of millions of litres of water
trapped in disused train tunnels.

31
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,840
I didn't realise how vast they were.

32
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,280
There's virtually a whole other city
underneath us.

33
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,600
Welfare groups say the tunnels
are a refuge for Sydney's homeless.

34
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,880
Building underground
water recycling infrastructure

35
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,633
would leave them with nowhere to go.

36
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,360
The new homeless concerns
are likely to cause another road block

37
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,476
for the government's
water crisis solution.

38
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,400
In a similar scenario in the US,

39
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,960
hundreds of homeless

40
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,200
were recently
evicted from underground tunnels.

41
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,680
It caused a public relations nightmare.

42
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,800
You can quickly
see why the government's

43
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,760
having so much
trouble evicting the homeless.

44
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,320
I mean, trying to navigate through

45
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,320
this maze of dark tunnels is hard.

46
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,400
Trying to find people hiding in here

47
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
is virtually impossible.

48
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,800
The Water and Environment minister
says

49
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,960
there is no evidence
of anyone living in Sydney's tunnels.

50
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,078
He says if Labor wins the election,
the water solution will proceed.

51
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,000
After the initial fanfare
the story dried up --

52
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,840
it was like the whole thing
never happened.

53
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,360
That's when alarm bells went off in
my head. Things just don't disappear.

54
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,880
Whenever something's not
spoken about, I've got to ask why.

55
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,155
It's my job as a journalist.

61
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,000
Actually, I can tell you
a story about John.

62
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,960
You guys may not know this one,
it was way back in 1991.

63
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,360
My name's Steve Miller,
I'm a TV cameraman.

64
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,200
I've been working in news
and current affairs since the mid-'80s.

65
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,400
Me and Pete had just started,
and they sent us to the first Gulf War.

66
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,240
So we had to phone home to the office,

67
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
to John, who was
the news director at the time,

68
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,800
and said, "Send us more cash.

69
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,400
"We need to get some gas masks
and chemical suits and stuff."

70
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,440
So they sent us, like, 10 grand.

71
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,280
We've got this cash in our hand, we've
gone, "Fuck it, let's spend it on piss!"

72
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,720
And the air raid sirens, everyone else
is fucking pulling on their masks,

73
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,837
and we're just going, "Oh, fuck it."

74
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,360
You kind of get married to the job,
so the people you work with,

75
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,120
they end up becoming
like family members.

76

man, but he's not very good at his job.

What're you talking about?

79

When you get that gang on the road,

87
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,720
when you get Steve
and Tangles out on a shoot,

88
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,480
they're just...

They're professional,
but they're also kids.

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,074
At the end of the day they like to
muck around and have a bit of a laugh.

91
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,160
I remember Natasha,
she was at another network

92
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,200
and then a couple of years later
they brought her across to us.

93

First impression?

94

Just another young person coming in

95
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,960
getting paid too much money,
hadn't really proved herself.

she was the next big thing.

Come in here, mate.

109
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,560
Pete and I, we had
an interesting working relationship.

110
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,080
He was very determined
in the way he would do his job

111
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,600
and I was very determined in the way
I would do mine.

112
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
Sometimes that would
work well together,

113
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,320
and sometimes it would
sort of cause a bit of friction.

114
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,680
Whenever her name came up,
the subject was changed pretty quickly.

115
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,920
When you think back on it now,
you sort of go,

116
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,753
"Oh, yeah, there was
something going on there."

117
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,240

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,840
which he was very,
very passionate about.

159
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,389
And I had to give him the news
that he was taken off the story.

160
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,760
STEVE: I first heard about the tunnels
being a potential story for us

161
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,560
just as we were prepping up
actually to go to China, with Pete.

162
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,000
Hey, mate, there's
a focus chart there somewhere.

163
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,400
Can you just hold it up for us?
Yeah, yeah. No worries.

164
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,880
Beauty.

165
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,920
He'd been working
on this thing for a long time

166
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,560
and he was pretty pumped
to get over there and get stuck into it.

167
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,640
I think he had some pretty good leads,

168
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,560
which could have blown
his career wide open -- it was great.

169
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,760
How's it look, mate?
Mate, it looks pretty good.

170
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,680
It ought to, the amount the repairs cost.

171
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,120
Thanks, Tangles. Nice one.

172
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,960
No more throwing cameras
around stairwells.

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,080
Yeah, I told you guys
it's not my fault, alright?

174
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,640
Hey, um, you happy to go handheld?
The lighter we go, the quicker we move.

175
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,240
Absolutely, mate.
We 're going to China after all.

176
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,040
More room for cheap DVDs,
pirated software...

(ALL CHUCKLE)

178
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,000
You're all class, mate.

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,280
It was purely John's decision
to put Pete on this story.

180
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Well, I was a little uncomfortable
with having Pete there to start with.

181
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,875
Like I said before,
we weren't exactly always gelling.

182
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,280
I was really nervous
about talking to Pete.

183
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,952
I didn't wanna tell him.

184
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,235
(REFLECTIVE MUSIC)

185
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,680
STEVE: It's not that exciting,

186
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,240
when you're building your hopes up
for this great big story

187
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,356
and then you sort of
get given a shit sandwich.

188
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,480
I thought at that point
I was doing the right thing.

189
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,840
I thought that Pete having to postpone
what he had planned

190
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,876
was worth it in the end for the story.

191
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,960
He did say he went in to see John.

192
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,440
I don't know
what happened in that room,

193
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,000
and the contents of that conversation

194
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,960
but, yeah, he had spoken
to John about it,

195
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,960
and I think it was from that point on

196
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,350
it was clear he wasn't going to China
and Nat had won the day.

197
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,716
Why did John go the other way?

198
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,480
C'mon. We all know
why John was favouring Nat.

199
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,913
Eh?

200
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,680
Once Peter was on the story
we started attending the daily pressers

201
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,600
to try and find out what happened
to the water recycling plans.

202
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,080
Pete was pissed off,
but, you know, Pete's a pro.

203
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Took him a day or two,
then he came round

204
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,440
just like the guy he is.

205
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,240
He started to do
his own searching around --

206
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,600
he had contacts in the council
who he spoke to.

207
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,560
And some rumours started to surface

208
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,120
that not only were there
homeless living in the tunnels,

209
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,320
but there were homeless
that were going missing.

210
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,080
You know, at that point
we slowly started to think

211
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,760
there may be something in this.

212
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
So we just started

213
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,149
by chasing the then water minister.

214
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
The main thing that was apparent --

215
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,874
that he was staying quiet on the topic.

216
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,640
He wouldn't talk to us --
no-one would talk to us.

217
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,880
At that point, we were
just getting stonewalled.

218
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,360
If it was true
that homeless were going missing,

219
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,520
this was a big story.

220
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,397
And it was a really important one.

221
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Where is he?
Through here.

222
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,400
Minister!

223
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,480
Minister, have you seen the report about
the homeless people in the tunnels?

224
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,280
Nothing to say at the moment.

225
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,920
Have you scrapped your plans because
people are going missing in the tunnels?

226
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,000
No comment. No comment.

227
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,720
Minister, should people be worried?

228
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,631
Is there a threat in
the underground tunnels?

229
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,840
Well?

230
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,360
Alright... that was alright.
You reckon?

231
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,160
I knew we wouldn't get anything.

232
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,240
I think that definitely
on quite a large scale

233
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,080
there was a lot of people
in the government

234
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,560
that knew what was going on.

235
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,520
They knew what was
going on down there.

236
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,440
You know, with everything
that's happened subsequently,

237
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,112
they were hiding stuff.

238
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I started getting in contact with
a few of the shelters around the city,

239
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,400
and eventually I came across
one particular homeless man

240
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,400
who I had believed
had been living in the tunnels.

241
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,080
So this was...
I mean, this was fantastic.

242
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,152
We had, finally, someone to speak to.

243
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,555
Right, Trevor, just one sec.
I've gotta fix your mike, if that's OK.

244
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,880
I'm not sure how she found Trevor,
but Natasha found Trevor.

245
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,400
We went down to this home,
and we sat him down for an interview.

246
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,880
(NAT AND PETE
CONFER INDISTINCTLY)

247
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,440
Yeah, sweet.

248
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,000
Alright, mate. This will be fun.
You'll be on telly.

249
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,320
Alright, guys, I'm sweet.

250
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,480
Trevor, if you don't feel
comfortable with anything

251
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,560
you let me know at any time.

252
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,880
And, um, when I'm
asking you the questions,

253
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,600
if you're not quite sure
of an answer, that's OK --

254
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,880
we can fix it up later,
so don't worry about that.

255
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,120
Good.
Yeah? Thank you.

256
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,280
Well, the interview with Trevor
was a tricky one

257
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,160
but something that I am, I guess,

258
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,600
always quite accustomed
to dealing with.

259
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,440
Trevor, I understand you've
been living it rough...

260
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,873
Call me Trev.

261
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,751
Trev? OK.

262
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,880
Trev, I understand you've been living it
rough for quite some time now.

263
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,840
What circumstances took you
to living in the tunnels?

264
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,480
Uh... Well, it kept me and my mates
warm in the winter. Yeah.

265
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,600
It all started out great,
chatting away to him.

266
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,840
He started to tell me a little bit about,
you know, his circumstances,

267
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,000
what led him to live in the tunnels.

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,840
He started to really paint a picture
of what it was like there.

269
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,880
And amongst your friends,
Alfie and Johnny and Harry

270
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,720
and some of the others,

271
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,359
do they still live down there... now?

272
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,675
No.

273
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,720
Trev?

274
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,680
Hmm.
Are you OK? You comfortable?

275
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,797
Hmm. Yeah.

276
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,000
At that point in the interview,
I asked Trevor

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,880
what he perhaps had
been through in the tunnels.

278
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,760
I asked Trevor what he had seen.

279
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,911
Clearly something
had happened to him.

280
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,315
Trevor, did you know someone
who went missing?

281
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,994
Trevor, did anything happen
to you down there?

282

283
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,999

284
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,633
.. are you alright?

285
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,915
NO!

Shit.

288
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,280
(WHISPERS) Did you get that before?
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

289
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,271
Oh, my God...

290
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,833
(WHISPERS) Crazy.
I know.

291
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,160
After Trevor's interview, it was clear
we were onto something.

292
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,200
AII the pieces of the puzzle were
symptoms of something deeper,

293
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
I just didn't know what.

294
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,640
I needed more.

295
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,835
We needed to get down there.

Oh, hi, Pam, it's Natasha Warner here.
How are you?

301

I'm well, Nat, and you?
Yeah, good, good, thanks.

302
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Look, I'm just wondering
if you can help me out.

303
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,600
I'm working on a story and I need
to get into the tunnels under the CBD.

304
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,840
Who do I need to talk to
to make that happen?

305
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,280
Right. What's the story?

306
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,640
Oh, look, I just need half an hour.

307
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,870
Um... just hang on a sec...

308
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,120
Nat, sorry -- I can't help you this time.

309
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,600
What?

310
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,240
Apparently no-one's getting in there,

311
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,356
and I don't think you'll be getting
any special treatment.

312
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,920
C'mon, Pam, it's me.

313
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,310
Exactly. And people got burnt
last time. I can't do it.

314
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,160
I really need this.
Look, Pam, can you help me out?

315
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,280
I'm sorry, Nat. 'Bye.
Look, I just need half...

316
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,713
(HANGS UP)

317
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,920
I guess it's easier to look at it now

318
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,080
and say that I was perhaps under
a lot of pressure to get this story.

319
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,400
At the time I just...
I felt I was doing my job.

320
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
I was so focused on just doing my job.

321
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
There was a lot of rumours
kicking around

322
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,640
she was in big trouble, and she
kind of really needed to lift her game

323
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,358
otherwise she was gone.

324
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,400
Well, I think that I'd put
a lot of work into my career

325
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,598
and I think it was all basically
hanging on this one... one story.

326
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,120
You know, I didn't really have a choice.

327
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,520
PETE: Hey, Tangles,
how's your head, mate?

328
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,040
Pete, I'm like a fucking shark.
As long as I keep moving, I'll be OK.

329
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,880
Here we go -- this is what you looked like

330
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,836
after Steve pulled you
out of the loo last night.

331
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,040
Oh, Steve, new toy.

332
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,480
Mate, waterproof, baby! A TG!
All the gear, yeah.

333
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,000
Good at spending the network's money.

334
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,360
It's not just water-resistant,
it's fully waterproof?

335
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,840
Yeah, waterproof, mate.

336
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,920
Yeah, can you roll up for me?
I'll, uh, give it a bit of sound. There it is.

337
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,040
Sure, mate.
Sweet.

338
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,160
Rolling.
Uh, great.

339
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,920
Pete, I'll just
get you to say some shit.

340
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,280
Hang on...
One, two.

341
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,320
Here, mate, just say some shit to that.
"Some shit to that."

342
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,840
Um, yes, very excited to be
going down the smelly sewers...

343
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,320
Hello. How'd you go?

344
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,840
Haven't got all the permits sorted
but, um, John's got us covered, OK?

345
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,160
When Natasha said that John
was covering us

346
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,400
and we didn't have permits...

347
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,560
That's kind of a pretty loose
arrangement,

348
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,040
you know, you just sort of sit there
and go, "Oh, well, we must be fine."

349
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,473
You sure?
Yeah.

350
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,240
When?
We're on for tonight.

351
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,800
Tonight? OK. So we are up?
Yeah, mate.

352
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,960
Yep, tonight. You good?
Yeah, sweet. Yeah, I'm good, man.

353
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,120
Alright.
The sooner we go, the better, hey?

354
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,599
Yep.

355
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,840
As a crew, it's... it's our job
to film it and get coverage.

356
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,673
It's really not our job to question it.

357
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,240
Hey, Pete, just hang back. I'm just
gonna get a shot of Nat walking in.

358
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
Yeah? OK.

359
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,040
MAN: Excuse me, guys?
Guys... Hold up, restricted area.

360
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,200
Oh, sorry, mate.
Maybe no-one told you.

361
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,440
We're just gonna be filming for about
half an hour. We'll be out of your hair.

362
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,635
Just grabbing a few shots...
I'll need to see a permit.

363
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,477
Permit?
Yeah, uh...

364
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,160
STEVE: You got a permit?
I've got a driver's licence.

365
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,958
(BOTH CHAT INDISTINCTLY)

366
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,360
Pete... how much have
you got in your wallet?

367
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,793
You're kidding me, aren't you?

368
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,075
We're not third world here,
it's not gonna work.

369
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,040
Guys? Everyone, time to leave, please.

370
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,520
Told you.
Fucking hell.

371
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,078
Let's go, come on.

372
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,274
I was that far into it
I couldn't go back at that point.

373
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,160
We decided to find another way in,

374
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,631
with or without official... assistance.

375
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,240
We found some access
round the other side.

376
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,994
Yeah, it looked like
a maintenance access.

377
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,709
You sure John's got this sorted?
Grow some balls, Pete.

378
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,560
I, at that point,
was starting to feel as though

379
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,320
there was something not quite right.

380
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,160
Um, so I thought,
to cover myself and to cover Tangles,

381
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,280
and really to cover all of us,

382
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,760
I'd just film pretty much everything
that was happening there.

383
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
You know, I thought we had to have

384
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,560
some sort of way of
protecting ourselves,

385
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,480
should something go wrong.

386
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,440
You know, if we got busted
and fined or whatever, arrested,

387
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,920
um, you know, I had some
evidence it wasn't me

388
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,440
trying to push us down there,
and it wasn't Tangles,

389
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,317
but it was Natasha.

390
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,396
Here -- take this.

391
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,629
Here we go.

392
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,593
OK, let's go.

393
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,880
You right? You want me to...
Take this.

394
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,920
Yep.

395
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,353
OK, make it quick.

396
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,748
(LAUGHS)

397
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,560
We just were kind of covering
our tracks as we went down --

398
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,357
you know, we didn't want
to get discovered.

399
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,556
Looking back on that...

400
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,474
..that was probably a mistake.

401
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,560
We OK?
Hey?

402
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,240
Are we OK to be down here?

403
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,310
That's what she said.
She said John's got us covered.

404
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,200
When we start filming a story --

405
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,280
when we actually start
"OK, let's get it, let's roll" --

406
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,080
Pete and Natasha,
they look after the editorial content,

407
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,320
and, you know, it's kind of
my job to take over there

408
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,960
and look after the pictures.

409
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,200
OK, turn around and come back.
I'll just get you walking past this grill.

410
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,997
You guys just hang back
there for a second.

411
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,280
Tangles and I would go off
and we'd just start

412
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,920
getting stuck into it,
filming like we always would.

413
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,037
You know, don't really need direction,
we'd just get into it.

414
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,280
Once we got in sort of a little bit further,
there were whole sections of tunnels

415
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,720
that were absolutely,
absolutely pitch black.

416
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,240
It is completely black down there.

417
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,880
You know, you could go in there,
turn the light off, spin around

418
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,680
and you wouldn't know where you were.

419
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,520
'Cause there's junctions,
tunnels going off everywhere.

420
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,000
So I kind of thought...

421
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,640
The first time I turned off the light
and stood there, I thought

422
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,160
we're gonna have to keep the light on
and stay across where we are

423
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,833
'cause otherwise it's going to be
pretty easy to get lost down there.

424
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,190
Hey, Tangles?
Yeah?

425
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,680
Just come here, mate.

426
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,920
There's something wrong with
my light. Can you check it out?

427
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,520
What do you mean?
Is it the connection?

428
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,320
Yeah, can you look in real close?
Is there something stuck on it?

429
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,800
Ah, shit!

430
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,440
How did I not see that coming?

431
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,395
(LAUGHS)

432
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,911
Thanks for that, Steve.
My eyes are stuffed.

433
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,720
Great.
Let's go.

434
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,320
Pete had sourced a map of the tunnels,

435
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,000
but the further we got in, the more
we realised it wasn't exactly accurate.

436
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,310
There were whole sections of tunnels
that weren't even on the map.

437
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,557
Just give us some light here, Steve.

438
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,552
OK. So that's the entrance,
that's where we came down before...

439
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,240
That's that way. That's not here...
I don't know why that is.

440
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,800
OK, through here.

441
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,680
Yep. That must be the way.

442
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,640
Once we got through
and past the maintenance areas

443
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,160
and we got into a little bit more
of the guts of the tunnels,

444
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,760
my impressions were
that... that it was amazing.

445
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,160
It was vast, this place was huge.

446
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,080
That's awesome.

447
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,674
(TRAIN RUMBLES NEARBY)
Shit, the sound's great.

448
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,560
Pete? Can I have 10 minutes
to grab some overlay here?

449
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,040
I'll give you five.

450
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,520
Five?
Yep.

451
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,040
We were very close
to the station there, so, um,

452
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,238
you know, Pete was trying
to make us pretty low-key.

453
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,631
I was blown away by the size of it --
it was massive, and just eerie.

454
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,990
You know, I think
we were all in awe of it.

455
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,720
It wasn't really difficult to get
great-looking shots down there,

456
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,320
you know, 'cause you're really just
painting stuff with your light

457
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,959
and whatever you saw there just was...
it looked really cool.

458
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,234
(TRAIN RUMBLES NEARBY)

459
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,748
This is looking really good.
Hey, guys, just hush for a sec.

460
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,870
Alright, looks good. Yeah, sweet.

461
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,160
The history to these tunnels, the ones
in particular that we were looking at,

462
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,920
was just incredible.

463
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,760
I mean, it dates back pre-World War II.

464
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,440
They were to be used as
an underground rail system.

465
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,512
Then in World War II
they were used as air raid shelters.

466
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,598
Come have a look at this.

467
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,960
The current NSW government

468
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,720
is not the first to use these
tunnels for another purpose.

469
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm standing in a section of tunnel

470
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,480
that was converted into an
air raid shelter during World War ll.

471
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,680
It's complete with all the amenities

472
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,558
that enabled soldiers to stay
for extended periods.

473
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,120
Various rooms were then, um,

474
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,840
reused and fashioned
for training for the SAS.

475
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,040
So time and time again they've,
I guess, been reinvented for their use,

476
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,589
and even to this day with the water
recycling plans that were announced.

477
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,720
I was fortunate enough to
come across an area where

478
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,960
it was evident that there was definitely,
you know, homeless

479
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,080
or, you know, people living down there.

480
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,469
That's good... good just here.

481
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,274
I'm right to go?
Hang on a sec.

482
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,153
Go when you're ready.

483
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,840
We've been walking in
the tunnel for less than an hour,

484
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,560
and already we've come
across somebody's home.

485
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,760
Here you can see their
makeshift bed, blanket

486
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,480
and empty tins of food.

487
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,000
Coming across the belongings
was very important --

488
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,760
it was vital to the story.

489
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,840
It was absolute proof
that there was life down here.

490
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,280
While there is no sign of
an occupant at the moment,

491
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,640
it is clear the minister's assertions
of abandoned tunnels are incorrect.

492
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,840
This was something that
the government were denying.

493
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,752
This is something
that we could now prove.

494
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,640
Hey, Nat, I'll get a shot of you
going down there, actually.

495
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,120
Yeah, cool.

496
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,000
Oh, hey. Light.

497
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,592
Cheers.

498
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,960
Mate, what's up?
What? Nothing.

499
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,758
It's a bit tight down there, tubby.
You reckon you're gonna make it?

500
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,640
He mustn't like working on the show.

501
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,120
(LOUD BANG)

502
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,600
Nat! You alright?
Nat, you alright?

503
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,720
Yeah, I'm right.

504
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,597
Do you need a hand?
No, I'm fine.

505
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,440
Nat? Look, we've already
got the sleeping bags and stuff,

506
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,040
we don't really need to get the lake.

507
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,280
We could probably do the rest up here.
Pete... Pete, I'm alright.

508
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,120
I just think it's a little...
(FIRMLY) I'm fine!

509
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,553
Just let's keep going.

510
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,000
Alright, you take that.
Yeah.

511
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,200
What's eating her?
Oh, she just really needs the story.

512
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,760
After what happened last time,
she's treading on thin ice.

513
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,280
Yeah, I reckon.

514
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,080
That's why John put me onto this --
make sure she doesn't fuck up again.

515
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,720
If she's not up to it,
why doesn't he give her the arse?

516
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,400
Mate, I think John'd wanna
give her a little more than just that.

517
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,640
Well, he'd have to get in line
behind you, wouldn't he?

518
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,960
NAT: Hey, guys, you might
wanna know for future reference

519
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
that these tunnels
carry sound pretty well.

520
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,080
And as far as I can hear,
you're all arseholes.

521
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,440
(STEVE LAUGHS)

522
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,360
Fuck off!

523
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,874
Yeah, give me the torch.
Right, yeah, hang on.

524
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,837
There you go, mate.

525
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,640
Get down there, you arsehole.
(BOTH LAUGH)

526
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,712
Pete, can you just lift that handle up
for me? Get a bit of sound.

527
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,720
Where to? Just...

528
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,153
(METAL SQUEAKS)

529
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,200
Yeah, nice.
Give it a kick.

530
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,360
Yeah, give it a kick.
Send it on its way.

531
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,680
What are we doing?
Just... just give it a kick.

532
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,557
You call it.

533
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

534
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,919
(RATTLES LOUDLY)

535
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,880
(SILENCE)

536
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,438
Thanks, guys.

537
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,320
The lake was just... so... vast.

538
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,680
I mean, this thing runs
a kilometre long.

539
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,398
It's bigger than I thought.

540
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,960
Yeah, I get that a lot.

541
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,440
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

542
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,040
Me and Tangles were
mucking around a bit --

543
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,440
we like to play jokes on each other.

544
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,600
You know, if I didn't do it,
he would've done it.

545
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,440
So I just grabbed him
and sort of went...

546
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
..you know, at the edge of the lake,
went to push him in.

547
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
You know how you go up,
hold onto their shoulders

548
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,920
and pull them back again?

549
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,520
Which I did, and then I let go of him,
and went to walk back to the camera --

550
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,000
in he went.

551
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,680
(SPLASH!)

552
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,320
Shit.
Tangles, are you right?

553
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,240
Yeah, slipped.
There's your dip, mate.

554
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,080
Steve, you... prick.

555
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,600
Oi, this is not funny. It's fucking cold.

556
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,840
Are you gonna give him a hand?
(LAUGHS) No, fuck him!

557
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,273
(LAUGHS)

558
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,600
This is not... Stop laughing, OK?

559
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,640
How long are we gonna be
down here, alright?

560
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,360
Tangles, as much as we used to
joke around and muck around together,

561
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,400
when it came time to work,
you know, he was very serious,

562
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,840
and it wasn't time for joking.

563
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,560
Creative department's ready.
Just letting you know.

564
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,515
OK.

565
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,360
Nat, just come forward a fraction.

566
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,360
So, you know, when he's sort of
giving me the impression

567
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,720
that there were problems,
I was believing him.

568
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,720
I'm standing directly below
one of Sydney's busiest train stations.

569
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,320
Behind me is the forgotten
water resource

570
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,600
that's causing all the controversy.

571
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,200
Earlier this year the government...

572
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,960
Nat, sorry. Pete, are you making noise?
No.

573
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,155
You weren't whispering?
No.

574
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,040
Alright. Sorry, Nat.
Can we go from the top?

575
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,031
Everyone, just keep it quiet. Thank you.

576
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,160
OK, let's go from the top again.
Let's move.

577
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,593
When you're ready, Nat.

578
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,040
I'm standing directly below one of
Sydney's busiest train stations.

579
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,360
Behind me is the forgotten
water resource...

580
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,040
Nat, sorry. Are you guys
fucking with me? What's the noise?

581
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,120
What are you hearing, mate?

582
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,111
It's... Hang on, I'll just check the battery.

583
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,720
Sweet, um, I don't know.

584
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,320
Maybe it's your cables.
Yeah, cables don't fucking talk, Steve.

585
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,200
Uh, alright. Sorry, Nat.
Go for it again, I'll see what I can do.

586
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,633
Just go straight through.

587
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,318
If Tangles says he heard something,
I do believe he felt he heard something.

588
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,040
I can't describe
how silent the place was,

589
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,318
so at the time I didn't feel that...
he could have been hearing anything.

590
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,520
It... it was strange.

591
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,560
I was just thinking, you know,
it could have been a technical problem,

592
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,080
could have been anything -- some
RF interference, anything like that.

593
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,240
But, you know, Tangles was adamant
there was something going on,

594
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,109
and, uh, when he's serious about
something, you know, you believe him.

595
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,640
Earlier this year,
the government announced,

596
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,240
then quietly abandoned,
plans to recycle water from this lake.

597
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,391
The Minister for Water
has yet to give a reason why.

598
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,557
Beautiful. Pete, happy?
I'm happy. How are you, Tangles?

599
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,240
Oh... yeah. Yeah, sweet, yeah.

600
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,277
Alright, let's go.
Let's move, grab the sticks.

601
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,993
Alright, let's go.

602
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,199
After we'd finished
our piece at the lake, um,

603
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,073
we decided to head for the bell room.

604
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,560
Righto, Nat.

605
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,960
Basically the bell room was built as like
a air raid sort of alert back in the war.

606
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,838
They would use it
to warn people of danger.

607
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,240
When we rang the bell,
it... it was deafening.

608
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,400
It rattled your ribs.

609
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,080
This bell is a relic of World War ll.

610
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,120
It remains here in the confines
of an air raid shelter,

611
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,032
as a reminder of what
imminent danger sounds like.

612
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,320
(BELL CLANGS)

613
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,920
Shit, that blew my levels
right off the meter, sorry. Um...

614
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,520
Hang on. Nat, can you just
hit the bell once more?

615

PETE: How's that?

618
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,720
Nah, look, if you want me to get that,

619
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
it's probably best I boom it
from down the hall.

620

Yeah, OK. Well, if we need it.
OK, cool, two seconds.

Tangles decided to, um, go into
the adjoining room off the bell room

622
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,280
and boom it from there

623
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,480
just to basically kill the sound
of the level of the bell,

624
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,200
which was just making
his levels peak out.

I don't really know much
about recording sound,

626
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,160
but I did at the time remember
thinking, "That's a bit weird."

627
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,640
You know, why would you do that?
Just turn it down a little bit.

Can you just listen on the cans,
watch the levels for me?

631
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,680
Why don't you get Pete to do it? He can
do camera, he must be able to do sound.

632
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,238
Nah, mate, I've done
enough hard work today.

I'll do it for ya, mate.

way too echoey in here.

to the audio for him,

which was fine.

but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.

789
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,960
I can't really describe it,
it was just...

790
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,872
There was blood and...

791
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,960
..over in the corner
was... Tangles's torch.

792
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,960
I... I sort of thought of myself
as his older brother.

793
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,000
You know, that was
the kind of relationship we had.

794
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,280
And, uh, he was sort of
entrusted to me.

795
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,872
That's the way I felt about it.

796

What about Tangles?

799
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,160
Whatever that fucking thing is,
it could be nearby.

00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,712

Um... and then we went in the room.

812

We wouldn't have been in there
for more than two or three minutes,

and then she came out,
we all came out together,

814
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,480
and she noticed
the camera had been moved.

815
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,873
My instinct was to check it
and see if it had recorded something.

816

someone had picked up the camera,

825
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,240
it had come off the ground,

826
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,959

And then we turn to come out

834

and... the camera goes down

835
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,312
and we just catch a glimpse --
it was just like one frame.

836
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,560
It happened in a split second.

837

I didn't know what it was, mate,

and it was fucking frightening.

Well, then... we find the safest room

Do you want to tell us how...
how you lost your friend

into the pool of light

dawned on me then

that the light was our way
of keeping it away from us.

01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,400
I need you to tell me exactly
where you are and what's happening.

1244
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,560
I don't know -- we're in the station

1245
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,840
and something...
something took our friend.

1246
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,160
OK, please stay calm.
You said you're at the station?

1247
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:19,920
Which station are you at?
Help me! Somebody HELP me!

1248
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,520
What are you doing?!

1249

Hello? Hello?

(NAT YELLS HYSTERICALLY,

1251
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,196
Hello? Are you there?

1252
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,760
Hello?

1260
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:12,440
STEVE: Yeah, it's kind of hard to...
to talk about it now.

1261
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,440
But I didn't know
he was dying at that point.

1262
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,560
You know, I thought
we were all gonna be fine.

1263
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,240
I mean...

1264
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:23,640
..it had been so difficult to get
to that point where we got there,

1265
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,120
and then, you know, I thought
we were going to be OK.

1266
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,270
There was people around us,
there was light.

1267
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,880
I... you know... I would
have been doing more

1268
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,110
if I thought he was lying there dying.

1269
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,189
NAT: I... I feel that I could have
done more to help Pete.

1270
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,080
You know, it's, um... it's easy to say

1271
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:52,675
that you would do things differently,
you know.

1272
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,477
It just didn't seem... very fair.

1273
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,640
I got told by the first paramedics

1274
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:08,440
that, you know...
they'd sort of given up working on him,

1275
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:13,719
they sort of... you know...
took a while to get Nat away from him.

1276
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,320
And, uh,
it slowly, slowly dawned on me

1277
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,600
about that point, you know.

1278
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,160
They sort of walked away from him.

1279
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,000
He was just lying there,
and he wasn't moving,

1280
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,070
and I was... I just thought, "Fuck."

1281
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,072
I feel... I feel... I feel responsible.

1282
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,717
I don't want to say that
I felt like it was my fault.

1283
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:08,200
I don't know exactly how
I've changed since that night.

1284
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,760
I can't help thinking
we were so close.

1285
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,398
Help was right there.

1286
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,477
I go over it again and again.

1287
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,357
Just constantly.

1288
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,832
What would I do differently?

1289
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:45,200
I was just pissed off
with everyone, everything.

1290
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,633
The government...

1291
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,440
..the police...

1292
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:53,080
I mean, how much
evidence do you want?

1293
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:56,834
It's just sad now, thinking about it.
It's pointless.

1294
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,793
It's just fucking sad.
