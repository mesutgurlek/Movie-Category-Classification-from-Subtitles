1
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,688
Hi.

2
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,692
I'm Sam Turner and we're here at VICE
Headquarters in Williamsburg, Brooklyn

3
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,694
with one of our favorite
fashion photographers,

4
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,697
Just a few nights ago, we
were all hanging out together

5
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:08,768
when he let slip a comment about his
sister that had us practically speechless

6
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,270
for the better part of an hour.

7
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:15,040
After hearing the full story, we immediately
thought, we have got to do a piece on it.

8
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,233
Should I read it?

9
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,468
SAM: Read it.

10
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:45,205
Okay, it says, "Dear Patrick, sorry you
have not heard from me in so long.

11
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,974
I have been working hard with
everyone to build a community

12
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,243
where we can finally live
free as God intended.

13
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,445
We're not there yet,
but we're so close.

14
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,982
It's the most beautiful place I have ever
been and I would love if you came to visit.

15
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,517
We have so much love here
but I miss your face."

16
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,800
Then it says "Love, Caroline,"
and there's a phone number.

17
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,352
We've been to some
of the most chaotic,

18
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,754
fucked up, war-torn
places in the world,

19
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:39,659
but never somewhere for something
as personal and bizarre as this.

20
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,028
So here we are, about
to leave New York City,

21
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,632
to set out to find your sister
in a remote part of the world,

22
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,935
to see what this community she is
living in is really all about.

23
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,503
Maybe we can call this one

24
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,271
the "VICE guide to the
Carter family reunion".

38
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,677
I'll be back tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

39
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:13,513
I'll wait for one hour
and then I will leave.

40
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,947
With or without you.

41
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,516
Don't worry, we'll be here.

42
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,084
I'm not worried.
8:00 a.m.

43
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,832
Who is Patrick?

44
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,599
Yeah.
That's me.

45
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,103
We were not told you'd
be bringing others.

46
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,840
There are three total.

47
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,542
Is there a problem?
We're all together.

48
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,610
We have to get clearance to
bring them to the Parish.

49
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,444
Please, stop filming me, sir.

50
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,984
They came with me.
I can't just leave them here.

51
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,320
My sister invited us.

52
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,689
My sister's name is
Caroline Carter.

53
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,990
Hold on.

54
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,058
I don't understand
if there's problem.

55
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,326
Hold on.

56
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,893
It should be all arranged.

57
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,332
<i>MAN (ON RADIO): Okay.</i>
<i>Bring them in.</i>

58
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,500
Copy that.

59
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,267
It's okay.

60
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,637
Come with me.

61
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,271
Let's go.

62
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,243
It's okay.

63
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,145
Get in the back.

64
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,646
The truck?

65
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,147
Get in the back.

66
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,538
So far so good.

67
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,631
Well, here we are,
we made it, kind of.

68
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,199
We don't have a local
fixer on this one,

69
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,267
and the first thing that happens is

70
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,702
Patrick almost getting into an
argument with one of our guides.

71
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,204
You know those are the
guys you want on your side

72
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,072
when you are out in
places like this.

73
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,309
Maybe New York has made me soft,
but these are the moments,

74
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,578
every time we make one of
these things, where I realize

75
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,979
it might have been
the worst idea ever.

76
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,681
No, we've definitely
had worse ideas.

77
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,952
I don't know why you're laughing.

78
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,053
Get a shot of his shoes.

79
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,824
Where did you think you were
going, wearing shoes like those?

80
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,659
I thought you traveled
for work all the time?

81
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,928
Yeah, to LA, and fucking Paris.

82
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,095
Closest I come to this shit

83
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,164
is shooting some model
in a field in Jersey.

84
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,866
Dude, you're in fashion,
you should own some boots.

85
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,892
Turn the camera off!

86
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,865
Turn it off!

87
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,732
Turn it off!

88
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,145
So things have not improved.

89
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:37,350
We didn't get shot, but
we have to be careful

90
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,785
not to let them catch us filming.

91
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:43,523
Patrick is over there explaining
who we are, what we're doing.

92
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:47,659
I'm not sure if that will
make things better or worse.

93
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,930
We're hoping that he can find his
sister and straighten all this out.

94
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,302
And if Patrick starts to get shot
at, I'm going the fuck that way.

95
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,169
As quickly as possible.

96
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,807
They want our passports,

97
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,011
but I'm not giving up
my passport to anybody.

98
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,748
Also, there is some
talk of a donation.

99
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:12,151
Not sure how sizeable
that donation has to be.

100
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:16,321
So far this is nothing at all like the
hippie commune we were expecting.

101
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,658
CAROLINE: Patrick?

102
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,926
PATRICK: Okay.
See, there she is.

103
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,026
Hey, it's okay guys.
It's okay.

104
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,432
Caroline, did you tell them?
All right, come on guys.

105
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,072
CAROLINE:
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

106
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,441
I'm so glad to see you.
What's with all this?

107
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,177
Oh, I'll explain it inside.

108
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,211
- Hi.
- Hi.

109
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,213
I'm Caroline.
Nice to meet you.

110
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,282
You too.
I'm Sam, this is Jake.

111
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,418
Hi.

112
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,587
We didn't know you were coming.
I'm so sorry.

113
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,088
It's just... We're really
happy to have you.

114
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,357
There's someone cleaning out
a cabin right now for you both.

115
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,425
Great.

116
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,961
Is it all right if I keep filming?

117
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,696
Yeah.
Yeah, of course, of course.

118
00:09:56,697 --> 00:10:01,467
I would just hope that you would
leave this last experience out.

119
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,370
It in no way reflects what
you are about to see.

120
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,373
The guns are just a precautionary
measure because of where we are.

121
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,742
Down here everything needs
some level of security.

122
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:10,743
Sure, we understand.

123
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:11,744
You want to go inside?

124
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,745
Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,746
Yeah? Okay, cool.

126
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,213
Thanks, guys.

127
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,990
My God, I can't believe I'm
looking at you right now.

128
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,758
Your hair is so short.

129
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,326
Yeah, I cut it.

130
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,761
You look good.
You look healthy.

131
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,096
Thank you.

132
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,497
I can't believe this is
where you are living.

133
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,766
Oh, just wait until you see it all.

134
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,636
Here we are.
Welcome to Eden Parish.

135
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,004
What do you think?

136
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,338
It's great, right?

137
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:45,344
<i>FATHER (ON MIC): Children, we have some
special visitors to the parish today.</i>

138
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,480
<i>Let's show them our hospitality</i>

139
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,616
<i>and represent ourselves in the
ways the Lord has taught us.</i>

140
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,985
<i>- FATHER (ON MIC): God bless you all.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

141
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,922
I don't think that we slept more
than three hours in a night

142
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,291
for six months when
we were building it.

143
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,795
But Father had a vision, and
he was of course right.

144
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,431
And we built Heaven here on Earth.

145
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,035
Who is Father?

146
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,770
Oh, right.
Yeah.

147
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,506
Probably sounds weird
to you guys, huh?

148
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,642
Well, he's the guy that
started all of this.

149
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,177
He's the reason that
I'm still alive.

150
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,680
He's the reason that
all of us are here.

151
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,149
He's a genius, I swear.

152
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,453
I know it sounds strange, but we all call
him that because it's just easier for us.

153
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,954
Is that him on the loud speaker?

154
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,556
Uh-huh.

155
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,058
Can we speak with
him at some point?

156
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,893
Um.

157
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:37,663
I know you guys are Patrick's
friends and everything,

158
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,199
but we've got to be really
careful about media exposure.

159
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,536
None of this would be possible
without some level of secrecy.

160
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,471
Secrecy, from whom?

161
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,572
People like us?

162
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,708
Or you mean like the
local government?

163
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,310
A little of both.

164
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,480
There are some people out there
that want to stop what we're doing.

165
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,316
They think it's wrong, but
I personally have no idea

166
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,819
why anyone would think
that this was wrong.

167
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,854
I've never been so happy
in my entire life,

168
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,824
and we grew up wealthy
on the upper west side.

169
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:08,360
But that's not living, at least not to me.
This is living.

170
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,596
We all built this
together as a community.

171
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,964
We would do anything
to keep it safe.

172
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,506
So some of our residents
agreed to move out of here

173
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:24,076
so that you guys could
stay here with us tonight,

174
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,079
but Patrick is going to stay
with me in the main house.

175
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,381
And I know it doesn't
seem like much,

176
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,751
but you guys should be pretty
comfortable for the night.

177
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,385
When we first got here, some
of our residents said that

178
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,721
they had the best
sleep of their lives.

179
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,023
It's so peaceful and just
wait until you see the stars.

180
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,392
They're so beautiful.
It's great, thank you.

181
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,962
Should we come find you
once we get settled?

182
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,898
We would actually like to talk to you
at some point if you're cool with that.

183
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,401
Just... but take your time
because I would really

184
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,237
love to spend some
time with my brother.

185
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,671
Take him, we can't give him away.

186
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,143
But really, if you guys need
anything at all, anything,

187
00:12:57,144 --> 00:13:00,546
the main house is just across the
field, just behind that pavilion.

188
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,747
- Do you see it?
- SAM: Yeah.

189
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,383
Feel free to just wander around and
get acquainted with the place.

190
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,252
Our residents are
really nice people.

191
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,386
Sounds good.

192
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,554
Mm-hmm.

193
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,156
- You ready?
- Yeah.

194
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,157
Well, welcome.

195
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,925
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,795
Okay, I guess I'm going
to go with her for a bit.

197
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,819
All right.
See you in a few.

198
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,589
Later.
See you, man.

199
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,041
You want the top or bottom?

200
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,084
She's selling this
place pretty hard.

201
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,953
Right?

202
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,788
Best night's sleep of your life...

203
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,288
Yeah.

204
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,196
How freaked out were
you back on the truck?

205
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,696
Dude.

206
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,232
Why did they have machine guns?

207
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,604
I'm gonna switch cards so
if anything gets weird,

208
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,339
we at least have the
footage we shot so far.

209
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,106
Good call.

210
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,994
<i>FATHER (ON MIC):</i>
<i>Peace I give you, children.</i>

211
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,129
<i>Do not let your hearts be troubled.</i>

212
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,831
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

213
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:29,134
<i>FATHER (ON MIC):
It's another day for us in paradise.</i>

214
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,135
Hi.

215
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:34,340
<i>When brothers and
sisters live in unity.</i>

216
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,574
<i>God bless you all.</i>

217
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,141
Hi.

218
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,414
I do not know who
to approach first.

219
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,517
They'll come to me.

220
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,251
Hey, how you doing?

221
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,022
Not that one, I guess.

222
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,298
Oh, got her.
Got her.

223
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,172
Hi.

224
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,507
Hi.

225
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,508
How are you?

226
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,676
I'm fine.
How about yourself?

227
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:11,677
I'm very well.

228
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,879
My name is Lorraine Davis,

229
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,749
but everyone around here
just calls me Miss D.

230
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,918
So how did you get
involved with this place?

231
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,185
Through the church.

232
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,789
Now Father had came into
the area where we lived

233
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,560
and I had seen signs
plastered all around town.

234
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:34,033
Signs inviting people to come out
and to help better themselves

235
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:37,703
and to get a better
relationship with God.

236
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:41,440
So I went down there to the church

237
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,311
and before that sermon
was over, I was sold.

238
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,714
That man has a way of speaking,

239
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:54,053
a way of making you just feel better,
and I'd never felt that way before.

240
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:58,090
And it wasn't long
after that he chose me

241
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,326
to be one of the lucky ones

242
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,462
to come down here and be
a part of all of this.

243
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,597
Oh, were you reluctant
to leave your home?

244
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,966
Oh, no.

245
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,600
After my husband had passed,

246
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:13,237
there just wasn't
anything here for me.

247
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:19,445
My faith is what was
most important.

248
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:23,381
This is right where I belong.

249
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,586
We're with VICE.

250
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,255
We want to talk with someone around our
age about what it's like living here.

251
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,256
I know VICE.

252
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,492
Cool.
Are you from Australia?

253
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,860
Melbourne, yeah.

254
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,862
How did you end up here?

255
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,965
I mean, what were you doing
before you came to this place?

256
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,867
I was an artist living in Brooklyn.

257
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,102
What kind of art do you do?

258
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,370
All kinds.

259
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,839
Painting, poetry, performance.

260
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,009
Do you ever miss the technology
you were accustomed to?

261
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,378
Even just communicating easier

262
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,380
or knowing what's going on
with the outside world?

263
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,382
You must, a little bit?

264
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,617
I don't need the
internet to communicate.

265
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,153
People lived without it
for thousands of years.

266
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,856
It's just another
unhealthy addiction.

267
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,792
Here we talk to each other in
person, not through satellites.

268
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:10,129
What about your
family in Australia?

269
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,562
Do they know where you are?

270
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,000
This is my family now.

271
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,302
Father has given me more
than I ever dreamed of.

272
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,538
I'm so grateful for that.

273
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,173
Okay.

274
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,308
Fair enough.

275
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,909
Thanks.

276
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,053
Oh, hi.

277
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,687
Hi.
Can we come in?

278
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,890
Sure.

279
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,825
What is this place?

280
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:44,830
This is our medical center and
temporarily our day-care.

281
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:51,203
I help with any conditions our residents
may have, especially our seniors.

282
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:54,339
And Miss Phoebe in there helps
takes care of some of the children

283
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,442
while their parents
are in the fields.

284
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,444
Are there a lot of
children and seniors here?

285
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,045
Oh, yes.

286
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:04,083
We have over 35 boys and
girls under the age of 10,

287
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:08,053
and at least 60 or so seniors.

288
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,489
That's how our parish really got
its start, helping those seniors.

289
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,593
Has anyone actually been born here?

290
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,729
Oh, we've birthed
seven babies to date.

291
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,464
Seven?
All here?

292
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,067
That's right.
Right here.

293
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,372
Why are you so surprised?

294
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:31,977
People are born around the world every
day in conditions worse than this.

295
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,447
It's not the hospital that has
the baby, it's the mother.

296
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,882
He's just nervous because
his wife's pregnant.

297
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,220
Really?
When is she due?

298
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,387
Next month.

299
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,388
Is this your first?

300
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,389
SAM: Yeah.

301
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,492
The first are the most exciting.

302
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:47,626
Congratulations.

303
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,262
Thank you.

304
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,464
Where do all these
supplies come from?

305
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,465
Do you get them locally?

306
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,601
Well, we brought a lot with us,

307
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,004
but thank heavens we haven't needed
to use much of the medication.

308
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:03,475
But we are prepared for
all types of emergencies.

309
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,777
Who pays for it all?

310
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,746
We did.

311
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:11,150
Well, in so many words, anyway.

312
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:16,755
When many of us first came to the
parish, we sold everything we had.

313
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:20,492
When several hundred people come
together, you would be surprised

314
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,861
that how much you can
get accomplished.

315
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,531
SAM: Everyone just gave up
what they had to come here?

316
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,166
That's right.

317
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,369
We sold our homes and we donated
the profits to the church.

318
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,703
And we would do it again.

319
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:39,311
Father is a businessman
on top of all things.

320
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,713
Sometimes that gets overlooked.

321
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,965
SAM: So where are you guys from?
MAN: Oh, we're from the hood, man.

322
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,033
SAM: Yeah.

323
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,334
I'm saying we had nothing
where we was from.

324
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,836
You know, five of us
lived in two rooms.

325
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,171
And that's how you want to live?

326
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,340
Me, Robert, our mother
and two sisters,

327
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,342
we all came down here together.

328
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,477
And I mean, honestly,
it's just changed us.

329
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,179
We're from a violent community.

330
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,581
I don't know, man.

331
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,816
If we didn't come down here,

332
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:18,917
God knows what would
have happened to us.

333
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,419
Oh, yeah, yeah, if you had told us

334
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,222
we'll be out there with the white
dudes and all these people...

335
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,122
Yeah, yeah.
We'd just say you was crazy.

336
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,495
It's like, we look at you all and
it's like you are the crazy ones.

337
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,997
Yeah.
I mean...

338
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,432
This is how we're
supposed to be living.

339
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,601
You know, everybody
here is in it together.

340
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,602
That's right.

341
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:37,836
You know, there's no
one man for himself,

342
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,371
it's like God watches over us.

343
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,006
Yeah.

344
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,507
- We watch over each other.
- That's right, man.

345
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:45,877
Do you see yourself ever going
back to the United States?

346
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,512
Never.
There's no point.

347
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,215
I ain't never going back, man.

348
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,717
I'd die before I go back.

349
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,019
It's real.

350
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,121
Hey, can I play some
ball with you guys?

351
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,256
Yeah, man.

352
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,257
Come on.

353
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,725
Can he ball?
He can really ball.

354
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,292
No.

355
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,059
<i>SAM: So we talked to a
bunch of the people here</i>

356
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,662
<i>and what we know so far
is that everyone thinks</i>

357
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,131
<i>this is the best place
they've ever been.</i>

358
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,066
<i>They have their own farming,
their own medical center,</i>

359
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,435
<i>their own daycare,
their own everything.</i>

360
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,070
<i>As far as utopias go,</i>

361
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,905
<i>it has something for everybody.</i>

362
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,308
If it's spirituality
you want, they got it.

363
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,810
If it's progressive
politics, they got it.

364
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,179
If it's a technology
free hippy lifestyle

365
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,682
you're looking for,
they got that, too.

366
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,950
I can't help but think desperation

367
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,819
is a lot of what
brought people here,

368
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,788
but if they're happy now,
who am I to say anything?

369
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,526
We're about to head
to the main house

370
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,194
to meet back up with
Patrick and Caroline

371
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:13,332
to see if we can do an interview with
this Father everyone keeps talking about.

372
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,601
I'm trying to keep it together, so
I can ask intelligent questions,

373
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:20,971
but jet lag's kicked in and
I am starting to melt.

374
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,543
Jake, what do you think
of all this so far?

375
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:28,212
Give me your
professional assessment.

376
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,984
JAKE: Um, I don't know.

377
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:36,120
I mean, I'm naturally
cynical, but...

378
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,227
The fact that a bunch of
drug addicts and alcoholics

379
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:45,329
actually pulled this thing together
is a little bit impressive.

380
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,234
Fact that they sold all their
worldly possessions to do it.

381
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,605
I don't know, just throws up the
red flag for me a little bit.

382
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,078
I feel like, I mean, if this
is like a place to come

383
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,515
and get clean or do a little
bit of thinking for a month,

384
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,150
it's perfect.

385
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:08,353
I think it is an actual
sustainable lifestyle for,

386
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:12,257
you know, 60 something
elderly people.

387
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,259
I mean, that medical
center is great,

388
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,496
but that's not really going to cut
it, in my professional opinion.

389
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,173
What are you gonna ask this guy?

390
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,773
I don't know yet.

391
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,677
Are you going in
with tough questions

392
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,145
or you're just gonna wait
and see what the vibe is?

393
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,916
I'm coming at him.

394
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,284
Okay.

395
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,553
Well, I'm gonna see
if he'll wear a wire,

396
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,554
gonna try and mic you guys up.

397
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,194
Sam, we got a little one.

398
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,269
Hi.

399
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,937
What's your name?

400
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,807
Savannah.
There you are.

401
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,942
Well, I've been looking
all over for you.

402
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,577
Hi, Savannah.

403
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,279
Don't mind her.
She is a mute.

404
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,313
Oh.

405
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,714
You friends of Caroline's?

406
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,583
Yeah.
We're with VICE.

407
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,544
We want to maybe do a
story about this place.

408
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,654
What kind of a story?

409
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,823
We don't really know yet.

410
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,458
You're not gonna make
fun of us, are you?

411
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,926
No, not at all.

412
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:23,962
We were just saying how
impressive all this is.

413
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:27,299
Hey, would you mind doing
a quick interview?

414
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,334
We talked with a few people
about how they ended up here

415
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,436
and it'd be great if we could get

416
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,972
- a mother's perspective on that.
- No, thank you.

417
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:39,444
We're not allowed to talk about the
Parish, especially to outsiders.

418
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,111
Come on, sweetheart.

419
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,351
Did she just call us outsiders?

420
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,885
Yeah.

421
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,493
It's kind of a different vibe, huh?

422
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,893
Yeah.

423
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,674
Hey.

424
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,675
Hey.

425
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,810
How are you doing?

426
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,345
I'll see you guys later.

427
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,779
You guys enjoying
yourselves so far?

428
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,780
Definitely.

429
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,516
Yeah?
So good news.

430
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:20,552
I spoke with Father and he agreed
to allow you an interview.

431
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:21,620
- Great.
- Yeah.

432
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,788
He is not really feeling
very well right now.

433
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,224
He just took some of his medication.
Oh, is he sick?

434
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:27,792
No.
It's nothing serious.

435
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,629
It's just sometimes the
medication upsets his stomach.

436
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,299
So he agreed to sit for an interview
tonight at the gathering.

437
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,368
We're planning an
event for your visit.

438
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,405
It's gonna be music and dancing,
you'll love it, especially you.

439
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:45,176
So we would love it if you would
look over this document I prepared.

440
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,812
It'll give you a little bit
more information about us

441
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,814
and it should help
with your questions.

442
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:53,016
He is only gonna sit for half an
hour and then the party will begin.

443
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,253
What time does the party start?

444
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,055
It begins at sun down.

445
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,925
If you just want to meet me
in front of the pavilion,

446
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,326
and then I'll take
care of the rest.

447
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:02,327
Perfect.
Thank you.

448
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:03,428
Okay.
Of course.

449
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:04,896
We have nothing to hide.

450
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,031
So if you'll excuse me,

451
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,333
I have some more planning
to do before tonight,

452
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,534
so I'll just see you
guys in a little bit.

453
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:10,535
Sounds good.

454
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:11,570
Okay.

455
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,604
- Yeah. Thanks, Caroline.
- Mm-hmm.

456
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,075
How is it going, man?

457
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,344
Man, I got some amazing
pictures so far, dude.

458
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,612
I can make a whole
book out of this.

459
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,183
Look at these faces, man.

460
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,617
Jesus.

461
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,721
You know, I can make something
really cool out of this

462
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,556
and it'd be great for me, 'cause
then I could set up a show

463
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:32,857
with Milt when I get back.

464
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,324
That's right.

465
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,629
Oh, no, that's what my ticket
on fashion looks like.

466
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,232
What have you guys been up to?

467
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:44,134
Well, we talked to a
bunch of the locals.

468
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,471
- And?
- It's pretty wild.

469
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,974
Yeah.

470
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,874
Strange group of people.

471
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,211
Nah, it's incredible.

472
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,616
Had a few bizarre
interactions, but you know...

473
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:01,620
Where I'm staying, a full extra bedroom,
office, can't even wrap my head around it.

474
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:05,590
The construction aspect is pretty
impressive I have to admit.

475
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:09,761
Do you think your... Do you think
your sister wants to stay?

476
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:10,795
It seems like it.

477
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,131
I thought I was gonna have
to come here and rescue her

478
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,634
but she seems good and she's
definitely done worse.

479
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,735
I don't know how I'm gonna describe
this to my parents, but...

480
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,507
Um, we're rolling, so
let's do that letter.

481
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:24,174
All right.

482
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,751
"Distinguished guests..."

483
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:36,021
Well, does it say
distinguished guests?

484
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,023
Says it.

485
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:40,025
"Welcome to Eden Parish.

486
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,760
Father wants only to
create a community

487
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,662
where peace and love are cherished,

488
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,865
where the needs of one another are met on
equal levels as we're all God's children

489
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,300
and it is how He Himself
intended us to live.

490
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,037
We do not seek to isolate
ourselves from the outside world,

491
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:55,807
but we do seek a distance from
imperialism, violence, poverty, racism

492
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:59,010
and all other unacceptable
attacks on basic human rights.

493
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,447
These conditions have all become
commonplace in modern societies.

494
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,683
Father created Eden Parish
not as a place to get away,

495
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,317
but as a place to start over.

496
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,452
It is a new beginning.

497
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:11,189
Sincerely, the loving
congregation of Eden Parish."

498
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,825
Define imperialism.

499
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,726
Define imperialism.

500
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,595
Idiots.

501
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,836
You're getting a signal?

502
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,103
No.

503
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,206
Okay.

504
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,728
What are you doing on your phone?

505
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:36,047
Dude, she is still gonna be pregnant
tomorrow when you get home.

506
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,682
They might have a satellite
phone in the office.

507
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,350
They don't have a satellite
phone in the office.

508
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:42,854
You know, you don't need to
encourage this kind of behavior.

509
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,355
Okay but I saw a room
with a lot of equipment.

510
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,757
He is fine.
You're fine.

511
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,603
<i>WOMAN (ON MIC):</i>
<i>Would all Parish members</i>

512
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,740
<i>please report to the
pavilion no later than 7:45.</i>

513
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,843
<i>We're having a very
special meeting tonight,</i>

514
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:06,745
<i>for Father and our visitors.</i>

515
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,513
<i>Everyone is required to attend.</i>

516
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,380
<i>God bless.</i>

517
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,521
(CHANTING)

518
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,728
So we're gonna have you
guys set up over here

519
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:26,030
and then Father will come out
when you guys are ready.

520
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,133
Wait, hold up.
We're doing this in front of everybody?

521
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,268
Yeah.
That's right.

522
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:34,304
Great. So just let me know
when you're all set, okay?

523
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:39,744
Hey, Patrick?

524
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:40,745
Yeah.

525
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:41,913
Hey, man, does your
camera shoot video?

526
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,548
Yeah.

527
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,917
Think you could help me get some...
during this?

528
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,552
Definitely.

529
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:49,553
Where do you want me to shoot from?

530
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,259
I mean, anywhere where you
can get a good shot of Sam

531
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,396
asking some questions and
then you can flip around

532
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,932
and get some shots of
people, that'd be awesome.

533
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,634
All right, maybe I'll
just set up over here.

534
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,267
Yeah.
Thanks, man.

535
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,208
Well, light looks pretty good.

536
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,460
WOMAN: Father's here!

537
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,994
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

538
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,115
Hi.

539
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,882
Nice to meet you.

540
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,255
Yeah.
All right, all right.

541
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,057
Let me get rigged up here.

542
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,293
All right.
All right.

543
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:12,797
Well, I trust your stay so
far has been hospitable.

544
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,200
What we lack in modern comfort,
we make up for in humanity.

545
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,201
Isn't that right?

546
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,835
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

547
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,942
It's been pretty amazing.

548
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,777
Everyone we talked to
seems to feel that

549
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,312
this is everything they ever wanted

550
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,646
and they all credit you for that.

551
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,815
Oh, I don't deserve the credit.

552
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,951
We all did this together.

553
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,087
We built this place
from the ground up.

554
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:39,324
This is our community and
you being our visitors,

555
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,092
it is just as much yours.

556
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,559
That's what we believe in.

557
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,830
I want to talk more about that,

558
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,466
but I would love to get some
basics out of the way first.

559
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,102
Caroline mentioned you were
little under the whether earlier,

560
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,971
so I hope this is not too much.

561
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,605
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

562
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:55,840
Great.

563
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,810
Okay, so first off.
Can I ask your real name?

564
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:02,447
Everybody here has been calling you
Father and I wonder how that started.

565
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,381
Well, it's a nickname.

566
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,987
I don't remember exactly when it
started, but it was many years ago.

567
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:12,957
Some people see anyone who
extends a helping hand

568
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,492
as a father figure.

569
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,961
And yes, that's where it came from.

570
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:20,765
My given name is
Charles Anderson Reed.

571
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,333
That's a great name.

572
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,870
Where are you from and how
did all of this get started?

573
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,138
Can you take us through it?

574
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:30,875
Oh, I am from all over, friend.

575
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,778
I've been in every big
city and every small town.

576
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,147
And you know what I found?

577
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:42,919
Poverty, violence,
greed and racism.

578
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,625
The foundations of a
cancerous society

579
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,160
and I felt it to make a difference.

580
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,896
You see all these
people here tonight?

581
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:55,666
They all came here because
they had nothing.

582
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,002
They were born outcast.

583
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,871
Never given a chance.

584
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,173
I know, 'cause so was I.

585
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:08,679
Society turned its back on these
people years ago, but I never will.

586
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,648
I grew up poor.

587
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,417
I know that pain.

588
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:17,155
I know what it's like to
lose hope, to feel trapped.

589
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,057
Well, there's none of that here.

590
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:21,426
You come down here and I'll
give you a place to live.

591
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:24,929
I'll give you a job, I'll give you
some good, I'll give you a bed.

592
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,264
Whatever you need.

593
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:27,432
ALL: That's right!

594
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,901
And we could live
our lives, friend.

595
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,536
Truly live.

596
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:34,439
There is definitely a
sense of togetherness,

597
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,209
but I do wonder if this isolation
is the only way to achieve that.

598
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,577
Well, I had hoped not,

599
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:44,048
but I believe for the
time being that's so.

600
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:48,453
You see, we built this
congregation over many years.

601
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:52,557
We travel around and preach a
good word, wherever we went.

602
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:55,460
And every stop we
made we'd pick up one

603
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:58,096
or two of God's lost children.

604
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,098
You know what we found
more often than not?

605
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,600
It's a struggle to
bring people together.

606
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:06,370
America is coming
apart at the seams

607
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:11,709
because of the way it's being
run, and the values it instills.

608
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,611
Your government is failing, friend.

609
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,481
Now before you call me a
communist or socialist

610
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,116
or whatever word you use

611
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,985
for somebody who tries
to help this fellow men,

612
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:24,322
let me remind you of one thing,

613
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:27,125
all the great leaders who
have tried to achieve

614
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:30,995
what we have here were
struck down and killed.

615
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,330
That's right.

616
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,632
Malcolm X.

617
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,767
Martin Luther King.
Oh, my God.

618
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,270
J.F.K.

619
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,272
R.F.K.

620
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:43,508
Well, I'm willing to die
for what I believe in,

621
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:51,181
when you can remove yourself from the fight
altogether and create something new.

622
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,019
A place without violence.

623
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,256
Romans Chapter 12 verse 2.

624
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:02,660
"Do not conform any longer to
the pattern of this world,

625
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:08,898
but be transformed by the
renewing of your mind."

626
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:15,071
And that way you can test
and prove God's will.

627
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:20,511
God's good and pleasing
and perfect will.

628
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,446
That's what we do here, see?

629
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:26,784
We are continuing our
cause peacefully.

630
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,686
Surely you can appreciate that.

631
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,521
Absolutely.

632
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,691
Speaking to that point,
when we came in,

633
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,060
we noticed there were
a few men with guns.

634
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,895
If this is a pacifist community,

635
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:42,033
and it seems as if
it is, why the guns?

636
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:45,168
Is there some paranoia
about the outside world?

637
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,838
Today a woman even
called us outsiders.

638
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,973
Oh.

639
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,676
You see, this is why I
don't like the media.

640
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:54,679
(LAUGHING)

641
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,314
We have been speaking five minutes

642
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:59,817
and you're already looking for
some negative angle to explore.

643
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:03,321
Oh, no, I don't blame you, Sam.
It's not your fault.

644
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:04,989
You don't even know
you're doing it.

645
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,058
It's just the way you've
been conditioned.

646
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:10,595
Come in here from a
sick, violent society,

647
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:13,064
it's only natural that
you'd be less interested

648
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:17,735
in the beauty of our community than in
the guns we use to protect the borders.

649
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,736
I wasn't saying...

650
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,739
What we're doing here is radical,
Sam, there's no doubt about it.

651
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,010
And it is complicated, that's why
I want to explain it to you.

652
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,246
I have sympathy for
your misunderstanding.

653
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,747
We all do.

654
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,714
We all used to think just like you.

655
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,887
Let me just say that there are
certain government agencies

656
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:41,024
that have been watching me and
my congregation for many years,

657
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,394
everybody knows that.

658
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:45,763
I do not keep it secret.

659
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,099
But I made a promise
to these people

660
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,136
that I would lead them
to a better existence

661
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,237
and that includes protecting them.

662
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,043
It's our home down here,
we have to preserve it.

663
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,411
That's understandable.

664
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:03,146
Yeah, see?
I knew he'd catch on.

665
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:08,786
Living in that beehive New York
City has jaded you completely.

666
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,154
That's good.

667
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,188
So...

668
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,794
It must have cost quite a bit
of money to create all this.

669
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:20,298
Was it just through donations all
these people's life savings?

670
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,932
Oh, Sam.

671
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:25,569
I hate you, you
phrase it like that.

672
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,139
Is that what money means to you?

673
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,273
A life?

674
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:32,443
We don't worship capitalism
and materialism.

675
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:35,179
We came down here to
live off the land.

676
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,916
That's why America started,
but they don't allow it anymore.

677
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,452
Yeah, if you're not paying
taxes then you go to jail.

678
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,788
Exactly.
That is exactly right.

679
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:46,856
Now, Sam, let me ask you
a question if I may.

680
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,961
Look around here,
look at all these people.

681
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:55,965
Do you see anybody who looks
like they ought to go to jail?

682
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,471
It doesn't look like it, no.

683
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,209
That's right.

684
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,044
I see you wear a
ring on your finger.

685
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:09,680
You are married man, are you?

686
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,715
Yes.

687
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:11,982
Oh, that's good.

688
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,883
You love your wife?

689
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,120
Excuse me?

690
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:19,222
A simple question.
Do you love your wife?

691
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,859
Yes, of course.

692
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,961
And you'd do anything for her.

693
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:28,264
And what about that child
you have on the way?

694
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,235
Oh, what's wrong?

695
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:34,872
You seem caught off
guard by my question.

696
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,840
Interesting when the shoe is
on the other foot, isn't it?

697
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,481
And I suppose you were wondering how I
knew that about your wife, aren't you?

698
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:46,217
Oh, relax, Sam.
I'm just making a point here.

699
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,220
You see, I love these people here

700
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:53,491
just as much as you love your
wife and your unborn child.

701
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:58,329
These people,
my family, my children.

702
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,431
And when you write this
up for your readers,

703
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:04,001
I want you to remember that.

704
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:07,505
And when you start to
put that spin on it,

705
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:11,375
just know that you're
dealing with their lives,

706
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:15,212
with those faces.

707
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:18,949
Look at the joy on those faces.

708
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,985
Remember what you're
seeing tonight, Sam.

709
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,223
You have a great responsibility.

710
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,157
I hope you're aware.

711
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,897
I am.

712
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,032
But we don't spin things.

713
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,867
We try to be honestly subjective.

714
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,602
We don't have an agenda,

715
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,905
we're just trying to document
things that are meaningful.

716
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:44,742
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Caroline told me that.

717
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:47,411
That's why I agreed
to this interview.

718
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:50,381
You know, I don't
believe in the media.

719
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:55,419
I see it always lies
upon lies upon lies.

720
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,187
Anything that'll sell more copies.

721
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,060
But I look at you, Sam, and I
can tell you're different.

722
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,830
I can see that you care.

723
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,802
We try.

724
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,537
Yes, you do.

725
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,443
Well, are there anymore questions

726
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:23,781
or can we quit all this and get on
to the celebration we got planned?

727
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:25,182
We got a wonderful band.

728
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:26,450
I know you're gonna love him.

729
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,451
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

730
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:33,958
I guess we're fine.

731
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:35,025
All right.

732
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,960
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

733
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:28,644
Yo, so that was one of the strangest
interviews I've ever done.

734
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,882
Shit. man.

735
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:35,886
Yeah, if you could see, I only...

736
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,988
Yeah, I only got through
about a quarter

737
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,658
of my questions and
really I'm not sure

738
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:43,727
if any of those even got answered.

739
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,029
Everything just sort
of got swept up

740
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:50,267
in this weird energy and I
couldn't think straight.

741
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:53,270
He had a way about him.

742
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,906
That's hard to focus.

743
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,909
Well, the thing about my
wife really stunned me.

744
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,545
And you were saying that
he must have heard it

745
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,914
from one of the people we
talked to, which makes sense,

746
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:08,552
but man, fuck me, it was
all just so jarring.

747
00:43:08,553 --> 00:43:11,422
All that clapping.

748
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,425
I hope it wasn't worthless.

749
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:19,263
See, they're setting up for a party

750
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,765
and hopefully we can get
some better footage

751
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,435
to make up for me dropping
the ball like that.

752
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:25,802
Sorry, man.

753
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,942
There's a ton of good stuff, man, I
don't think you should worry about it.

754
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:36,712

Okay, I've completely turned
the corner on this place.

782
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:07,037
I'm a fan of this goat.

783
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,173
And people seemed really psyched,

784
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:12,676
party was great even
without any booze.

785
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:15,012
I'm starting to be able to see why
people want to live like this.

786
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:19,917
I mean, I wouldn't, but I think
I'm starting to better understand

787
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:21,552
where they're coming from.

788
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:23,887
I dig it.

789
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,156
Music's actually really good.

790
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:28,559
And I fucking hate church music.

791
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,928
Yeah, he wasn't lying about that.

792
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:34,531
Patrick's having a good
time wherever he is.

793
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,768
He might not want to
come back with us.

794
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,168
Oh, heads up.

795
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,338
Hey, Savannah.

796
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,943
You're having a good time?

797
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,681
What?
Is this for me?

798
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,085
Thank you.

799
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,619
- What is it?
- I don't know.

800
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,963
What is it?

801
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:07,229
What's it say?

802
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,973
Oh, shit.

803
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:49,939
<i>♪ Fix me, Jesus, fix me ♪</i>

804
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,342
Where is she?

805
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:53,777
I don't know.

806
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:58,047
<i>♪ Oh, fix me ♪</i>

807
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,921
<i>♪ Oh, fix me ♪</i>

808
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:14,130
<i>♪ Oh, fix me ♪</i>

809
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:21,804
<i>♪ Fix me, Jesus, fix me ♪</i>

810
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,687
And there's the guards.

811
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,056
What are they doing with guns?

812
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:41,325
I don't like this.

813
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:43,159
We got to find Patrick.

814
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,404
Patrick?

815
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:55,971
He's not in here.

816
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,609
Fuck.

817
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,448
What is all this shit?

818
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,586
Let's get out of here.

819
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:12,489
Sam, hold on.
Safe's open.

820
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,225
Oh, dude, you've got
to get over here.

821
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,493
Leave it, man.

822
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:17,728
Holy shit.

823
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:18,729
It's all their passports.

824
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,197
Dude, I don't give a shit.
Let's go.

825
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,732
I got to get some shots of you
looking through this shit.

826
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,500
Somebody's coming, Jake, come on.

827
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,601
Come on.

828
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,006
Can I help you guys?

829
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:31,006
Yeah, we were just looking
for your brother.

830
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:36,879
His room's just right
around the corner.

831
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,462
Oh, he is not here right now.

832
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:53,463
Huh?

833
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:56,033
I completely forgot.
He is busy.

834
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,534
Busy doing what?

835
00:48:57,535 --> 00:49:00,637
I've been telling Allison
and Sarah about him

836
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:04,141
And they're just so happy
that he's finally here.

837
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:07,110
So they took him.

838
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,379
Threesomes aren't
particularly Christian,

839
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,149
if I'm remembering
Sunday school correctly.

840
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,151
Well, we all have to sin
every once in a while

841
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:15,986
as long as Father approves.

842
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:18,255
He approved getting
your brother laid?

843
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:20,924
One must not question
what's best for the Parish.

844
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:22,793
How so?

845
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:26,396
I love my brother and
I miss him so much.

846
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:29,066
And I think that he
would be so happy here

847
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,568
and we're just trying
to show him that.

848
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:35,005
Don't you think he'd
miss New York, his job?

849
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:36,807
He can be a photographer here.

850
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:39,810
And he has all these ideas...
This idea about this book

851
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,812
about the Parish, I
think it's brilliant.

852
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,580
And my parents can support him

853
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,916
and we're expanding all
this and we need money.

854
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:48,685
And if Patrick stays then
we can get the money and...

855
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:51,088
Yeah, you want your parents
to send money to help

856
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:52,422
build this place out.

857
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:55,158
It's a donation.
It's the same as you.

858
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,095
It's... We just need to get
through this next phase

859
00:49:58,096 --> 00:49:59,930
and then we'll be completely fine.

860
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:01,331
Oh, are you all right?

861
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,533
Yeah. Yeah.

862
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:06,470
Caroline, I need your assistance.

863
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:09,071
I'm coming, Father.

864
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:14,611
If you see Patrick, tell
him to come see us.

865
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:15,679
Okay.

866
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,216
Just relax.
You're in paradise.

867
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:21,685
You fellows seem lost.

868
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,354
Do you need someone to walk
you back to your cottage?

869
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,356
No.
We're fine.

870
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,624
You sure about that?

871
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,460
You wouldn't want to walk
into the wrong place.

872
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:31,628
Why?

873
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:35,132
Is there something you
don't want us to see?

874
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:39,870
It's just an expression, friend.

875
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:43,974
It's late, you want to go poking
around other people's business,

876
00:50:43,975 --> 00:50:46,009
you go right on ahead.

877
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,712
But if you put your hand
into the dog's bone,

878
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,848
don't be surprised if you get bit.

879
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:54,384
What's that supposed to mean?

880
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,753
You boys have a nice evening.

881
00:50:56,754 --> 00:51:00,155
Sam, let's just drop it.

882
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,362
Patrick?
Sam, come on.

883
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,801
Shit.

884
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,174
What the fuck is going on here?

885
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:18,508
Did he just threaten us?

886
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:20,277
I'm not sure.

887
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:22,612
Do you think he knows
we were in the office?

888
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:25,115
Anyway, is Patrick's
sister hiding his files?

889
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,918
I know she is not supposed to be.

890
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,920
They're just using Patrick?

891
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:31,021
I don't know.

892
00:51:31,022 --> 00:51:33,455
I don't know what's
going on anymore.

893
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,929
This is too fucked up.

894
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,430
These people are happy living here.

895
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,432
Good for them, but I don't
want to get any more involved.

896
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,901
I'm done.

897
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:47,437
Also, if she's getting high
and sleeping with the guy,

898
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,905
what's the point of this place?

899
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:52,309
It's supposed to be
sober living, right?

900
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,711
I mean, she looks an awful lot
like the fucked up sister

901
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:57,079
Patrick was describing.

902
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,310
Savannah?
Where is she, dude?

903
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,478
Where did she go?

904
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,612
I don't know.

905
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,604
Please, take us with you.

906
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:55,872
What?

907
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:57,507
You don't know what's
really going on here.

908
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,643
They will kill us if they
know we were talking to you.

909
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:00,777
Who?

910
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:01,878
Father.

911
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:03,880
This place is not
what it seems like.

912
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:06,016
They hurt people who
go against the Parish.

913
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,851
Please, you have to help us.

914
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,286
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?

915
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,655
They keep it secret,
but it happens.

916
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:13,523
Father will not let us leave.
We're prisoners here.

917
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,792
You are being manipulated.

918
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:18,895
We talked with plenty other
people, they all seemed happy.

919
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:20,030
No.

920
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:22,899
You talked with who Father
wanted you to talk with.

921
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,903
Many other people won't tell you
but they are afraid to speak out.

922
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:29,539
You don't understand the hold
he has over a lot of them,

923
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,409
they're brainwashed and don't even
know it, they'll do anything he asks.

924
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,511
Your friend's sister
is one of them.

925
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,913
She has done terrible things
to people who act tough.

926
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:39,049
Savannah saw them.

927
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:43,019
They beat my daughter, that's
why she won't speak anymore.

928
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,422
Please, please, help us.

929
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:47,390
I don't know what we can do.

930
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,825
Our helicopter comes
in the morning,

931
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:50,827
but it's not big enough to
carry many more people out.

932
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:51,928
Then just take my daughter.

933
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:52,929
What?

934
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,065
Please, don't let her die.
I beg you.

935
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,334
Shh! Ssh!
Somebody is coming.

936
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:58,934
Oh, God.

937
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,038
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

938
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,209
What is going on here?

939
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,544
We found her wandering out here.

940
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:10,347
We're trying to find out where she lives.
She doesn't talk much.

941
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:11,348
I will take her.

942
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:12,349
Oh, it's okay.
We can do it.

943
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,217
I know where she lives.
I will take her.

944
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:20,557
Where is your mother, Savannah?

945
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:23,693
I will go tell Father.

946
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,227
Let's go.

947
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,872
Jesus Christ.

948
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:37,874
Come on.

949
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,741
Let's just get back inside.

950
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,314
They were terrified.

951
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:46,983
We shouldn't have let him take her.
Why the fuck did we let them take her?

952
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:49,085
What were we supposed to do?

953
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:51,121
We can't take anyone with us.

954
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,756
We could've done something.

955
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:54,124
Sam, it's not why we're here.

956
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,593
It's not our problem.

957
00:54:56,594 --> 00:55:00,230
It's not why we make these films,
you're losing sight of things.

958
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:03,333
We can report this when we get back,
but it's not up to us to decide

959
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:04,901
what happens to these people.

960
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:07,270
We're not the Red Cross.

961
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:08,838
Did you see those scars?

962
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:12,108
How could she let her
daughter be beaten like that?

<i>God bless you all.</i>

970
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,031
Look at them just do exactly
what he tells them.

971
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:37,199
Brainwashed.

972
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:45,675
Look, the helicopter is gonna
be back here in 8 hours.

973
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:49,145
Let's just pack our bags
and be ready to go,

974
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:52,015
seems like everybody
is going to sleep.

975
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,516
I don't think anything else
is gonna happen tonight.

976
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,386
You know, let's just
try and get some rest

977
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,955
and hopefully things
will calm down.

978
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,692
But when the sun comes up,
we're gonna get Patrick,

979
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,328
we're getting the hell out of here.

980
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,296
What is this place?

981
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:14,469
(DISTANT CHATTERING)

982
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,937
Well, it's officially 5 o'clock.

983
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:51,107
So much for the greatest
night's sleep of our lives.

984
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:53,576
Tried to go to sleep
about an hour ago.

985
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,378
Whatever they're doing
in the pavilion

986
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:59,215
seems to have stopped,
so it's been quiet.

987
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:00,717
Oh.

988
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:02,252
Neither of us could sleep.

989
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,387
It's a weird night.

990
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:09,759
Looks like it's finally
getting to us.

991
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,764
Well, I'm actually really scared.

992
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:19,969
It's the most scared I've
been in a long time.

993
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,005
Ready to go home.

994
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:45,161
All right, it's morning now.

995
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:48,064
We made it through the night.

996
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:52,001
There appears to be some kind
of group of people gathered

997
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:54,170
outside of the pavilion.

998
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,639
It's unclear what exactly
is going on over there,

999
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,175
but we're gonna have to
just go find Patrick

1000
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:04,346
and start to make our way
back to the air strip.

1001

1002
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:20,295
You see this?

Jesus Christ.

1004
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:28,103
What the hell is going on?

1005
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:45,321
Hey, what the fuck is happening?

1006
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:46,489
Dude, what's going on?

1007
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,690
This has been happening
for an hour.

1008
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:51,461
These people want to leave, I started
filming 'cause I knew you'd want it.

1009
00:58:51,462 --> 00:58:52,695
I have no idea what to do.

1010
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:53,997
All these people want to leave?

1011
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:57,066
They all know we have a helicopter
coming and they want on it.

1012
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,135
We can't take all
these people with us.

1013
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:01,137
I told them, I keep telling
them, they won't listen.

1014
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:02,205
Caroline has been
freaking out all morning.

1015
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,505
I don't know what to do.

1016
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:07,343
Hi.

1017
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:08,878
Is everything all right?
Yeah, it's fine.

1018
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:12,248
We haven't had anyone
come here for over a year

1019
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:14,384
and so you guys being here is
really stressing them out.

1020
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:16,386
Okay, can I... Can
I ask you on the record

1021
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:19,756
Okay, you know just really
don't concern yourselves.

1022
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:22,091
It's fine.
Everything... This is nothing.

1023
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,893
Caroline, this is not nothing.
These people want to leave.

1024
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,495
You can't keep them here.

1025
00:59:25,496 --> 00:59:27,363
Listen, you guys...
They can't leave.

1026
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:29,766
They have to stay here.
Their families are here.

1027
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,534
Do you want to break
up their families?

1028
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:34,270
Hey, wait a minute.
They are allowed to leave, right?

1029
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,406
Of course, they are.
That's not what I'm saying.

1030
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:38,908
You guys need to go to the
helicopter right now.

1031
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,111
Hey, Sam!
Sam!

1032
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,514
Sam, do not get involved in this.

1033
00:59:44,515 --> 00:59:46,416
What are you doing?
Come on.

1034
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,784
Please, take her with you.

1035
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,919
Calm down, Wendy. No one
is taking her anywhere!

1036
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,921
I told you, our
helicopter is too small.

1037
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,423
You could take just her.

1038
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,258
Dude, no.

1039
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,560
Go ahead and get to the field,
ask how many people it can hold,

1040
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:58,928
I'll stay back here
and figure this out.

1041
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,129
Sam, this is crazy.

1042
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,564
- We can't take anybody with us.

1043
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:02,565
-Just her.

1044
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:03,967
I can't leave her like this, man.

1045
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:06,569
Just get there before the pilot leaves.
Have one of the guys radio back.

1046
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,805
That'll work, right?

1047
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:11,207
Just don't let that
helicopter leave without us.

1048
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:14,310
Go, hurry.

1049
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,578
Caroline, where's the ride?

1050
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,918
All right.

1051
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:24,454
I'll radio back soon as
I know what we can do.

1052
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,089
You're sure you know,
when we come back

1053
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,223
Trust in your brother...

1054
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,232
It's gonna be okay.
It's fine.

1055
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,834
We're not gonna leave
without you, okay?

1056
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:38,968
You cannot do this.

1057
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,470
Back off!

01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:43,338
We're not gonna leave
you, I promise.

Caroline, where are you going?
I have to get Father!

1062
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,952
He warned me about this,
he was right about you,

1063
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,353
he was right about all of you.

1064
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,355
You came here to destroy
us from within.

1065
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,991
I didn't want to believe it, I
fought for you to come here.

1066
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,494
You are not my family,
I made a big mistake.

How many more people can fit in this?

No, that was not the deal.
No one else comes.

No, it's just... It's a mom and her
daughter and my friend's sister.

No, I told you.

No, she's sick.
We have to help her.

in, no exceptions.

01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:59,829
<i>You must be here.</i>
<i>This concerns all of you.</i>

1105
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:02,231
<i>I need you here with me now,</i>

1106
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:06,367
<i>quickly, quickly, quickly.</i>

1107
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:21,017
Come on in.

1108
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:22,618
Everybody, come in here.

1109
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,222
Have a seat, please be seated.

1110
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:29,657
Everyone be seated
please, have a seat.

1111
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:38,533
I've got something to
tell you, so settle down.

1112
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:41,871
You know I love you.

1113
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:44,774
Yes, Father.

1114
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:48,644
I gave you all I had.

1115
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:54,050
But there comes a day when
the quality of your life

1116
01:05:54,051 --> 01:06:00,556
matters more than the time
you've got left to live.

1117
01:06:00,557 --> 01:06:03,659
Oh, the men came here

1118
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:10,066
and destroyed everything
we worked for.

1119
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:12,168
We can't let them go
back to New York.

1120
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:13,169
No.

1121
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,437
No.

1122
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:19,775
Because they would spread lies
about us and what we have here.

1123
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:21,410
Yes, Father.

1124
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:25,147
Then their government
would send soldiers here

1125
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:29,785
to burn our homes and take our
children and kill us all!

1126
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:31,320
No, no.

1127
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:34,590
That's right, we can't
let that happen, no!

1128
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:36,826
I will not let that happen.

1129
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:39,462
Now I didn't want
to hurt these men,

1130
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:43,165
but somebody will come looking
for them, you know they will.

1131
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,333
Yes, Father.

1132
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,302
So where do they go?

1133
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:49,972
Or where do they stay?

1134
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:53,342
This is the end for us.

1135
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:59,615
Our time has finally come.

1136
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:02,118
Oh.

1137
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:08,357
Oh, mother, precious mother,

1138
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,960
(INDISTINCT)

1139
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:13,829
I'll come with you, Father.
Take me with you.

1140
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:19,001
I know you will.

1141
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:23,005
Some of you have been with
me since the beginning.

1142
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:25,741
We knew this day might come.

1143
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:32,515
We talked about it and
we planned for it.

1144
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:36,018
Some of the children have
already been given the potion.

1145
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,888
Oh, no.

1146
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:41,891
We don't wait to be murdered.

1147
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:44,160
We don't wait to be
struck down like dogs.

1148
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:48,097
Take your drink and lay down
your life with your family.

1149
01:07:48,098 --> 01:07:50,366
If we can't live our life this way,

1150
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:54,403
what earthly life is worth living?

1151
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:57,406
This is the last
sacrament, children.

1152
01:07:57,407 --> 01:08:00,676
They all know we're
not afraid to die,

1153
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:05,181
but I want us to be able
to choose our own death.

1154
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:10,252
We can go kindly and
we can go quiet.

1155
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,622
This is our final test.

1156
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:14,790
Oh, I love you all.

1157
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:18,694
You've been so loyal
to me all these years

1158
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:22,198
and we're gonna be together again.

1159
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:26,834
We are heading for eternal life.

1160
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:27,095
(GROANING)

1161
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,604
Where are they?

1162
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:37,106
They're gone.

1163
01:09:37,107 --> 01:09:39,642
Please, I could still
fly us out of here.

1164
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:42,744
Please help me, help me to my seat.

1165
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:49,218
Get your friends.
Hurry.

1166
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:53,054
We don't have much time.
Go, go.

1167
01:09:56,525 --> 01:10:01,664
Don't struggle, no, don't struggle
with it, don't you struggle.

1168
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:05,668
It's a bitter taste
and then it's over.

1169
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:11,040
There's no pain,
there's no convulsions

1170
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:14,176
and this is not suicide.

1171
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:18,647
We are not sinners, no, we're
proving our faith here.

1172
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:22,184
Let's offer our bodies
as a living sacrifice,

1173
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:27,189
holy and pleasing to
the Lord, Romans 12:1.

1174
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:32,161
We can't go back, there's
nowhere to go back to.

1175
01:10:32,162 --> 01:10:35,564
So our time is up.

1176
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,199
Don't be afraid.

1177
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,334
Don't be afraid.

1178
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:42,037
It's just stepping over
to the other side.

1179
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:44,773
That's all it is.

1180
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:49,278
Let's show the world that
the only peace left for us

1181
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,414
is in death.

1182
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,918
We are going to a better place now.

1183
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,220
Let's all go together.

1184
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:02,725
It's just a little medication,
that's all it is.

1185
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:05,794
We're just going to sleep.

1186
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:08,597
Everybody, get a drink now
just like we rehearsed.

1187
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:14,236
Father, no, no, look, I'm sorry but
this just don't make no sense.

1188
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:17,373
I mean, we all worked hard here,

1189
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:19,208
how are we just gonna
give up like this?

1190
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:21,944
Oh, son, we're not giving up.

1191
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:28,083
I've never lied to you and I tell
you now they will come down here

1192
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:32,755
with their guns and
bombs and wipe us out.

1193
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:35,958
America's on the brink
of another war.

1194
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,894
We don't deserve to die like that,

1195
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:41,897
we deserve peace.

1196
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:45,634
You all agree with that,
that's why you came down here.

1197
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,236
Father.

1198
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:57,413
We have to go, so
let's go together.

1199
01:11:57,414 --> 01:11:59,148
Out time is up.

1200
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:02,251
Come on in, bring them in.

1201
01:12:02,252 --> 01:12:04,286
That's right, that's right.

1202
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:08,023
Keep your dignity, son.
We're all here with you.

1203
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:12,528
That's right, that's right,
quickly, quickly.

1204
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:18,167
Mothers, help your children, tell
them everything is all right.

1205
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:21,370
Go ahead and drink if you
got a drink, drink it up.

1206
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:26,308
I tried to create a heaven
here, you know, I tried.

1207
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:28,944
But now the time has come.

1208
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:33,515
Step over to the other side
with our brothers and sisters,

1209
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:37,686
where the real heaven waits.

1210
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:44,560
Come over here, take
more of this, take more.

1211
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:48,831
We all must take our drink.

Take it.

Take it.

Anybody who receives this,
something terrible happened here.

1222

I don't know why, but
they're trying to kill us.

1223
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:09,411
I'm just gonna keep rolling

1224
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:11,780
and I hope that I get
as much as possible,

hope that this footage
makes it out of here.

1226

Whatever happens, this
story needs to be told.
