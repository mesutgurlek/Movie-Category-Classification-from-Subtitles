- I think your tape...
- Oh, Jesus!

00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,068
...got eaten.

5
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,026
Jesus! That was good!

6
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,738
- Yeah. They're great, Creedence.
- This thing's brand new!

7
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,459
- How about the radio?
- Radio doesn't work.

8
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,779
You can't get anything out here.
No entertainment.

9
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,542
Now there's no entertainment. Damn it!

10
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,417
Well, I guess we just have to talk
to each other, huh?

11
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,864
We talked to each other already.

12
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:20,538
Yeah, I know where you're from.

13
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,462
Hey, hey, hey,
want to see something real scary?

14
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:25,187
- Sure.
- I love this. Okay?

15
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:26,668
- Yeah, what?
- We're driving along here, right?

16
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:29,661
- Yeah.
- Imagine... Not running out of gas,

17
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,580
- we have plenty of gas. All right?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,547
Oh, my God!
What are those gravel beds up ahead?

19
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,301
They're gonna fly up
and knock out our lights.

20
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:39,906
- Hey, come on.
- Blackness. Oh, my goodness.

21
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,901
Why, there could be nuns ahead,
we wouldn't even see them.

22
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:44,308
- Isn't this amazing? Look!
- Yeah, yeah.

23
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:45,742
I don't know whether it's too safe.

24

DRIVER: I used to play chicken
and see how far we could drive

25
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:50,623
without someone, either the passenger
or the driver, going, "Stop."

26
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:51,778
- Well, I don't know.
- Oh, my God, huh?

27
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:53,461
- I think you better just...
- Who's chicken, huh?

28
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,347
...turn the lights on now.
- Is that a bear up there?

29
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:58,824
Uh-oh, more pebbles.

30
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:02,106
Oh, my goodness. It looks like
they're out permanently this time.

31
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,259
- This is dangerous.
- No. The road's straight,

32
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,226
it's just kind of scary, a little.
What is that up ahead?

33
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:07,458
Something might come up ahead.

34
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:10,017
- Yeah, right.
- A big, huge squirrel!

35
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,907
Chicks love that.

36
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:14,742
- That's scary enough.
- I know. I like it.

- Yeah.

Okay. Want to play TV theme songs?

39
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:21,981
- Sure.
- You know how to play that?

40
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,388
- No.
- I'll hum a theme song.

41
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,223
If you guess it, you get to hum one.
If I guess it, I get to have it back.

42
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:29,504
- Okay.
- Lf you get three in a row, you win.

- Absolutely, absolutely.

All right. How about this one?

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:10,103
Know it?

58
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:11,822
Look at that fossil

59
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,258
It's stuck over there in the tar

60
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,466
Look at that old man
He looks like an old ape

61
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:19,899
- What is it?
- No.

62
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,707
Look at that old bone

63
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,507
It could be worth some bucks

64
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,625
- What is it?
- I don't know.

65
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,065
Look at those two apes
This must be where they lived

66
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:32,341
Look at that city
Let's continue to dig

67
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:33,823
- What is it?
- I really don't know.

68
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,548
It's National Geographic.
National Geographic.

69
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,780
- Okay, all right. Okay, I got one for you.
- Okay.

70
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:45,544
Yes.

71
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,502
What is it?

72
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:53,388
I don't know, but you're doing it great.
Sounds like it was on CBS.

73
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:00,903
- You know what...
- I don't know.

74
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:04,379
- "Book him, Danno. Book him, Danno."
- "Book him, Danno. Book him, Danno."

75
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:06,388
One more hint.

76
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,263
- What was its locale? Locale?
- Surfboards.

77
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,103
- "An island in the Pacific Ocean."
- Gilligan's Island!

78
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,304
- Hawaii Five-O!
- Yes.

79
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,425
Jesus, I thought I was good at this.

80
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:20,898
Did you ever watch The Twilight Zone?

81
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,307
Oh, God, remember The Twilight Zone
with Burgess Meredith?

82
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,300
Remember, he loved to read,

83
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,744
and there was a nuclear war,
and he had no friends anyway,

84
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:33,944
and he was down
in the basement of the library.

85
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,144
- Oh, yeah, with the glasses!
- Yes.

86
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,140
He was the last man
and he broke his glasses.

87
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:38,218
- Yeah.
- This thing freaked me out.

88
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,539
When I was seven years old,
I bought another pair of glasses

89
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:41,948
just in case that would happen.

90
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:44,418
Those shows, they were so good,
they were so scary.

91
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,544
- Yeah.
- They were great.

92
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,699
Remember the one
where the guy had the stopwatch?

93
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:49,222
Somebody in a bar gave him a stopwatch,

94
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:50,742
and he was this real obnoxious guy.

95
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:54,219
And he took the stopwatch, and he hit it,
and everybody else in time froze but him.

96
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:56,539
- That's an Outer Limits.
- No, that was a Zone.

97
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:58,904
- That's an Outer Limits.
- That was a Zone.

98
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:00,104
Well, they had one about the mannequins

99
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,463
that got two weeks off
and turned into humans

100
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:03,699
and they were allowed to go out
and shop for two weeks on their own.

101
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:05,268
And then this one came back
and it was over two weeks,

102
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,021
and the other mannequins went
"Come over here for a minute"

103
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:09,748
- and turned her into plastic.
- Boy, they were scary. They were great.

104
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:10,978
I loved it.

105
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,266
Hey, you want to see something
really scary?

106
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:15,828
You bet!

107
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,388
- Really?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,668
Okay, this is really, really scary now.

109
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,742
- I trust you.
- Okay, pull the car over.

110
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:27,460
- Pull the car over?
- You want to see it?

111
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:30,143
- Well, show me while I'm driving.
- No, I can't. I can't tell you about it.

112
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:31,264
It should only take a couple of seconds.

113
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,464
All right. Two seconds. Okay?

114
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:33,584
- Okay.
- What is it?

115
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:34,658
- Just pull it over.
- Okay.

116
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:35,784
- I'll show you.
- All right.

117
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,664
Okay.

118
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,668
Scare me.

119
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:51,058
- Are you ready?
- Okay, go ahead.

120
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,547

(SNARLING)

NARRA TOR. You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

123
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,783
Beyond it is another dimension,

124
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,986
a dimension of sound,

00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,540
a dimension of sight,

126
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:29,945
a dimension of mind.

127
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,146
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

128
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,106
of things and ideas.

129
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,102
You've just crossed over
into the Twilight Zone.

130
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:58,377
You're about to meet an angry man,
Mr. William Connor,

131
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:02,701
who carries on his shoulder a chip
the size of the national debt.

132
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:07,180
This is a sour man, a lonely man,
who's tired of waiting for the breaks

133
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,908
that come to others but never to him.

134
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:15,268
Mr. William Connor, whose own
blind hatred is about to catapult him

135
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,627
into the darkest corner
of the Twilight Zone.

136
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,507
Hey! Hey! Bill!

137
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:31,904
- How you doing?
- All right.

138
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:36,301
I can't stay long. My wife's relatives
from Florida are coming over for dinner.

139
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,698
Hey, girl, another beer over here!

140
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,622
Bill, you look kind of cranky this evening.

141
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:43,745
Yeah, I'm pissed, all right.

142
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,787
Know that guy Goldman?

143
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,825
You didn't get promoted?

144
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,984
They gave it to that Jew bastard.

145
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,183
Why don't you come over here
and cheer me up? I need it.

146
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,987
Just drink your beer.

147
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,464
What about you? You want to cheer me up?

148
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,221
Don't touch me.

149
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,780
"Don't touch me." Okay.

150
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,907
I think she likes you, Bill.

151
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,627
- I can't believe it, you know? I can't.
- Bill, drink your beer. Relax.

152
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,620
What do you mean, "relax"?

153
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,939
They give Goldman my promotion
and you're telling me to relax.

154
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,065
You know
what that would've meant to me?

155
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,788
An extra $6,000 a year that I'd earn.

00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:46,786
We'll just knock on our son's door and say,
"Let us in, Murray. We're your parents."

464
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,220
Now, wait a minute.

465
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:53,541
Let's think this over. I mean,
we're talking about being young again.

466
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:56,020
We're talking about sex.

467
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:01,461
But Jack Dempsey isn't here!
I'll never meet him!

468
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:06,868
My ring! My wedding ring! It fell off!

469
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:11,338
Oh, please, I didn't ask to be young again.

470
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:13,784
All I wanted to do was dance.

471
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,018
I can be old and dance.

472
00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:20,789
I'm not going to school again.

473
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:25,383
I remember the night when my father died.

474
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:29,667
We laid him out
and sent all the children outside.

475
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:33,059
I saw Halley's Comet fly over.

476
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:36,744
I don't want to lose
all the people that I loved again.

477
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:40,741
I was too young to see Halley's Comet.

478
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:44,344
I was going to see it
when I was 80 years old.

479
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:48,903
That's only two birthdays away,
Mrs. Dempsey.

480
00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:53,427
Would you like to see it at eight or 80?

481
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,348
Eighty.

482
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:08,583
Thank you.

483
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:14,265
Well, you can always go inside
and go back to bed.

484
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:20,783
Maybe if you old folks had
a little of that magic still left in you,

485
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:25,781
you could wake up back
in your old, nice bodies,

486
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:32,149
but with fresh young minds.

487
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:35,385
Fresh young minds.

488
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:37,582
Young minds.

489
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:42,502
- Fresh young minds.
- Fresh young minds.

490
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:43,658
Yeah.

491
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:54,826
- Harry, wait!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!

492
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:56,740
I like being young.

493
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:16,342
Popsiclehead!

494
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:18,386
(SPEAKING YIDDISH)

495
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:22,386
There are kids in the beds.

496
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:25,464
There are kids in the beds!

497
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:30,020
- There are kids...
- Kids, kids, kids.

498
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:33,023
Kids.

499
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:36,744
Yeah. Yeah.

500
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,861
- What are you talking about?
- You'll see. There were kids in the beds.

501
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:41,462
The bed...

502
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:48,422
Well, they have...

503
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:52,185
There were kids in the beds.

504
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:57,067
- ALL: Good evening, Miss Cox.
- Well, they're old now.

505
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:01,021
Tallyho!

506
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:09,147
Welcome to Sherwood, milady.
What, Sir Guy? No greetings from you?

507
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:11,618
Why are you doing in here,
you little ragamuffin?

508
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:16,260
How dare you come in here at this hour
of the night and frighten these people.

509
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:31,063
Please, take me with you.

510
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:34,386
I want to go, too.

511
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:37,819
You can't come with me, Leo.

512
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,942
You'll have to stay with yourself.

513
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:49,784
"There's a destiny that shapes our ends,
roughhewn though it may be."

514
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:52,822
I'm sorry.

515
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:57,421
Well, let's away!

516
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:01,105
But I'm ready now.

517
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:04,667
I'm ready.

518
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,422
AGEE: It's wonderful to be young again!

519
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:11,184
Beware the thrust of my steel. Tallyho!

520
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:07,067
He'll get it.

521
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,946
Tomatoes are on the fence.

522
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:18,337
We've been saying for years
that we'd go and see that lake.

523
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:20,021
Let's ask Murray to come along.

524
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:22,782
Let's ask Mr. Conroy,
he could bring his grandchild.

525
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:28,421
Mr. Agee! Mr. Agee!
Has anyone seen Mr. Agee?

526
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:30,022
Hannah?

527
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:43,263
Why are you sitting around moping,
sitting around hoping

528
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:44,987
Just listen to me

529
00:44:45,709 --> 00:44:50,419
I'm sure that you will agree
Age means nothing

530
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:13,383
- Mr. Bloom?
- In person.

531
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:16,620
Oh, how wonderful!
We were expecting you.

532
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:21,180
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
our new guest has arrived.

533
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:41,585
NARRA TOR. Portrait of a woman in transit.
Helen Foley, age 27.

534
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:44,024
Occupation, schoolteacher.

535
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:48,705
Up until now, the pattern of her life
has been one of unrelenting sameness,

536
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:51,701
waiting for something different to happen.

537
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:57,422
Helen Foley doesn't know it yet,
but her waiting has just ended.

538
00:45:58,229 --> 00:46:01,699
Okay, I give up. Where am I?

539
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:03,108
Well, you're not lost.

540
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:06,977
It looks like you missed a turnoff
at Cliffordville right there.

541
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:11,347
Yeah, okay, half mile down the road's
a gas station, that's Beaumont.

542
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:12,623
You hang a left and you go four blocks.

543
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:14,506
The highway cuts right in front of it.
You can't miss it.

544
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:16,307
You probably...

545
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,345
Hey, kid, easy on the machinery.

546
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:23,908
It doesn't work right.

547
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,457
Kid, I don't build the games,
I just keep the quarters.

548
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:28,858
Why don't you stick another quarter in,
maybe it'll work better.

549
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:33,020
See, the highway splits
right outside of town, it goes off...

550
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,860
Walter, the kid is screwing up the TV.

551
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:38,860
Hey, it's his quarter.
The TV's free, you know.

552
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:40,428
Yeah? I got 20 bucks on this.

553
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:41,988
Lots of luck.

554
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:46,663
So, where you headed?

555
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:51,179
- Willoughby.
- Hey, nice town.

556
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:54,818
- You got a job set up there or what?
- No, not really.

557
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:56,979
- Where you from?
- Homewood.

558
00:46:57,069 --> 00:46:58,104
(PHONE RINGING)

559
00:46:58,189 --> 00:46:59,224
Nice town.

560
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:01,743
- Lf you say so.
- MAN: Hello. Yeah.

561
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:04,104
Hey, Walter, it's your wife.

562
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,907
- Your wife.
- Thanks.

563
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:16,378
...cannot hurt him. There's a left-hand...

564
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:20,582
- Okay.
- Hey, Charlie.

565
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:23,820
Hey, come on, man, take it easy.
Take it easy.

566
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:26,743
That's it.

567
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:28,942
That's enough!

568
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:32,021
What's going on here?

569
00:47:33,229 --> 00:47:34,947
Hey, what happened?

570
00:47:39,029 --> 00:47:40,906
Hey, look, I don't know
what happened, lady.

571
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:42,707
Whatever happened, I'm sorry.

572
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:45,178
Yes, well...

573
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:48,705
Hey, forget about the sandwich. No charge.

574
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:49,778
Terrific.

575
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:54,661
- Nice town.
- That was real good.

576
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:56,421
Thanks a lot, guys.

577
00:48:15,669 --> 00:48:17,466
Oh, my God.

578
00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:18,698
Are you all right?

579
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:19,778
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

580
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:22,821
Are you sure? Here. Let me see.

581
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:25,586
Oh, shit. God.

582
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:31,107
Oh, no! Look at that!
Look, I'll give you some money.

583
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:33,419
- Can you get it fixed?
- Yeah.

584
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:37,257
- Could you maybe give me a ride home?
- Sure.

585
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:45,241
HELEN: You live all the way out here?

586
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:49,881
I'll bet your parents are worried about you.

587
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:51,957
- Not really.
- No?

588
00:48:53,046 --> 00:48:56,322
Today's my birthday.
They don't even care about that.

589
00:48:58,646 --> 00:48:59,999
Really?

590
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:02,115
Wow.

591
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:05,357
- What a crummy birthday.
- It's okay.

592
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:07,004
I made a friend.

593
00:49:08,686 --> 00:49:10,085
Me, too.

594
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:12,559
I'm Anthony.

595
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:17,598
- Helen Foley.
- I'm very glad to meet you, Helen.

596
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:19,085
Thank you.

597
00:49:49,246 --> 00:49:50,804
What a lovely house.

598
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:52,080
- You like it?
- Yeah.

599
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:54,441
It's really peaceful out here by itself.

600
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,485
Come on in.

601
00:50:26,246 --> 00:50:28,885
Hello? It's me!

602
00:50:28,966 --> 00:50:31,036
- Hi, Anthony!
- Hi!

603
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:33,082
- Well, well, well.
- Hello.

604
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:36,715
- Anthony's home!
- Look at this. How do you do?

605
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:39,320
- This is Helen.
- Is that right? Helen?

606
00:50:39,406 --> 00:50:41,681
Helen, delighted to meet you.
Any friend of Anthony's is a friend...

607
00:50:41,766 --> 00:50:42,915
Hello.

608
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,600
This is Uncle Walt and my sister, Ethel.

609
00:50:45,686 --> 00:50:46,721
How do you do?

610
00:50:46,806 --> 00:50:50,003
Well, now, did I hear Anthony come in?

611
00:50:50,086 --> 00:50:53,158
- Yes, there he is!
- This is my mother and father.

612
00:50:53,246 --> 00:50:54,281
- Hello.
- Hello.

613
00:50:54,366 --> 00:50:56,641
- This is Helen.
- Helen Foley.

614
00:50:56,726 --> 00:50:57,795
Helen. Delighted.

615
00:50:57,886 --> 00:51:00,605
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Helen.
- She gave me a ride home.

616
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:02,517
- Did she?
- You don't mean it!

617
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:03,959
Very generous of you.

618
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:06,719
Yes, well, I'm afraid
we had a little accident.

619
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:08,960
Accident?

620
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:12,004
Yes, well, I knocked Anthony down
while he was riding his bicycle.

621
00:51:12,086 --> 00:51:15,874
- Did you?
- You knocked him down?

622
00:51:16,486 --> 00:51:17,601
Yes.

623
00:51:19,366 --> 00:51:20,924
(FATHER LAUGHING)

624
00:51:21,006 --> 00:51:23,440
Well, doesn't look like
there was any harm done.

625
00:51:23,526 --> 00:51:27,405
- WALT: No, sir. No, sir. Anthony's fine.
- Oh, yes. Yes, Anthony's fine!

626
00:51:27,486 --> 00:51:29,761
- Can Helen stay for supper, Mother?
- Oh, no, really, I was just...

627
00:51:29,846 --> 00:51:31,279
- What a wonderful idea!
- ETHEL: Good idea.

628
00:51:31,366 --> 00:51:33,482
Of course she can!

629
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,963
Well, that would be lovely.

630
00:51:38,046 --> 00:51:40,276
- ANTHONY: Can we eat right now?
- Oh, yes.

631
00:51:40,366 --> 00:51:41,560
Sure! Why not!

632
00:51:41,646 --> 00:51:44,206
WALT: Why not?
We can eat anytime we want.

633
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:46,356
- May I wash my hands?
- Right this way.

634
00:51:46,446 --> 00:51:48,801
- You may leave this.
- All right.

635
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:52,435
- And I'll help you with your sweater.
- Thank you.

636
00:51:53,766 --> 00:51:55,836
See you in a little while.

637
00:52:05,366 --> 00:52:06,765
Mind the step.

638
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:40,525
Anthony.

639
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,394
Anthony?

640
00:52:57,686 --> 00:52:58,914
Anthony?

641
00:53:00,686 --> 00:53:02,199
Ah, the beach.

642
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:04,157
(OTHERS CHATTERING)

643
00:53:04,286 --> 00:53:07,323
Oh, I used to love the beach.

644
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:10,480
FATHER: Well then, you don't get a light.

645
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:12,124
Give me a light
and you can have a cigarette.

646
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:13,719
You give me a cigarette,
then you can have a light.

647
00:53:13,806 --> 00:53:15,285
It doesn't work that way. I found them first.

648
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,355
Don't tell me how it works.

649
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:20,001
Here. Here. Where is that mirror?
You two shouldn't be smoking, anyway.

650
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:21,519
You know it isn't good for you.

651
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:37,480
Hello.

652
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:45,795
That's Sara, my other sister.

653
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:49,483
She was in an accident.

654
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:04,359
ANTHONY: Here I come.

655
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:10,163
I always like to let them know
when I'm coming.

656
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,401
- We're ready to eat now.
- MOTHER: Wonderful!

657
00:54:13,486 --> 00:54:14,475
WALT: Well, that's marvelous!

658
00:54:14,566 --> 00:54:17,205
FATHER: Great! I'm starving.
WALT: Me, too. Me, too.

659
00:54:24,246 --> 00:54:28,637
Well, let's get started.
I bet Anthony is really hungry.

660
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:30,876
Come on, now. Here you go.

661
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:32,399
WOMAN: Here's your sweater, dear.

662
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:36,877
Well, now, you know, we are so happy
that you can eat with us.

663
00:54:36,966 --> 00:54:40,720
You know, Anthony is so thoughtful
about things like that.

664
00:54:40,806 --> 00:54:43,161
Would you like to sit beside me?

665
00:54:43,566 --> 00:54:45,796
- Maybe your mother would...
- Oh, no, no, no.

666
00:54:45,886 --> 00:54:48,275
You see, I'm going to have
to be fixing supper.

667
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:49,685
Yes, that's right.

668
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,916
You sit right next to Anthony.

669
00:54:52,006 --> 00:54:54,361
Oh, that's fine. Just fine.

670
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:56,562
- All right. All right.
- Very good, yes.

WOMAN ON TV. Now, you listen to me,

672
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:08,760
don't you dare bring
one more thing into this house!

673
00:55:08,846 --> 00:55:11,280
Do you hear me? One more thing!

674
00:55:11,366 --> 00:55:14,324
Not one solitary single thing!

Darling, do you remember where supper is?

678
00:55:23,926 --> 00:55:25,723
You know where it is.

00:55:27,646 --> 00:55:31,002
- I do?
- In the oven, isn't it, Mother?

680
00:55:32,606 --> 00:55:35,837
Oh, yes! Yes, of course! Of course.

681
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,879
- How silly of me.
- She never knows.

682
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:45,562
- I'll help you find it, Mother.
- We'll be back in just a little while.

683
00:55:46,766 --> 00:55:48,677
We cartoon characters
can have a wonderful life,

684
00:55:48,766 --> 00:55:50,643
if we only take advantage of it.

685
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:55,277
- We can do anything we think of.
- What do you mean, chum?

686
00:55:55,366 --> 00:55:57,926
Well, supposing I decide
I want to be a mouse.

687
00:55:58,486 --> 00:55:59,635
I'm a mouse.

(HELEN AGREEING)

- What else do you like?
- Nothing else is as good.

691
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:10,561
Anything can happen in cartoons.

692
00:56:10,646 --> 00:56:14,161
- Here we go!
- Good eatings for everybody.

693
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:17,124
- Yummy, yummy, yummy!
- Yes, sir.

694
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:18,639
All right, all right, come on.

695
00:56:18,726 --> 00:56:23,436
Anthony, this is yours, dear,
in your regular place right there.

696
00:56:23,526 --> 00:56:26,279
And, Helen, why don't you sit right here
next to Anthony.

697
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:28,596
- This is for you, Uncle Walt.
- Thank you.

698
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,085
- There we are.
- Here you go, Mother.

699
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:32,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mother.

700
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,441
You're welcome, Anthony.

701
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,998
- I love this. This is great.
- It really hits the spot.

702
00:56:55,686 --> 00:56:57,005
Okay?

703
00:56:57,526 --> 00:56:58,800
Fine.

704
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:09,480
Peanut butter. It's good that way.

705
00:57:12,646 --> 00:57:16,719
- Peanut butter makes the burger.
- That's right. That's right.

706
00:57:16,806 --> 00:57:19,001
Wouldn't go down otherwise.

707
00:57:20,486 --> 00:57:21,965
Peanut butter's good for you.

708
00:57:25,446 --> 00:57:27,323
I could eat another plateful.

709
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:38,845
Do you eat like this all the time?

710
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:42,043
Anthony can always have
anything he wants.

711
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,435
- Anything at all.
- You bet.

712
00:57:44,526 --> 00:57:46,915
Well, don't you think it's good?

713
00:57:47,606 --> 00:57:50,439
You're young. You need your nutrition.

714
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:53,405
You can't eat like this all the time.

715
00:58:03,926 --> 00:58:06,121
It's not good all the time.

716
00:58:07,286 --> 00:58:10,676
- No, it's not!
- Anthony, that is absolutely right!

717
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,760
- You hit the nail on the head!
- You are so right!

718
00:58:14,246 --> 00:58:16,316
You never tell me that!

719
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:21,440
Not happy birthday!

720
00:58:21,526 --> 00:58:25,155
No, not happy birthday!

721
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:29,003
Of course! It's a birthday supper.

722
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:34,277
Another birthday? With presents?
And wishes?

723
00:58:37,486 --> 00:58:38,999
I didn't do it!

724
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:44,646
It's okay. Everything's okay.

725
00:58:45,686 --> 00:58:48,325
I'm sorry, Anthony.
I really have to be going.

No, please don't go!

00:58:54,606 --> 00:58:55,675
He's gonna do a trick.

729
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:58,326
MOTHER:
Oh, you've got to stay for the trick!

730
00:58:58,406 --> 00:59:00,044
He's going to do a trick!

731
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:02,401
Come back. Come back. Wait. Wait.

732
00:59:02,486 --> 00:59:04,920
- Do the hat trick, Uncle Walt.
- Yes. Oh, yes.

733
00:59:05,006 --> 00:59:08,442
- Where's the hat?
- It's on the TV.

734
00:59:12,486 --> 00:59:15,717
- There it is. All right.
- Now, then, you've got to stay here.

735
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:17,364
You sit right down there.

736
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:21,082
The hat trick.

737
00:59:21,886 --> 00:59:23,638
Well, let's see.

738
00:59:24,926 --> 00:59:29,875
Nothing up the sleeve. There we go.
That's it. Nothing up the sleeve. See that?

739
00:59:33,566 --> 00:59:37,718
Well, nothing up the sleeve and...

740
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:43,556
And... I beg your pardon. Excuse me. Yes.

741
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,843
- Go ahead, Uncle Walt.
- Oh, yes, yes.

742
00:59:46,926 --> 00:59:49,838
But the hat. Where's the hat?

743
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:57,681
Nothing, as you can see, in the hat, right?

744
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:01,234
Nothing in the hat.

745
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,801
So...

746
01:00:05,206 --> 01:00:09,199
You'll like this. Do it, Uncle Walt!

747
01:00:10,366 --> 01:00:11,719
Yes, sir.

748
01:00:17,766 --> 01:00:20,405
- Go ahead, Uncle Walt!
- Yes.

749
01:00:43,486 --> 01:00:44,680
You see?

750
01:00:45,686 --> 01:00:47,517
Isn't this fun? We do it a lot.

751
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:50,518
- You'll love it here.
- You'll really like it here. Really. I promise.

752
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:53,040
- I swear you'll like it.
- Do more!

755
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:04,720
Go away!

756
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:17,402
Please don't go, Helen.
I can make it real nice here.

757
01:01:17,486 --> 01:01:20,683
I can make the food
just the way you said it should be.

758
01:01:20,766 --> 01:01:22,882
I can even change the house.

759
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:27,395
Just say it and I can make
whatever you like. Just don't...

760
01:01:34,646 --> 01:01:37,479
I told you. They hate me!

761
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:39,636
They want to send me away
to someplace bad

762
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:42,160
just like my real mother and father did.

763
01:01:42,246 --> 01:01:44,601
That's not right, Anthony.
You know we wouldn't do that.

764
01:01:44,686 --> 01:01:47,120
No, we love you, Anthony. Honestly, we do.

765
01:01:47,206 --> 01:01:49,117
- Sure.
- ANTHONY: They're afraid of me!

766
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,436
Everybody is.
That's why they act that way.

767
01:01:51,526 --> 01:01:53,357
And I do everything for them.

768
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:56,006
They can just sit around
and watch TV all day.

769
01:01:56,086 --> 01:01:58,759
No one has to do a thing. Not a thing!

770
01:01:58,846 --> 01:02:01,997
- And I'm real good all the time.
- That's right. You're a good boy, Anthony.

771
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:05,681
- You're a good boy. We love you.
- Yeah.

772
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:08,439
Well, then, I wonder who wrote this note.

773
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:11,359
I wonder who called me a monster.

774
01:02:11,446 --> 01:02:12,799
It wasn't me, Anthony.

775
01:02:12,886 --> 01:02:15,958
Why, I'd never do anything like that,
you know that.

776
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:19,595
- Don't look at me.
- Me either!

777
01:02:19,686 --> 01:02:21,881
It wasn't any of us, Anthony. It was her!

- No. It wasn't me!
- No, her, her. Ethel! Ethel!

779
01:02:24,446 --> 01:02:27,085
It must have been Ethel.
Of course, it had to have been Ethel.

01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:28,315
- That's right.
- Yes.

Ethel! There you are. It was Ethel.
That's right.

- Oh, great.
- MOTHER: It had to have been Ethel.

01:02:35,846 --> 01:02:38,041
Of course, it was Ethel. Of course.

784
01:02:38,126 --> 01:02:41,755
Oh, I didn't know that.

785
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:45,361
What a big surprise. Ethel, huh?

786
01:02:45,446 --> 01:02:48,995
Go ahead, Anthony. Do it! Do it!

Do what, Ethel?

788
01:02:51,246 --> 01:02:53,760
Now, do you realize
you'll never get out of here?

789
01:02:53,846 --> 01:02:56,121
You think it was an accident
you came here?

790
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:57,798
He made it happen.

791
01:02:57,886 --> 01:03:02,243
He brought you here, just like
he brought us here and kept us here.

792
01:03:02,326 --> 01:03:04,999
Just the way he'll keep you here.

793
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:07,919
Maybe he'll get mad at you
like he did to his real sister

794
01:03:08,006 --> 01:03:09,359
and cripple you and take away your mouth

795
01:03:09,446 --> 01:03:12,404
so you won't be able
to yell at him anymore.

796
01:03:12,486 --> 01:03:16,718
Or maybe he'll do to you
what he did to his real mother and father.

797
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:19,320
Time for you to go now, Ethel.

798

- Anthony, don't!
- It's a big surprise.

799

I just made it up.

I told you cartoons are good.

All I have to do is wish for something

you're safer up here than on the ground.

- Yes, I'm sure.

Anything you need, call me.

935
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:43,522
Well, thank you, but I'm sure I'll be fine.

936
01:15:44,486 --> 01:15:46,761
Really, I'll be fine.

937
01:15:47,646 --> 01:15:48,635

01:17:53,446 --> 01:17:55,437
There's something out there!

943
01:17:55,526 --> 01:17:58,165
There's something moving, I saw it!

944
01:18:00,006 --> 01:18:02,725
There's a man on the wing of this plane!

945
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:31,485
There was somebody out there.

946
01:18:31,566 --> 01:18:35,161
- You've got to believe me!
- I saw him. Green and slimy.

947
01:18:35,246 --> 01:18:37,919
- Leave the poor man alone.
- I'm only trying to help.

948
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:40,964
- You've got to humor them.
- There was lightning.

949
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:43,765
At first I thought it was an animal,
some kind of a bird or something,

950
01:18:43,846 --> 01:18:44,961
but it was a man!

951
01:18:45,046 --> 01:18:48,004
There were flames
coming out of the engine,

952
01:18:48,086 --> 01:18:51,158
and then a flash and then smoke!

953
01:18:51,566 --> 01:18:55,559
Maybe it was a technician who was caught
on the plane when it took off.

954
01:18:55,646 --> 01:18:57,796
My God, how could he survive out there?
The air is too thin.

955
01:18:57,886 --> 01:19:02,118
The blast of the wind. It's... It's so cold.

956

01:19:14,646 --> 01:19:17,843
My God. I feel so stupid.

958
01:19:30,046 --> 01:19:31,638
Can you imagine?

959
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:36,004
A naked man crawling along the wing
of an airplane at 35,000 feet?

960
01:19:36,086 --> 01:19:38,839
There's no reason to feel embarrassed,
Mr. Valentine.

961
01:19:38,926 --> 01:19:43,875
- Just try to get some sleep.
- It's amazing, the mind,

962
01:19:44,206 --> 01:19:47,278
how the eyes can make you see
something that isn't even there.

963
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:48,515
There's a man in seat 3F

964
01:19:48,606 --> 01:19:50,801
that's completely freaking out.

965

Look, you're just gonna
have to deal with him.

966
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:55,885
It's all right.
You don't have to stay with me.

967
01:19:55,966 --> 01:19:58,434
I know you have other passengers
to attend to.

968
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,118
I'm happy to sit with you till you sleep.

969
01:20:00,206 --> 01:20:04,085
No, it's probably easier for me if I'm alone.

There's a man outside.

- You've got to let me outside.

- Get us on the ground!

- Take care of the little girl.
- Okay. Come here, darling.

- That's it. Relax.

Nothing at all. I'm sorry I shouted.

you've got to see this my way.

I'm the First Officer of an airplane
in a severe storm.

Now, I have an irrational passenger.

1005

You're threatening the safety
of this aircraft

1006
01:24:04,446 --> 01:24:06,357
and you're frightening
the other passengers.

1007

You either calm down
or we're gonna handcuff you.

1008

Listen, there's something wrong
with this airplane!

I don't care what happens to me,

but if somebody doesn't do something
about it, we're all gonna die!

Mr. Valentine, what do you think
is wrong with this aircraft?

1015
01:24:31,606 --> 01:24:34,404
- There's an engine out.
- Which one?

1016
01:24:35,046 --> 01:24:37,082
The one on the outside.

1017
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:39,839
Outboard number one. It's out, isn't it?

1018
01:24:40,726 --> 01:24:44,719

- Never mind about that. It's true, isn't it?

1019
01:24:45,766 --> 01:24:48,280
Nine minutes ago, outboard number one
was struck by lightning.

1020
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:49,640
There was a flame-out, and we lost it.

Mr. Valentine,
this aircraft has four engines.

1023
01:24:57,526 --> 01:25:00,677
The possibility of us losing one of the
remaining three is remote in the extreme.

1024
01:25:00,766 --> 01:25:02,961
You're sure it was just lightning?

1025
01:25:04,646 --> 01:25:05,965
Absolutely.

1026

Listen, we're gonna be landing
in about 20 minutes.

1027
01:25:14,006 --> 01:25:17,999
There is the highest probability
that we'll survive this flight.

Not to mention the gun.
The gun was awful.
