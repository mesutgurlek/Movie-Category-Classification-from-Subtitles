1
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,377
Penny, this is
the fifth time we've stopped

2
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,295
since this morning.
At this rate,

3
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,048
we're not going to get
to the inn until after midnight.

4
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,721
If you're deliberately
trying to sabotage the trip,

5
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,223
you're doing
a pretty good job.

6
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,726
No, I just--

7
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,521
I--

8
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,356
I have to go
to the bathroom.

9
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,908
Is she all right?

10
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,452
Uh, just a little
carsick.

11
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,413
It's just a car.

12
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,457
It's just a car.

13
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,751
It's just a stupid car!

14
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,048
Jesus, Penny.

15
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,925
Get a grip.

16
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,306
Do you want
to be a pathetic freak

17
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,433
for the rest
of your miserable life?

18
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,041
Penny?

19
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,879
Penny?

20
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,094
Penny!

21
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,138
Penny, please.

22
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,935
Penny, please,
wake up.

23
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,404
We've got a gas leak.
Let's get these people out.

24
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,624
He's gone. We've got to get the mother
and the daughter out of there fast.

25
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,502
Daddy?

26
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,687
Penny?

27
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,482
Penny, you'll be okay.

28
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,154
The nice fireman...

29
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,908
is coming
to get you, dear.

30
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,829
Don't be afraid.

31
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,555
No!

32
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,154
We were going
to build a snowman.

33
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm sorry,
what did you say?

34
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,537
That's why we were going up.
I'd never seen snow before.

35
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,956
You wanna see plenty
of snow up there

36
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,793
come this time tomorrow.
Cutoff low is setting in overnight.

37
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,213
Weatherman says it might be
as much as three or four feet.

38
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,185
Maybe we should
just go home.

39
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,979
It sounds like
a pretty bad storm.

40
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,607
Penny, is that
what you want?

41
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,652
To come out all this way
just to turn around and go home?

42
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,781
When you first came
to see me six months ago,

43
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,075
you said all you wanted
was to live a normal life,

44
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,703
and that you would do
whatever it took to get you there.

45
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,622
Isn't that
what you said?

46
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,876
And what did I tell you in our
first session, that very first day?

47
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:45,340
Own it.
I have to own it.

48
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,969
That's right.
It has to be your choice.

49
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,222
Beating our fears and phobias
is all about helping ourselves,

50
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,224
and no amount of counseling
is going to help you

51
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,727
unless you want
to help yourself.

52
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,062
I do.
I want to.

53
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,648
I have to.

54
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,902
I'm not going to ride my stupid bicycle
everywhere for the rest of my life.

55
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,196
You have to confront
your fears head on,

56
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,866
and the only way you can
completely do that is to--

57
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,618
Complete the circle.

58
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,413
Go back to where
it all began.

59
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,957
Okay, what do you say
we get back in the car...

60
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,627
and go on with our journey?

61
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,993
Don't forget your
breathing exercises.

62
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,877
Relaxation tape
number four.

63
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,090
- You know the drill.
- Face forward in a seated position,

64
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,969
eyes closed, arms resting
comfortably by your side,

65
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,639
allowing your mind
to clear itself

66
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,808
of any outside stimuli.

67
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,519
Now repeat after me

68
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,938
and try to visualize

69
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,982
a giraffe...

70
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,132
...Buffalo...

71
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:53,010
My throat's pretty dry.

72
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,013
There's some bottled water
in the back.

73
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,727
...Coyote--

74
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,652
What's this?

75
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,447
For when we build
that snowman.

76
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,456
You should write
a book about me.

77
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,918
Tell the world what a freak
Penny Deerborn is.

78
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,838
Penny, after everything
we've been through together,

79
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,841
I'd like to think you've moved
beyond feeling sorry for yourself.

80
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,428
Why don't you spare both of us
the poor-pitiful-me routine

81
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,181
and tell me what's
really bothering you?

82
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,266
It wouldn't
have anything to do

83
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,144
with all those phone calls
you're not answering, would it?

84
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,067
I'd rather not
talk about it.

85
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,740
It's going to be a long couple of hours
ahead if we don't talk to one another.

86
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,745
Ben.

87
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,957
He lives in my building,
that's who's calling.

88
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,543
I see.

89
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,546
And why is this Ben
calling you?

90
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,590
To ask me out.

91
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,885
There's nothing surprising about that.
You're a very pretty girl.

92
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,514
- Don't you like him?
- Just the opposite.

93
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,808
So then what's
the problem?

94
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,853
I can just imagine me
on our first date.

95
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,897
"Hi, it's good to see you.

96
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,525
Oh, what a nice car.
Excuse me while I throw up."

97
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,532
I just don't see the point in starting
something I can't finish.

98
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,123
I remember being your age.
Freshman in college--

99
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,125
I had a very serious crush

100
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,711
on this gorgeous guy
in my English Lit class.

101
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,796
Only I was totally convinced

102
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,174
that he didn't even know
I existed.

103
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,427
I mean, he was the quarterback
of the football team,

104
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,971
and I was just
a lowly freshman

105
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,056
with curly hair
and a funny nose.

106
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,641
You don't have
a funny nose.

107
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,352
No, you couldn't have convinced me
of that back then.

108
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,480
So what happened?

109
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,983
I married him.

110
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,948
I like that story.

111
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,075
The only limitations
in this life

112
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,037
are the ones we put
on ourselves, Penny.

113
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,539
What was that?

114
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,083
It's just a pothole.
It's okay.

115
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,587
Remember to breathe.

116
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,509
Okay, relaxation.

117
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,575
Penny?
Penny!

118
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,037
Penny, you didn't take
something, did you?

119
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,039
What?

120
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,458
We agreed no sedatives.

121
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,460
No more self-medicating,
remember?

122
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,004
Yes. I mean, yes,
I remember.

123
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,340
No, I didn't
take anything.

124
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,342
I was just--

125
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,512
just trying to do
what you told me and relax.

126
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,180
You know,
if you took something,

127
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,391
it negates everything
that we're trying to do here.

128
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,728
Orianna,
I'm telling you the truth.

129
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,065
- Honest.
- Okay.

130
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,442
Then you won't mind
emptying out your pockets.

131
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,364
Just as I thought.

132
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:51,456
This is shit. This defeats
the whole purpose of this trip,

133
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,250
and you know it.

134
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,712
You have to trust in the process, Penny.
You have to trust me.

135
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,090
I just-- I didn't think I'd
make it through without it.

136
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,884
I'm so disappointed in you.

137
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,095
We might as well just turn the car
around and head right back--

138
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,722
Look out!

139
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:17,149
Are you okay?

140
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,069
Oh, God.

141
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,295
Are you all right?

142
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,464
Do you need
a ride somewhere?

143
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,768
He seems to be all right.
I just grazed him.

144
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,604
Oh, thank God.
That was close.

145
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,773
What did he say?

146
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,484
The poor guy's so cold, he could
barely speak above a whisper.

147
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,695
He said something about needing
a lift to a camp near Onyx Pass.

148
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,989
- You're going to give him a ride?
- I just hit him.

149
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,784
We're lucky he's not
calling the police.

150
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,912
The least we can do is give him a ride.
It's freezing out there.

151
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,686
Okay.

152
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,567
Everybody all set?

153
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,839
It's cold out there, right?
You must have been freezing.

154
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,719
So I'm Orianna
and this is Penny.

155
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,395
Penny, would you like
to listen to another tape?

156
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,939
No, I'm fine.

157
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:32,534
If you're hungry, there's an apple
in the bag back there.

158
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,059
It's okay.
It's just another pothole.

159
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,022
I'm sorry.

160
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,024
I'm just a little nervous.

161
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:07,861
- Cars make me nervous.
- But you're getting better.

162
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:11,323
No, actually, I'm more
than a little nervous.

163
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,743
I'm petrified.

164
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,496
I have amaxophobia.
It's a fear of cars.

165
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,748
Orianna is my doctor.

166
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,626
She says its more common
than you would think.

167
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,086
Have you-- have you ever--

168
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,089
have you ever heard of it?

169
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,721
No, I guess not.

170
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,600
I'll just stop talking.

171
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,146
# Don't come knocking
on my door #

172
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:48,277
# 'Cause there'll be
no more cryin' to me #

173
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,365
# I heard he tore
your heart in two... #

174
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,410
Remember your
breathing exercises.

175
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,538
# Was it anything
like me and you? #

176
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,378
# Did he leave when things
weren't working out #

177
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,298
# And there was nothing
you could do? #

178
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:15,929
# And did he say,
"We'll still be friends" #

179
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:22,728
# And "I'll love you
till the end"? #

180
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,565
# Don't come back
cryin' to me #

181
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,321
# When your new love
sets you free #

182
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,825
# Don't come
knockin' on my door #

183
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,828
# 'Cause there'll be
no more cryin' to me... #

184
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,414
Oh, uh, no thank you.

185
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm not very hungry right now,
but thank you.

186
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:48,045
# You say you want
another chance... #

187
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,006
No, thank you, I'm fine.

188
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,927
# That you've learned
about true romance #

189
00:18:54,968 --> 00:19:00,641
# But I know about
the games you play #

190
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:04,102
# And all along how you
would never stay... #

191
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,742
We're getting close
to Onyx Pass.

192
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,124
So, um...

193
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,209
it doesn't look like
the camp is open.

194
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,796
You said you
work here, right?

195
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,217
Not much of a talker.

196
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,898
I don't see
any lights or anything.

197
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,714
You want us
to drop you here?

198
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,659
Jesus, what a creep!

199
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,816
Everything's okay, Penny.
Everything's okay.

200
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,026
We're gonna be okay.
Come on, honey, breathe.

201
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,529
Good, breathe.

202
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,420
Oh, God. I think I'm going
to be sick.

203
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,848
Penny, come on.
Get back in the car.

204
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,435
Penny, come on.

205
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:35,814
- Oh, God.
- Penny, get in!

206
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,170
All right, hey--
this is no time to panic.

207
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,088
We have to get
back to a highway

208
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,216
before that tire
goes completely flat.

209
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,968
Okay okay. Shh.

210
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,095
Okay okay okay.

211
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,389
Listen to me. Penny, Penny,
Penny, look at me.

212
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,808
Look at me. All right,
I want you to count-- one--

213
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,353
Breathe in.
Breathe in.

214
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,898
Breathe out, that's right.
That's good, let it go.

215
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,360
I wanna go home.

216
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,404
I know, honey, so do I, but first
we have to get back in the car.

217
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:28,283
- No no.
- Penny! Penny, Penny.

218
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:31,787
I want you to visualize that beach,
the place you love.

219
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,873
Come on.
The sun is warming your skin.

220
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,793
It's making you feel good.

221
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,629
- I'm so cold.
- No, it's not cold.

222
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,423
It's hot now. It's hot,

223
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,926
the way you like it on the beach
in the middle of July.

224
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,595
Listen--
the sun, the sand,

225
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,472
the water.

226
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,809
Now, Penny, I want you to turn around
and look at the car.

227
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,061
- It can't hurt you. It's just a car.
- No!

228
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,313
Penny, you have to do
what I'm telling you!

229
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,440
We've got to get
back in the car!

230
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,735
Okay, I'm leaving!

231
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,822
No.

232
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,960
Come on, come on,
come on!

233
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,129
- I hurt my ankle.
- All right.

234
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:25,132
We'll get some ice on it
as soon as we get to the inn.

235
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:27,926
Penny, Penny, can you clean off
the back window?

236
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,428
I can't see a thing.

237
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,139
Just do it!
I need to know if he's following us.

238
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,226
Oh, hell.

239
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:39,248
Cell phone.
Where's my cell phone?

240
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:46,255
Damn it.

241
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,802
- No, don't leave me here!
- I just have to check the tire.

242
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:03,772
The tire's
completely destroyed.

243
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,998
Damn it.

244
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,171
- The spare's no good.
- What are we going to do?

245
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,714
Keep trying
to use the cell phone.

246
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:31,466
Come on, grab the coats.

247
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,760
Oh, and turn off
the headlights.

248
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,325
Ow.

249
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,076
Oh, come on.
Let me see, let me see.

250
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,078
Oh.

251
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,663
Wait, it's not good.

252
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:04,166
If you put more pressure on it,
it'll just get worse.

253
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,709
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine, I can walk.

254
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,794
No, listen to me.
I won't leave you.

255
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,963
I just need to try and get a signal.
I won't go far.

256
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,757
If it doesn't work,
I'll come right back,

257
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,301
- and we'll think of something else.
- No no no.

258
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:15,928
- Damn it!
- Penny, come on.

259
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:19,348
Get back in the car.
Just sit in here, lock the doors.

260
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:21,683
- You'll be warm and safe inside.
- Please don't--

261
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,810
- don't-- please don't go.
- Penny, I have to.

262
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:27,189
There's no other choice.
I won't be long. You'll see.

263
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,691
What if he's still out there?

264
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,736
We're a mile away from him now.
He's a coward playing games.

265
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,906
If he really wanted to hurt us, he would
have done it when he was in the car.

266
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:38,534
- Orianna, please stay.
- Just stay in the car.

267
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,577
Keep the doors locked
and the windows rolled up.

268
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,663
Come on.

269
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,207
Here, take this.

270
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,543
- What am I supposed to do with it?
- Just take it.

271
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:49,586
It's pepper spray.

272
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,880
- Don't go!
- Two minutes, that's all.

273
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,258
I'll be back in two minutes.

274
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:49,062
911, state your
emergency, please.

275
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,647
Yes, hello? I--

276
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,192
Shit shit!

277
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:58,113
Penny?

278
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,642
Ostrich...

279
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:19,296
Crocodile...

280
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:35,604
Orianna?

281
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,960
Orianna?

282
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,137
Shit.

283
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,526
Orianna?

284
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,089
Orianna?

285
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:11,760
Was that you?

286
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:50,048
Orianna?

287
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:12,446
Orianna!

288
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,451
Orianna?

289
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:24,499
Why didn't you
take me with you?

290
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:44,621
Weatherman's telling us
we may see thunder and lightning

291
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:47,958
as the storm moves in, sending
temperatures plummeting well below zero.

292
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,544
And now, back to more music
on Mountain-95.

293
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,425
Son of a bitch.

294
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:59,136
What's the matter?

295
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:02,598
Somebody killed Becky Simpson
over at the diner this morning.

296
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:04,933
- No shit.
- Yeah.

297
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:08,061
Run a meat skewer
clean through her neck.

298
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,689
Damn. Poor Becky.

299
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,609
They got any idea
who did it?

300
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:18,447
Somebody that didn't like
her meatloaf would be my guess.

301
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,914
That's not funny, Eddie.

302
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,417
No, I guess not.

303
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,879
Found a guy in the trunk of a car
parked out front too.

304
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:36,924
Some businessman
from down in the flats--

305
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,635
made hamburger
out of his face with a tire tool

306
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:42,888
and stuffed him
in the trunk of his own car.

307
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,600
What the hell
is this world coming to?

308
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:49,478
Coming to an end
would be my guess.

309
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:51,730
All you gotta do is read
the paper to know that.

310
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:54,149
Sin, misery
everywhere you look.

311
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:56,318
That's a little drastic,
don't you think?

312
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,655
With everybody
killing each other,

313
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:02,407
robbing, lying...

314
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,827
fucking somebody
else's wife.

315
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:10,290
You got something
to say to me, Eddie,

316
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:12,125
let's hear it.

317
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:17,798
# You just come
back now, steady-- #

318
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,883
We got work to do.

319
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:24,721
Come on, we gotta secure this camp
before that storm sets in.

320
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,853
No, come on, Eddie.

321
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:33,730
You wanna say something to me?
Get it out.

322
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:37,109
You say you cut through
them woods every day

323
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,986
on that old logging road
out there,

324
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:41,488
- 'cause it's a shortcut, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

325
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,657
It shaves about 20 minutes
off my walk to work.

326
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:46,618
All right.
All right, that makes sense.

327
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,079
What doesn't make sense
is why you're spending

328
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,040
all your break time
out in them woods.

329
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:57,254
It wouldn't have anything to do
with Mary Saunders, now would it?

330
00:38:57,296 --> 00:39:00,465
Like you said,
we got work to do.

331
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,803
Look, all I'm saying
is a small town like this,

332
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:07,306
you can't get away
with anything.

333
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:11,476
You'd better think twice before you
go diddling some other man's wife.

334
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,687
Thanks, Eddie.
I'll keep that in mind--

335
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:17,191
if I ever think about diddling
some other man's wife.

336
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:14,039
Orianna?

337
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:19,127
Where are we?

338
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:45,863
Penny?
Penny, is that you?

339
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:48,156
I told you
to stay in the car.

340
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:51,869
Come on, this isn't funny.
Get that light out of my eyes.

341
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,038
Penny!
Penny?

342
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:19,688
Oh, God!

343
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:32,784
Oh God!

344
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:38,415
No!

345
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,044
Oh, God!

346
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:13,033
Somebody help me!

347
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:18,914
Somebody please!

348
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:25,546
Somebody help me!

349
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:41,478
Somebody!

350
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:46,775
Somebody!

351
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,282
Please...

352
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,081
Please.

353
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:20,642
No-- somebody.

354
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:40,704
Somebody help me!

355
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:43,123
Somebody help me!

356
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:49,046
Somebody help me!

357
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:52,633
Somebody!

358
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:13,862
Oh, God!

359
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:19,535
Help me!
Somebody help me!

360
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:27,042
Somebody, please!

361
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:52,628
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

362
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:56,131
It's just a bad
bad bad dream.

363
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:58,634
It's...

364
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,303
it's a dream, a dream.

365
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,724
Why didn't I listen to you,
right, Orianna?

366
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:18,315
"Stay in the car."
That's what you said, right?

367
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:24,321
Someone's gonna come
help me, right, Orianna?

368
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:26,573
Right?
Someone has to come.

369
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:29,660
They have to come.

370
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:32,746
You should have stayed
in the car, but you didn't.

371
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:26,485
Ben, thank God!

372
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:29,029
Penny? I can
barely hear you.

373
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:30,906
- Ben!
- We have a bad connection.

374
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:33,909
- Listen to me!
- I'll call you back later.

375
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,411
Ben, no!
Wait wait wait!

376
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:10,612
Oh, no!
No!

377
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:55,949
What do you
want from me?

378
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,356
No!

379
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:33,529
No!

380
00:53:00,806 --> 00:53:03,058
Jesus, Alvin! You scared
the shit out of me.

381
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,478
Unlock the door.
It's cold out here.

382
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:15,696
# Lordy Lordy Lord,
I could make her mine #

383
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:19,408
# Lovin' lovin' lovin'
just to sleep again #

384
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:23,078
# It won't stop there,
I'm gonna love you #

385
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,581
# Don't stop it #

386
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:27,833
# Don't turn it down #

387
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,754
# Lordy, Lordy, Lord-- #

388
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:17,424
# Lordy, Lordy, Lord,
play it all night-- #

389
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:33,524
Over here!
Over here, help me!

390
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:37,069
Over here!
Over here, somebody. Hello!

391
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:40,781
# Just move those thighs-- #

392
00:54:40,822 --> 00:54:42,407
Over here!

393
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:56,296
Hey hey!

394
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:58,674
Somebody!

395
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,510
Hey, over here!

396
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,148
I gotta get going.

397
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,025
I thought you had
an hour break.

398
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:19,528
No, gotta call the wife.

399
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,613
She's been acting
a little funny lately.

400
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:23,740
I'm starting to think
she's onto us.

401
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:27,077
On top of that--
Eddie knows.

402
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,705
Eddie?
How?

403
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:32,332
He's not stupid,
you know?

404
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:34,001
He just acts that way.

405
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:37,838
Well, hell with Eddie.
And your wife.

406
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,549
- I can't.
- How about after work?

407
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:42,843
- Here?
- No.

408
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:45,888
- I gotta take the kids to school.
- Oh hell, Alvin.

409
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:48,724
When are you going to stop
working this stupid night shift?

410
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:51,435
I don't know.
When I win the lottery.

411
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:57,232
Then why don't I meet you
back here again tomorrow night?

412
00:55:57,274 --> 00:56:00,736
Okay?
I gotta go.

413
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:02,946
Not without
a good-night kiss.

414
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,371
Wait wait.

415
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,540
- What?
- Did you hear that?

416
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,210
I thought
I heard something.

417
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:21,173
No!
God!

418
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:26,094
God!

419
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:31,099
- It sounded like a car honking.
- I don't hear anything.

420
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:33,727
# You know, you know #

421
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:36,355
# You know-- #

422
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:43,005
Shit!

423
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:46,133
Come on, get up.
Let's check your other pocket.

424
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:07,256
I think we're going to have
to do this the hard way. I'm sorry.

425
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:11,885
Work with me,
Orianna, okay?

426
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:27,192
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

427
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:37,554
Oh my God!

428
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:40,682
- What the hell happened?
- Wait wait wait! Please please!

429
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,685
I can't hear you.
Roll down the window.

430
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:48,774
Please please! He's out there somewhere.
You have to help me.

431
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,984
Who? Who's out here?

432
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:53,820
The hitchhiker.
He killed Orianna.

433
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:56,198
Please?

434
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,867
No no. There's nobody
out here but me.

435
01:00:58,909 --> 01:01:00,702
Please, just help me.

436
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,346
What the fuck?

437
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:27,354
I can't, okay?

438
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:30,190
- I can't get you out of here by myself.
- Please?

439
01:01:30,232 --> 01:01:33,277
No, look, the car-- it's wedged in here
tighter than a drum, okay?

440
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:36,029
And your front tire over there
is completely blown out.

441
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:38,365
Please!

442
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:40,325
All right, listen.

443
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,411
I'm just going to get
someone to help, okay?

444
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:44,413
No no no-- please please,
don't leave me.

445
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:46,540
Just don't leave me.
Get me out of here, please.

446
01:01:46,582 --> 01:01:49,293
Look, I'll be back
in a jiffy, okay? Just hold on.

447
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:50,919
No, he's going to kill me.

448
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:53,255
What? Who?

449
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:56,175
The hitchhiker.

450
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,556
I told you, okay?
There's nobody out here but us.

451
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:04,892
He's out there somewhere.

452
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:06,894
He's probably watching us.

453
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,688
I can't take it anymore.

454
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,773
I can't breathe.
I'm dying here. Please!

455
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:24,411
All right.
All right.

456
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:28,123
- Do you got gas?
- I got gas, I think so.

457
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:31,919
Okay okay. Look, you're going to have
to work with me here, all right?

458
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,962
- Can you do that?
- I think so.

459
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:36,507
All right. Okay.
Turn the car on.

460
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:41,970
Crap.

461
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:45,516
Look, it's all right.
Just try it again, okay?

462
01:02:50,812 --> 01:02:53,023
All right, all right,
all right.

463
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:55,984
Oh crap!

464
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:57,986
Crap! Okay, look,
we gotta do this fast.

465
01:02:57,986 --> 01:03:00,989
- Real fast, okay?
- Mister, I can't drive.

466
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:03,325
It's simple, okay?
It's simple.

467
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:04,952
Put your
foot on the brake,

468
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:07,329
and then just pull the gear
in reverse, okay?

469
01:03:07,371 --> 01:03:09,456
- Can you do that?
- I don't know.

470
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:12,000
Give it a try, okay?
Just pull it to "R."

471
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:18,507
Okay, when I say, you gotta step
on that accelerator like hell.

472
01:03:18,507 --> 01:03:20,717
- All right, you got it?
- I got it.

473
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:24,304
- Can we hurry because I can't breathe?
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

474
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:26,473
Hold this
for a minute, okay?

475
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:28,559
Okay, are you ready?

476
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,602
Okay, now!
Here we go!

477
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:44,032
Mister?

478
01:03:58,881 --> 01:04:00,966
Mister?

479
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,178
Mister?

480
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:09,433
Mister,
where are you?

481
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,074
Come on.

482
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,536
Come on!

483
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,957
Come on!

484
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:52,411
# We've gotta go #

485
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:55,372
# Get inside
my helicopter... #

486
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,416
Alvin!

487
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:01,044
Alvin, what's going on?

488
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:08,302
Is everything okay?

489
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:10,179
I have to go home.

490
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:17,060
I can't stay out here all night.

491
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:31,950
# Take your hand
and tell you it's all right #

492
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:36,246
# I wanna be the one
to hold you tight #

493
01:06:36,288 --> 01:06:39,791
# And whisper
words of love #

494
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:44,213
# And while I'm thinking
of you, I wanna be the one... #

495
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:46,798
Damn it, Alvin,
where the hell are you?

496
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,051
This ain't funny.

497
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:51,178
We've got work to do.

498
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:57,476
# How I wish
that you were mine... #

499
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:40,602
Penny?

500
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:07,796
- Mama?
- Everything is going to be okay.

501
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:10,549
Mama?

502
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,094
Am I dead?

503
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:16,597
Don't you worry, baby.

504
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:19,183
Mama's here now.

505
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:37,993
Orianna?

506
01:08:37,993 --> 01:08:41,371
Turn on the lights.
I can't see.

507
01:09:15,072 --> 01:09:18,033
No!

508
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:39,179
Fuckin' North Pole
out here.

509
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:47,187
You dumb shit, Alvin.

510
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:51,066
You and your fuckin' stupid
fuckin' girlfriends.

511
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:55,696
Shit!

512
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:03,912
Oh oh!

513
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:10,919
Oh my God!

514
01:10:10,919 --> 01:10:13,172
Dear God!

515
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:16,884
Oh my God!

516
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:22,264
No!

517
01:10:22,264 --> 01:10:25,142
Wow--
I--

518
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:28,145
no!

519
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:34,318
No no.
Oh, no.

520
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:37,487
No!

521
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:56,298
Ostrich.

522
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:03,472
Antelope.

523
01:11:03,514 --> 01:11:06,141
Rhinoceros.

524
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:12,022
Bullshit.

525
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:16,401
Bullshit.

526
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:18,654
Bullshit.

527
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:42,302
Don't die on me!

528
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:45,347
Don't!

529
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:25,220
Who's out there?

530
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,771
The only limitations
in this life

531
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:00,023
are the ones we put
on ourselves, Penny.

532
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,968
I won't die like this.

533
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:39,521
You hear me?
I said I won't die like this.

534
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:53,785
I can do this.
I gotta do this.

535
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:56,663
Get--

536
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:59,166
I can do this.

537
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:04,213
Come on!

538
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:10,385
Yes! Yes!

539
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:12,554
We did it!

540
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:20,896
I think we did it.

541
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:23,565
We did it.

542
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:16,618
Oh my God!
No!

543
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,996
Stop!

544
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:21,582
Oh, stop!

545
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,187
Oh God!

546
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:25,187
Penny.

547
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:28,690
This little piggy
went to market.

548
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:31,485
This little
piggy stayed home.

549
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:36,657
This little piggy
went, "Boo-hoo-hoo,

550
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:40,077
you cut me
to the bone."

551
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:01,765
Who are you?

552
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:04,226
Who are you?!

553
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:06,228
Who are you?!

554
01:19:12,085 --> 01:19:14,338
Let-- oh my God!

555
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:17,132
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

556
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:19,760
Oh my God!

557
01:19:31,563 --> 01:19:34,107
Show your face,
you coward!

558
01:19:53,418 --> 01:19:56,630
You have to own it,
right, Orianna?

559
01:19:56,672 --> 01:20:00,384
Face your fears.

560
01:20:00,425 --> 01:20:03,053
Full circle.

561
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:09,017
Some journey.

562
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:14,606
Bon voyage.

563
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:22,239
Jesus.

564
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,536
Why'd you have
to pick up the stranger?

565
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:40,716
The trunk's open.

566
01:21:16,668 --> 01:21:18,879
No!

567
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:46,907
I'm so sorry, Orianna.

568
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,830
If it wasn't for me
and my stupid fears,

569
01:21:53,872 --> 01:21:55,916
you'd still be alive.

570
01:21:58,335 --> 01:22:00,087
But I guess ultimately
there is only

571
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:02,422
one thing we're all afraid of.
Isn't that right?

572
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:09,388
You know what?

573
01:22:14,142 --> 01:22:17,271
All of a sudden
I'm not so afraid anymore.

574
01:23:09,531 --> 01:23:13,076
I'm sorry.

575
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:54,052
Penny?

576
01:24:57,639 --> 01:25:00,100
Hi!

577
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:23,457
Don't forget
your breathing exercises,

578
01:25:23,498 --> 01:25:25,542
Penny!

579
01:26:45,956 --> 01:26:48,250
Let me o-ooooout!

580
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:13,650
Police have identified
fingerprints at the diner

581
01:27:13,692 --> 01:27:16,236
belonging to an escaped
mental patient known only as--

582
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:19,823
# Too long, sugar, too long-- #

583
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:55,567
Oh my God!

584
01:28:08,163 --> 01:28:09,623
Damn!

585
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:13,836
Are you all right?

586
01:28:13,877 --> 01:28:16,380
Are you all right?

587
01:28:16,421 --> 01:28:19,466
Oh my God!

588
01:28:19,508 --> 01:28:21,677
Oh my God!

589
01:28:21,718 --> 01:28:24,304
Oh!

590
01:28:27,349 --> 01:28:29,393
Oh, Jesus!

591
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:35,607
Come with me.
Come on.

592
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:38,318
Come on, let's get you
out of the road. Jeez.

593
01:28:41,905 --> 01:28:43,365
Come on.

594
01:28:49,538 --> 01:28:51,832
There you go.

595
01:28:51,874 --> 01:28:53,834
Oh, Jesus.

596
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:56,128
What the hell are you doing
in the middle of the road?

597
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:25,592
# Who do you think
you're talking to? #

598
01:30:25,634 --> 01:30:27,886
# Were you alone and... #

599
01:30:27,928 --> 01:30:35,811
# Do your moves
line up on the pole? #

600
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:41,149
# You shut up and watch
what the fuck you say #

601
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:45,445
# Stay away,
'cause I don't mind losing #

602
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:49,950
# Shut up and watch
what the fuck you say #

603
01:30:49,992 --> 01:30:56,373
# Stay away or you just
might end up dead #

604
01:30:56,415 --> 01:31:00,794
# Is that the way
you choose? #

605
01:31:00,836 --> 01:31:05,299
# You should have
listened to your friends #

606
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:10,971
# They were trying
to protect you #

607
01:31:11,013 --> 01:31:16,435
# Shut up and watch
what the fuck you say #

608
01:31:16,476 --> 01:31:20,647
# Stay away,
'cause I don't mind losing #

609
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:25,194
# Shut up and watch
what the fuck you say #

610
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:32,284
# Stay away or you just
might end up dead... #

611
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:45,839
# You just might
end up dead... #

612
01:31:56,475 --> 01:32:00,812
# It doesn't matter
when you leave this place #

613
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:05,526
# I know exactly
when you sleep #

614
01:32:05,567 --> 01:32:09,780
# Will your friends
be there tonight? #

615
01:32:09,821 --> 01:32:13,867
# You never wait
to see me #

616
01:32:13,909 --> 01:32:17,371
# Shut up and watch
what the fuck you say. #
