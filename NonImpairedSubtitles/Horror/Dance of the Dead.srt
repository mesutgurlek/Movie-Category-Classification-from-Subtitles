1
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,494
Ma'am.

2
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,705
Stop.

3
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,831
All right, that's enough.

4
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,535
That's enough.

5
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,577
Next. Come on.

6
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,704
I said stop!

7
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,519
Yeah! Yeah!

8
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,749
Aloha, kids.

9
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,586
Don't forget
to buy your tickets

10
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,685
for the Hawaiian
Hula Prom tonight.

11
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,287
Tickets are on sale
outside the main office

12
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,764
or at the door. Aloha!

13
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,873
Get your prom tickets,
only 50 bucks.

14
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,417
- What a rip-off.
- It's gonna be a very special night...

15
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,748
That's okay.

16
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,485
Get your prom tickets.

17
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,024
Greetings
and welcome

18
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,497
to the 59th official
Sci-Fi Club meeting.

19
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,797
Hold on, isn't this supposed to be
the Amnesty International meeting?

20
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,131
They're here at 3:00.

21
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,967
Guys, guys, stay.

22
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,405
- We got food coming.
- Dork.

23
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,904
Scalpel cam.

24
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,572
Mm, oh, yeah.

25
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,172
Nasty.

26
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,619
Looks great
on the macro lens.

27
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,382
I'm just gonna have to
take your word for it.

28
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,016
I cannot wait to take you
to the prom tonight.

29
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,253
Okay, Jimmy, we gotta get to work.
Come on.

30
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,022
Don't tell me.
Tell the frog.

31
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,155
You can have all of me,
Lindsey, my love,

32
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,961
cut me open, take my heart.
It is yours.

33
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,968
I feel the same way, froggy.

34
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,197
And so do I, froggy.

35
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,934
Jimmy, quit acting like an idiot
and dissect your frog.

36
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,104
And you... how many times have I told you
shut that camera off before I break it.

37
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,910
You, cheerleader, take your scalpel
and cut open your frog.

38
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,679
I can't. I like frogs.

39
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,948
There's the stomach.

40
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,287
There's the liver.
There's the pancreas.

41
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,350
There's the brain.
Look at it.

42
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,055
What a dick.

43
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,155
What was that?

44
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,497
I was just saying what an inspiration
you are to all of us, sir.

45
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,968
I mean, it's teachers like you
that really make a difference.

46
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,266
Stand up.

47
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,445
Seeing as we're dissecting
animals today, class,

48
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,277
I'd like everyone
to take a look at this one...

49
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,510
James Dunn,

50
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:23,487
Jimmy Dunn Dunn
Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb.

51
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,490
Notice the brain

52
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,049
devoid of all
intelligent thought;

53
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,187
capable of only C-minus average,
barely passing high school;

54
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,495
the mouth, big and loud,

55
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,764
always running
with nothing to say.

56
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,202
Note the hands,

57
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,002
only worthy of working
at a drive-though;

58
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,636
a loser, a nothing,

59
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,907
a nobody.

60
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,107
You may be seated.

61
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,446
Um, Mr. Hammond,

62
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,454
you forgot one organ.

63
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,183
And I think you know
what you can do with that.

64
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,859
See you in detention.

65
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,626
Man, why did I get in trouble?

66
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,633
Guilty by association.

67
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,430
Sorry.

68
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,028
Man, fuck this school.

69
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,405
Kyle. Kyle.

70
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,536
Do not make me
call the police again.

71
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,874
Sit down.

72
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,881
Relax.

73
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,577
Shh.
Please.

74
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,750
Are you recording?

75
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,053
Hey, this is Kyle Grubbin.

76
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,651
This is a screen test.

77
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,625
Yeah!

78
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,602
- You faggots looking at something?
- No.

79
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,103
I wonder which one of his sisters
he's taking to the prom.

80
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,975
Dude, shut up.
I heard he carries a gun in his truck.

81
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,378
Dunn, you're up.

82
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,782
Just relax.
He can't even hear me.

83
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,247
Yo.

84
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,386
That was amazing.

85
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,290
Okay.

86
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,525
It looks really good
on camera.

87
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,361
So I heard your date
to the prom got sick.

88
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,400
Yeah.

89
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,662
Still going?

90
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,726
I wanted to talk to you about that.

91
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,999
Really? Wow.

92
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,236
You can do it, Steven!

93
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,709
Are those the...?

94
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,303
Yeah, the sci-fi guys.

95
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,473
Total geeks.

96
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,040
Do you know them?

97
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,710
No.

98
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,516
Come on, Steven,
ask her!

99
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,683
- Use the force, Steven the force!
- Come on!

100
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,352
Will you guys shut up?
I'm trying to talk to Gwen.

101
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,159
So should I ask him?

102
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,824
Him?

103
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,868
Him...

104
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,340
Nash Rambler.

105
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,274
Nash, the band guy?
He's, like, 30.

106
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,369
I mean, you're a guy, Steve.
What would you say?

107
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,079
Yeah, I'd say yes.

108
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,242
Really?

109
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,842
Okay.

110
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,081
I'm gonna go ask him.

111
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,180
- Oh, right now?
- Wish me luck, okay?

112
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,192
Yeah.

113
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,228
Good luck.

114
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,359
Hey, listen, listen.
Forget her.

115
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,228
We have got a serious
Sci-Fi Club meeting tonight.

116
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,494
Yes, we do, baby.

117
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,502
Bring your camera.
Bring your camera, all right?

118
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,061
Jules, I'm not going to another
robotics convention.

119
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,630
Ha ha, funny.
Child's play, my friend.

120
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,642
Listen, I want you to focus.

121
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,201
Great secrets will be revealed tonight,
my young Gandalf.

122
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,214
You got that?

123
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,445
Steven, I know it hurts, okay?

124
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,486
Let it out.

125
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,885
Let it out.

126
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,981
Steven, Steven,
your destiny awaits.

127
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,992
- Your destiny.
- Destiny, Steven, destiny.

128
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,994
Destiny.

129
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,996
My destiny was back there.

130
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,726
Come on, dude.

131
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,738
There are three As in "Hawaiian."

132
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,502
And we have 10 hours
until this dance starts.

133
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,737
Okay, so either you
work with me, people,

134
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,745
or you get the eff out of here.

135
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,338
Sorry. Sorry.

136
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,816
I'm just super stressed.

137
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,819
Hey hey hey,
don't worry about it.

138
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll take care of it.

139
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,322
Hey, can we get someone

140
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,450
to take that down, please?

141
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,290
Thanks.

142
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,920
So I heard

143
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,931
Jimmy got kicked out
of Hammond's class again.

144
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,058
Yeah.

145
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,364
Are you seriously
going to prom with him?

146
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,268
Mitch, we've talked
about this.

147
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,069
I am going to prom
with Jimmy.

148
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,837
In the pizza wagon?
Please.

149
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,651
You want to smell like pepperoni

150
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,983
or vanilla bean air freshener?

151
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,826
Do you smell that?

152
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,454
Something's in the air.

153
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,260
This town always
smells like ass, man.

154
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,860
No no, this is... this is bad.

155
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,962
Between global warming
and smog

156
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,303
and that freakin'
power plant down the block,

157
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,606
we're killing
ourselves, bro.

158
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,804
Am I interrupting?

159
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,971
No.

160
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,811
I'm Gwen from third hour.

161
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,612
You do good flips.

162
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,619
Thanks.

163
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,917
Um, I was wondering,

164
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,923
are you taking anyone
to the prom tonight?

165
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,754
I mean, I was gonna go,

166
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,657
but then my date
ate bad spinach.

167
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,992
So now I'm going solo.

168
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,532
Yep, solo.

169
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,534
Are you taking anyone?

170
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,196
I'd rather chew my tongue off
with a mouthful of gasoline

171
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,704
than go to that fucking dance.

172
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,968
May I ask why?

173
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,509
Because we refuse to listen

174
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,373
to the Piñata Heads play.
That's why.

175
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,404
If Quarter Punks don't play,
Quarter Punks don't go.

176
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,076
Tell you what... go ahead
and skip that prom,

177
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,484
come over
and watch us play,

178
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,818
and afterwards
you can give me head.

179
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,659
Shut up and stare, goofball.

180
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,095
- This is detention, not dreamland.
- Yes, sir.

181
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,368
I thought I told you
to say nothing.

182
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,599
So what do you say
when I say to say nothing?

183
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,606
Nothing.

184
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,904
You must think I'm a real idiot,
don't you?

185
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,336
Oh, so you do think
I'm an idiot then?

186
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,348
Answer me, boy!

187
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,714
Sir, you told me not to talk.

188
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,549
What the hell are you talking to me
right now then for, sissy boy?

189
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,112
It's 30 more minutes of watching
the Brick Channel for you...

190
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,921
all brick all the time.

191
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,962
You may not believe this, Dunn,
but I'm trying to help you.

192
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,897
You do want to do something
with your life, don't you?

193
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,900
Yes, you do.

194
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,095
You don't want
to wind up alone, Dunn,

195
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,104
credit card debt
up the wazoo,

196
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,106
nobody to talk to
but your dog,

197
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,642
ex-wife won't return
your phone calls

198
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,907
'cause she's a bitter, fat,
stinking piece of hog meat.

199
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,608
What are you looking at?
Drop and give me 50

200
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,810
and count them off!

201
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,649
Everyone thinks
prom is this big event

202
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,019
that they're gonna remember
for the rest of their life,

203
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,785
but really it's just
an excuse for kids

204
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,724
to get together and get freaky
on the dance floor.

205
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,728
You'll forget it in 10 years.

206
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,661
No, I won't.

207
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,323
Yeah, you will.

208
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,991
Will you forget us in 10 years?

209
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,662
Maybe, if I have Alzheimer's.

210
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,932
Oh, gee, how sweet.

211
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,806
Jimmy, did you even
get me a corsage?

212
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,469
No.

213
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,536
I got us a motel room, though.

214
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,344
You know, Jimmy,
it would be really nice

215
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,214
if you were romantic
for once, you know?

216
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,880
I'm romantic.
That thing this morning

217
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,923
with the frog...
that got a huge laugh.

218
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,618
Is everything a joke to you?

219
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,819
Yes, it is.

220
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,387
Well, I'm not a joke.
I'm a woman.

221
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,400
And I'd like a corsage
instead of a dead frog.

222
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,992
Wow, I'm sorry.

223
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,061
You called yourself a woman.

224
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,841
That's it.

225
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,278
That's it. I am not going
to prom with you.

226
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,941
What? Are you serious?

227
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,646
Yes, unlike you, I am serious.

228
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,779
I'm not going to prom with you.

229
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,255
You can't do that.

230
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,349
Yeah, I can. I just did.

231
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,121
Why?

232
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:53,097
Jimmy,

233
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,463
you spend more time
in detention

234
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,468
than you do in class.

235
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,197
And everything
is a joke to you.

236
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,865
It's just not funny anymore.

237
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,354
Prom.

238
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,973
I'll never ask for anything else again.
That's all I want.

239
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,811
I just want to be prom queen, please.
I'm gonna be prom queen.

240
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,190
This is gonna be awesome.

241
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,202
I'm so glad we're not
going to the prom.

242
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,635
Hey guys, you ready?

243
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,194
- Yeah.
- Let's lock and load.

244
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,833
Prom, baby, yeah!

245
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,612
Stupid spinach.

246
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,690
Smell that?
Vanilla bean, baby.

247
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,226
Have fun.

248
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,491
Don't hit your crust.

249
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,771
Dunn, I got a delivery for you.

250
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,775
No can do, boss.
I'm going to the prom.

251
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,606
It's my car you're
driving, shitball.

252
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,874
You do what I tell you.

253
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,348
Aye aye, Captain.

254
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,888
Freakin' boss.

255
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,164
I know it's kind of strange,

256
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,223
but it's the best view in town.

257
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,939
Mitch, I thought we were
going to the dance.

258
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,943
We are. I just thought,

259
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,945
since you've been
working so hard,

260
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,947
we just take a breather,

261
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,473
you know, loosen up a bit.

262
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,520
Oh.

263
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,658
Yeah, so I was thinking

264
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,790
about running for student council
again next year,

265
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,959
but I think I might
just take a year off...

266
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,469
you know, give other people
a chance to win.

267
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,131
But then I remembered
what my dad always said...

268
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,608
"Never never never

269
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,077
let other people win."

270
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,046
We went to the cemetery
last month, Jules.

271
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,742
Yes, well, we did,
but not with this.

272
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,910
I got it from my brother
who works at MIT.

273
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,351
As an accountant.

274
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,753
Whatever.
He snuck it out of R&D.

275
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,485
He said it was developed
as some sort of prototype

276
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,550
to handle
ultra-high-frequency levels

277
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,495
of extrasensory activity
within a 10' radius.

278
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,997
- Nice.
- Stop.

279
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,499
- What does it say?
- I don't know.

280
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,592
It didn't come with
an instruction manual.

281
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,830
Whoa!

282
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,532
Y'all boys
shouldn't be here.

283
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,440
Oh, we're doing
research

284
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,909
of a family tree.

285
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,538
My uncle's buried...
in the Civil War

286
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,775
he was shot.
And we're looking

287
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,181
for the, uh, grave.

288
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,380
- Right, guys? Yeah.
- Yeah.

289
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,788
Stick to the path right here.

290
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,419
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

291
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,019
What was that?

292
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,463
I don't know, man,
but I got the willies bad right now.

293
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,559
Yeah, in your pants.
Come on, let's go.

294
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,764
You're the vice president.
I'm the president.

295
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,832
He's... he's a joke.

296
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,175
I just mean
you deserve to be

297
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,738
with somebody
who respects you.

298
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,116
I really like you, Lindsey.

299
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,454
I just want you
to be happy, that's all.

300
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,234
Don't mess up my hair.

301
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,450
Hey, shut up.

302
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,453
There's people
making out in there.

303
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,489
Come on.

304
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,758
- George.
- Get off me.

305
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,691
- George, come on.
- Just leave me.

306
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,093
This is it.

307
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,098
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah.

308
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,157
This is definitely it.

309
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,499
Oh, this thing is going crazy.

310
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,471
- Come on.
- Jules, what are you doing?

311
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,735
Okay, we saw it, Jules.
It's very pretty. Let's go back.

312
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,674
Dude, it's open.
Come on.

313
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,473
Dude, we're not
going in there.

314
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,537
You came all this way
to turn around and go home?

315
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,549
Fine, go home, little girl,
go home.

316
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,879
I'm going in.

317
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,680
Come on.

318
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,053
Oh, guys,
you gotta see this.

319
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,127
- Steven.
- Shut up.

320
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,997
Holy crap.

321
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,660
Why is it on the floor?

322
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,068
Is that even sanitary?

323
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,266
Rod, open it.

324
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,571
I'm not even coming in there, man.
You open it.

325
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,010
- George.
- I'm not gonna touch that thing.

326
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,876
Damn it, guys,
somebody's gotta open it.

327
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,041
Since, Jules, you're the president
of the Sci-Fi Club

328
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,051
maybe you want
to be our leader

329
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,485
and jump in there
and try to...

330
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,817
All right, fine.

331
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,585
I'll do it.

332
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,684
Pussies.

333
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,289
Still rolling, Jules.

334
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,333
All right.

335
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,016
It's empty.

336
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,089
Christ.

337
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,632
You all right, Rod?

338
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,081
Come on.

339
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,185
There it is again.

340
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,187
It's just the seats.

341
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,189
No, it's moaning.

342
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,817
Sorry, my fault.

343
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,690
I can't move my legs that way.

344
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,730
Got it.

345
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,129
Mitch, I don't think you should...

346
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,832
It's okay.

347
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,808
No, Mitch, really.

348
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,503
It's okay.

349
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,011
No, Mitch, stop.

350
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,671
- Shut up.
- Stop it.

351
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,644
Mitch?

352
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,084
Mitch?

353
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,343
Aw, hell.

354
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,852
Come on, come on!

355
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,050
I said...

356
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,989
Stay on the path.

357
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,823
What, you knew about this?

358
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,362
Why didn't you tell us?

359
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,523
Hey, man, I'm just
trying to keep my job.

360
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,226
Hit 'em in the brain.
It's the only way to kill 'em.

361
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,553
Come on.

362
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,816
Come on, come on,
come on.

363
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,521
- Oh, God.
- Open the door! Open the door!

364
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,531
I just killed those people.

365
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,295
No, you didn't.
Open the door.

366
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,770
Get in.

367
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,257
Hey, no eating in store.

368
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,993
Pizza Wagon.

369
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,393
Yum-yum, come get some.

370
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,627
Come on, people.
I got a prom to go to

371
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,192
without my girlfriend.

372
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,241
Ma'am, I see you.

373
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,842
Whoa.

374
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,716
Are you okay?

375
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,119
Okay, all right.

376
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,986
I'm gonna call 911,

377
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,423
or not.

378
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,929
Uh, someone help, anyone.

379
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,896
Ma'am, ma'am, I'm not gonna
be able to help you

380
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,933
if you don't stop
biting at me like that.

381
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,968
Okay?

382
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,773
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

383
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,245
Here comes
the neighborhood.

384
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,928
Smoking out of
the devil bong, man.

385
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,930
Devil bong!

386
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,725
Close the door,
Jensen.

387
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,572
All right, that's what
I'm talking about!

388
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,880
Hey, you kids.

389
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,183
Principal Castlemoody.

390
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,086
- Is that beer?
- No.

391
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:09,149
Give me that.

392
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,822
Yeah, you too, smart guy.

393
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,831
You're lucky I don't
call your mamas.

394
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,833
Get back in there.

395
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,869
Get!

396
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,331
Punk-ass kids.

397
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,625
Oh, God.

398
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,355
Mr. Hammond, you scared
the crap out of me.

399
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,500
What happened
to your face, Frank?

400
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,442
Don't move
or I'll scorch you.

401
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,847
Kyle?

402
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,891
Yeah.

403
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,094
They gone?

404
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,598
I don't know,
but are you okay?

405
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,099
Get your hands off me.

406
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,295
You're lucky I'm not kicking
your ass right now.

407
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,032
Drop it, Kyle.
It's tired.

408
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,234
What?

409
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,937
Your friends are dead and those things
are coming back this way

410
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,945
and I'd rather not be
here when they do.

411
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,947
Man, piss off!

412
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,974
I ain't scared
of nothing... nothing.

413
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,180
Are you serious?
I just heard you crying over there

414
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,155
like a bitch
a second ago.

415
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,590
How do I know you are not
one of them, huh?

416
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,494
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
pop your head off right now.

417
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,394
Yo, man, they're jacking your car.

418
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,200
You assholes!
Wait up!

419
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,470
Damn it. My boss
is gonna kill me.

420
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,608
Whoa.

421
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,811
Do you have
a license for that?

422
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,685
No carnivorous cocksucker
is gonna mess with me.

423
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,318
Who are you calling?

424
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,621
Who do you think?
The cops.

425
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,958
No, no cops.
My daddy's a cop.

426
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,497
Great.

427
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,624
No, I hate my daddy.
No cops.

428
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,429
Don't be ridiculous.
We need them.

429
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,970
Who is the man
with the gun?

430
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,542
Kyle, I'm on your side.

431
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,479
Those are the guys
you want to shoot.

432
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,813
Waste 'em.

433
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,374
What is taking you
so long?

434
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,977
I have got to load it.

435
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,649
All right?

436
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:27,816
Come on, come on.

437
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,230
Wow.

438
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,736
That was disturbing.

439
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,734
- Hey, watch this.
- No!

440
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,571
Sorry, Gwen,
it was a mistake.

441
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,237
Jimmy, are you crazy?

442
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,178
Jimmy!

443
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,277
I gotta
get out of here.

444
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,125
Come on, man, wait up.

445
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:17,368
- Just go, just drive!
- I'm driving.

446
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,336
- Just go, just drive!
- I'm driving.

447
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,429
- Stop arguing, just drive.
- I'm not arguing.

448
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,269
We're all gonna die
because of you.

449
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,332
- Jules, shut up.
- Listen, don't tell me to shut up.

450
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,970
I brought the shotgun.
I got the second-most power in this car.

451
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,809
I keep dialing 911,
but the number's busy.

452
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,314
- How can it be busy?
- I don't know.

453
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,247
- Just keep dialing then.
- I have been.

454
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:37,118
Just dial the number.
Now, it's 911. 411's information.

455
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,621
Thanks, Jules, thanks,

456
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,624
Aren't you Jimmy Dunn's
girlfriend?

457
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,954
Uh-huh.

458
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,517
Then whose car is this?

459
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,531
Go go go go.
What are you...?

460
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,794
- Don't stop the car.
- Why are you stopping?

461
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,235
I didn't do anything.
It just stopped.

462
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,041
- They ripped through the engine?
- Apparently so.

463
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,043
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do, guys?

464
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,409
Does anyone have
a plan or something?

465
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,880
Why don't you shut up and try thinking
of one yourself, princess, okay?

466
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,678
Hey, easy.

467
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,685
Let's not bite
each other's heads off.

468
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,017
That's kind of funny.

469
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,081
It is kind of funny.
I didn't think of it like that.

470
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,490
It works kind of both ways.
It's funny but it's not.

471
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,995
Guys, if you don't
straighten up

472
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,725
you're gonna end up
like Rod.

473
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,767
That's not cool, man.

474
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,359
What is she doing?

475
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,097
Lindsey, let's go.
Come on.

476
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,639
It's chicks like that

477
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,641
that make me glad
I don't have a girlfriend.

478
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,007
- Right.
- What's that supposed to mean?

479
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,911
Pick up, Jimmy.
Please pick up.

480
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,582
Jimmy?

481
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,951
It's Jimmy.
Hey, guys, it's Jimmy.

482
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,015
Jimmy! Jimmy!

483
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,457
Thank God he's alive.

484
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,801
Jimmy?

485
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,135
It's not Jimmy.
Run!

486
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,307
My dress.

487
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,580
You made me
rip my dress.

488
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,524
- Guys, it's locked.
- Open it.

489
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,421
Shut the door.
Shut the door.

490
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,362
Don't. Shut up, Jules.
She's coming.

491
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,162
She's not gonna make it.
Shut the door.

492
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,566
- Lindsey, come on.
- Let's go, hurry up.

493
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,934
He's right
behind you.

494
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,073
- There's more coming.
- Guys, we need to board up this door.

495
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,203
Find whatever you can
and use it.

496
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,044
We need to board up these windows
and that door too. Let's go.

497
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,016
Whoa whoa whoa,
who put you in charge?

498
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,918
I am vice president
of the student council.

499
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,217
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm the president
of the Sci-Fi Club.

500
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,815
And you're the genius who brought us
here tonight. I'm with her.

501
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,985
Okay, come on. Let's get this couch,
move it in front of the door.

502
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,120
Here, George over here.
Steven, right there.

503
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,631
Go, come on, faster.
You hold this.

504
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,135
Wait a second.
No no no, we're not staying.

505
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,502
Jules, either help out or get
the eff out of the way, okay?

506
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,246
Why is this happening?

507
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,583
End of the world.

508
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,215
God's flushing the toilet.

509
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,486
It's his way of saying,
"Y'all couldn't work it out,

510
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,221
so adios."

511
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,888
I didn't take you
for a religious man, Kyle.

512
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:40,529
I just tell it
like the Bible does.

513
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,937
I'm gonna need
years of therapy after this.

514
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,272
Gwen, it's gonna be okay.

515
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,278
Liar.

516
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:51,474
Shut up, Kyle.

517
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,483
Dude, watch the window.

518
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,848
Oh, thank God it's Jimmy.

519
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,114
Hey, Lindsey,
are you all right?

520
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,746
Tell her I say hi.

521
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,085
Where are you?

522
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,092
Where are we?
Guys, where are we?

523
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,321
- I don't know.
- I think we're at a corner of Oak,

524
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,953
in the house
near Millpond.

525
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,964
Oak and Millpond?

526
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,500
Yeah, Oak and Millpond.
We can get there from here.

527
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,763
Just stay right where you are.
I'll come and get you.

528
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,861
Really?

529
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,202
Of course.

530
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,901
I'll be there.

531
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,068
Okay.

532
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,580
Whoa whoa whoa, hey,

533
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,014
who said you get to go
get your girl?

534
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,813
She's with other people, Kyle.
It's better protection.

535
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,688
She'd better be worth it.

536
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,749
She is.

537
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,199
We can crawl
across town down here

538
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,738
without them
ever seeing us.

539
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,740
I used to play down here
when I was a little kid.

540
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,969
You was one messed up
little kid, huh?

541
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,773
- Yeah.
- Me too.

542
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,779
Hurry.

543
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,145
Go on.
Go on, girl.

544
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,550
Come on, this way.

545
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,296
Oh my God.
It stinks.

546
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,800
Whoa.

547
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,426
What is that?

548
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,437
Is that poop?

549
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,838
That shit ain't shit.

550
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,072
Something's wrong
with that shit.

551
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,477
Must you curse so much?

552
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,641
Looks like the power plant's
been dumping

553
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,548
something fierce
down here.

554
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,678
This town's, like,
marinating in it.

555
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,279
It must have finally reached
its boiling point.

556
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,825
Ugh, I shouldn't
be here right now.

557
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,723
I should be at prom
in a beautiful dress,

558
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,888
slow-dancing
with Nash or somebody.

559
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,764
Hey, I'm somebody.

560
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,634
So what we got is,

561
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,299
"I slept with my
third-grade teacher."

562
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,309
Teacher... what rhymes
with "teacher"?

563
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,743
- She was a sexual creature.
- Preacher. Preacher.

564
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,973
- Sexual creature.
- "Creature" is the way to go.

565
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,982
"She was
a sexual creature.

566
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,348
She always made me
feel all right."

567
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,683
- She kept me up at night.
- She flew my kite.

568
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,985
Dude, chill out, man.
Seriously, stay in the circle.

569
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,116
Okay, like it.
I like it.

570
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,285
"She made me feel all right.

571
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,261
- She kept me up all night."
- Kept me up all night.

572
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,458
"She taught me the ways
of multiplication."

573
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,626
Multiplication...
that's what she taught.

574
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,863
And led to my first
masturbation.

575
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,667
God damn, no,
Jensen, man.

576
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,332
You've hotboxed
the entire garage.

577
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,673
I swear, you've smoked
us all stupid.

578
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,338
- Go open the door.
- Open the door, go.

579
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,541
- "Masturbation."
- I can't even hear myself think.

580
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,744
How do you expect me to get
to the next level with this song?

581
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,317
One of you jokers laced my joint
with formaldehyde again?

582
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,725
Whoa.

583
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,003
Want to touch
my Mohawk?

584
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,471
- Kyle, would you stop?
- You smell good.

585
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,531
I think this is it.

586
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,872
I am not going in there.

587
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,677
Okay, go go go.

588
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,657
It's dark.
Come on.

589
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,920
Come on,
let's go.

590
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,722
Hello?

591
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,734
Lindsey?

592
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:09,296
- Creepy.
- There's a light.

593
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,341
A door.
Come on.

594
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,479
Yeah yeah,
this is it.

595
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:21,073
Jimmy!
You've found us.

596
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,848
I'm so glad
you're okay.

597
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,721
Steven, I'm okay.

598
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,317
You've got your tux.

599
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,328
You look nice.

600
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,557
You look wonderful,
baby.

601
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,465
You can let go now.

602
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,799
Sorry. Yeah.

603
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,339
Awkward, dude.

604
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:48,903
Oh, shit. Hey, Kyle Grubbin,
what are you doing here?

605
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:52,380
Bashing heads, turning shit up...
you know, the usual.

606
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,475
Kyle couldn't get
a date to the prom.

607
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,144
All the farm animals
were busy.

608
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,620
Man, I screw college girls.

609
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,592
So how did you end up
with these guys?

610
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,191
We were at the cemetery
and these things... they just came out

611
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,202
and they pulled Mitch
and they took...

612
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,000
Wait, Mitch? What were you doing
at the cemetery with Mitch?

613
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,940
We were just parked,
you know, by the bluff.

614
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,603
Mitch Cutter?
You were with him?

615
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,705
Yeah, but nothing happened.

616
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,148
Mitch Cutter.

617
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,743
At least have the decency to dump me
for someone cool.

618
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,754
The guy's a tool,

619
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,222
and you're a tool
by association.

620
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,953
Why him?

621
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,791
Because he took
life seriously

622
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:44,460
and I thought he liked me.

623
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,503
He liked you on the back seat
of his car.

624
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,341
Wonderful.

625
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,809
Move that chair.
No, give it to me.

626
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,813
Give it to Kyle.

627
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,509
Looks good, Kyle.

628
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,379
That should do it, yeah.

629
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,388
You chew?

630
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,720
Yeah, I'm Jewish.

631
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,259
Why?

632
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,194
I'll try some of that.

633
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,097
Mm, that's good.

634
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,396
You don't know
how weird this is, man.

635
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,767
Remember last year we were in gym
and you tripped over me

636
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,635
and started to hit me
in the face for no reason,

637
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,799
I started bleeding and everybody
started laughing

638
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,672
and I started to cry?

639
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,338
Remember that?

640
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,347
Nuh-uh.

641
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,349
Hey, you remember
junior year when you...

642
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,351
oh, okay.
You remember

643
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,649
junior year when
you broke my arm

644
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,655
'cause you said
I looked at you funny?

645
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,657
Remember that?

646
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,454
Man, that was you?

647
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:44,960
Yeah.

648
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,929
Man.

649
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,761
Good times.
Yeah.

650
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,165
How's your arm?

651
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,170
Not good, actually.

652
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,766
Um, but Kyle,
I hate to admit it,

653
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,208
but I'm actually glad
you're here.

654
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,576
You're the biggest
badass I know.

655
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,581
Hoorah!

656
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,622
Too bad we didn't
go to prom together.

657
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,923
Then we wouldn't be
in this mess.

658
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,054
We were supposed to go
to the prom together?

659
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,655
That was kind of my plan.

660
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,567
But you never asked me.

661
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,003
Eh, you would have
said no.

662
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,735
Steven, if I had a choice
between this place

663
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,743
and going to prom
with you,

664
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,109
I would have
chosen you.

665
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,955
You guys...

666
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,632
we're in a funeral home.

667
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,342
Yo, who farted?

668
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,467
Go!

669
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,678
- Is she dead?
- I don't know, George.

670
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,805
- Why don't you check her pulse?
- Is everybody okay?

671
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,679
There's got to be
a light somewhere.

672
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,445
Someone find the light switch.
Come on.

673
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,248
I can't see anything.

674
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,220
Feel along the walls.

675
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:55,554
Jules, is that you?

676
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,259
Steven, get off me.

677
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,627
Sorry, Gwen.

678
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,564
I think I got it.

679
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,560
Ugh.

680
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,266
Crazy old bitch.

681
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,214
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

682
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,053
Where did he go?

683
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,526
Make yourself useful.
Load it.

684
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,310
Now!

685
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,326
- George, get out of the way.
- Hey!

686
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,984
It hurts.

687
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,628
Am I dying?

688
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:47,898
No, man, you're fine.

689
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,670
Liar.

690
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,176
Jim, I'm sorry I whacked you
at school today.

691
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,376
Shh, don't talk.

692
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,055
I'm sorry I was a dick.

693
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,961
It's okay.
I deserved it.

694
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:18,827
Jim, do me a favor.

695
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:21,427
Anything.

696
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,239
Kill 'em all.

697
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,420
Kyle.

698
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,086
Kyle.

699
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,394
What are we gonna do?

700
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,045
Um, Jimmy,

701
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,706
he just got bit.

702
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,410
So shouldn't we, like, leave?

703
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,494
Hey.

704
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,086
Are you okay?

705
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,335
This is
such a tragedy.

706
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:03,863
I really really just wanted everything
to be perfect.

707
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,703
Oh, gosh, the prom.

708
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,481
Every teenager in town
is at that prom.

709
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,450
Oh, man.

710
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,352
Guys, all that noise,
all the fresh meat...

711
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,014
every zombie in town
will be there.

712
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,751
It will be
a feeding frenzy.

713
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,759
Our entire high school
class will be gone.

714
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,886
- History.
- All of 'em.

715
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,521
No one's picking up.

716
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,260
We have to warn
everyone.

717
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,962
What, you're going
to the prom?

718
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,062
Are you crazy?
It's, like, 1000 to six.

719
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,937
We just got to stay here. I'm sure
the government knows about this.

720
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,000
They have to. They should be
sending somebody.

721
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,104
Look...

722
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,115
if we die two weeks from now

723
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,117
or two hours,

724
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,915
I'd like to go out fighting.

725
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,286
If we don't stop those things
from getting to the prom,

726
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,552
then our world is over.

727
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,658
I'm tired of being a lower.

728
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,700
Okay.
So how do we get there?

729
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,703
We fight our way.

730
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,204
With what?

731
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,672
- With this.
- And with this.

732
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,506
- Don't be stupid. The gun's empty.
- No, it's not.

733
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,048
Now it is.

734
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,749
Guys, there's a hearse
out front...

735
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,654
a hearse big enough for six.

736
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,556
So who's the fastest runner?

737
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,254
I don't have
my sneakers on today.

738
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,160
And I don't have any shoes.

739
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,391
I have asthma.

740
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,057
And I have a wooden leg.

741
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,034
Come on, guys,
if you can run fast, you say so.

742
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,730
Um...

743
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,329
I can move pretty fast.

744
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,602
Yeah, send the cheerleader.
That's a great idea.

745
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,872
Guys, I can see the hearse.
It's by the curb.

746
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:52,608
You don't have
to do this, Gwen.

747
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:55,651
You're right.
You do it.

748
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,780
Me? I'm not really athletic.

749
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,154
See what I mean?

750
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,250
All right,
is everybody ready?

751
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,626
Jules, on three.

752
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:13,932
One...

753
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,232
- two...
- Dear God, be with Gwen.

754
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,867
She runs for her life
into hell.

755
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,572
I don't like it.
I don't want to go.

756
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,217
Three!

757
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:31,345
Come on.
Go!

758
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,958
All clear.

759
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,632
Run, Gwen.
Go go go go!

760
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,311
God, I love that girl.

761
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,548
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

762
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,711
Guys, come on,
get in the car!

763
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,018
Come on,
Steven, quick!

764
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,064
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

765
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,661
I'm going as fast as I can!
This is a hearse!

766
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:21,931
- Is everybody okay?
- Yes.

767
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,438
I'm good.
We're good.

768
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,805
- George, did you find a map?
- Yeah, I got one in my pants.

769
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,538
It's a big map.
Where am I gonna get a map from?

770
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,603
Guys, what the hell was that?

771
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,307
That was a tire.
It blew out.

772
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,940
Someone shot it.
I think someone shot at us.

773
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,042
Who would be shooting at us?

774
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,552
I'll take you first, monsters!

775
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:38,815
Don't shoot, Coach!

776
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,379
- Who's that?
- Coach Keel, don't shoot.

777
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,119
Jimmy Dunn, fourth period.
You had me in detention today.

778
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,492
Dunn?

779
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,326
Them sons of bitches
ate my dog.

780
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,423
They ate my dog,

781
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,867
my German shepherd,
the best bitch I've ever had.

782
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:56,735
I was able to keep them green boys
away from the neighbors for a bit,

783
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,570
but they got to one,
then they got to another and another,

784
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,372
so I had to kill
the whole block.

785
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:05,437
Yeah, it's been a rough one
for all of us.

786
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,910
- Hey.
- Hey.

787
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,647
Ooh, boy,

788
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,749
looks like you got
yourself a platoon.

789
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,350
Where are y'all going?

790
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,396
To the prom,
to kick some zombie ass.

791
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,296
The prom...

792
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,096
it'll be a regular Thanksgiving-day
supper for them green boys.

793
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,399
All right, we'd better
get suited up then.

794
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:29,836
Suited up?

795
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,135
You don't win wars with toothpicks
and cheddar cheese, missy.

796
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,237
You gotta be prepared.
Ain't that right, Dunn?

797
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,748
Yes, sir.

798
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,613
All right, let's get in gear.

799
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,312
We got us a war to win.

800
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,839
I wish it was a corsage.

801
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,443
Little lady,
you'll get the machete.

802
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,105
But I don't know
how to shoot a machete.

803
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,820
What the hell is wrong
with you, son?

804
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,954
Whoa, is this what
I think it is, Coach?

805
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,862
Don't move, kid!
Don't move!

806
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,798
Don't move.
Don't you move.

807
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,063
You can take out
the whole city block with this.

808
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,503
Whoosh!
No eyebrows, man,

809
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,507
a mushroom cloud,
the whole deal.

810
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:42,067
I got this off craigslist
for emergencies only.

811
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,114
Everyone gets a walkie.
Tune to channel 22.

812
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,308
Let's sync
those watches, people.

813
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,352
Come on,
move move move!

814
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:55,083
Do we have any more
helmets, Jules?

815
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,352
No, man.

816
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:57,916
Well, can I have
that one, please?

817
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,928
Sorry, it's the last one.
Stop.

818
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,588
Dude, come on, you're taller
than me, Jules.

819
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:02,791
- Please?
- No.

820
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:05,027
This is so cool.

821
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,035
No guns for you kids.

822
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,367
Guns are mine, all mine.

823
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,605
I don't want to repeat
history, man,

824
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,112
like Rod did.
Please?

825
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,681
Please?

826
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,239
Rod?

827
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,115
Jules...

828
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,952
Thanks.

829
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,453
Um, can we say a prayer?

830
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:35,396
I know it sounds super dorky,
but we really need it.

831
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,228
Are you serious?

832
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,892
Yeah.

833
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:40,902
Make it quick, okay?

834
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,029
Okay, everyone hold hands.

835
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,199
Gay.

836
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,573
Shut up, Jules.

837
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,446
Continue, Lindsey.

838
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,744
Okay, um,
dear God,

839
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,285
we don't know why you've brought
the dead back to life,

840
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,287
but you have.

841
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,482
So we pray that you help us
through tonight...

842
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,888
Mm-hmm.

843
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:04,256
...help us to help others
through tonight.

844
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,795
Lord, we know this is
not a perfect world

845
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,797
and we are
far from perfect,

846
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,993
but could you please
lend us a hand here?

847
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:14,935
Protect us.

848
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,198
In Jesus's name...

849
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,832
For the love of Buddha,
are we done?

850
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,876
...amen.

851
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,977
Let's rock.

852
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,189
Bitchin' ride, Coach.

853
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,191
It took me three years
to save up for her,

854
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,318
but she's worth it.

855
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,682
Why aren't they attacking?

856
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,687
Who cares?
They're sitting ducks.

857
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:09,191
Wait a second...

858
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,556
Oh!

859
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,291
Ew, is he done yet?

860
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,996
Not yet.

861
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,038
Okay, I think he's done.

862
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:27,304
Oh, not yet.
Yes. No.

863
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,639
Oh, that did it.

864
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,077
Yeah, he's done.

865
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,809
Now do you jerkoffs believe me
about the power plant?

866
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,511
- Nash!
- Spinach!

867
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,384
Oh, great, it's Nash.

868
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,084
What's up, guys?

869
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,791
Why weren't they attacking you?

870
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,624
They dig our sound, man.

871
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:47,890
What?

872
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,228
We were just in the garage,
jamming out.

873
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,699
And then all of a sudden
they came after us.

874
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,168
And at first we were freaked,
but then we realized

875
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:57,297
they were listening
to our music.

876
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:00,740
The more I watched them,
the more I realized

877
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,337
they're communicating
with each other like bugs, like...

878
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,245
- Bees, dude. They're like bees.
- Yes.

879
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,613
And we're like the queen bee.

880
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,515
And then they hear us
and they tune in

881
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,350
and then they check out.

882
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,549
The more we started playing,
the more they started coming.

883
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:16,819
That was, like,
five hours ago.

884
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,987
You guys have been playing
for five hours straight?

885
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,122
Hey, we needed
the practice.

886
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:24,132
That's amazing.

887
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,827
It's okay.

888
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,802
Oh, no, thanks.

889
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,236
I'm high on life.

890
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,245
Hoorah!

891
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:39,543
Queers, make a hole.

892
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:42,084
- Whew.
- Good job, Coach.

893
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,085
Dude.

894
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,621
- That was amazing.
- 10 years of training.

895
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,850
- God bless America.
- Amen.

896
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:50,859
We gotta shut that
power plant down.

897
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,327
It's too late.
What's done is done.

898
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,523
The only thing we can do now is
kill what it created.

899
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,657
Yeah, so take these
and follow us.

900
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,668
Thanks, babe,

901
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,762
but we got our weapons.

902
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,787
Apocalypse.

903
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,990
Where did they all go?

904
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,324
Where do you think?

905
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,625
Jimmy, look,
it's the sign-in book.

906
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,636
Oh.

907
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,832
Dude, that's Miss Raines,
my English teacher.

908
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,875
Aw, I liked her.

909
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,270
We're too late.

910
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,465
Every zombie in town
is here.

911
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,872
That's the guy from
the comic book store.

912
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:52,642
That's my mailman.

913
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,582
You give me two minutes,
I'll have this school wired

914
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,280
like a crackhead
drinking a Red Bull.

915
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:01,482
Listen up. Here's what
we're gonna do.

916
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,390
All right,

917
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,485
here's the entrance.

918
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,154
Here's the gymnasium.

919
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:09,698
I'm gonna drop
some firecrackers

920
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,700
right here, here and here.

921
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:14,168
Now you kids, you're gonna have to
board up the entrances

922
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,296
right here, here and here.

923
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,772
We got one shot at this.

924
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,309
So let's do it right.
You got it?

925
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:22,844
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

926
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:29,947
Adios, amigos.
We'll see you on the other side.

927
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,976
That should hold it.

928
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,841
Okay, good.

929
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,445
Did you guys
hear that?

930
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,145
Stop pushing me.

931
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,162
Please, don't hit us.
We're not one of them.

932
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:21,633
It's okay. I'm Jules Ryder.
I'm here to rescue you.

933
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,972
They ate the prom king.

934
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:30,137
It's okay.
I'm here to help.

935
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,181
Thank you.

936
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:38,318
It's okay.
You'll be all right.

937
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,356
All right, everybody,
we're gonna get you out of here.

938
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,358
I need you to stay together.
You got me?

939
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,018
Stay together
if you want to live.

940
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,936
All right, Dunn,

941
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:02,341
I just gotta set
the roof explosives.

942
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,948
Of course this shit
was a lot easier

943
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,450
when I was
20 lbs lighter.

944
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:13,922
All right, Jimmy,
it's Hiroshima time.

945
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,582
I just gotta
shimmy to safety

946
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,592
and we'll turn this bitch
into Baghdad.

947
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:18,752
Oh, no!

948
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:21,160
Shit!

949
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,333
Dunn, are you there?
Over.

950
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,663
Go for Jimmy.

951
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,169
I dropped the damn remote.

952
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,000
The remote?

953
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,767
The remote to set off
the explosives.

954
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,934
It landed right in the damn plate
of potato chips.

955
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,945
Son of a bitch.

956
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,605
Dunn, you listen to me.

957
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,512
You've got to get that remote.

958
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,279
I'd go myself, but I got
one other charge I got to set

959
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:45,877
and we got no time.
It's a one-way ticket, son,

960
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,253
but you gotta buy it.
Over.

961
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,559
I'm going in the gym.

962
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,394
Are you nuts?

963
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,526
Somebody's got to get
that remote.

964
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,299
They're not gonna see me
if I stick to the shadows and move fast.

965
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,203
Jules, get everybody
out of here

966
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,208
and as far away from the school
as possible.

967
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,267
- You got it.
- Jimmy, no.

968
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,871
I'll be right back.

969
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,713
Jimmy, please.

970
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,179
All right, come on, let's go.
Move it, move it.

971
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,681
This place is gonna blow.
Come on, let's go.

972
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,046
Let's go, come on.

973
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,788
Gwen!

974
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,025
Gwen, are you okay?

975
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,031
I'm fine.

976
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,176
My helmet, Jules.
My helmet. I love you.

977
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,041
I love you too, man,
but we gotta go.

978
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,580
We gotta go.
Come on.

979
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,275
It's all clear.
Let's go.

980
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,906
- Hey.
- Lindsey, no.

981
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,239
What are you doing?

982
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:52,748
Jimmy, I'm not
leaving you again.

983
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,749
Besides, I planned this prom.

984
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,808
I'm not gonna miss it.

985
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,783
You did a real good job
with this stuff, babe.

986
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,385
Really?
Thanks.

987
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,626
There it is.

988
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,158
Hold on.

989
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:15,726
Let's go.

990
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,854
- Jimmy.
- I'm here.

991
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:12,050
Very slowly follow my lead.

992
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,419
We have to find that remote.

993
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:25,098
Not bad for a couple of queers.

994
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:37,940
Do you see it?

995
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,503
No. Do you?

996
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,678
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

997
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:19,414
You don't ever have to
tell me you're sorry.

998
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:30,323
Let's go, come on.

999
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,594
Steven, I need to talk to you.

1000
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,159
Gwen, the school
is about to explode.

1001
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,728
Steven, I need you.

1002
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:38,932
Please.

1003
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,715
Oh, Jeez.

1004
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,258
Steven, please don't tell them.
They'll kill me.

1005
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,294
Gwen...

1006
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,295
Please, Steven.

1007
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,297
I'm just so cold.

1008
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,299
- Gwen.
- Just hold me, okay?

1009
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,358
Just hold me.

1010
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,800
It's okay.

1011
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,243
I'm not gonna
let them kill you.

1012
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,838
I won't let you die.

1013
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,314
I promise.

1014
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:30,181
You're the best.

1015
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,720
Please, Steven.

1016
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:09,862
There it is.

1017
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:18,799
Jensen, Jensen, plug it in.

1018
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:20,842
Plug it in, man, plug it in!

1019
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,290
Mitch?

1020
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,919
Here we go again.

1021
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,659
No no, Jimmy, Jimmy,
Mitch, Mitch!

1022
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,696
Whoa whoa.

1023
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,705
Jimmy!

1024
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:12,890
Come on, come on, come on.

1025
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,991
Take this.

1026
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,071
Shit, it's the band.

1027
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,482
We got the detonator.
Let's go.

1028
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,041
No way, man.
This is the best set of our lives.

1029
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,644
If you don't hurry up this is gonna be
the last set of your life.

1030
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,621
Now come on.

1031
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,825
Thank you, Cosa High School.
Good night.

1032
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:31,365
Come on, come on,
come on.

1033
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:36,401
Go go go!

1034
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,599
Coach, is everybody out?

1035
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:40,266
Everybody but me.
Count to 10.

1036
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:42,310
Let's drop
those nukes.

1037
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:46,346
- We locked those doors.
- That shit's not cool.

1038
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,178
We're not gonna make it.

1039
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,547
Get out of the way.

1040
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,677
Safety glass.

1041
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,586
- Jensen, come on, come on.
- Jimmy.

1042
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:00,654
Jensen!

1043
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:09,070
Oh!

1044
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,474
- Go! Go!
- Go go go.

1045
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:22,345
Push!

1046
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,510
I'm slipping.

1047
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:29,383
Hammond.

1048
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,164
Jimmy.

1049
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,903
Jimmy!

1050
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:12,829
Come on.

1051
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,267
- Come on.
- Everybody down!

1052
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,441
Lindsey.

1053
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,638
I love you.

1054
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:32,582
Yes!

1055
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,760
Hot damn, Dunn.
I was wrong about you.

1056
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,263
You are a good soldier.

1057
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,300
- Kick ass!
- Yeah!

1058
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,929
Bring any marshmallows?

1059
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,097
No, sir.

1060
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,368
Steven.

1061
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:02,141
Hey, congratulations
on winning prom queen.

1062
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:04,617
Yeah.

1063
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:08,252
Like it matters.

1064
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:10,484
Tell me about it.

1065
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,756
Who are you guys?

1066
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,295
We're the Sci-Fi Club.

1067
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,472
Really?

1068
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,030
Do you believe in UFOs?

1069
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,201
Yeah.

1070
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:30,005
I saw one once.

1071
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:31,841
Me too.

1072
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:34,609
Wow, this is, you know...

1073
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:35,843
Wow.

1074
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,851
George...

1075
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,114
no.

1076
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:43,651
How are you?

1077
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:45,659
I want to give you this.

1078
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,661
It will protect you, just in case.

1079
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:50,220
Okay.

1080
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:52,766
You know what?
Actually, no.

1081
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:04,278
We've got to shut down that power plant
before it spreads.

1082
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,541
It's the way Jensen
would have wanted it.

1083
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:08,606
Rock 'n' roll, brother.

1084
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,948
Sounds like a plan,
pretty boy.

1085
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,146
You in, ace?

1086
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:15,018
Yes, sir.

1087
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:18,389
Lindsey?

1088
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:21,588
You go, I go.

1089
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:24,223
All right, first things first...

1090
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,631
the coach wants to go
to the pancake house.

1091
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:30,035
There we'll all have
breakfast and juice on the coach.

1092
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:33,233
Then we'll discuss
stage two of this op.

1093
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:34,969
Sound good?

1094
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:37,007
Pancakes
are cool.

1095
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,440
Roger that.

1096
01:23:39,441 --> 01:23:40,441
