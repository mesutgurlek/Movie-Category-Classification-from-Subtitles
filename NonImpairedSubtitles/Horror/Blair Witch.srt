"Blair Witch (2016)" ^ (Run time 01:22:14)

2
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:07,961
Do you see her?

3
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,370
What do you mean?

4
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:12,212
I missed it the first time too.
Hang on.

5
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,461
Okay.
What is that?

6
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,636
Lisa, I think that
might be my sister.

7
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:30,739
Wait, wait
Okay uh...

8
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,340
How did you even find this?
Did you have like a search alert set up?

9
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:36,453
Yeah, yeah exactly.
And usually it's nothing,

10
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,305
but the guy who uploaded
this video said it was

11
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,966
from a tape he found in
the Black Hills woods.

12
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:44,010
But those woods have been searched, right?
They never found the house.

13
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:46,019
Yeah, but the
Black Hills forest is huge,

14
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:48,434
so maybe they weren't looking
in the right place, you know.

15
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,789
That's why I want us to start
where the tape was found

16
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:51,894
and camp the night...

17
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,736
- Lisa.
- Hi.
- Hey.

18
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:55,074
What are you guys doing?

19
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:57,940
We're doing Lisa's documentary
class project, starring me.

20
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:00,001
Boring.

21
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:11,232
Okay.
So try on the earpiece camera.

22
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:14,248
- Uh, which is... Is it this one?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:16,287
And then, press the button
at the side.

24
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:19,479
- Okay.
- And then it should be recording.

25
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,744
The cool thing about these
is they've got built-in GPS.

26
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,390
How's that?

27
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:32,199
You're getting one of these
for Peter and Ashley, right?

28
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:33,931
Yeah.
We just have to make sure you remember

29
00:02:33,956 --> 00:02:36,219
- ... to switch out the cards.
- Okay.

30
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,608
Iteration, take 1...
take 2... 3...

31
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:49,496
When James was 4 years old,

32
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:51,920
his older sister disappeared
while making a documentary

33
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,732
near the town of
Burkittsville, Maryland.

34
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:02,957
Some of the footage shot
by James' sister was later found.

35
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:06,645
The final moments of it
showed her going into a house,

36
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,605
seemingly within the
Black Hills forest.

37
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:22,090
That area was extensively searched
by police and FBI

38
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:26,150
but they could find no evidence
of an existing house in those woods.

39
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:29,452
Investigators concluded that James' sister
might have vanished else where

40
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:33,756
despite her crew's equipment
and footage being found nearby.

41
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,010
For as long as I have been
friends with James,

42
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,139
he's wondered what happened to her.

43
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:44,658
His continue search to find closure and
answers to his sister's disappearance

44
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,343
is the subject of this documentary.

45
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:54,707
How long have you
and James been friends?

46
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:58,099
Our parents were friends,
so I guess we grew up together.

47
00:03:58,124 --> 00:04:00,966
So you knew him when
his sister disappeared.

48
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,436
Yeah.

49
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:05,785
I don't really remember Heather
all the well, to be honest.

50
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,303
But after she ran off into those woods
she didn't come back.

51
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:13,776
Yeah, I remember all that.

52
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:21,342
- I got one.
- That's me.

53
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:22,520
Nice shooting.

54
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:23,966
Peter.

55
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,677
Can you give us an idea what
we're going to be doing out there.

56
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,367
The four of us,
we're going to go out there

57
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:31,952
and we're going to
try to find this house.

58
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:34,853
James, he's been messaging with
the guy who uploaded that video.

59
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:38,271
He's going to show us exactly where
in the woods he found the DV tape.

60
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:40,156
And James, you think
you're going to find the house?

61
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,837
Maybe, I hope so.

62
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:43,715
So you really think your sister
could still be out there

63
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,906
after all these years.

64
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:47,061
All I know is...

65
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,672
If there is
any chance at all

66
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:51,311
that I could find out
what happened to her

67
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:53,422
I need to at least try.

68
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:55,156
And what about the legends?

69
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,438
Legends?

70
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:00,663
Yeah. Do you believe at all in
the stories about the Blair Witch?

71
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:12,093
Hey Lisa, I can't tell if
this thing is recording or not.

72
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:13,908
- Yeah, it should be. Did you...
- Yeah?

73
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:16,079
Did you press and hold
the button when you did it?

74
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:16,694
Yeah.

75
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,203
These things are so small,
where are you going to put it?

76
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:21,085
Okay, it's recording.
We are recording.

77
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,728
Just, and make sure it's always
facing forward

78
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:25,190
and make sure you
press the button down.

79
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:26,606
- And you hold it down.
- Got it. Got it.

80
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:27,814
- Are you pressing and holding?
- Yeah, I got it.

81
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,292
- Did you hold it down?
- Holding down, holding down, holding down.

82
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:31,925
- Hey, Peter!
- Yeah.

83
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,919
- How do I look?
- Yeah, that's sexy.

84
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:41,886
The thing is, he's going back out to
those woods to look for his sister, Lisa.

85
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:43,595
Because he thinks
she could still be there

86
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,583
because of some blur footage
that some weirdo put online.

87
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:49,715
- So like, how's that gonna look?
- I don't want to exploit anyone.

88
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,162
Alright then, don't tell anyone about it.
Okay, how about that?

89
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,426
Who's that? There's an option.
Don't tell anyone.

90
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:55,934
Just come out there
with us and film it

91
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,534
like he wants you
to as his friend.

92
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,677
Don't use the footage
for your movie.

93
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,969
- I can't promise that.
- Right.

94
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:05,207
- No, I can't
- I know. I know you can.

95
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,955
I can't promise that, Peter.
Because it's like,

96
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,940
- what if something actually happened out there.
- I see you, Lisa. Yeah, right.

97
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:10,090
- No, no, no.
- Okay, I'm gonna get a beer.

98
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:12,133
What if we find something
that no one ever found.

99
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:15,028
I'm so sorry. He and James
have been since friends forever.

100
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,418
Because I haven't been
friends with him

101
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,169
for as long as you guys
doesn't mean I don't care.

102
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:21,104
- I know that.
- I have a responsibility to James...

103
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,980
Oh.
Oh, baby.

104
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:27,128
How are you feeling?

105
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,047
You're asking if
I regret getting drunk

106
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:32,021
the night before going
camping in the woods?

107
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:33,950
I do not.

108
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:38,448
Okay.

109
00:06:38,473 --> 00:06:40,536
Let's just move back
a little bit.

110
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:44,687
How far does it go?

111
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:47,522
Like a 100 meters,
it's the max I think.

112
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:59,836
Ashley and I have used
this in class before.

113
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:02,002
It's just like cheap helicopter shots,
you know.

114
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:04,637
It could be useful in terms of finding
our way around the forest.

115
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:06,710
Yeah, we're going
to have GPS with us, right?

116
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:08,879
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's built into the earpiece camera.

117
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:11,160
But it only works if you put on those,
just

118
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:14,249
keep an eye on the battery
in case we got separated.

119
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:19,681
Comm check, over.

120
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,974
Comm check?

121
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:29,167
Yeah. That's like what people say
in the military, over.

122
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,712
Okay.
Anyway, it's working.

123
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:35,959
Over.

124
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:38,046
Copy that, over and out.

125
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:42,150
- Hey, the walkie-talkies worked.
- Yeah, we know.

126
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,707
You got the faces, boys.

127
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,280
Somebody wasn't upgraded.

128
00:07:52,877 --> 00:07:54,508
Whoa.

129
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:59,931
- Okay, which one is you guys'?
- This one.

130
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:01,880
Okay!

131
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:03,461
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

132
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,528
- Who made the bed?
- I don't know.

133
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:14,965
- Let me get through.
- James. James. James.

134
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:18,555
Goodnight, folks.

135
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:20,962
Oh yeah.

136
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,777
Enhance it a little.

137
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,809
When you...

138
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:29,413
- And this used to be called Blair.
- Sort of.

139
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:32,920
There was a town called Blair
back in the 1700s

140
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,266
but it is was discovered abandoned.

141
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,861
So they built up a new town,
called it Burkittsville.

142
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,974
They're here.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,216
- Hey.
- Hey.

144
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,607
Hey, come in.

145
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,581
- Hey...
- Hey.

146
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,078
Can I...
Can we have like water or anything?

147
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,498
I'm okay, thank you.

148
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:14,217
Feel free to make
yourself at home.

149
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:15,819
It's just through there.

150
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,523
Yeah, have a seat in there.

151
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:19,730
And uh,
Lane will be right with you.

152
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,757
Hey, I'm glad you all
are recording this.

153
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:24,003
Not everyday we get like
minded investigators

154
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:26,802
coming out here and
discuss the Blair Witch.

155
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:30,885
Hey, I may need to get you guys to sign
some release forms later, if that's okay.

156
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,277
Yeah, sure, that's cool.
I probably need you to sign one too.

157
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:37,581
So, you're Darknet666.

158
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:40,659
Yeah. Well, we both are,
but you can call me Lane.

159
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:43,135
- This is-This is Talia.
- Hi.

160
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:46,523
So, okay.
Well, first off,

161
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,963
I was hoping you could show us
where you found the tape.

162
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,421
We're going to make
that our starting point.

163
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:53,095
Are you guys really gonna go
camping out in those woods?

164
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,856
Yep, that's the plan.
Why?

165
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:01,021
Uh, we want to go
out there with you.

166
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,372
I mean if you're going to be looking around,
we want to be a part of that.

167
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,550
It's not... you know.

168
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:10,309
- I'm not going to be a burden or anything
we go camping all the time.
- Yeah.

169
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,595
Hey, that's the deal if you want us
to show you where we found it.

170
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:21,226
Is it okay if we talk
a little in private real quick?

171
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:24,554
Well, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure, go ahead.

172
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:33,574
- What do you think?
- No.

173
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,475
Well, don't we need them to show us
exactly where they found the tape?

174
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,502
Yeah.

175
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:40,729
Yeah, but I didn't think they'd
want to stick around after that.

176
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:45,077
Well, they didn't exactly make it
sound like we have an option.

177
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:04,494
What are you bragging about?

178
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,159
This guy really crack me up.

179
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,454
We made it.

180
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,395
- Yeah.
- Alright, Lisa.

181
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,911
Babe, what the hell
do you have in here?

182
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:38,738
It's heavy.

183
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:40,251
Lisa.

184
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,126
And Ash, I'm going to
give you the headlamp.

185
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,213
Okay.

186
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:45,998
It's cool if we leave
our cars here?

187
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:48,123
Yeah.
It's fine, they're safe.

188
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:50,151
No one comes out this way.

189
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:56,270
I'm already hungry.

190
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:58,323
Yeah.
I can eat.

191
00:11:58,348 --> 00:12:00,925
Eat all these granola bars,
you'll like that.

192
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:06,575
Hey, what do you thing
they're smoking up there?

193
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,514
Definitely bath salts.

194
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,904
- You know what?
I'm going to go ask.
- Wait.

195
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:15,592
Hey, yo.
Darknet666, wait up.

196
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,023
I saw some of your other videos.

197
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:20,547
- Yeah?
- Yeah, before we came out here.

198
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,457
Saw this one, it was really
interesting where you guys

199
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,828
like found this
little pile of rocks.

200
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:27,415
Would you stop it.

201
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:29,601
Symbols.

202
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,631
Symbols, oh they were symbols.
No, no, no, seriously.

203
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:36,403
So, do you guys really believe
all these old stories?

204
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:40,187
I mean, someone died everywhere
at some point, right?

205
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:43,117
It doesn't mean every square foot
of this planet is haunted.

206
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:44,655
Did you grow up here?

207
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,790
- No.
- See, I did.

208
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:49,805
Talia did.
We both-we both grew up here.

209
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:54,058
And older folks in town used to talk a lot
about these woods when I was little.

210
00:12:54,083 --> 00:13:00,672
And after his sister and her crew
went missing and her stuff got found,

211
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,662
suddenly everyone I noticed
wanted to forget it.

212
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,499
This area has a history of things happening
that no one really likes to talk about.

213
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:12,792
Rustin Parr.
Coffin rock.

214
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,751
The list goes on and on.

215
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,673
- Watch yourself.
- Okay.

216
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:28,294
- Watch your step.
- It goes down here.

217
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:32,194
Back in the 1940s,
Rustin Parr brought 8 kids

218
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:34,476
up to his house
in these woods.

219
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,464
He killed 7 of them.

220
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:39,193
But Parr claimed that he
heard the voice of an old woman

221
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,387
telling him to kill the children.

222
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:44,269
He would take them up to his attic
and make one stand in the corner

223
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,867
while he killed the other one.

224
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,520
There's been some debate on that
actually where...

225
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,375
whether it was the attic
or the basement.

226
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,974
So he thought he heard the
Blair Witch telling him to kill people.

227
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,515
Well, he never said who its was.

228
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,312
He just said that it sounded
like this voice of an old woman.

229
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:02,673
They hanged him out in
these woods near his house.

230
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:04,476
Wait, he got a house out here?

231
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:06,149
Yeah, but that's not the one
we're looking for though.

232
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:08,546
Parr's house was burned down
after he was hanged.

233
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:10,837
Supposedly they found a bunch of
old tunnels and stuff underneath

234
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:12,899
that didn't go anywhere.
Some kind of...

235
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:15,229
underground railroad thing I think.

236
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:34,670
Oh, my back.

237
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:47,268
Okay.
So, this is uh...

238
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:50,212
This is technically where
the Black Hills woods start

239
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,760
back when this was private land.

240
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:55,151
Uh, who owns it now?

241
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:57,796
No one.
It's the States' I guess.

242
00:14:57,821 --> 00:15:01,106
So, we're not trespassing
or anything, right?

243
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:03,105
No.
No one cares.

244
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,142
No one living that is.

245
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,215
If we have to go camping
with the locals,

246
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,887
could you please
don't piss them off.

247
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,589
Babe, I didn't say anything,
I didn't say anything.

248
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:25,447
You don't have to say anything,
Peter, you know that.

249
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,914
Sick.

250
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,624
Sorry.

251
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:34,417
NO ENTERING AFTER
NIGHTFALL

252
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:42,640
This is where we found
the DV tape.

253
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,828
There was nothing else
on the tape?

254
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:47,742
Like I said, it was all static except
for that bit when we upload it.

255
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,366
Why does that tree
look like that?

256
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:50,471
Lightning.

257
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:54,006
Sometimes when it hits the tree,
the electricity goes into the ground

258
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:56,632
and burns the tree
from the roots up.

259
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,636
.

260
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,601
A girl drown in this creek.

261
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,644
It was around when
Burkittsville was founded.

262
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:25,006
Her family was doing the washing
and the mother said she saw

263
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:28,148
a hand reached out of the water
and pulled her daughter in.

264
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,479
Probably the only reason we still
know about this because there are

265
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:35,062
newspaper articles said
the girl's body was never found.

266
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:40,118
Are we crossing this?

267
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:47,012
Oh yah.

268
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:49,344
- That's not how it is.
- Cool, dude.

269
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,907
- I'm walking across the water.
- That's right.

270
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:53,807
- Oh.
- That's cold.

271
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:56,040
Leeches are fine.
What do you mean?

272
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,825
Wait, wait, you said there are leeches?

273
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,881
No, I'm just asking.

274
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:01,051
Are you coming?

275
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,843
Did you get a pedicure
before you came here?

276
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,406
Yes.

277
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,811
I know.
I know.

278
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:12,316
You sure this is a good idea?

279
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,977
Would you hold the
camera for me first.

280
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:15,937
One second, my shoe.

281
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,618
- Oh.
- You alright?

282
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:21,096
Becareful there.

283
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,340
Ah, that's cold.

284
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:24,835
- Yeah. I got it. I got it.
- Yeah? Alright.

285
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:26,766
Careful.

286
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:32,565
You alright?

287
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:41,599
Ashley!

288
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:43,517
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.

289
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,081
I cut my foot on a rock.
You could see blood.

290
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,646
You will be alright.

291
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,955
- You okay?
- Yeah.

292
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,772
You're alright.
You're alright.

293
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:01,661
Let me see that foot.

294
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:04,435
That's better.
You're alright. You're alright. You're alright.

295
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,266
- Is it bad because it looks like it's pretty deep?
- No, it's not bad at all.

296
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,338
I just got to clean it.

297
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:12,707
Lisa, do you mind getting my first aid kit,
it's in my bag over there.

298
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:15,394
- Lisa, first aid kit bag, please.
- Oh shit, sorry.

299
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:16,767
- Thank you very much.
- Yep, sorry.

300
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,782
- Lane. Jesus.
- Hey! Hey! Back up!

301
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,693
Back up! Back up!
Back it up! Back it up!

302
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,686
- Get back over there.
- I'll be one more second.

303
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,713
- I swear...
- Alright. Alright.

304
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:27,683
There you go.
Oh. Oh.

305
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,931
It's okay,
try not to move too much.

306
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:30,307
It looks like
it's really bad.

307
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:33,115
No, it feels a lot worse
than that, Ashley, I promise.

308
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,319
- Pressure.
- Ahh.

309
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,563
It's okay. It's alright.
Now I just got to wrap it up

310
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:38,123
and you could get
to walk on it.

311
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:40,849
Just bring it around.
There you go.

312
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:43,343
- Thank you, James.
- No problem, man.

313
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:45,457
- Okay. Want to try standing up?
- Yeah.

314
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:47,829
Okay, alright.
Don't put too much pressure on it.

315
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:50,199
- You ready?
- Two. Three.

316
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,453
There you go.

317
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:52,524
- You alright?
- Yeah.

318
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,899
- Not so bad.
- Not so bad.

319
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,212
Oh.
Ow.

320
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:00,752
You okay?

321
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,963
Come to my palace
in the woods.

322
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:12,693
That's how we roll.

323
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:13,975
In style and out.

324
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,635
No, that's what I'm trying
to say is um...

325
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:17,998
Is it...
Fuck.

326
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,025
- Babe, I got it. I got...
- Babe.

327
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,853
Please let me just put
the tent together, okay!

328
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:24,774
- I'm just saying that.
- I just need to put the tent together right.

329
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:26,514
I...
It's not supposed to be bent, I know.

330
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,095
So, you just bend...
Is this supposed to be bent.

331
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,138
This is not the entrance.

332
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:34,917
That's not.
Well, that's not either.

333
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:36,479
Fuck.

334
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:38,247
Fuck.

335
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:41,389
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck you.

336
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,292
Fucking tent.

337
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,312
Okay.
I think it's good.

338
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:55,137
Hey.

339
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:58,789
I'm going to get some firewood
before it gets totally dark, okay.

340
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,527
Looks like the sun's coming
down pretty quick.

341
00:20:00,552 --> 00:20:03,663
Uh. Well, hold up.
Let's finish this and I'll come with you.

342
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:06,071
No, man.
I'm not going to far, okay.

343
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:09,417
I'll keep my camera on.
You can see me on the GPS, alright?

344
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,235
Okay.
Well, take a walkie-talkie with you please.

345
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,343
Man.
Brother, already got one.

346
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:17,238
- Thank you.
- Yep.

347
00:20:55,164 --> 00:20:57,662
What exactly should
we be looking for?

348
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:00,215
We're looking for the house
from Heather's footage.

349
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,370
Did you see the...

350
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:03,008
Do you see any clearing
or anything like that?

351
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,300
I shouldn't take this thing
too much further up, but...

352
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,200
I mean, I don't see anything yet.

353
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:18,944
- Yeah, that was a good movie.
- Oh my god.

354
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:25,196
- Oh boy.
- Oh Lane.

355
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:31,815
- Yeah.
- Ehh.

356
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,772
- Yeah.
- Eww.

357
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:35,278
- I'm really uncomfortable with this.
- Ew, I don't want it!

358
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:37,106
- Why do you have to eat it like that?
- I didn't think...

359
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:39,764
You could eat a little bit quicker,
you don't have to go all slow like that.

360
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:41,814
- Oh god.
- Oh.

361
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,427
Okay, so...

362
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:07,603
The Blair Witch.
Who is she really?

363
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:10,147
Elly Kedward.

364
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,789
That's what most people say.

365
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:19,373
She was accused of witchcraft
after some of the children in town

366
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:21,855
said that she's taking
blood from them.

367
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:25,375
There wasn't much of
a trial system back then.

368
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,517
The townspeople took her
out into these woods.

369
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:31,886
Tied her to a tree and
left her to die of exposure.

370
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:35,032
In the spring, they went back
to look for her body

371
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:37,215
but there was no trace of it.

372
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:40,769
They assumed she was eaten
by animals or something, but...

373
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:44,628
Then people in town
started disappearing.

374
00:22:45,484 --> 00:22:49,818
First the children who accused her
and their families, then others.

375
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:56,146
Eventually everyone who was left just
abandoned their homes, fled the town.

376
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:58,991
- Whoa.
- What?

377
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:02,384
- What?
- Alright, I was just going to add.

378
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,852
According to this book
I read, published in 1809,

379
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:07,754
they didn't just tied
Elly Kedward to a tree.

380
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:10,538
I mean they did tie her to a tree,
but they tied her up really high

381
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,791
and they strung these
heavy rocks to her arms and legs

382
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:14,968
as weights stretching her.

383
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:17,017
They left her to die
on a makeshift rack.

384
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,454
Okay.
Thanks.

385
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:23,158
Ever since there's been
a curse on these woods.

386
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:25,492
The legend says if you
look directly at the witch

387
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,884
you'll die just from
the fright of it.

388
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:31,089
That's why Rustin Parr
stood in that corner.

389
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,148
They say no one has ever seen her
and live to talk about it.

390
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:38,125
Or alternately, no one
has ever seen her appear yet.

391
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:40,641
These are just stories, okay.

392
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,199
I've been to these woods before.

393
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:45,936
When I was a kid with about
a hundred other people.

394
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:48,254
You were a part of those
search teams?

395
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,194
I remembered that.

396
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,604
Yeah.

397
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,891
So, how come I'm okay?

398
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,241
Nothing got me then.

399
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,472
Maybe it did.

400
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,249
You're back, right?

401
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:07,981
Alright, real theory, real theory.

402
00:24:08,006 --> 00:24:09,692
The one I put online.

403
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,083
Whatever spell the witch
put on these woods,

404
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:14,911
you have to be out here at night
for her to get you.

405
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:17,460
You have to spend the night.

406
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:20,283
Wait, then how come
you're still alive?

407
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,367
That's a good point.

408
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:24,755
Maybe she's using us
to lure you all out here.

409
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,752
- Okay, I had enough of that crap.
- Yeah, me too.

410
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:30,217
Let's get some rest.
We got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow.

411
00:24:30,242 --> 00:24:32,268
- Night, dudes.
- Yeah, goodnight.

412
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:41,210
- Goodnight, James.
- Goodnight.

413
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:05,805
I just heard something
moving outside.

414
00:25:47,424 --> 00:25:48,740
Shit.

415
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,180
Shit!

416
00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:09,982
Hey, Lisa.

417
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:15,728
Lisa, what the hell
are you doing?

418
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:17,114
- Did you hear that out there?
- Yeah, I heard.

419
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:19,022
There is something out there
out in the woods like a bear or...

420
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:20,547
Shhh.
Shhhh.

421
00:26:32,315 --> 00:26:33,747
What the fuck was that?

422
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,337
- It's okay. It's my walkie-talkie.
- Oh. Shhhit.

423
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:36,906
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

424
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:39,611
Peter, is that you?
Comm check.

425
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:43,366
Hey, man.
What the hell was that?

426
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:44,425
Fuck.

427
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,535
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

428
00:26:47,126 --> 00:26:48,420
You okay?

429
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:49,969
Yeah, yeah.
We're okay. We're okay.

430
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:51,600
Lisa's here too, we're okay.

431
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,607
I mean, she just came like
just now and we're okay.

432
00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:56,937
- Like 30 seconds ago.
- Hey, is everyone okay out there?

433
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,722
Yeah, we're fine.
You two, good?

434
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,282
No.
Lane's not here.

435
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,442
- Where is he?
- Well, he went off to pee.

436
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,064
But he always goes
far off for privacy.

437
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:09,906
Oh god.

438
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:12,782
Hey, Lane!

439
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:16,163
Lane!

440
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:20,109
Lane!

441
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,228
Oh, god damn it.

442
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:26,892
We should probably
go look for him right?

443
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:28,710
- Make sure he's okay.
- No.
- No.

444
00:27:28,742 --> 00:27:30,156
No, I'm not going out there.

445
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,196
- That is definitely not a good idea.
- Well, I'm gonna go and look for a while.

446
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:35,455
Okay, I'll come with you.

447
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,383
Uh. Shit.
He might be... lost, okay.

448
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,715
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

449
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,398
I guess I'll... I should probably
go back to my tent then.

450
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:46,177
You can stay here
if you want.

451
00:27:46,202 --> 00:27:47,847
- Okay.
- Yeah?

452
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:49,153
- Okay.
- Alright.

453
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:52,082
- I'll be right back soon.
- Alright.

454
00:27:53,414 --> 00:27:55,716
- Hey.
- Good luck, man.

455
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:01,833
- Careful. Over there.
- Thanks.

456
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:13,032
Lane!

457
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:18,635
Lane!

458
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:27,119
Lane!

459
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,052
God, where is he?

460
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,541
Lane!

461
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:38,357
Lane!

462
00:28:44,475 --> 00:28:46,074
Lane!

463
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:58,879
Did you see the tree
that fell?

464
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,151
It sounded like
it landed nearby.

465
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,665
Yeah, but...

466
00:29:03,815 --> 00:29:06,583
Sounds can travel
pretty far out here.

467
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,278
Shit!

468
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:10,147
Lane!

469
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:12,615
- Lane, what the fuck?
- I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

470
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,664
- Tell me you recorded those sounds.
Did you get those sounds?
- Uh, no.

471
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:17,020
Yeah, yeah.
Lisa and I are recording.

472
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:18,944
I went to see if I could find
what was making those noises.

473
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:20,764
I couldn't find anything.
Did you guys find anything?

474
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:22,171
- No, dude. Just...
- No.

475
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:23,438
... get back to the camp, okay?

476
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:26,328
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

477
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:28,940
- You okay?
- Yeah.

478
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:30,682
Okay.

479
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,641
You guys, get out here.

480
00:29:50,286 --> 00:29:51,635
No.

481
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,350
I'm getting out of here.

482
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,834
I'm unpacking and leaving.
This is fuck up.

483
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:57,049
Holy shit.

484
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:58,659
I want to go home, okay.

485
00:29:58,684 --> 00:30:00,233
Where'd this stuff come from?

486
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:02,641
Someone must have put these things up
while we were asleep.

487
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,431
What's going on?
What's wrong?

488
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:07,601
We should film this.
Talia, get the camera.

489
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:09,791
- You guys should be taking pictures.
- What is it?

490
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:13,718
- What?
- You guys, seriously.

491
00:30:13,743 --> 00:30:16,383
I want to go home now.
We need to get out of here.

492
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:18,616
Hey James, that's not
a bad idea, okay?

493
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:20,224
- We are not prepared for this.
- Okay.

494
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:22,129
I've seen this stuff before.
It was in Heather's footage, guys.

495
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,922
Shit.
There's another one back here.

496
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,568
- That's my tent!
- Fuck.

497
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:28,831
Does anybody know what time it is?
My watch is saying 2 PM.

498
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:31,852
What? How is it even possible?
We just woke up.

499
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,916
- But how did we sleep
  till 2 in the afternoon.
- Yeah.

500
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:35,108
- Okay. Okay, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Please, you know.

501
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,828
You know what? Ashley's right.
Let's just...

502
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:38,512
pack up our stuff and
get back to my car, okay.

503
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,223
No, no, no.
Are you sure?

504
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:42,447
Yeah. Yeah.
This is too weird.

505
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:44,144
- I don't know.
  We found something, right?
- Yeah.

506
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:46,975
Like, we can show the footage to the police.
Maybe they'll reopen Heather's case.

507
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,668
Wait.
I want to get that on camera.

508
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:50,593
I'll get this free.
Let me just...

509
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:53,719
Just rip it off the tree,
for Christ's sake.

510
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,537
Holy shit.

511
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:57,555
Let me give this a shot,
just a shot.

512
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,115
I have an idea. Why don't you stay here
and get all the footage you want.

513
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,807
Alright, that's it. Come on.
Turn it off. Turn it off.

514
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:05,009
I want to get a shot
at it, okay?

515
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,104
Fuck this.

516
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,198
So.

517
00:31:47,223 --> 00:31:49,440
Hey, what kind of
a camera is that, man?

518
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:51,399
Oh.
It's a DV camera.

519
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:53,448
- Oh yeah?
- It's old.

520
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:55,125
Good in low light.
It's better than modern cameras.

521
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,183
Mm-mm, okay.

522
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,623
Does it use tapes,
like the one you found or is it...

523
00:31:59,648 --> 00:32:02,040
You know, there are not too
many brands of it anymore.  Why?

524
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:04,393
- Oh nothing, I'm just curious.
- Oh, I recommend it.

525
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:05,788
Everything is cards now but...

526
00:32:05,813 --> 00:32:08,704
Some ways, you know, tapes are
more reliable and cheaper.

527
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:10,207
You still have to carry
a lot of batteries though.

528
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:11,475
Oh yeah.

529
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,086
Ow!
Ahh.

530
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:14,880
- Ashley.
- Babe.

531
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:17,495
- You, alright? You, okay?
- What's wrong?

532
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,818
I'm fine.
It's just my foot.

533
00:32:19,843 --> 00:32:22,370
- You want to take the boot off.
- No, it just hurt for a second.

534
00:32:22,395 --> 00:32:23,994
But, it feels fine now.

535
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:25,257
-  Can you feel that?
- Yeah.

536
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:26,634
- Does that hurt?
- It's fine.

537
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:28,191
Hey, Lane.

538
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:30,354
Lane. Stop it.
Stop it!

539
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:31,754
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What is this?

540
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:34,359
- This looks familiar, doesn't it, guys?
- Yeah, that's a rope.

541
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:35,867
I'm carrying that because
it's used for camping.

542
00:32:35,892 --> 00:32:36,855
- Give back to me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

543
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,699
- Give it back.
- Get back, man.

544
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:39,356
You have the samples from
the camp, don't you, Talia?

545
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:40,815
So, can I see one?

546
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,153
- Because this rope looks exactly the same.
- What the hell.

547
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:45,765
Definitely it does not look the same.
Rope is rope.

548
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,158
- Open your eyes.
- Okay, let her see it then.

549
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:48,904
She doesn't need to see it!

550
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:50,101
- Come on.
- Hey! Hey. Hey.

551
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:51,795
- Get the fuck off, big man!
- Listen, stop it!

552
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,821
Listen, we weren't trying to
scare you or anything. We just...

553
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,958
We weren't lying about the things
that were going on in these woods.

554
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:58,132
We just...
We needed...

555
00:32:58,157 --> 00:33:00,248
- ... somebody to see what was happening.
- No. No, no, no.

556
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,456
Did you...
You fake this?

557
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:10,218
Yeah. Yeah.
We faked it.

558
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,012
Alright, look.
We faked it because it's real, okay.

559
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:15,530
There really is something happening here,
guys, in these woods.

560
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:17,092
- And that make sense to you?
- Everyone would.

561
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:19,445
Hey, we didn't fake
those noises last night.

562
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,035
And, sleeping until 2 o'clock.
How could we fake that?

563
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,609
There is something really
going on out here.

564
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:28,081
Right. For all we know, you guys put
sleeping pills in our water or something.

565
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,657
- What?
- Did you?

566
00:33:29,682 --> 00:33:30,744
- No.
- No.

567
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:32,226
You know what?
Okay.

568
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,126
Fuck this.
I'm out.

569
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:38,151
You guys-You guys want this.
This is on you.

570
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,587
Hey, get a shot of this.

571
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:44,528
Lane.

572
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,299
The guys are fucking assholes.

573
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:51,069
Guys.

574
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,207
We don't-
We don't have the GPS thing.

575
00:33:56,232 --> 00:33:58,637
There's no cell reception out here.
So, I mean...

576
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,724
- That's not our problem.
- Just hear me out.

577
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:01,734
- That's not our problem.
- What if-What if we get lost, okay?

578
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,013
What if we get lost?

579
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:05,496
I thought you guys camp
right here all the time.

580
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:08,186
- We've been following you.
- My god!

581
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,174
- No.
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man!

582
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,048
We have gone as far as
the creek when nobody has.

583
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:13,260
- Nobody's been here for years.
- Shit.

584
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,521
We don't know where we are!

585
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:16,245
Okay, just calm down.
We meant to, we meant to.

586
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,802
- We want to stay in numbers, okay?
- Jesus Christ!

587
00:34:17,827 --> 00:34:20,362
- There's more of us so the odds are better.
- Okay, is there anything that you two
told us that is not a lie.

588
00:34:20,387 --> 00:34:22,071
And I guess it's just a coincidence
that your camera uses

589
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:24,368
the exact same kind
of tape that you found.

590
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:25,369
No.

591
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:26,341
- Okay.
- It wasn't...

592
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:28,334
I think you two got
all the footage you need.

593
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,575
You walk that way for about 2 miles,
you'll hit the fence.

594
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,392
Look. Can we just calm down
and we just talk about it.

595
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:33,927
- NO! Get out of here!
- Come on.

596
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:36,812
- Please. Please, just come on.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Go.

597
00:34:37,445 --> 00:34:39,889
- Cut the camera off.
- Guys, you don't understand, okay.

598
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:41,547
- Just go!
- GET OUT OF HERE!

599
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:42,226
Go!

600
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,958
- Come on, please.
- Time up, it's time to go! Just go!

601
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,158
Please, man!

602
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,276
- Take him, go.
- Come on!

603
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,238
Guys, are you sure?
Does this...

604
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:52,819
Does this have to happen?
We can talk about this.

605
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,869
We can talk about it.
I have like...

606
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,479
Lane, I swear...
Fuck.

607
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:59,190
- I'm... God, no.
- Fuck.

608
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:01,986
Fuck!

609
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:05,659
James, man.

610
00:35:05,684 --> 00:35:07,577
I'm so sorry.

611
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:09,970
I actually thought that...

612
00:35:10,017 --> 00:35:12,409
Heather could still be out here.

613
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:14,440
They're pathetic, man.

614
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,982
I should have known then.

615
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:22,388
I guess I just...

616
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:27,829
Oh god.

617
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:35,635
Well.

618
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,018
I don't know about you guys,
but I feel a little bit ...

619
00:35:38,043 --> 00:35:40,037
You know, less scared of
being in the woods now.

620
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:41,812
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

621
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:43,572
Are you going to be okay?

622
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:45,525
I'm alright, man.

623
00:35:45,715 --> 00:35:47,482
- I'm okay.
- I'm giving you a hug.

624
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,199
- Don't give me a hug.
- I'm giving you a hug.

625
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:50,647
I'm giving you a hug, my son.

626
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:53,464
Aw.
Look at that.

627
00:35:58,091 --> 00:36:00,157
You're welcome to stay here.

628
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,978
- Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

629
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:19,743
You got it.

630
00:36:22,173 --> 00:36:23,863
Lisa, come on.

631
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,675
Let's go.

632
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,949
Hey, James.

633
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:36,051
Are we anywhere
close to the fence yet?

634
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:37,710
Yep, should be.

635
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:08,265
This looks familiar.

636
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,871
That's a good thing, right?

637
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,495
How could you even tell?

638
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,171
I don't know.
I just...

639
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:15,328
I thought we...

640
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:17,225
- Wait, wait.
- What?

641
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,904
- No. No.
- What?

642
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:24,274
No way.
No way!

643
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:25,655
We've been walking in a circle!

644
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,446
That doesn't make sense.
I've been following the GPS.

645
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:29,746
Then we should have reached
the fence hours ago!

646
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:32,556
We shouldn't be back at the same
fucking campsite we just left!

647
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:35,667
- Can I see the GPS, James.
- I don't know, it must be broken.

648
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:38,402
- We're lost.
- No, we're not lost.

649
00:37:38,427 --> 00:37:41,850
- We got turned around. We got...
- Got turned around.

650
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:45,038
Let's look around with the drone.

651
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,723
- Better get start hiking for the road.
- Okay, let's do that.

652
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:49,965
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey. Hey.

653
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,531
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

654
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,281
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
- You sure?

655
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:58,348
- I'm fine.
- You can't...

656
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:00,677
- I'm fine.
- You can't keep walking.

657
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:02,811
- We got to camp here tonight, you'all.
- Oh, no no no...

658
00:38:02,836 --> 00:38:05,028
- No, no, no, babe. You got to...
- I'm not...! Ah, ah.

659
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:06,203
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

660
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:10,149
I can't stay here another night, Peter.
I can't stay here another night, okay.

661
00:38:10,174 --> 00:38:13,560
Hey, you need a rest.
Okay, you got to let that foot heal.

662
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:15,124
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay?

663
00:38:15,149 --> 00:38:17,136
Look, we'll just set up the tents.

664
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,476
We'll be okay.
This is fine. We...

665
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:20,958
We'll figure it out.

666
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:26,046
Can you please... at least
take down those creepy sticks, babe.

667
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:28,975
- I can't look at those things anymore.
- I got it. I got it.

668
00:38:39,462 --> 00:38:41,312
Hey, can I see your camera?

669
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:43,851
I just want to charge the batteries
and change the cards out.

670
00:38:43,876 --> 00:38:45,221
Yeah.

671
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,688
Did you hear that?

672
00:38:47,713 --> 00:38:49,001
What?

673
00:38:50,257 --> 00:38:51,552
Nothing.

674
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:54,546
Nothing.
My ears are playing tricks on me.

675
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:57,026
You know what?
I thought I heard a voice earlier...

676
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:00,269
Hey.

677
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,193
Hey, how are you doing?

678
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:04,759
I'm fine.
I'm just freezing.

679
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:07,340
Can you tell James
to start a fire?

680
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,881
Oh babe.

681
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:12,811
We should check out
this cut on your foot.

682
00:39:12,836 --> 00:39:14,610
Yeah, okay.

683
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,310
Okay.

684
00:39:22,656 --> 00:39:24,751
I'll just take that off.

685
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,739
- Ah!
- Okay.

686
00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:36,396
- Becareful, it hurts.
- I got you. Alright.

687
00:39:41,525 --> 00:39:43,570
Looks like you...

688
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:45,922
It's a bit irritated.

689
00:39:45,947 --> 00:39:47,648
Is it bad?

690
00:39:47,673 --> 00:39:49,466
No, uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

691
00:39:49,498 --> 00:39:51,922
No, it's fine.
I mean, we should just...

692
00:39:51,947 --> 00:39:54,839
You know...
put some ointment on it.

693
00:39:54,864 --> 00:39:56,215
I'll go get James.

694
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,548
- Ah!
- Whoa whoa whoa...

695
00:39:57,573 --> 00:39:59,011
Don't do that now!

696
00:39:59,036 --> 00:40:01,161
What was that?
What just happened?

697
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:03,183
Okay.

698
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:06,273
It's fine now.
Just...

699
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:08,844
Becareful where you touch, okay.

700
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:12,126
That's how I felt
when I fell earlier today.

701
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:16,065
Okay.
Uh.

702
00:40:16,753 --> 00:40:19,907
I'm gonna set your foot down, okay.
And uh...

703
00:40:20,236 --> 00:40:22,836
You should just stay lying down.
I'll be right back.

704
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:24,176
Okay.

705
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:26,857
I'm just gonna rest my eyes.

706
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:28,447
Okay.

707
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,145
Hey, I need to talk to you.

708
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,258
That cut, on Ashley's foot,
it's gotten worse.

709
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:48,755
But.
No, no.

710
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,361
Whatever it was,
it was really fucking weird, man.

711
00:40:50,386 --> 00:40:53,409
Okay.
You said it looked like a muscle spasm.

712
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:55,419
Yeah, or something like it.
I-I don't know.

713
00:40:55,444 --> 00:40:57,302
Whatever.
There's something inside of her cut.

714
00:40:57,327 --> 00:40:59,600
Now she's cold and
I think she has a fever.

715
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,441
- So, I just...
- Okay.

716
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:03,707
- Okay, I'll go take a look at her right now.
- Thank you.

717
00:41:03,732 --> 00:41:04,846
Yep.

718
00:41:05,515 --> 00:41:08,029
I want to keep a fire going
for her tonight. So...

719
00:41:08,054 --> 00:41:10,280
I'm going to gather some woods
if you guys think you could get it started.

720
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:12,530
- Yeah, it's a good idea.
- Hey, keep your walkie-talkie on.

721
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:13,969
Of course.

722
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,076
Hey, will you look at this?

723
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,479
What is it?

724
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:19,869
Well.

725
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,532
I don't see a road
or a creek or anything.

726
00:41:22,557 --> 00:41:24,793
Should I take it further out?

727
00:41:25,673 --> 00:41:28,555
Maybe it's the angle
or something.

728
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,701
- What?
- Oh.

729
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:30,740
What's happened?

730
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:32,568
I don't know.
Like it...

731
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:34,865
Oh shit!

732
00:41:40,076 --> 00:41:41,593
Fuck.

733
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:54,205
God damn it.

734
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:58,578
Lisa, if you are watching this footage,
I think you'll want to delete it.

735
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,745
How is she?

736
00:42:31,198 --> 00:42:33,512
It's infected.
She has a fever.

737
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:37,557
Did you see anything like... moving
like Peter said?

738
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:45,026
Nothing like that.

739
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,817
Look, we should take her straight
to the closest ER tomorrow.

740
00:42:48,843 --> 00:42:50,233
Okay.

741
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:07,949
Damn it.

742
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:13,612
Hey James, is that you?

743
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:20,902
Hey, genius,
I think you're sitting on your walkie.

744
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:28,567
Okay.

745
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:33,425
Shit.

746
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,342
Oh shit.
Come on. Fuck.

747
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:40,116
Oh shit.

748
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:42,118
Hello?
Hey.

749
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:45,619
Is someone out there?

750
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:52,441
Oh shit!

751
00:44:00,455 --> 00:44:02,184
Oh. No.
No, no, no!

752
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:04,590
No! No, no!
No, no!

753
00:44:04,615 --> 00:44:06,951
Come on!
Come on!

754
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:33,612
Okay.
Hopefully the batteries last.

755
00:44:52,804 --> 00:44:53,835
What was that?

756
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,586
It sounded like another treefall.
I think that's...

757
00:44:57,044 --> 00:44:58,067
James.

758
00:44:58,092 --> 00:44:59,235
Peter!

759
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,416
- Wait, James.
- Peter!

760
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,382
James!

761
00:45:33,822 --> 00:45:35,590
Peter, can you hear me?

762
00:45:39,177 --> 00:45:40,631
Peter!

763
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:56,944
Peter!

764
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,428
Peter!

765
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,158
Peter!

766
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:08,643
Peter!

767
00:46:10,374 --> 00:46:11,745
Peter?

768
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,514
Peter!

769
00:46:17,627 --> 00:46:20,258
(Peter's flashlight.)

770
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,114
Peter!

771
00:46:30,758 --> 00:46:32,322
Peter!

772
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:37,070
Peter, can you hear me?

773
00:46:38,538 --> 00:46:41,429
Peter, if you're hurt or you can't
speak or something, just...

774
00:46:41,454 --> 00:46:44,587
Press the button on your
walkie-talkie twice, 2 clicks.

775
00:46:45,532 --> 00:46:48,748
Peter, if can you hear me, just press
the button on your walkie-talkie.

776
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:52,871
Peter!

777
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:56,129
Fuck.

778
00:47:37,418 --> 00:47:39,029
Oh.
What?

779
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:41,628
I don't feel so good.

780
00:47:43,644 --> 00:47:45,255
Where's Peter?

781
00:47:46,192 --> 00:47:49,308
He went to get some firewood
but he'll be back soon, okay.

782
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,361
Come on,
let's get you back to bed.

783
00:48:06,859 --> 00:48:08,024
Lisa!

784
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:09,072
Hey.

785
00:48:09,113 --> 00:48:11,864
- Can everyone stop doing that?
- Come here.

786
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,929
Fuck.

787
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:21,312
I found Peter's flashlight out there.

788
00:48:21,337 --> 00:48:22,654
Shit.

789
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:27,338
That was him screaming
out there, right?

790
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,253
- I think so.
- Oh god.

791
00:48:32,278 --> 00:48:33,877
Okay, James.
Look.

792
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:35,289
It will be okay.

793
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:37,767
Look.
We need to stay together.

794
00:48:38,404 --> 00:48:40,445
You're right.
You're right.

795
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:44,192
Let's just keep the fire going.
If he sees it, he can find his way back.

796
00:48:45,942 --> 00:48:47,283
Okay.

797
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:13,488
You know, I actually thought that...

798
00:49:13,513 --> 00:49:16,202
Heather could still be out
in these woods somehow.

799
00:49:18,518 --> 00:49:20,012
But now...

800
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:22,191
Peter's lost

801
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,526
and Ashley's hurt.

802
00:49:25,705 --> 00:49:27,559
It will be okay.

803
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:37,662
Did you hear that?

804
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,009
Yeah.

805
00:49:44,945 --> 00:49:47,872
- Do you think they're coming in here?
- I don't know.

806
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:57,941
Peter!

807
00:50:11,524 --> 00:50:12,952
Peter?

808
00:50:16,398 --> 00:50:17,789
Lane, Talia?

809
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,470
- What are you guys doing here?
- No no no...

810
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:21,164
It's not-Its not real.
Don't go close.

811
00:50:21,189 --> 00:50:23,065
It's a trick.
It's a trick.

812
00:50:23,294 --> 00:50:25,327
When was the last time
you saw us?

813
00:50:25,352 --> 00:50:28,840
Uh.
Earlier this afternoon.

814
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:30,433
No.
Lane.

815
00:50:30,457 --> 00:50:32,608
It's been 5 days
since we saw you.

816
00:50:32,632 --> 00:50:35,062
Maybe 6. What the fuck
is going on with the sun?

817
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:36,668
The sun is not coming up!

818
00:50:36,693 --> 00:50:38,492
The sun is not fucking coming up!

819
00:50:38,517 --> 00:50:40,261
What are you talking about?

820
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:43,530
Hey, where are the other two?
Peter and, what's her name?

821
00:50:43,692 --> 00:50:46,400
Ashley is sleeping
She's not feeling well.

822
00:50:46,425 --> 00:50:48,622
And we don't know
where Peter is.

823
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:50,233
Fuck.
It's starting for them.

824
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:51,729
- We have to go. Come on, we have to go.
- No.

825
00:50:51,754 --> 00:50:53,795
Guys, we're not going to fall
for your stupid shit again.

826
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,256
Could you just tell us
what's going on?

827
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:57,082
Do I look like
I'm messing with you?

828
00:50:57,107 --> 00:50:58,844
- You got any food.
- No! No, get back.

829
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:00,536
Get back, please. Talia.

830
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:03,092
- Get back here, please.
- I want it!

831
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:04,135
Get back.

832
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,859
We're alive, don't you see that?
Are you crazy?

833
00:51:06,884 --> 00:51:08,472
Look at them.
They are doing better than us, aren't they?

834
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:09,146
Are they?

835
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:11,327
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know.

836
00:51:11,352 --> 00:51:13,013
- No, no, no, no.
- Please.

837
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:14,593
You want to stay
here, you go ahead.

838
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:16,221
- Go ahead!
- Please. Don't! Just...

839
00:51:16,246 --> 00:51:19,500
These people are going to die!
They're going to be here forever.

840
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:21,172
Not me!

841
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:22,649
Not me!

842
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:24,216
Lane!

843
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,525
Talia.

844
00:51:47,347 --> 00:51:51,270
We're just gonna go
sit by the fire and...

845
00:51:52,384 --> 00:51:54,885
we'll set up a tent for you, okay?

846
00:52:37,558 --> 00:52:39,652
I don't think I can sleep.

847
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:43,926
Me neither.

848
00:53:13,097 --> 00:53:14,419
What?

849
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,202
It makes no sense.

850
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:17,395
What?

851
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,945
I set the alarm for 7 o'clock,
it's still dark outside.

852
00:53:25,422 --> 00:53:28,155
- Okay, we should pack up.
- Okay.

853
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:36,424
What the hell?

854
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:42,494
Oh my god.

855
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,787
Oh my god.

856
00:53:44,812 --> 00:53:46,168
Lisa.

857
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:48,421
Lisa, get out here.

858
00:53:48,446 --> 00:53:50,228
What the fuck is that?

859
00:53:51,752 --> 00:53:54,560
Oh my god.
Oh.

860
00:53:54,592 --> 00:53:56,245
Oh my god.

861
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,143
How could we not hear this?

862
00:54:03,154 --> 00:54:05,106
Holy shit.

863
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:07,722
Oh, fuck.

864
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:10,291
They're everywhere

865
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:14,758
Who could have done this?

866
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,309
My god.

867
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:18,707
I'll rewind the camera.

868
00:54:20,464 --> 00:54:21,991
Shit, the battery is dead.

869
00:54:22,016 --> 00:54:24,516
We have to go.
We have to go.

870
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,862
We...
We have to go now.

871
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:29,131
Yeah, okay.
Let's pack up our things.

872
00:54:29,156 --> 00:54:31,015
No, no, no...!!!

873
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,462
- Ashley.
- Ashley.

874
00:54:32,487 --> 00:54:35,143
What is this shit?

875
00:54:35,168 --> 00:54:36,675
Okay, okay.

876
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,115
What is going on?

877
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,050
What is she doing here?
Where is Peter?

878
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:45,779
Talia came back a few hours ago.

879
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:47,666
- she got lost okay.
- You're safe. You're okay.

880
00:54:47,691 --> 00:54:49,043
Peter.

881
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:50,810
I'm not sure.

882
00:54:52,502 --> 00:54:54,008
Ashley.

883
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:57,341
Ashley.

884
00:54:57,772 --> 00:55:00,579
- Ashley.
- I feel... I feel sick.

885
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,822
Okay. Okay.
What...

886
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:05,196
What about the...

887
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:07,566
What about the drone camera?
Can you send the drone camera up?

888
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:09,665
- Can you look for him like
  you were looking for the house!
- It crashed.

889
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,152
No! No!
No! No!

890
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,230
No.
No.

891
00:55:15,255 --> 00:55:16,785
Hair.

892
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:20,856
Mine.

893
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:24,579
My hair.

894
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:26,846
- It's bullshit she was here.
- This is my hair.

895
00:55:26,871 --> 00:55:29,202
- You did this!
- Ashley. Ashley.

896
00:55:29,235 --> 00:55:31,209
You just shut up!
This is all your fault!

897
00:55:31,234 --> 00:55:32,672
Ashley, don't!

898
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:38,035
Oh my god.

899
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,722
God!
No!

900
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,004
Talia. Talia. Talia...

901
00:55:48,029 --> 00:55:50,079
No, oh my god!

902
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:54,386
Ashley.
Ashley, Ashley, Ashley.

903
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:55,629
- It's going to be okay.
- Okay.

904
00:55:55,654 --> 00:55:57,391
- It's going to be okay.
- Okay.

905
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,884
Oh my god!

906
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,646
Oh my god!

907
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,813
James!

908
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,851
Ashley!

909
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,011
James!

910
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:57,761
Lisa, I'm here!

911
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,572
James.

912
00:57:01,597 --> 00:57:03,309
- Lisa, here I am. You okay?
- Yeah.

913
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:04,722
You alright?

914
00:57:09,837 --> 00:57:11,377
Where's Ashley?

915
00:57:13,803 --> 00:57:15,762
I don't know.
I don't know. We got split up.

916
00:57:15,787 --> 00:57:17,912
- We have to go find her.
- We have to go back. Let's backtrack.

917
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:19,928
- Okay.
- Alright, stay close.

918
00:57:19,953 --> 00:57:21,261
Stay close.

919
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,876
It's alright.
You're alright.

920
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,020
Lisa!

921
00:57:29,185 --> 00:57:31,007
James!

922
00:58:18,976 --> 00:58:20,442
Peter!

923
00:58:23,975 --> 00:58:25,223
Okay.

924
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:26,726
- She couldn't have gone far, right?
- I don't know.

925
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:30,378
Ashley!

926
00:59:36,571 --> 00:59:38,268
Holy shit.

927
00:59:42,197 --> 00:59:45,351
Ashley!

928
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:51,929
Ashley!

929
00:59:52,243 --> 00:59:53,690
We'll find her.

930
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:02,254
Hello?

931
01:00:02,572 --> 01:00:04,202
Ashley, is that you?

932
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:06,215
Comm check.

933
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,043
That's Peter, he's okay.

934
01:00:08,118 --> 01:00:10,780
Peter, is that you?

935
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,780
Help me...

936
01:00:26,228 --> 01:00:29,854
Hey. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

937
01:00:35,228 --> 01:00:36,711
Lisa, come on.

938
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:38,776
It's okay.

939
01:00:41,534 --> 01:00:42,992
You're okay.

940
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:58,992
It's alright.

941
01:00:59,709 --> 01:01:01,522
You're safe.

942
01:01:04,455 --> 01:01:06,158
It's okay.

943
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,197
You're okay.
You're okay.

944
01:01:16,571 --> 01:01:18,065
I promise.

945
01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:20,894
Yeah.
Okay.

946
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,709
- We got to go.
- Yeah?

947
01:01:28,734 --> 01:01:30,383
- Yeah.
- You alright? You sure?

948
01:01:30,408 --> 01:01:31,776
Yeah.
We got to go.

949
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:34,316
Okay.
This way.

950
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:37,817
Easy.
Slowly. Slowly.

951
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,007
That's it. That's it.
- - Okay.

952
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:45,102
That's it.

953
01:02:11,138 --> 01:02:12,168
Alright, the drone.

954
01:02:12,194 --> 01:02:14,913
Okay. I can send help.
I can send help.

955
01:02:17,169 --> 01:02:18,810
Come on.

956
01:02:27,028 --> 01:02:29,981
Shit. Shit. Shit.
It's stuck.

957
01:02:30,006 --> 01:02:31,444
Shit.

958
01:02:32,765 --> 01:02:35,176
Okay.
I can... I can...

959
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:36,510
Okay.

960
01:02:46,299 --> 01:02:47,716
Okay.

961
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:55,102
Okay.

962
01:03:32,094 --> 01:03:33,346
Shit.

963
01:04:43,712 --> 01:04:46,245
Ashley!

964
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:53,747
Ashley!

965
01:04:57,433 --> 01:05:00,292
Ashley!

966
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,544
It's okay, keep going.
It's alright.

967
01:05:17,154 --> 01:05:19,964
Ashley!

968
01:05:30,914 --> 01:05:33,795
- Is that her?
- Where's it coming from?

969
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,118
This way.
Come on!

970
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,693
Ashley!

971
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:44,711
Ashley!

972
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,473
Ashley!

973
01:05:54,142 --> 01:05:56,170
Ashley!

974
01:05:58,428 --> 01:06:00,126
Oh my god!

975
01:06:00,151 --> 01:06:01,834
We found it!

976
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:03,464
This is it!

977
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:11,575
- Lisa, come on.
- No, no, no, James.

978
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,908
I don't want to go in there.
I don't think we should go, let's not go.

979
01:06:15,089 --> 01:06:16,248
(James.)

980
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:18,177
- Heather!
- Stop!

981
01:06:18,202 --> 01:06:19,478
That's my sister!

982
01:06:19,503 --> 01:06:21,324
I don't know what happened
to your sister, James.

983
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:23,177
But that's not her.
That can't be her.

984
01:06:23,202 --> 01:06:24,184
(No!)

985
01:06:24,209 --> 01:06:25,277
Let's go.

986
01:06:25,302 --> 01:06:27,285
- Oh god, I have to go in there.
- Please!

987
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:29,632
My sister is in the house!
It has to be her!

988
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:32,433
- James, please. Please.
- Lisa.

989
01:06:33,305 --> 01:06:36,155
You know this is
what I came here for.

990
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,801
James, please!

991
01:06:43,234 --> 01:06:44,848
Heather!

992
01:06:52,537 --> 01:06:54,653
James!

993
01:06:57,124 --> 01:06:58,658
Heather?

994
01:07:18,113 --> 01:07:19,626
Heather?

995
01:07:24,911 --> 01:07:26,350
Hello?

996
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:35,443
Peter?

997
01:07:37,612 --> 01:07:39,135
Peter!

998
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:40,846
Peter!

999
01:07:48,758 --> 01:07:50,164
Heather!

1000
01:07:51,186 --> 01:07:52,582
Heather!

1001
01:07:53,797 --> 01:07:55,121
Heather!

1002
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:16,898
Heather!

1003
01:08:17,358 --> 01:08:18,922
Heather!

1004
01:08:42,522 --> 01:08:43,929
Heather!

1005
01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:45,656
Heather!

1006
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:47,713
Heather?

1007
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,482
No!

1008
01:09:07,507 --> 01:09:09,983
Oh shit.
Oh shit.

1009
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:20,073
Heather?

1010
01:09:20,735 --> 01:09:22,061
Hello?

1011
01:09:22,306 --> 01:09:24,058
Heather!

1012
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,776
Heather!

1013
01:09:30,508 --> 01:09:31,953
Heather.

1014
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:37,146
Oh, fuck this.

1015
01:09:42,103 --> 01:09:43,731
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

1016
01:09:54,521 --> 01:09:57,300
Ashley!

1017
01:10:00,461 --> 01:10:02,469
James!

1018
01:10:19,123 --> 01:10:22,202
James!

1019
01:10:22,896 --> 01:10:25,552
James!

1020
01:10:46,164 --> 01:10:47,822
James?

1021
01:10:52,186 --> 01:10:53,544
Fuck.

1022
01:10:59,033 --> 01:11:00,903
James!

1023
01:11:11,528 --> 01:11:13,074
Hello?

1024
01:11:15,675 --> 01:11:17,306
James?

1025
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:36,504
Who is that?

1026
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:38,308
You look exactly
how I remembered.

1027
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,656
Oh my god.
Lane?

1028
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,380
I guess she couldn't
have let you go.

1029
01:11:41,406 --> 01:11:43,809
She had to find
people who remember.

1030
01:11:44,018 --> 01:11:46,367
Draw us apart, you understood?

1031
01:11:46,675 --> 01:11:48,949
You have to do
what she tells you!

1032
01:11:48,974 --> 01:11:50,425
Get out!

1033
01:12:17,573 --> 01:12:18,837
Lane!

1034
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,536
Lane!

1035
01:12:30,903 --> 01:12:32,673
Lane!

1036
01:12:49,341 --> 01:12:50,872
Fuck.

1037
01:13:08,775 --> 01:13:11,855
Okay.
It's got to lead outside.

1038
01:15:03,951 --> 01:15:05,216
Okay.

1039
01:15:10,304 --> 01:15:11,859
Breathe.

1040
01:15:12,629 --> 01:15:14,305
Breathe.

1041
01:15:15,282 --> 01:15:17,438
Everything's okay.

1042
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:20,785
Breathe.

1043
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:09,927
Fuck.

1044
01:18:00,506 --> 01:18:02,266
- Lisa?
- James.

1045
01:18:04,969 --> 01:18:06,222
Oh my god.

1046
01:18:06,252 --> 01:18:09,421
The attic.
We're in the attic?

1047
01:18:10,127 --> 01:18:11,872
Wait! Wait!
She's right behind me.

1048
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:13,388
Oh shit.

1049
01:18:26,925 --> 01:18:28,534
What the fuck was that?

1050
01:18:28,567 --> 01:18:29,976
Oh god.

1051
01:18:33,254 --> 01:18:34,949
What do we do?

1052
01:18:34,974 --> 01:18:37,559
The corner.
Get in the corner, come on.

1053
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:41,521
- James, what are you doing?
- I said, corner now! Come on!

1054
01:18:46,628 --> 01:18:48,313
Don't turn around!

1055
01:18:48,338 --> 01:18:49,908
Don't look.

1056
01:18:52,038 --> 01:18:54,185
Shh. Shhh.
Quiet.

1057
01:18:59,986 --> 01:19:04,129
Just keep your eyes close.
She only takes sacrifices.

1058
01:19:04,303 --> 01:19:06,706
We can't look direct at her.

1059
01:19:21,731 --> 01:19:23,533
Close your eyes.

1060
01:19:28,428 --> 01:19:31,117
Lisa, I'm so sorry.

1061
01:19:34,032 --> 01:19:36,493
This is all my fault.

1062
01:19:47,606 --> 01:19:48,931
Heather?

1063
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,858
(... ....)

1064
01:19:55,155 --> 01:19:56,994
Is that really you?

1065
01:19:58,592 --> 01:20:01,235
Who are you talking to?

1066
01:20:13,078 --> 01:20:15,708
James!

1067
01:20:32,548 --> 01:20:35,595
James, where are you?

1068
01:20:57,746 --> 01:21:00,638
If you don't look at her,
She can't hurt you.

1069
01:21:33,165 --> 01:21:35,939
Lisa, I'm so sorry.

1070
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:40,315
James?

1071
01:22:03,946 --> 01:22:09,038
