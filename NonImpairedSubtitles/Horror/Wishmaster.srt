1
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,600
Before the beginning of time, 

2
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Did God insufflate the life? universe. 

3
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,500
Lumi?re were born the Angels. 

4
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,600
Ground was born the Man. 

5
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,000
Fire were born the Djinn, 

6
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,200
condemned creatures? to live 

7
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,700
the vacuum enters the worlds. 

8
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,800
Who awakes a Djinn 

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,100
will see three of these exaucés wishes. 

10
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,800
The troisi?me exaucé wish, 

11
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,300
impious legions of the Djinn 

12
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,000
will break on the ground. 

13
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Only one fear exists ... 

14
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Fear of the Djinn. 

15
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,300
Formulate your second wish. 

16
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,700
Astonish Me, Djinn. 
Show me wonders. 

17
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,900
If such is your wish. 

18
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,300
Help me, wizard! 

19
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,100
Draw aside this curse. 

20
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,400
Help us. 

21
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,300
By all the names of God, 
I did not want that! 

22
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
Draw aside very from a wish. 

23
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,700
Make the wish. 

24
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
More wishes. 

25
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
That Its Majesty is keep silent. 

26
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,800
But my poor people ... 

27
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Wish-you It that 
in the whole world? 

28
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,900
More wishes. 

29
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I will have warned you, wizard. 
Do not say any more. 

30
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,200
ll awaits nothing any more but one wish. 

31
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,100
3 granted wishes? who awoke, 

32
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,600
he open the door between the worlds. 

33
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,000
New wonders. 

34
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,300
New splendours. 

35
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,200
And of new and terrifying main. 

36
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,900
In America, nowadays 

37
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,500
And you?tes come in person, 
Mr. Beaumont. 

38
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
I awaited it 1 0 years. 

39
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,900
Ancient sculpture, 
2 ,45 m. of top. 

40
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,200
Rule of pre-Islamic God 

41
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,700
Ahura Mazda. 

42
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,000
These gods were prohibited 
under the Islamic law. 

43
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,800
Its existence is a miracle. 

44
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,700
What does it make? 

45
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,300
Oh the moron! 

46
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,700
Gently with this case! 

47
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,600
Get stuffed ! 

48
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,100
I can help you? 

49
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,400
Can -?tre. 
I hold the pawnshop 

50
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,500
on the 5?me. 
The cesspool of the universe. 

51
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,400
In short, one brought that to me this morning. 

52
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,200
I gave a handsome price of them 
and I would like to make it appraise. 

53
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Excellent initiative. 

54
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,900
- Nick? 
- Shannon? 

55
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,300
That should interest Alex. 

56
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,300
Mazette! 

57
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,800
Which is its source? 

58
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Its history. 
ll comes from O? 

59
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,600
Of a type which held it 
of its large-m?re. 

60
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,500
I have déj? heard that. 

61
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,700
I will put 
my best expert above. 

62
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,000
Shannon will give you a receipt. 

63
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,400
Thank you to have chosen our house. 

64
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,600
I believe that that is there. 

65
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,100
I believe. 

66
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,500
Beautiful match. 

67
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
How is Rick ? 

68
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,100
I know anything of it. I did not speak to him. 
It is finished. 

69
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,500
Does Ca make how much? 
Six weeks and half? 

70
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Seven. 

71
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,400
You count what? 

72
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,700
One could ... 

73
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
- What? 
- One could leave. 

74
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,000
One leaves all the time. 

75
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,500
One leaves all the time, 
but ' ' one does not leave together ' '. 

76
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,200
Josh, you are my best friend. 

77
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,100
It is hard to find one of them. 

78
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,600
I do not want to waste that. 
You will find somebody well. 

79
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I know the song. 

80
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
You know why? 

81
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,300
I am afraid to lose the little which I have. 
Including you. 

82
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,200
Restaurant and movies? 

83
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
And hot dog and match? 

84
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,800
One ensures, hein? 

85
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
I will wet myself. 

86
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,600
I will throw you a fate, Alex. 

87
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,100
Ca will go can -?tre. 

88
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,900
One sees oneself later. 

89
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,300
I will be at the laboratory. 

90
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,700
Thinks? what I said. 

91
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,600
An opal of fire of this size. 

92
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
It is splendid. 

93
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,000
It be-?-statement? 

94
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,300
Excellent translucidity. 

95
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,000
No coloured trails. 

96
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,100
It is single. 

97
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,800
Which beautiful word. 
I adore this word. 

98
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,300
' ' Single ' '. 

99
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,400
Ca must be worth its price. 

100
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,600
I salivate. 
You submit a report/ratio to me. 

101
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,800
Nick? Goes you in. 

102
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
What is it? 

103
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,300
You awoke me. 

104
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,100
You awoke me. 

105
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,500
What? 

106
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,100
I did not hear you, 
you frightened me. 

107
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,100
Which is the verdict? 

108
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
I believe 
that there is something of odd. 

109
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
Does Ca change the value? 

110
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,700
I must make other analyses. 

111
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,000
How, physics? 

112
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,500
- Something? interior? 
- Exact. 

113
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,600
I am not a gemmologist. 

114
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,700
I could analyze the spectrum 

115
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,300
with the infra-reds. 

116
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
Now? 

117
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Wait... 

118
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,300
I have initially a connery? to make 
for Pr Leiber. 

119
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,400
I make it d?s that I can. 

120
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,000
You remainders? 

121
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,100
Not, I have the training of the girls. 

122
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,900
It is significant. 

123
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,400
Keep me informed. 

124
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
You are the best. 
I will revaudrai you that. 

125
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
And our dinner? 

126
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Pauses. 

127
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,100
You know why you did not mark? 

128
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,800
Miss of calms. 

129
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,800
You all can mark 
if you have time, 

130
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,300
if you aim. 

131
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,000
But that goes quickly a match. 

132
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,400
One wants to take the ball to you. 
Therefore, you owe?tre calms. 

133
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,800
No the body. Of spirit. 

134
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,700
If a opportunity arises, 
you forget the remainder. 

135
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,900
Time, other players 
do not exist any more. 

136
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,300
Only you and the basket. 

137
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,300
You see it, you find it. 

138
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,400
You launch. 

139
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,600
Laser places from there for analysis. 

140
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,800
You pack it as you want. 

141
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
It is what that? 

142
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,000
You awoke me. 

143
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,300
End of the scanning. 

144
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,900
End of the scanning! 

145
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,000
We transform lead into gold, 
then leave a message. 

146
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,700
Josh, it is Alex, 
you are L? 

147
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Something of odd 
has just arrived to me... 

148
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,300
ll has somebody there? 

149
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,100
Is the pain terrible? 

150
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,000
I can help you. 

151
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,100
And to relieve your sufferings. 

152
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,800
You do not have qu '? to ask. 

153
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,400
Do you want that your pain ceases? 

154
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,800
If such is your wish. 

155
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,900
Release me! 

156
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,200
I am sorry. 

157
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,700
lnspector Nathanson. 

158
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,000
You?tes? 

159
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,400
Alex Amberson. 

160
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,300
You knew it... Josh? 

161
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,900
It was my best friend. 

162
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,400
I am sorry. 

163
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,600
You want to sit down? 

164
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,100
Not What did it occur? 

165
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,100
Undoubtedly an accident 
D? with the material. 

166
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,400
ll worked on what? 

167
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,100
ll analyzed 

168
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
a gemmeous stone. 

169
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,700
An opal. 

170
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,200
For me. 

171
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,200
Help a former child of chorus. 

172
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,000
If you do not have a currency, 
I accept the tickets. 

173
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,100
I await you L?. 

174
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,600
Still L? 

175
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,100
Is not necessary to leave the customers alone. 

176
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,500
Keep your councils for you, 

177
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,900
salt tramp. 

178
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,500
I m?ne the life that I want, salt idiot. 

179
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,200
I will speak? who I want. 
The pavement does not belong to you. 

180
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,200
But it belongs to me this pavement. 

181
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,600
Because I pay taxes. 

182
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,500
I you emmerde! 

183
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,500
Me, I you emmerde! 

184
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,900
Cr?ve, bag? shit! 

185
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,100
I esp?re that you go claquer 
in the gutter 

186
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,800
so that I piss you above. 

187
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,800
Baboon bald person! 

188
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,000
Dyed of piss 
wire of partouzarde Chinese! 

189
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,700
ldiot informed! 

190
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,200
' ' the pavement belongs to me, 
I pay taxes.'' 

191
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,200
You know O? you can put them 
your taxes! 

192
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,100
I esp?re that you will burst kidneys. 

193
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,300
That you will rot in hell, 
and that... 

194
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,400
Who it is that? 

195
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,500
A friend, can -?tre. 

196
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,100
Say to me... 

197
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,400
You think really all 

198
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,000
these curses? 

199
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,500
I want, ouais. 

200
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,500
What you would make 
so that they are carried out? 

201
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,300
I have that a cig 
and a handshake. 

202
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,200
Not all? fact. 
You have a heart. 

203
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,700
I exchange it against a shower 
and of the Daniels Jack. 

204
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,200
The death of your enemy 
is our market. 

205
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,500
You?tes well f?lé. 

206
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,600
But I love how you think. 

207
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,600
Please to me this. 

208
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,600
Of which mani?re? 

209
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,600
Find an idea. 

210
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,300
And it enjoys. 

211
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,500
ll should have cancer. 

212
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,400
To have cancer and to burst. 

213
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,600
If such is your wish. 

214
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,600
Ch?ques of allowances... 

215
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,100
Does Eh, that go? 

216
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
- does Ca go? 
- I do not know. 

217
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Leave it. 

218
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Was Ca worth the sorrow of it? 

219
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Run, insect. 

220
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Run to tell what you want. 

221
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,300
Say to them that something is released. 

222
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,300
Something which nourishes wishes. 

223
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
Say to them quickly. 

224
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,100
As long as you have a heart. 

225
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,600
If you do not like, 

226
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
crush it. 

227
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
I am sorry for Josh. 

228
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,100
You were so close. 

229
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Not as close as he wanted. 
And now... 

230
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
Listen, 

231
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,600
it is not your fault. 

232
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,100
If, I believe. 

233
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,500
What? 

234
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,200
Something was odd 
in this opal. 

235
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,100
It is that which has D? to explode. 

236
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,800
What I gave him killed. 

237
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,400
You know what you say? 

238
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,100
I know that it is nutcase, 
it is that the probl?me. 

239
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,900
You want that I recall 
Dr. Montiglio? 

240
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,200
I smell myself well. 

241
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,800
I am just shaken. 

242
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,800
Not, you imagine things 
like the derni?re time. 

243
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,800
Doesn't that have anything? to see. 

244
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,700
Will lay down you instead of you to worry. 

245
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Arr?te the number of the older sister. 

246
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,600
The fire, it is past. 
And you saved me. 

247
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,600
I did not save dad and mom. 

248
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,700
Not. 

249
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,500
You could not. 

250
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,800
It is as for Josh, 
it is not your fault. 

251
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,400
Arr?te to make feel guilty 
if not that will start again. 

252
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,900
Therapy, nightmares, 
all. 

253
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,600
Not. 

254
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,200
It is different. 

255
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,800
ll occurs something. 

256
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
Something of low register. 

257
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,400
I will find what it is. 

258
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,500
A part, Alex? 

259
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,500
I feel your fear. 

260
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,500
I seek certain Etchison. 

261
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,800
- ll arrives. 
- It is him? 

262
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,900
Mr. Etchison? 

263
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,800
Call me as you will want. 

264
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,700
I do not have time to play. 

265
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,300
It is idiot. 
One could have fun. 

266
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,000
Let us speak rather about the opal. 

267
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Invaluable stone. 

268
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,600
I do not see. 

269
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,100
Your friend Clegg, him, 
tr?s saw well. 

270
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,400
Do not know. 

271
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
50 years, 
it holds the pawnshop, 

272
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,900
and will denounce you in the event of continuations. 

273
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,800
It is what the probl?me? 
You?tes cop? 

274
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,900
lls will remain outwards 
if you say all to me. 

275
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,400
On the statue. Apr?s the accident. 
You saw the infos. 

276
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,000
- a type died. 
- That of Beaumont? 

277
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,500
Do I know? 
The type 

278
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,300
who bought was L?. 

279
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,000
Clegg spun me 200 $. 
I was made entuber? 

280
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,100
Royally. 

281
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,800
ACClDENT OF The DOCKS 
FAlT A DEATH 

282
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,500
Alexandra. 
Which joy of re-examining you. 

283
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Which sad news, Mr. Beaumont. 

284
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,100
lrremplaçable. 
Single in its kind. 

285
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,200
We speak about ED Finney, 
your assistant? 

286
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,200
Well s?r. 

287
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,200
If you allow, I would like to pose to you 
some questions. 

288
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,500
All that you will want. 

289
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,100
Is the press interested more? the accident, 
the workman of the crane... 

290
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,600
This drunk pig. 

291
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,800
qu '? the statue it-m?me. 
Was it encrusted with stones? 

292
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,400
Without ornament. 
Like Ahura Mazda. 

293
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,800
It was made 
apr?s conversion? the lslam. 

294
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,000
I want to show you something. 

295
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,000
That will interest you. 

296
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,800
Jerk! 

297
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,200
My room of the Lost Gods. 

298
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,800
Formerly venerated, forgotten today. 

299
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,200
Each culture of antiquity. 

300
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,100
Look at,

301
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,800
the reserved place 
for Ahura Mazda. 

302
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,600
Who is exactly Ahura Mazda? 

303
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,900
I collect 

304
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,500
objects, 
not theologies which they represent. 

305
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,100
It was a divinity 
religion zoroastrienne. 

306
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
A beneficial god? 

307
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,700
Undoubtedly. 

308
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,900
Nevertheless the legend known as 

309
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:35,400
that the opposite force was in fact 
its own shade. 

310
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,300
ll was thus to some extent 
the source of the evil. 

311
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,100
Contact somebody? the University. 

312
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,000
A brilliant woman 
who worked for me. 

313
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,100
She can help you. With condition 
that it is of good mood. 

314
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,400
Who is the pet of the professor? 

315
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,200
What do you make in the black? 

316
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,900
Who ?tes you? 

317
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,600
This would be something 
what don't you wish to see? 

318
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,400
Tr?s well. 

319
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,200
My eyes! 

320
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,700
I do not see anything. 

321
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,000
Bastard. 

322
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,600
Alex, that does occur? 

323
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,200
Excuse me. 

324
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,000
I do not know. 

325
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,400
You lost consciousness. 
You want to drink? 

326
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,100
Water? 

327
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,500
Ca goes. 

328
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,000
Ca owes?tre the stress. 

329
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,100
Ca goes, sinc?rement. 

330
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,300
Sinc?rement? 

331
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,800
I esp?re to see you restored 

332
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,800
for my evening. 

333
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,500
That planned for f?ter 
my acquisition. 

334
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,700
Your owner received the invitations. 

335
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,700
You and your sister 
?tes welcomes. 

336
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,700
It would be with pleasure ... 

337
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,100
but I will undoubtedly be occupied. 

338
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,100
Still ... 

339
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Wait ... 

340
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,300
Move back of a m?tre. 

341
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,000
The red tape, one will see tomorrow. 
I am occupied. 

342
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,900
Yes Well. 

343
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,300
You must make error. 

344
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,200
I am Alex. 
Did R. Beaumont warn you? 

345
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,300
Which fieffé jerk that-L?. 

346
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,600
It is not your probl?me. 
Except if you work with him. 

347
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,700
Or sleep with him. 

348
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Voil? who shows 
that you have go?t good. 

349
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,500
A little ... Not. 

350
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
Ca does not go. At the bottom. 

351
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,800
What can I for you? 

352
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,900
Nothing if I do not have 
all your attention. 

353
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,100
I like you. 

354
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,200
I am m?lée 
? this coproduction. 

355
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,400
The folklore it is my ray, 
not the theatre. 

356
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,700
D?s which Pr Benson is L?, 
I run away myself. 

357
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,500
One spoke about Pierre of Secret Fire 

358
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,600


359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
359 
00 :37 :17,000 -- > 00:37:20,900 
A wizard would have locked up 
a spirit malefic? interior. 

360
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,500
A spirit malefic? 

361
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,800
A creature residing between the worlds. 

362
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,100
A Djinn. 

363
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,500
A genius? 

364
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,100
Forget what one says of the Djinn. 

365
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,900
Forget Robin Williams. 

366
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,800
For former Arabic, 
a Djinn was not nice nor funny. 

367
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,300
It was other thing. 

368
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,600
The face of the fear. 

369
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,900
Does Ca give what? 

370
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,900
Say it to me. 

371
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,500
You approve. 

372
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,500
You want to test another thing? 
More adjusted? 

373
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,800
I do not like?tre tight. 
I had enough of it. 

374
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,500
Tr?s well. Follow me. 

375
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,100
With pleasure. 

376
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,300
Esp?ces or chart, Mister ...? 

377
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,200
Demarest. Nathaniel Demarest. 

378
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,500
Call Me Nathaniel. 

379
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,600
Nathaniel, esp?ces or chart? 

380
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,200
What do you prefer? 

381
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,100
Esp?ces. 

382
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,700
It is done. 

383
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,000
It is my first day 
in your world. 

384
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,400
I like that the beauty is inalterable. 

385
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,300
You do not fear 
what yours fades? 

386
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,300
That your mirror tells you 
a sad history? 

387
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,300
I think... that it is the life. 

388
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,300
It is our batch? all. 

389
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,700
Not. 

390
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,300
Ask. 

391
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,700
And you will see. 

392
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,000
Ask that cease the decline. 

393
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,000
Known as: ' ' I want?tre beautiful? never.'' 

394
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,000
I want?tre beautiful? never. 

395
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,800
Delighted by treat with you. 

396
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,000
I will find you soon. 

397
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,500
Do you want that that is given? 

398
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,400
I am sorry. 

399
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,200
I wanted just to show 
my costume. 

400
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,200
Ca makes sufficiently fear. 
Will repeat.

401
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,600
Does Ca go? 

402
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,000
The Djinn, singular and plural word, 

403
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,500
were created apr?s the Angels, 
but before the Man. 

404
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,500
Magic and malefic. 

405
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,300
Maléfiques? 

406
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,100
Do the geniuses exaucent the wishes, not? 

407
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,200
It is their duty. But their real goal 
is to adapt the world. 

408
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,300
Me was told... 

409
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,600
fables. 

410
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,100
The faith passed in the tales. 

411
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,500
Our terrors are camouflaged 

412
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,000
in history of magic lamps 
to rock our children. 

413
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,100
Old accounts 
are darker. 

414
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,600
Much more. 

415
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,400
The Djinn represents all our fears. 

416
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,500
A race of?tres inhuman 
who wants us evil. 

417
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,800
More powerful than we could 
to imagine, 

418
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,900
guided by an insatiable ill will. 

419
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,700
lnspector Nathanson? 

420
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,600
You?tes chargé d' affaires Aickman. 

421
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,100
I was it. 

422
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,900
The business is classified, 
at least side homicide. 

423
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,900
With less 
of information. 

424
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,700
It is you who will inform me. 

425
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,400
- What do you want to know? 
- Little thing. 

426
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,500
The address of a certain Alexandra. 

427
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,600
Why I would give it to you? 

428
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,400
In what that does concern you? 

429
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,500
What do you look at? 

430
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,100
This type... 
is guilty of all the sins. 

431
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,600
7 times released. 

432
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,100
Ca returns to me sick. 
You know what I would like? 

433
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,300
Say to me. 

434
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,100
Just once, 
I would like to wedge this jerk 

435
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,200
for homicide, 
in front of everyone. 

436
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,100
Eh, you! 

437
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,500
Pierre of Secret Fire 

438
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,300
created to deliver the people perse 
of the Djinn 

439
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,400
is also a curse, 

440
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,000
because it is a door between the worlds. 

441
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,900
Grace? it, a Djinn can project 
its race in our reality 

442
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,800
and to dominate humanity. 

443
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,500
The Djinn charges initially Pierre 
human hearts 

444
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,900
of which a wish... 

445
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,900
ll activates it by finding the human one 
who awoke, 

446
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,900
by granting 3 wishes to him. 

447
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,400
The capacity of the Djinn is limited 

448
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,500
? the achievement of the wishes. 

449
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,000
It is closed. 

450
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,700
I seek an employee. 

451
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,200
- ll has only the owner there. 
- Perfect, I want to speak to him. 

452
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Later, appointments. 

453
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,800
You become razor. 

454
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,100
Open 

455
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,300
the door. 

456
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,400
OK. Goes you in. 

457
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,000
Push yourself of L?. 

458
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,200
R?ve, jerk. 

459
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,200
It is frustrating 
that an unlimited capacity serf 

460
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,300
only when one larva 
ask something. 

461
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,900
I know anything of it 
and I have anything of it? foutre. 

462
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,300
Ask me a thing. 

463
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,800
I want that you leave. 

464
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,800
I must enter. 

465
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,400
Would be necessary to pass to me? through. 

466
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,600
And I would like to see that. 

467
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,500
What do you make L? 

468
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,800
The guard opened to me. 

469
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
Could you help me? 

470
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,300
I seek Alexandra Amberson. 

471
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,100
It is its day of rest. 
Who?tes you? 

472
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,800
Somebody until it waits. 

473
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Could you give me his address. 

474
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
If she knows you, 
why you do not have it? 

475
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,700
I said that it awaits me, 
not that she knows me. 

476
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,800
Then, made that by ' ' e-mail '', 
because 

477
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,400
I can nothing give you. 

478
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,700
- You include/understand? 
- Perfectly. 

479
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,600
Would you know O? she is? 

480
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,200
Yes. 

481
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,800
- would you say it to Me? 
- Not. 

482
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,000
It is a pi?ce of value. 

483
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,200
Really? 

484
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,900
You would like that it is worth 
1 00 times more? 

485
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,200
If I want that it is worth 
1 00 times more? Yes. 

486
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,700
You?tes David Copperfield? 
How do you make? 

487
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,800
Secrecy of family. 

488
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,100
O? is Alexandra? 

489
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,000
I am sorry, that me g?ne 

490
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,300
to say it to you. 

491
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,200
What would help you? 
Say it. 

492
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,700
Which limit? 

493
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,000
Your imagination. 

494
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,700
I am not covetous. 
A million dollars? 

495
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,300
It is done. 

496
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,100
Let us see that. 

497
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,100
The recipient is not mentioned. 

498
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,000
Which idiot. 
It is my son, Nick. 

499
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,200
ll directs prestigious 
cabinet of expertise. 

500
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,300
Good flight.

501
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,200
Hello, you. 

502
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,300
What do you make? 

503
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,600
I learn the r?gles from a play. 

504
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,400
I return expr?s early 
and you are not m?me not pr?te. 

505
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,000
Tennis shoe. 

506
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,100
I did not pay attention. 

507
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,900
Give me one second. 

508
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,900
Super! 
5 minutes of pause. 

509
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,100
Calms, Miss Amberson. 
I made as you said. 

510
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,800
Pass by again to me your portable. 

511
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,900
Who is this woman, initially? 

512
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,700
The responder! 

513
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,700
Pr Derleth, it is still Alex. 

514
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,600
I must absolutely speak to you. 
Recall me. 

515
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,100
Forgiveness. 

516
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,100
Can I use your portable? 

517
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,600
I will pay the call. 

518
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,100
It is good. 

519
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,600
Voil?. Like that 

520
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,000
you will not fall. 

521
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,600
Nobody. 

522
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,700
Practical, isn't this? 

523
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,200
I require what is D?. 

524
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,800
lnspector Nathanson. 
We must speak. 

525
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,500
A type sought you. 

526
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,600
You only 
can put an end? their pain. 

527
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,500
You only can release them. 

528
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,900
Patience, my friends. 

529
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,700
Patience. 

530
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,700
I can enter? 

531
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:02,100
Pierre is charged by the heart 
people, by their fears. 

532
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,400
The Djinn seeks me. 

533
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,000
This is not a little incredible 
with the 20?me si?cle? 

534
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,600
Small glass, can -?tre? 

535
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,900
Me, if. 

536
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,900
Isn't movable beautiful? 

537
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,000
Your owner would like. 

538
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,500
I did not speak to you about him. 

539
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,600
Not? 

540
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,100
How I know it? 

541
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,200
By Beaumont? 

542
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,100
It is him. 

543
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,500
I will say to you. 

544
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,300
You?tes? the search for magic, 
of charm 

545
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,600
to disencumber you 
of a hypothetical Djinn. 

546
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,600
lls existed certainly. 

547
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,300
- You are cold? 
- Ca goes. 

548
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,800
Heating? 

549
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,000
Not Continue. 

550
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,300
O? in was I? 

551
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,000
Charms, wizard... 

552
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,100
You?tes born in an age of reason. 
The age of Science. 

553
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,400
All the wizards died, 

554
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,700
and all the charms are lost. 

555
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,200
The Djinn... 

556
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,400
If there existed, 

557
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,400
would be what was. 

558
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,100
lmaginez. 

559
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,800
The only magic element 
of a rationalist world. 

560
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,000
A vulnerable world incrédule. 

561
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,600
O? no Reason 
would never save you. 

562
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,000
Nor no Science. 

563
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,000
ll would take good time, not? 

564
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,800
It is not a joke. 

565
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,200
It is not funny. 

566
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,700
You are hungry? 

567
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,200
I am not hungry, not thirst. 
Why?tes you so attentive? 

568
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,500
I am sorry. 

569
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,000
I am tended a little. 

570
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,300
I believe. 

571
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,600
But that goes. 

572
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,700
O? in were we? 

573
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,300
No charms. 

574
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,700
No the hope. 

575
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,400
If there is no hope, charms, 

576
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,900
I must count on me. 

577
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,500
To face a creature 
bottom of time. 

578
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,500
To measure itself 
with the Prince of the Empire of the Shade. 

579
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,200
To measure your brain of the 20?me si?cle 

580
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,200
? that which crossed space 
between the worlds, 

581
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,600
and pressed the wings of the Angels. 

582
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,000
You make my joy, really. 

583
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,800
I am delighted. 

584
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,300
I wounded you. 
I am sorry. 

585
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,500
I will catch up with myself. 

586
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,600
What can I make? 

587
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,500
I go there. 

588
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,700
Sit down! 

589
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,100
Please. 

590
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,000
You sit. 

591
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,200
O? is Wendy? 

592
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,400
In the room. 
Avoid going there. 

593
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,700
I needed his face. 

594
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,100
You killed it. 

595
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,100
I cannot kill anybody. 
Except if it is what they want. 

596
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,400
You owe the knowledge. 

597
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,400
It did not want to die, 

598
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,700
salt lying shit! 

599
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,600
I showed him my true face. 
It did not like. 

600
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,300
It became hysterical.

601
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,400
I asked him 

602
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,600
if she wanted?tre delivered 
of its fear. 

603
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,900
They is dangerous to know you. 

604
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,500
Your enquiring friend. 
Your owner. 

605
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,600
The police officer. Wendy. 

606
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,900
By the way, 

607
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,000
O? is your delicious small sister 
today? 

608
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,700
You make him evil, 

609
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,000
I kill to you. 

610
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,900
Save to me, my child. 

611
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,500
Here my true nature. 

612
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,800
Ca is likely to hurt. 

613
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,200
Let us stop. 

614
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,400
Formulate your wishes. 

615
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,900
Three wishes. 

616
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,200
You are not intrigued? 

617
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,800
All that you want. 

618
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,500
- All? 
- of me all Requires. 

619
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,300
I will grant it to you. 

620
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,100
A voyage on the moon, 
in Egypt of the Pharaons. 

621
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,100
If I want your death? 

622
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,000
As it is original. 

623
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,400
I will grant a free wish to you. 

624
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,700
A sample. 
For?tre in environment. 

625
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,500
I want that you destroy yourselves. 

626
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,700
Make you jump the brain. 
Now. 

627
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,800
Well. 

628
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,800
What is eternal cannot die. 

629
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,000
If that can comfort you, 
that made an evil of dog. 

630
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,700
Formulate your three wishes. 

631
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,300
ll is always necessary to know 
its adversary. 

632
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,800
I will make a wish. 

633
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,400
I would like... 

634
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,400
to know what you?tes. 

635
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,300
What do you make? 

636
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,500
I exauce your wish. 

637
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,500
You want to know what I am. 

638
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,600
For you, I am that. 

639
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,000
The cry of the abandoned child. 

640
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,300
The rail of the whipped b?te. 

641
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,400
The face which scans you 

642
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,800
bottom of the shade. 

643
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,100
The vacuum in the heart 

644
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,500
of your hopes, Alexandra. 

645
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,700
I am despair. 

646
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,900
Do not make any wish. 

647
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,900
Then, you like me? 

648
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,800
I did not want that. 
You owe?tre outside, not here. 

649
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,000
I am dependent? what I bind. 

650
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,300
Locked up in what I lock up. 

651
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,600
I did not want that. 

652
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,300
Formulate your wishes more prudently. 

653
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,000
Leave your sister alone. 

654
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,300
T'en do not make, 
I will hold company to him. 

655
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,300
Leave it. 

656
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,200
ll is necessary it. 

657
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,700
The pain of the liked?tres 
is tr?s persuasive. 

658
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,700
Ask me to return. 

659
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:17,100
I would like?tre at home. 
Without you! 

660
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,500
Shannon, O? you are? 
ll is necessary to leave from here. 

661
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,300
I SUlS AT BEAUMONT. 
REJOlNS Us. SHANNON. 

662
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,100
You made two wishes. 
We are now dependent. 

663
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,800
O? what do you go, O? that you would be, 
I will find you. 

664
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,700
I you emmerde! 

665
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,300
You go by L? 

666
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,700
Forgiveness, you?tes invited? 

667
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,600
Help me. 
This type is dangerous, 

668
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,400
it broke my windshield 
and desired to kill me. 

669
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:19,800
Forgiveness, Mister. 
?tes you waited by Mr. Beaumont? 

670
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,000
I asked you a question. 

671
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,400
If I am awaited? Yes. 

672
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,700
I owe it? Mr. Beaumont. 

673
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:34,200
Tr?s well, but that does not have the air 
of an invitation. 

674
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,500
I make fun about it. 
You push. 

675
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,000
I go?tre tr?s clearly. 

676
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,100
If you?tes not on the list, 
you do not enter. 

677
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,700
I know this kind-L?. 

678
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,300
You?tes never fallen 
on one of my kind. 

679
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,300
I will enter. 
And you will let me pass. 

680
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,400
It is clear, gatekeeper? 

681
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,900
Gatekeeper? I am called Valentine. 

682
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,100
Johnny Valentine. 

683
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,100
That which will make you 

684
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,900
to lose an eye. 

685
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,100
Forgive my ardour. 

686
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,500
Haste to finish the play distorted 
my judgement. Let us make a market. 

687
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,100
I do not do anything. 

688
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,200
What will you make, then? 

689
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,700
This evening, 
I transfer the jerks of the receptions. 

690
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,800
And tomorrow? 

691
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,600
You cannot do only that? 

692
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,100
You did only that. 

693
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,100
You wished another thing. 

694
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:37,400
Tell me the truth. You will not be 
ever tired of this work? 

695
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,200
Escape towards another trade. 

696
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,500
Which report/ratio that has with you? 

697
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,300
Ca has one of them. 

698
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:49,400
Seized your chance. Answer? my question. 

699
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,600
Would you like to escape? 

700
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,200
If such is your wish.

701
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,700
Houdini put 2' 30 ' '. 

702
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,600
Forgiveness. 

703
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:41,800
Afflicted. 

704
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,400
What do you make? 

705
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,100
- I want to leave you L?. 
- I Releases. 

706
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,700
One must leave. 
Trust me. 

707
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:05,200
Not. You did not see 
the new friend of Beaumont. 

708
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,900
You remember the type of the tennis shoe? 

709
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:20,200
I was? reception of Cindy 
when they announced their divorce. 

710
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,100
One spoke about it during one year. 

711
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,600
Really? 

712
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,900
One spoke about that of a prince 
during si?cles. 

713
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,600
It entered the history? 

714
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,200
I would like a reception like that. 

715
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,900
If such is your wish. 

716
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,000
You see? through me. 

717
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,600
My God! 

718
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,200
Not yet, human. 

719
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,200
Soon ... I will be it soon. 

720
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,500
Buckle the périm?tre! 

721
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,600
ll remains us 

722
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,900
a thing? to finish. 

723
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,700
One will remain L about it?. 

724
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,300
Listen to their cries, my child. 

725
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,300
Listen to the melody of their torment. 

726
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,500
Refuse! 

727
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,900
You can save them, Alexandra. 

728
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,500
If such is your wish. 

729
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,300
I do not want. I cannot. 

730
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,800
Is my patience? boils. 

731
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,000
You will do what? 
To kill me? 

732
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,000
And the 3?me wish? 

733
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:53,500
I do not require that you would have died, 

734
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,900
only that you wish the?tre. 

735
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:06,900
Run ... 

736
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,800
- What does it occur? 
- O? is Shannon? 

737
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,800
You saw it? 

738
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,700
Come. 
One tries to control the situation. 

739
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,400
Do not remain L? 

740
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,200
ll arrives! 

741
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:56,300
ll is not necessary to remain L?. 
One will not leave oneself there ! 

742
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,900
More exits. 

743
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,800
More folds. More excuses. 

744
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,700
Say your wish. 

745
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,400
I do not have any. 

746
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,300
Really? 

747
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,800
M?me by seeing ultimate the pi?ce 
Beaumont collection? 

748
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,400
Final bouquet. 

749
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,100
One of my masterpieces. 

750
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,000
lntitulé: ' ' My sister, 

751
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,000
why did you give up me? '' 

752
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,900
Rather resembling? 

753
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,900
I like especially 

754
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,400
this glance of b?te tracked. 

755
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,000
Salt son of vicious whore! 

756
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,400
You do not approve ? 

757
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,400
Tr?s well. To release! 

758
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,400
You am to me? 

759
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,100
In the absence of victory, let us br?lons them. 

760
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,600
A memory? 

761
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:08,000
Say your wish. 

762
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,100
I advise to you to make quickly. 

763
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,800
Calm ... 

764
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,300
I would like ... 

765
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,100
I would like ... 

766
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,600
Continue ... 

767
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,200
Calm ... 

768
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,300
I would like that Mickey Torelli 
did not drink 2 days ago. 

769
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,700
It is impossible! 

770
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,200
Not by ... 

771
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,600
you! 

772
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,600
You badly fell. 

773
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,400
You?tes come 
in person 

774
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,400
Mr. Beaumont. 

775
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,400
All is in order. 

776
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,000
I awaited it 1 0 years. 

777
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,000
Mickey, pay to! 

778
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:52,100
They is not coconuts, 
it is an pre-Islamic trick! 

779
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,500
Then, mollo! 

780
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,500
Included/understood! 

781
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,400
Ca will make a charming gift 
engagement. 

782
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,100
At least. 

783
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,700
You are late. 

784
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,700
I give you 2000 of them. 

785
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,600
One does what this evening? 

786
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:37,700
' ' On' '? 

787
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,500
What is there, Josh? 

788
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,000
You are afraid of the complications? 

789
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,200
You know ... 

790
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,600
that will help you, that. 

791
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,700
Does Ca help you?

O? does one go this evening?

Restaurant and movies.

With me? 

795
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,400
I had rather thought 

796
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,200
hot dog and match. 

797
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,400
You smell yourself well?
