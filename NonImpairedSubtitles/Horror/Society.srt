1
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,518
Bill?

2
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,473
It's like a nightmare...

3
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,574
Last night?

4
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,480
...my life.

5
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:29,002
Are you scared?

6
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:32,874
I get scared.

7
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,615
Of what?

8
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:40,834
My parents, ah, my sister.

9
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:46,488
You.

10
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:50,621
Why?

11
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:55,406
I don't know.

12
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:02,584
I feel like something's
going to happen...

13
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:09,197
...and if I scratch the surface there'll
be something terrible underneath.

14
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:13,415
It is perfectly normal
to experience a certain...

15
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,643
...irrational fear.

16
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:19,644
It's no more than a phase.

17
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,683
It will pass, I assure you.

18
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,523
Come and get it, Milo!

19
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:22,439
Is that confidence or what?

20
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:26,050
- A matter of good breeding Milo.
- Yeah you're Mr Perfect!

21
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:29,270
You'll probably end up
assassinating the President.

22
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:32,748
You have one warped sense of humor,
you know that?

23
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,663
Blanchard!

24
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,406
Jenny!

25
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:48,494
What?

26
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:50,322
Blanchard is here!

27
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:53,889
Damn it, Bill, you know I can't see him.

28
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,455
Will you get rid of him for me, please?

29
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:57,891
What are brothers for, huh?

30
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:12,583
- Let go of me!
- I'm sorry about this, I didn't mean!

31
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,149
Just give me a minute, I can explain this!

32
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:16,716
Jenny, come on!

33
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:17,717
Listen to me!

34
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:22,152
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I know how this looks!

35
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:27,198
Get out! Get out!

36
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,636
- Something very weird is going on here!
- Oh, no shit

37
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:36,204
I have to talk to you

38
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,379
I didn't know you had to hide
in a closet to talk.

39
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:41,247
- Bill, she's playing games with me, man.
I'm serious! - Liar!

40
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,338
Jen... Bill...

41
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,818
David, why do you keep bothering
my daughter?

42
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,430
- Mrs. Whitney, I just want to talk to her.
- Please, please...

43
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,256
...just leave!

44
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:56,257
C'mon Blanchard.

45
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:00,651
All right. I...

46
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,047
What's going on here, guys?

47
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:11,961
Oh, it was nothing, Dad.

48
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:13,396
It's okay, Daddy.

49
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:18,092
I thought we weren't going
to see David Blanchard any more.

50
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,399
Yes, Daddy.

51
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,532
You should be getting ready.

52
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:26,793
You know Judge Carter
will be there tonight.

53
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,708
I'm almost ready know.

54
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:33,103
Oh, ah...

55
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:34,494
Bill...

56
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,363
Wasn't that Milo outside?

57
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:39,410
Yeah, yeah,
he was just goin to take me to the...

58
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,324
...ah the game.

59
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:56,852
- You okay?
- Sure!

60
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,159
So you want to tell me
what's going on with Blanchard?

61
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,118
I don't know, jealous I guess.
He just wasn't the right sort for me.

62
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:08,425
Could you zip me up Billy?

63
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:18,343
Something wrong?

64
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,564
Ah, no, no
It's just a little damp.

65
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,174
Well, I'm not taking another shower.

66
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,522
Yeah.

67
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,916
But I'm really sorry
that I'm going to miss your coming out.

68
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:38,439
What a coincidence
the way things turn out, huh?

69
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:43,006
Yeah, come on, basketball's much more important
than a stupid coming out party.

70
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:46,314
Besides, I have already been dating
for years. Joke.

71
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:48,228
Yeah.

72
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,969
We are...

73
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:54,230
...the one!

74
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,014
We are the one!

75
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,016
We are the one!

76
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,712
All right!

77
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:06,019
The hero, the best player,
our hero...

78
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,410
...Bill Whitney!

79
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,456
All right!

80
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:15,327
Isn't he wonderful?

81
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,069
You are for the girls!

82
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:21,635
We are number one!

83
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:28,944
They are just using
their athletic ability to get the votes...

84
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,684
...of the childish morons
in this audience.

85
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:36,252
Looks to me like you just lost
the moron vote Marty.

86
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:46,126
Alright!
Hey, let's carry on with the debate!

87
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:52,433
Candidate Whitney, you may respond
concerning the proposed dress code.

88
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,047
Yeah...

89
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:00,874
Well...

90
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,963
We should have a dress code.
I guess.

91
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,011
...and I think we should follow it...

92
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:23,459
...in the most possible, ah strict,
as we possibly can.

93
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:36,370
What I mean is if we can prove
to the administration...

94
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,242
...that a dress code
really is a problem...

95
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:44,852
I mean just imagine everybody walking
around in those idiotic clothes.

96
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:48,550
Like Marty over here
is wearing right now.

97
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:52,595
And I mean everybody.

98
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,814
It would make them think that there
was some kind of a conspiracy.

99
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:08,777
Hey, she's bad news man.

100
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:16,477
The debate and the game, I nailed the
guy, it was a shoe in, the election.

101
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:23,046
Well I'm glad to see you're allowing yourself
some success without sabotaging it.

102
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,743
Let me ask you...

103
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:30,049
...how do you feel about your family
in light of all these recent victories?

104
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:31,485
My family?

105
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,051
Yeah.

106
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:41,186
Ah, nothing.

107
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,970
I mean, I don't think about them,
they don't think about me, we're just...

108
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:48,929
...we're just one big happy family.

109
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:52,844
Except for a little incest and psychosis.

110
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:56,584
Look, I know you're being fishiest...

111
00:12:58,063 --> 00:13:00,325
...but I think you really believe that.

112
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:01,543
No.

113
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:04,023
No, no, I don't.

114
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,416
We are getting along much better now.
Really.

115
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:08,547
Hey...

116
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:12,767
Let's not waste our time bullshitting.

117
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:14,288
All right.

118
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:21,729
They don't approve of me, okay,
they don't accept my friends.

119
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:25,818
They don't talk to me like they do
Jenny.

120
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,776
And they don't even look like me!

121
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:34,213
I told you to teenagers sometimes feel alienated
from those closest to them.

122
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,824
I think I was adopted.

123
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,828
Don't you think
that sounds a little bit paranoid?

124
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:49,046
No, I've never been paranoid.

125
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,873
Just a little bit paranoid.

126
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,440
Within normal ranges.

127
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:59,703
You know, you really deserve
what's going to happen to you.

128
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:01,966
What's going to happen?

129
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:05,272
You're going to make
a wonderful contribution to society.

130
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,810
Jenny!
Hey!

131
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:20,236
I need some sun tan lotion!

132
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:24,021
Jenny!

133
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,935
Oh!

134
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:42,727
Listen, Jenny I'm just going...

135
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,348
God, Bill, what's the matter with you?

136
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:11,741
Get out of here!

137
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,570
I'm sorry, really,
I just came in here to get his.

138
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,353
Get out of here!

139
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:43,673
- Most incredible product we've ever done!
- It was fabulous, did a terrific job

140
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:55,674
Bill?

141
00:15:57,025 --> 00:16:01,287
Ah, yes! The future student body
president of Beverly Hills Academy.

142
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,249
We're so excited about our party
for Judge Carter next week.

143
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:11,554
Well, I'm going to go to the beach today.

144
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,295
When will you be back, son?

145
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,166
- Well, that depends if we go out after...
- Don't be late, darling.

146
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,231
- I love that one, that's really good.
- That's the best product we've ever own.

147
00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:34,262
It's absolutely terrific.

148
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,942
I love you, you know.

149
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:42,513
And, if you really loved me...

150
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:46,298
...you'd get us invited
to Ted Ferguson's party.

151
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:48,821
I can't believe we were left out!

152
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:55,781
Look, he's over there!

153
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,044
Come on, Billy Baby,
couldn't you just go talk to him?

154
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:01,610
Please?

155
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:09,911
Die, alien scum!

156
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:13,712
Jesus! Goddamnit! My hair!

157
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:19,447
Give me that!
Hey, get back here!

158
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:38,629
Don't get too hot.

159
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:24,740
Hey!

160
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,914
It's Whitney...

161
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:27,393
...the wonder boy!

162
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:31,916
Is this part of the beach dress code?

163
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:36,484
Hope you're not bent out of shape,
I'm captain of the debating team.

164
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:38,791
Hey, nothing you do can bend me.

165
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,052
Just remember Whitney we don't lose.

166
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:44,706
What are you going to do,
rig the election or something?

167
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:48,056
We don't have to.
Martin here was born to lead.

168
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:53,580
So, ah, you know
if anything's going on this week?

169
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:54,885
This week?

170
00:19:58,148 --> 00:19:59,887
I can't think of anything.

171
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:05,762
- Well, if you do, let me know, huh.
- I'll send you a telegram.

172
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:16,682
- Yeah, let me know, huh?
- It's my pleasure.

173
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:27,859
Bill!

174
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:31,383
- Blanchard, what's up?
- I've got something you've got to hear.

175
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:34,862
- You were out of line with my sister.
- Oh god! Now look, I'm serious.

176
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:37,036
This is very important.

177
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:39,038
What are you talking about?

178
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:42,562
Not here,
Just come with me to the pier okay.

179
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:44,302
Please!

180
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,179
...paragraph ten...

181
00:20:56,265 --> 00:20:58,005
Dad, something's wrong
with my earring.

182
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:00,050
- Jenny!
- Oh hi, Judge Carter.

183
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:04,313
How is our newest confirmed member
of society this lovely afternoon?

184
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,489
Oh, I'm fine, it's my earring that's not
doing so well.

185
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:10,230
I must say young lady you certainly
added beauty...

186
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:14,056
...to an altogether beautiful coming out
party. Don't you agree, Jim?

187
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,102
Prettiest girl there your honor.
Please, be seated.

188
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:24,019
Well, it's right in the back, by the claps.

189
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,454
Oh, yes...

190
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,586
Seems to be something caught in there.

191
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,680
Top Secret. Eh, Blanchard?

192
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:52,554
Everybody in. All right girls,
don't forget your seatbelts.

193
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:54,991
Wait a minute, that's my family!

194
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,000
Allright now Bill, I know you're going
to be a little upset about this but...

195
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:05,215
...I put a voice activated tape recorder
underneath your parents' car
and a microphone...

196
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:08,651
Are you bugged my family!

197
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:10,389
Just listen to the tape!

198
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:14,523
I remember my own coming out,
I was so excited!

199
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:16,872
Then you can do it with women
as well as men?

200
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:20,699
- Of course!
- You know the schedule, first the dine,
then copulation.

201
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:24,571
Someone your own age first,
then with your mother and me.

202
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:27,572
Then in comes the host.

203
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:31,835
You know, I could hardly keep a straight
face when Bill apologized to me...

204
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:33,357
...about not being able
to make it tonight.

205
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:37,838
Don't be concerned about your brother, Jen.
He's too busy with things in his own world
to worry about us.

206
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:45,147
You really lucked out, Jen!
Ted Ferguson is really cute!

207
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:46,843
Ted Ferguson?!

208
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,647
Yeah, Jenny and Ferguson.
That's just the beginning, here listen

209
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:54,500
Wow! Your boobs are totally sexy!

210
00:22:54,587 --> 00:22:57,980
Guys are going to pop high ones
the second they see you.

211
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:03,036
- I'm a little nervous about it.
- Oh relax Jenny! Just go with it!

212
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,039
It's so much fun
to see how far you can strech!

213
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:10,769
Yeah the hotter and wetter you get,
the more you can do, it's great!

214
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:17,077
It's a microphone.

215
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,338
Let me see...

216
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:25,516
David Blanchard's been bothering
my daughter recently.

217
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:27,996
Following her around, things like that...

218
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:32,779
He's a real electronics wizard.

219
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:35,694
Is that so, Jim?

220
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:41,597
Oh, Ted you're wonderful!

221
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:49,296
Oh, Ted! Oh my God!

222
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,397
Is that him?

223
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:11,297
God! This is excellent!

224
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,931
What the hell are they doing?

225
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:20,978
Come on, you rigged it!

226
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:24,155
What, you've been living with
these people all your life and you
don't know anything about this?!

227
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,111
Shut up!

228
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,305
Come on don't do it!

229
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:34,073
Here's your stupid recorder.

230
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:35,682
Bill, wait!

231
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:45,079
Dr. Cleveland,
you got to listen this tape!

232
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:48,123
- Billy, something happen at home?
- I'm not crazy, this is real!

233
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:52,434
I can't right now, Billy,
but I'll be glad to listen to it later.

234
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:53,769
No, now please.

235
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:55,414
Billy, please, trust me...

236
00:24:55,632 --> 00:25:00,032
... I will call you just as soon as I listen to it
or I'll see you tomorrow.

237
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,347
No, it's okay Billy.

238
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,565
- Give me the tape.
- No!

239
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,568
You still don't trust me?

240
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,831
Are you still afraid of me?

241
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,179
Okay, it's up to you, Billy.

242
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:17,617
If you want to bring
it tomorrow, it's okay.

243
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,880
I, I don't know why I'm afraid, but...

244
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:28,230
Doctor, it's very important.

245
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:30,405
I understand.

246
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:34,103
Listen to it.

247
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,199
Okay, Now listen...

248
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:53,982
Yesterday, after you left the beach,
I heard something.

249
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:57,593
It involved my parents,
my sister and Ted Ferguson.

250
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:00,899
He's not inviting us, is he?

251
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:02,900
I knew it!

252
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:06,685
Just listen to me for a minute here.
And stop worrying about that stupid party!

253
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:09,686
It may seem stupid to you,
but I want to go.

254
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:13,906
Is that all you think about?
Parties and social status?

255
00:26:14,036 --> 00:26:15,776
If you're having problems...

256
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:18,213
...because you're
so big headed and selfish...

257
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,954
...no wonder
no one ever invites us anywhere!

258
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:22,519
Listen...

259
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:27,087
I'm trying to tell you something you know?
You're doing is giving me a bunch of shit!

260
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:31,132
Fine fine! That's just fine!

261
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,744
Is that how you feel about me?

262
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:37,788
Well, I'm just glad that I know it now,
rather than later.

263
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:39,963
I don't know, Billy...

264
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,139
Maybe we should start
seeing other people.

265
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:46,531
Wait a minute, Shauna!

266
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:48,662
Shauna! Wait.

267
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,229
Oh! Man!

268
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,230
Hey, Bill!

269
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,535
Hi, Milo.

270
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,583
Hey dude, I see you got... Oh.

271
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:11,675
- I'm very concerned about you, Billy.
- You listened to the tape?

272
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:15,155
You're aware, aren't you,
that what you're doing is illegal?

273
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:17,287
Yeah, what about what they were
doing?

274
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:20,114
...my father...

275
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:23,028
...my sister and my mother...

276
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:24,898
...together?

277
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:32,686
Everybody in?

278
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,688
- Yes, Dad.
- All right girls, don't forget the seatbelts.

279
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,776
Fast forward a little bit.

280
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:47,823
Oh I remember my own coming out,
God, I was so excited!

281
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,060
You mean I can dance
with anyone I want?

282
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:51,661
Of course.

283
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:53,217
I, what, I don't understand.

284
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:58,342
You know the schedule, first we dine,
then introductions, then you'll be presented.

285
00:27:58,873 --> 00:27:59,961
No, ah, no.

286
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:06,149
- Oh my god! It's so exciting!
- Don't worry, dear, we'll be there to help you.

287
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,356
I felt really bad
that Bill couldn't come.

288
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:10,183
I hope he doesn't fell left out.

289
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:14,535
We're very proud of your brother Jen, it's just
unfortunate that he couldn't be with us.

290
00:28:14,621 --> 00:28:16,405
That's not what I heard!

291
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,019
Bill!

292
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:31,194
Billy!

293
00:28:32,848 --> 00:28:35,153
People are what they are.

294
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:39,240
Now you have to learn to accept that...

295
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:42,894
...and you have to learn
to accept societies rules...

296
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:44,852
...of privacy.

297
00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:49,769
If you don't follow the rules, Billy,
bad things happen.

298
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:53,902
Some people make rules
and some people follow the rules.

299
00:28:53,988 --> 00:28:56,946
It's a question of what you're born to.

300
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:01,863
- I really hate giving you drugs!
- What?

301
00:29:03,516 --> 00:29:04,908
I don't believe this!

302
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:06,865
You can always trust me, Billy.

303
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,474
You got to believe me.

304
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:24,874
Blanchard, I need
another copy of this tape.

305
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:27,136
No, it can't wait!

306
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,094
Yeah...

307
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:32,531
The corner of Roxbury and Wilshire.
Right, okay hurry!

308
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:01,457
It's Blanchard.

309
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,691
Is he dead?

310
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:18,976
Hey!

311
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,543
This isn't a garage sale.

312
00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:25,499
Look, officer. He was a friend.

313
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:30,111
Look! You can't just wander
into the scene of an accident.

314
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,332
- Look, officer, something is definitely wrong here.
- Get the hell out of here!

315
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:39,160
- No, wait a minute, you don't understand...
- Get the hell out of here!

316
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:07,262
Guess what,
telegram came for you.

317
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:12,569
- Listen Jenny, something bad happened today.
- Come on! Don't you want to open it?

318
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,179
Go ahead, read it!

319
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,486
"Mr. William Whitney...

320
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,664
...you're cordially invited to a
party to be given at the
residence of Theodore S. Ferguson..."

321
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,317
Wow!

322
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:35,624
"...this evening 15th of October,
at eight PM.

323
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,538
Cordially attended, tycoon, Ferguson."

324
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:41,713
Sounds like some bash, son.

325
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:45,759
But be careful
on the drinking and driving.

326
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,325
That home is just beautiful!

327
00:32:48,848 --> 00:32:53,590
Maurice Arno did most of the interiors
and he says it's his best work to date.

328
00:32:57,722 --> 00:32:59,592
You just don't understand.
I'm trying to tell you something.

329
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,056
We know all about the
automobile accident, son.

330
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,161
It's terrible, just terrible.

331
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:08,249
Oh, my! It's just awful.

332
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:14,905
I don't think
you quite understand here.

333
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,515
David's dead!

334
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:23,953
- Jenny!
- I know, I'm really going to miss him.

335
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:27,171
That's it, you're really going
to miss him?

336
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:32,218
I know the guy freaked out after
you dumped him, but come on, still.

337
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:35,001
Listen, I'd rather not talk about it.
Please.

338
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:41,091
So, what are you going to wear?

339
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:42,875
You mean to the funeral?

340
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:45,442
No, you weirdo.
To the Ferguson's party!

341
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:48,096
Oh, Ferguson...

342
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:01,308
- Your name is Clarissa, isn't it?
- Uh huh.

343
00:35:04,484 --> 00:35:05,745
Clarissa Carlyn.

344
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:17,880
So where is Shauna?

345
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:22,665
Well...

346
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:26,927
I didn't expect to see her here,
if that's what you mean.

347
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:31,365
That is who
you're going out with right?

348
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:38,239
- Do you know my mom's maiden
name too? - Real or adopted?

349
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,545
Bill!
What happened with Blanchard?

350
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:42,807
Milo, Ferguson invited you?

351
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:44,198
Come on, give me a break.

352
00:35:44,546 --> 00:35:47,417
- I'm not in the mood, all right.
- Whatever turns you on.

353
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:50,246
At least don't turn tricks
to get my kicks.

354
00:35:58,946 --> 00:36:00,555
That was totally uncalled for.

355
00:36:00,643 --> 00:36:02,295
Well, have you seen her mother?

356
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:05,295
Wait, wait, listen, listen.
What happened today with Blanchard?

357
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,689
Hey, I asked you about Blanchard,
you saw it, didn't...

358
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:11,431
I can't deal with that right now, okay?
I've got to go.

359
00:36:22,652 --> 00:36:23,784
Well, Billy.

360
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:28,395
- We need to talk.
- I guess you got my telegram.

361
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:31,048
Sorry it was so much to last minute.

362
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:34,485
I want to talk to you about Blanchard
and my sister Jenny.

363
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:37,052
I thought they broke up.

364
00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:40,401
He really wasn't her type anyway...

365
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:44,185
You are so intense.

366
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:46,187
Just relax!

367
00:36:47,362 --> 00:36:48,623
Enjoy.

368
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:51,581
I want to know
what happened to Blanchard!

369
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:54,193
And I want to know what you did
to my sister in her coming out?

370
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,887
You know the schedule,
first we dined...

371
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:00,280
...then I fucked your sister!

372
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:04,674
And then everybody else
got so turned on, they fucked her too.

373
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,022
And as far as that bagel breath
Blanchard goes...

374
00:37:07,154 --> 00:37:10,025
...I ran that low rent
fool right into a pole!

375
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:12,548
That was a pretty busy week,
don't you think?

376
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:22,162
You stupid!

377
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:30,819
You make waves within,
you're going to drown.

378
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:03,183
Wet dreams?

379
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,794
You're crazy,
do you know what you just did?

380
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,143
No.

381
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,144
But I know what I'm about to.

382
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:12,926
Don't bother, it's his party.

383
00:38:13,535 --> 00:38:15,579
Some day it's going to be my party.

384
00:38:20,669 --> 00:38:23,933
You're in a danger
of loosing this button here.

385
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:28,413
It's only held on by one thread.

386
00:38:29,804 --> 00:38:30,805
Oops!

387
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,415
I told you!

388
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,722
You're weird.

389
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:38,723
Wanna go get sex?

390
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,024
Umm, sure.

391
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:08,433
Better get out of these wet things.

392
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:19,614
You're so fresh!

393
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:28,879
Are you sure no one's going come in?

394
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:32,882
We're all alone!

395
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:44,713
Mean machine jelly bean.

396
00:39:47,236 --> 00:39:48,541
Try to run now!

397
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:17,542
Clarissa?

398
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:28,331
What's the matter, Billy?

399
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:32,899
You...

400
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,986
...you were in a funny position!

401
00:41:36,857 --> 00:41:38,684
Billy, you are so sweet.

402
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,556
I wonder
when exactly you lost your virginity.

403
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:51,127
That's Bill's Jeep!!

404
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,735
It is.

405
00:41:52,996 --> 00:41:55,042
I can't believe he would do this to me.

406
00:41:55,128 --> 00:41:58,912
- Oh, come on, Shauna, it's better you
find out now, rather than wait, right? - No!

407
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:03,349
God,
what a bitch that Clarissa Carlyn is!

408
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,177
- Can you imagine what's going on?
- All right.

409
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,486
How do you like your tea?
Cream? Sugar?

410
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:18,140
Or do you want me to pee in it?

411
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:25,231
You're a class act, Clarissa!

412
00:42:37,193 --> 00:42:39,323
Oh, I'm so mad I could just scream!

413
00:42:41,803 --> 00:42:42,935
Who's that?

414
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,587
I don't know!

415
00:42:45,676 --> 00:42:47,764
- We better get out of here!
- Uh-uh!

416
00:42:59,765 --> 00:43:00,765
Oh, shit!

417
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:02,772
Clarissa!

418
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,822
Home a little early tonight,
don't you think so, mother?

419
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:23,346
Has that brain of yours
finally gone completely numb?

420
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:27,647
Mrs. Carlyn, Bill Whitney.

421
00:43:38,921 --> 00:43:40,400
Come on mother, out! Out!

422
00:43:41,748 --> 00:43:42,836
Out!

423
00:43:46,097 --> 00:43:47,490
What are you doing?

424
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,710
Lighten up Billy boy,
drink your tea before you drool.

425
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:55,972
So what's with her?

426
00:43:57,364 --> 00:43:59,583
She does things I don't like.

427
00:44:02,497 --> 00:44:04,932
I've never known anyone like you.

428
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:08,283
It's about time you did honey bunny!

429
00:44:13,633 --> 00:44:15,375
It's getting late...

430
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:07,966
- Shauna!
- So are you happy now?

431
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,228
- What do you mean?
- What a bitch that Clarissa Carlyn is!

432
00:45:11,315 --> 00:45:13,534
You think you can do
anything that you want?!

433
00:45:13,664 --> 00:45:16,577
- Calm down and let me explain.
- Was she a good fuck?!

434
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:19,605
That's all you're really interested in,
isn't it, Billy?!

435
00:45:19,793 --> 00:45:21,972
No, look Shauna, let, ah...

436
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,931
Oh, Billy! How could you?

437
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:28,281
Ah, look, I...

438
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,760
Shauna!

439
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,819
Yeah, right there dad, that's good!

440
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,473
What's this?!

441
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:03,864
Oh, God! Bill!

442
00:46:04,908 --> 00:46:07,127
Is that thing what I think it is?

443
00:46:07,258 --> 00:46:10,607
That's a really disgusting thing
to bring into mom and dad's bedroom.

444
00:46:10,912 --> 00:46:13,476
I don't know what's going on here,
but I don't appreciate it!

445
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:16,958
- Calm down, Bill! - Some of us
have to go to school on time!

446
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,220
You know, you look really nice in a tie!

447
00:46:22,394 --> 00:46:23,526
Don't you think so, Jim?

448
00:46:24,005 --> 00:46:25,527
Yes, yes, he does!

449
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:28,138
Knock it off here!

450
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:31,581
Why are you guys
doing this to me huh?!

451
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:33,530
Don't be so paranoid!

452
00:46:33,748 --> 00:46:34,793
Wait...

453
00:46:35,845 --> 00:46:37,024
I'm not paranoid!

454
00:46:37,273 --> 00:46:39,830
Oh, don't be like that...

455
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,015
Come on, Bill, calm down.

456
00:46:44,016 --> 00:46:47,916
You know, you'll make such a 
great contribution to society.

457
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:51,932
You'll do our whole family proud.

458
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:57,676
You guys disgust me.

459
00:47:00,763 --> 00:47:03,329
Don't be
disrespectful to your mother.

460
00:47:04,373 --> 00:47:07,591
My mother?
God knows where my mother is.

461
00:47:10,462 --> 00:47:12,965
I won't tolerate this language
from you, young man.

462
00:47:13,466 --> 00:47:14,966
Fuck you, butthead.

463
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,640
Bill, how dare you
use the F word to your father.

464
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:21,209
Oh gee, I'm sorry mom,
you prefer the word, copulation?

465
00:47:25,298 --> 00:47:27,429
You stay away from me,
don't touch me.

466
00:47:29,081 --> 00:47:32,737
- Do something with him.
- You don't have to do anything,
because I'm moving out.

467
00:47:32,866 --> 00:47:34,346
You can't do that.

468
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:06,622
Oh, Blanchard...

469
00:48:09,927 --> 00:48:13,669
He looks really weird.
Not like himself at all.

470
00:48:16,713 --> 00:48:18,716
I think that is
what they always look like.

471
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,550
They ah, must have had to do
a lot of reconstructive stuff on him...

472
00:48:34,898 --> 00:48:35,899
Yeah.

473
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:47,700
Bill.

474
00:48:48,557 --> 00:48:50,297
It's imperative that I talk with you...

475
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:53,168
...about your parents...

476
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:56,432
...about him...

477
00:48:57,433 --> 00:49:01,127
...about some things
that have been happening here lately...

478
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,477
...Society.

479
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:07,958
- What do you mean society?
- Not here.

480
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:13,092
Meet me tonight at Franklin Canyon,
about nine, at the gate.

481
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,877
Petrie!

482
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:10,207
Hey!

483
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:38,092
Petrie!

484
00:51:07,758 --> 00:51:08,846
Who's there?

485
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:52,869
Who are you?

486
00:53:32,007 --> 00:53:34,792
- Clarissa, what are you doing here?
- I live here.

487
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,617
Yeah, look, I just saw Petrie
with his neck cut.

488
00:53:37,705 --> 00:53:39,663
Poor baby,
I hope he didn't make a mess.

489
00:53:39,794 --> 00:53:40,968
Where's your father?

490
00:54:10,766 --> 00:54:12,288
This isn't the one.

491
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:29,168
I don't think we need the lab
to tell us there's no blood.

492
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:31,558
Look officer, this isn't the car.

493
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:35,169
- They must have taken it. I don't know.
- They?

494
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:37,823
What are you hopped up on?

495
00:54:38,214 --> 00:54:41,129
Look, I'm telling you,
someone killed Martin Petrie.

496
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,827
Up against the car, kids.

497
00:54:48,742 --> 00:54:51,091
This isn't the car, okay, it was a Volvo...

498
00:54:51,177 --> 00:54:53,830
...not whatever this is
and there was a dead person in it.

499
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:56,398
Is it really this boring, being rich?

500
00:54:57,007 --> 00:54:59,094
You are going to frisk me, too?

501
00:54:59,181 --> 00:55:02,400
I guess you're just naturally fucked up.

502
00:55:06,664 --> 00:55:10,535
Next time I see you,
it will be a lot less pleasant.

503
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,239
What now?

504
00:55:25,805 --> 00:55:28,414
- You can go home with me.
- I'm not in the mood, all right.

505
00:55:28,501 --> 00:55:30,675
Hey, that's not what I meant.

506
00:55:59,518 --> 00:56:03,084
We'll have the presidential debate
in a moment.

507
00:56:03,997 --> 00:56:08,305
Why didn't you come home last night?
Mom and dad are really upset.

508
00:56:08,913 --> 00:56:11,349
Jenny,
do you have anything to tell me?

509
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,090
What do you want me to say?

510
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,877
Come on, I swear it,
it'll be just between you and me.

511
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,747
Just tell me the truth.

512
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:24,138
- About what?
- You know what.

513
00:56:25,617 --> 00:56:28,009
You know,
I'm really worried about you.

514
00:56:29,184 --> 00:56:31,403
Yeah, you are.

515
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:34,274
Pipe down!

516
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:36,710
Thank you.

517
00:56:39,973 --> 00:56:41,146
Where's Petrie?

518
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:45,324
It's strange
that Martin Petrie isn't here.

519
00:56:46,193 --> 00:56:47,673
He's never late.

520
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:52,109
He's won every attendance award,
but he's not coming here.

521
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:55,763
So please.

522
00:56:57,026 --> 00:57:00,199
David Blanchard's death
was no accident.

523
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:05,333
David Blanchard tried...

524
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:10,075
...tried to tell me about the society
that kills to keep its existence a secret.

525
00:57:10,729 --> 00:57:12,469
They killed Blanchard.

526
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:14,862
Martin Petrie...

527
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:18,556
...tried to tell me about this society...

528
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,775
...but they got to him before I did.

529
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:24,301
I saw Petrie last night
in Franklin Canyon...

530
00:57:25,431 --> 00:57:26,432
...murdered.

531
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:29,649
Martin Petrie is dead!

532
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,045
Someone like to tell me
what's going on here?

533
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:42,266
I had car trouble.

534
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:45,832
Nice speech, Whitney!

535
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:50,358
Bill!

536
00:58:01,275 --> 00:58:03,666
- Bill, we got to talk.
- Leave me alone, Milo!

537
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:06,059
I fucked you up man, and I'm sorry.

538
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,496
- I didn't think you'd take it this far.
- What do you mean?

539
00:58:09,976 --> 00:58:13,933
I mean, I was the one who put the
shrunken head in your locker...

540
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:17,412
...and the sex doll in your Jeep,
but I didn't think you'd flip out.

541
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:22,238
You. You. Petrie, Ferguson,
who else was in on this, huh?

542
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,239
Who else, asshole?

543
00:58:23,025 --> 00:58:26,853
Just give me a chance to explain, I'm
trying to tell you, you son of a bitch...

544
00:58:26,984 --> 00:58:30,552
...but you got your own answers,
as usual. I'm not in on anything...

545
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:33,074
...but I followed you
to Franklin Canyon last night.

546
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:35,858
I saw Petrie and Ferguson
coming out from the wood.

547
00:58:35,944 --> 00:58:40,339
Petrie was wrapped in a blanket, then
some old station wagon showed up...

548
00:58:40,426 --> 00:58:43,645
...then an old Ford.
The whole thing was weird.

549
00:58:48,343 --> 00:58:49,821
You, you saw it?

550
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:55,346
I only followed you
because of the way you were acting.

551
00:58:56,346 --> 00:58:59,305
Oh, then it's not me,
I mean I'm not goin crazy here.

552
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,741
Right!

553
00:59:03,047 --> 00:59:05,570
Why the dolls and stuff?

554
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:10,092
I don't know, you just go me angry.

555
00:59:10,266 --> 00:59:12,876
You know, I'm your best friend
when it suits you.

556
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,792
I guess I do go a little overboard.

557
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,446
I'm sorry.

558
00:59:23,187 --> 00:59:24,579
It's all right man.
It's all right.

559
00:59:27,754 --> 00:59:32,496
I don't know what kind of trouble
this is going to be.

560
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:35,323
I'm with you.

561
01:00:11,646 --> 01:00:14,647
Why doesn't it surprise me
that you're all here like this?

562
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:18,390
Thank God you're here!
You nearly spoiled everything.

563
01:00:27,046 --> 01:00:28,786
We've been worried sick about you.

564
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:31,179
Look, I would really love
to stay and shoot the shit...

565
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:34,311
...but I got a big day tomorrow,
so I'm going to go to bed.

566
01:00:35,311 --> 01:00:36,486
Now wait.

567
01:00:37,355 --> 01:00:39,835
Wait a minute, Bill.
We want to talk to you for a second.

568
01:00:39,965 --> 01:00:41,922
I don't think so
Wait...

569
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,881
Let go of me!

570
01:00:44,837 --> 01:00:46,317
What do you think you're doing?

571
01:00:46,795 --> 01:00:49,143
Yuo know how I hate to give you drugs.

572
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:50,928
You can't do this to me.

573
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:53,320
I have rights, I'm almost eighteen.

574
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:57,280
Thanks, Cleave.

575
01:02:03,878 --> 01:02:04,877
Excuse me.

576
01:02:05,182 --> 01:02:06,227
Miss!

577
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:10,185
Bill... 
William Whitney, what room is he in?

578
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:23,143
I don't see
anything here about a Whitney.

579
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:25,410
I know he's here,
he was just brought in.

580
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:27,324
Just a minute.

581
01:02:51,118 --> 01:02:52,337
- William Whitney?
- Yeah.

582
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:55,381
Are you a relative?

583
01:02:55,686 --> 01:02:56,731
Yes!

584
01:02:57,513 --> 01:02:59,731
Well, you'll have to go
to the morgue then.

585
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:00,862
The morgue?

586
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:03,865
He isn't dead, he Just got here.

587
01:03:03,995 --> 01:03:07,519
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No, you're not sorry.

588
01:03:07,649 --> 01:03:08,692
There's been a mistake.

589
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,955
Please, we don't want
to have to call security.

590
01:03:12,826 --> 01:03:14,130
He can't be.

591
01:03:54,326 --> 01:03:58,066
I'm sorry, you know
how I hate to give you drugs.

592
01:04:00,677 --> 01:04:03,896
You know the schedule,
first we dine, then copulation.

593
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:05,940
Someone your age first.

594
01:04:06,026 --> 01:04:08,072
Then your sister.

595
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:14,510
You know you'll make
such a great contribution to society.

596
01:04:23,732 --> 01:04:25,080
Blanchard!

597
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:30,084
- Oh oh.
- Let's get this one out of here.

598
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,954
- Yes, doctor.
- Easy, easy now.

599
01:05:24,242 --> 01:05:28,635
That's right. Roll out the red carpet,
Bill Whitney never disappointed huh?

600
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:34,639
They said you were dead.

601
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:37,681
Things are just the way they seem,
only more so, Milo.

602
01:05:39,249 --> 01:05:40,640
What happened in there?

603
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:44,468
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing, I'm here, aren't I?

604
01:05:44,772 --> 01:05:46,948
I won, Milo. I'm free.

605
01:05:47,383 --> 01:05:50,254
They couldn't handle Whitney,
the wonder boy.

606
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:52,908
Bullshit, it's a set up.

607
01:05:53,735 --> 01:05:56,605
- They even brought your Jeep here.
- Come on!

608
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:58,910
They just want me to be happy.

609
01:06:00,129 --> 01:06:01,303
Bill...

610
01:06:01,782 --> 01:06:03,522
You're officially dead.

611
01:06:05,391 --> 01:06:08,482
Come on, can't you see
they're setting you up for something?

612
01:06:11,136 --> 01:06:12,396
Paranoia?

613
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,964
I'm not paranoid, all my fears are real.

614
01:06:24,403 --> 01:06:26,535
Let's party, Jelly bean.

615
01:06:29,058 --> 01:06:31,321
Where's your mom?
Or is she in on this too?

616
01:06:31,451 --> 01:06:33,102
Why don't you come upstairs?

617
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,713
I want to be a bad...

618
01:06:34,843 --> 01:06:37,683
Bad little girl, now right huh?
Bad little girl?

619
01:06:38,496 --> 01:06:40,542
Come on, you want to get rough?

620
01:06:40,716 --> 01:06:43,019
- Things aren't the way they seem, Billy.
- Oh, yeah?

621
01:06:45,673 --> 01:06:47,501
Why don't you stay here a while?

622
01:06:51,502 --> 01:06:52,764
Yes, stay a while.

623
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:56,723
Quit it!

624
01:06:56,897 --> 01:06:58,289
It doesn't work anymore.

625
01:06:59,986 --> 01:07:01,421
Don't go home, Billy.

626
01:07:01,856 --> 01:07:05,293
Don't go home? Are you kidding me,
they want me home.

627
01:07:05,424 --> 01:07:07,251
It's time to party hardy.

628
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:17,126
Where are we going? What's the plan?

629
01:07:17,213 --> 01:07:18,344
Plan?

630
01:07:18,517 --> 01:07:19,866
You kidding?

631
01:07:34,396 --> 01:07:35,395
Ah shit!

632
01:07:36,788 --> 01:07:38,224
Mrs. Carlyn!

633
01:07:38,398 --> 01:07:39,833
Don't do that!

634
01:07:41,181 --> 01:07:43,008
Get out of the car!

635
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:46,225
Okay.

636
01:07:46,618 --> 01:07:48,575
We're going to take a little ride.

637
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:52,578
But don't touch the hair.

638
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:50,160
Mom? Dad?

639
01:10:44,188 --> 01:10:45,318
Mom...

640
01:10:45,406 --> 01:10:46,450
Dad...

641
01:10:46,537 --> 01:10:48,495
What happened to you?

642
01:11:22,164 --> 01:11:23,513
Wonderful!

643
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:27,385
Wonderful!
Everyone was just wonderful.

644
01:11:29,689 --> 01:11:33,214
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Judge Carter!

645
01:11:49,612 --> 01:11:51,440
My dear!

646
01:11:53,093 --> 01:11:56,964
You are both absolutely brilliant!

647
01:12:01,185 --> 01:12:03,360
Well done, well done indeed.

648
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:05,837
Effective...

649
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:08,274
...efficient.

650
01:12:10,144 --> 01:12:12,450
And to say the very least...

651
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:13,930
...entertaining.

652
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:18,845
I do love the...

653
01:12:19,933 --> 01:12:24,238
... smell of the hunt
and the taste of the shunt.

654
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:31,765
What's going on?

655
01:12:31,895 --> 01:12:33,288
You see, Bill...

656
01:12:35,245 --> 01:12:36,941
...it's like this...

657
01:12:38,986 --> 01:12:41,728
...there's no business
like show business.

658
01:12:46,815 --> 01:12:47,948
Who are you?

659
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:52,210
I'm not your mother.

660
01:12:52,906 --> 01:12:56,169
Jesus, Bill...
you never were one of us.

661
01:12:58,257 --> 01:12:59,649
Who are you?!

662
01:13:00,215 --> 01:13:02,301
You almost understand, don't you?

663
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,871
You're a different race from us,
a different species, a different class.

664
01:13:11,046 --> 01:13:13,177
You're not one of us.

665
01:13:14,874 --> 01:13:17,049
You have to be born into the society.

666
01:13:18,312 --> 01:13:19,658
Alien scum!

667
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:22,051
No.

668
01:13:22,139 --> 01:13:25,063
We are not from outer space
or anyhing like that.

669
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:29,491
We have been here
as long as you have.

670
01:13:30,882 --> 01:13:35,754
It's a matter of good breeding, really.

671
01:13:36,668 --> 01:13:38,102
Alien scum!

672
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:16,458
Clarissa, where have you been?

673
01:15:18,633 --> 01:15:20,241
You're late!

674
01:15:27,421 --> 01:15:29,030
You've done very well, James.

675
01:15:29,117 --> 01:15:31,900
I'm pleased to be able to contribute.

676
01:15:33,423 --> 01:15:35,032
Anything for society.

677
01:15:35,555 --> 01:15:38,948
You too, young man.
You have a bright future for you.

678
01:15:39,556 --> 01:15:42,950
We may have an internship for you
this summer in Washington.

679
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,092
Come on!

680
01:16:20,796 --> 01:16:22,406
Come on, Mrs. Carlyn!

681
01:16:23,015 --> 01:16:24,666
You're going to be my date.

682
01:16:26,885 --> 01:16:30,153
Jenny is going to Radcliff,
she'll tour Europe first of course.

683
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:34,454
Oh, Nanny!
You're such a lucky woman.

684
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:41,806
Jenny is a real beauty.
She possesses such natural poise.

685
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:46,591
Yes, Jim and I both derive
a great deal of pleasure for her.

686
01:16:49,026 --> 01:16:50,375
Don't we, darling?

687
01:17:13,518 --> 01:17:14,997
Ladies and gentlemen...

688
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:19,825
Tonight we have a double header.

689
01:17:23,349 --> 01:17:24,741
Blanchard!

690
01:17:28,656 --> 01:17:30,615
After the first shunting...

691
01:17:31,744 --> 01:17:35,965
...we'll have that special treating
we've been hearing so much about.

692
01:17:37,096 --> 01:17:40,292
A wonderful specimen, in his prime...

693
01:17:43,402 --> 01:17:45,621
...nurtured by Jim and Nan...

694
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:48,535
...in their very own home.

695
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:17,638
Keep your eye on Blanchard,
Billy boy...

696
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,204
...because you're the next.

697
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:24,337
What are you doing?

698
01:18:26,038 --> 01:18:27,038
No...

699
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:32,539
Oh, god... Please...

700
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:38,865
Let go of me!

701
01:19:18,866 --> 01:19:19,966
Jim!

702
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:22,107
Jenny!

703
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,416
Good bye, David!

704
01:19:48,467 --> 01:19:49,510
Stop it.

705
01:19:49,945 --> 01:19:53,120
You're not losing your taste
for these pathetic animals, are you?

706
01:19:54,253 --> 01:19:55,362
Don't worry.

707
01:19:55,592 --> 01:19:57,559
You'll get your share.

708
01:19:58,646 --> 01:20:00,430
We all gonna get our share.

709
01:20:01,126 --> 01:20:04,041
- What's going on?
- Didn't you know, Billy boy?

710
01:20:04,302 --> 01:20:07,956
The rich have always sucked off
low class shit like you.

711
01:20:22,581 --> 01:20:24,616
There it is.

712
01:20:27,877 --> 01:20:30,444
Hey, what are you doing in there?

713
01:20:31,053 --> 01:20:34,012
This is a private party.
And private property.

714
01:20:34,098 --> 01:20:35,273
To members only.

715
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,927
- We're invited.
- You're invited? Who's that?

716
01:20:38,145 --> 01:20:39,624
This is my mother.

717
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,929
That's your mother.

718
01:20:42,147 --> 01:20:43,277
Hair.

719
01:20:43,364 --> 01:20:45,191
Hair, Mrs. Carlyn!

720
01:21:17,732 --> 01:21:19,559
Good and pliable, your honor.

721
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,560
Oh, no!

722
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,658
Look.

723
01:21:43,678 --> 01:21:45,223
A beauty mark.

724
01:21:46,124 --> 01:21:47,324
Pretty isn't it?

725
01:21:48,465 --> 01:21:50,200
Oh, please.

726
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,017
And now...

727
01:22:11,933 --> 01:22:14,848
...we'll get to the bottom.

728
01:22:15,532 --> 01:22:16,582
Oh God!

729
01:22:44,121 --> 01:22:45,296
Run, Billy!

730
01:22:46,689 --> 01:22:47,906
I love you.

731
01:22:54,735 --> 01:22:55,954
Billy!

732
01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:15,050
Where are you?

733
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:21,097
Where are you, Billy?
Anyone around my station is, I see it.

734
01:23:25,752 --> 01:23:27,622
It's showtime, Billy!

735
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:32,015
You want to play, huh?

736
01:23:35,409 --> 01:23:36,409
You...

737
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:37,628
You...

738
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:43,762
Let me give you a hand, Bill.

739
01:24:01,423 --> 01:24:02,468
Mom?

740
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:12,688
Oh, Billy! How sweet of you,
to come here to me.

741
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:42,574
Do you have any edible fantasies,
you'd like to indulge in Billy?

742
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,357
Now is the time.

743
01:24:54,241 --> 01:24:58,453
Well, son, I guess you're right,
I am a butthead.

744
01:25:02,975 --> 01:25:04,229
Hey, hey, hey, Bill?

745
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:18,507
This isn't another hang up, Billy.

746
01:26:33,109 --> 01:26:35,937
Hi, everybody!
Here comes Billy.

747
01:26:36,419 --> 01:26:37,664
Let go of me!

748
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,332
Billy on the half shell.

749
01:26:45,073 --> 01:26:46,103
Billy!

750
01:26:47,857 --> 01:26:49,206
Leave her alone.

751
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:56,077
Well, well, well, what do we have here,
you're going to rescue
the young maiden Billy?

752
01:26:56,078 --> 01:26:57,078
Something like that.

753
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:01,472
You and me, man to man.

754
01:27:03,037 --> 01:27:05,429
Well, a slave revolt.

755
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:15,430
I love it you gotta save the girl,
it's so cute.

756
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:18,567
Billy don't,
you'll only make it worse.

757
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:19,786
Shut up, Clarissa.

758
01:27:19,872 --> 01:27:22,352
Jim! Nan! Where the hell are you?

759
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,948
We got to pull myself together.

760
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:28,651
A beauty mark.

761
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,567
I'm getting too old for this.

762
01:28:52,884 --> 01:28:57,163
Nan! Jim! Come on,
you guys, knock it off, will you?

763
01:28:57,164 --> 01:28:59,864
You've gotta come downstairs.
You've gotta see this.

764
01:28:59,949 --> 01:29:03,524
- We're changing!
- Oh really? Into what?

765
01:29:06,927 --> 01:29:09,059
Members of society...

766
01:29:10,538 --> 01:29:13,061
...hailing from Beverly Hills...

767
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:18,369
...with lineage dating from Julius
Caesar and Gengis Khan...

768
01:29:19,673 --> 01:29:23,501
...the master of the hunt,
the champion of the shunt...

769
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,806
...Ted the Tycoon Ferguson!

770
01:29:35,595 --> 01:29:36,986
In this corner...

771
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:41,596
...from nowhere in particular...

772
01:29:43,423 --> 01:29:46,643
...Bill the Bastard Whitney!

773
01:29:48,557 --> 01:29:49,906
Gentlemen...

774
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:51,385
...begin!

775
01:30:02,956 --> 01:30:05,740
Everybody ready
for the dessert of the night?

776
01:30:13,266 --> 01:30:14,528
Ferguson!

777
01:31:06,029 --> 01:31:07,529
Bill! Bill!

778
01:31:17,255 --> 01:31:21,212
See this arm, Bill,
you can get very familiar with it.

779
01:31:41,962 --> 01:31:43,094
Oh, shit!

780
01:31:46,688 --> 01:31:48,276
Is that all you got?

781
01:31:48,888 --> 01:31:51,533
Come on, gummy.
Give me your best shot.

782
01:31:54,753 --> 01:31:57,667
All right Billy, the game's over.

783
01:32:17,546 --> 01:32:22,231
I told you Whitney, we don't lose, ever.

784
01:33:18,513 --> 01:33:20,666
It's turned inside out.

785
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:31,667
Clarissa!

786
01:33:37,157 --> 01:33:38,692
Bill, come on man!

787
01:33:47,941 --> 01:33:49,637
You'll never get away with this.

788
01:33:55,118 --> 01:33:56,293
Don't count on it.

789
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:02,867
Butthead!

790
01:34:08,343 --> 01:34:09,605
Come on! Come on!

791
01:34:40,098 --> 01:34:44,012
Well Dr. Cleveland, it looks
so I may have an opening...

792
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:48,494
...in Washington next summer.
Know what I mean?
