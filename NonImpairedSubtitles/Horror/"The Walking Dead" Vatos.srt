1
00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:03,838
Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,485
Dad!

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:08,613
You handcuffed my
brother to a roof?

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,054
And you let him there!

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,117
It seems to me what you really
need most here are more guns.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,919
I dropped the bag in Atlanta
when I got swarmed.

7
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:19,645
I'm going back.

8
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:22,638
You just got here and you're
gonna turn around and leave?

9
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:29,254
Merle! Merle!
No! No!

10
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,014
- What?
- Nothing.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,218
It's not nothing.
It's always something.

12
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:56,256
Didn't dad teach you
to tie nail knots?

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,125
Why would he do that?
He only ever used a fisherman's knot.

14
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,266
- One knot.
- No, he didn't.

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,902
No, he tied at least three.

16
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,804
Clinch knots?

17
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,539
No way.

18
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,674
Fine, I'm making it up.

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,288
Did dad teach you
mostly dry lures?

20
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,523
Yeah.
You?

21
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,460
- Wet.
- You're kidding.

22
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,895
<i>But he was always
so adamant.</i>

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,997
I mean, you know dad
on the fishing thing.

24
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:39,632
Gee, you think?

25
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,869
I only spent my entire childhood
with my ass in a boat.

26
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:46,106
But in my day it was all
about getting the hook seated.

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,141
We were fishing
for the dinner table.

28
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,744
Not us.
We always threw them back.

29
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,912
- Always.
- I guess he changed things up.

30
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:56,216
But that'd be like changing
his religion or something.

31
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,719
People change. It's not his fault
we were born 12 years apart.

32
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:02,155
<i>No.</i>

33
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,492
No, because the minute
you went off to college

34
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,762
it was my ass in that boat and he
taught me dry lures from day one.

35
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:13,700
This was not behavior
developed over time.

36
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,345
You think he did it for us?

37
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,881
Because he knew
we were so different.

38
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:36,156
He knew that you needed
to catch the fish

39
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,725
and I needed
to throw them back.

40
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,630
All right, remember his rule:

41
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,965
No crying in the boat.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,735
It scares the fish.

43
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,738
Mom and dad...

44
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,374
I mean,

45
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,744
maybe Florida
wasn't hit so bad.

46
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,847
Maybe it's better there.

47
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,882
<i>Do you think?</i>

48
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,990
I think you have a bite.

49
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,793
Even with the wrong knots.

50
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,798
Oh God.

51
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,303
So much for the no crying rule.

52
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,272
I think that was more
for dad than the fish.

55
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:15,014
I won't hesitate. I don't care if
every walker in the city hears it.

56
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,799
You got a do-rag
or something?

57
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,485
I guess the saw blade was
too dull for the handcuffs.

58
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:57,023
Ain't that a bitch.

59
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,317
He must have used a
tourniquet... maybe his belt.

60
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,452
Be much more blood
if he didn't.

61
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,486
Merle?
You in here?

62
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,940
Jim?
You okay?

63
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:30,083
You keep this up, you're
gonna keel over out here.

64
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,123
Drink some water at least.

65
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:18,064
Had enough in him to take out
these two sumbitches.

66
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,933
One handed.

67
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,738
Toughest asshole
I ever met, my brother.

68
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,675
Feed him a hammer,
he'd crap out nails.

69
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,811
Any man can pass out
from blood loss,

70
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,113
no matter how tough he is.

71
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,953
Oh, baby.
Will you look at that?

72
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,689
Hey, check it out.

73
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,293
Ladies...

74
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,663
Because of you my
children will eat tonight.

75
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,632
- Thank you.
- Thank Dale.

76
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,700
It's his canoe and gear.

77
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,836
<i>Mom, look.
Look at all the fish.</i>

78
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,838
Thank you.

79
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,943
Yeah, whoa.
Where did you two learn to do that?

80
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,612
- Our dad.
- Can you teach me how to do that?

81
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,849
Sure. I'll teach you all
about nail knots and stuff.

82
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,785
- If that's okay.
- You won't catch me arguing.

83
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,756
Hey, Dale. When's the last time
you oiled those line reels?

84
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,492
- They are a disgrace.
- I, uh,

85
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,627
<i>I don't want
to alarm anyone,</i>

86
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,397
but we may have
a bit of a problem.

87
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,415
- Merle!
- We're not alone here.

88
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,517
- Remember?
- Screw that.

89
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,386
He could be bleeding out.
You said so yourself.

90
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,041
What's that burned stuff?</i>

91
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,611
Skin.

92
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,779
He cauterized the stump.

93
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,986
Told you he was tough.

94
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,021
Nobody can kill
merle but merle.

95
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,957
Don't take that on faith.
He's lost a lot of blood.

96
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,626
Yeah?

97
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,862
Didn't stop him from busting
out of this death trap.

98
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,098
He left the building?

99
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,766
Why the hell would he do that?

100
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,234
Why wouldn't he?</i>

101
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,038
He's out there alone
as far as he knows,

102
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,773
<i>doing what he's got to do.</i>

103
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,175
Surviving.

104
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,544
You call that surviving?

105
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,114
Just wandering out in the
streets, maybe passing out?

106
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,916
What are his odds out there?

107
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,919
No worse than being handcuffed and
left to rot by you sorry pricks.

108
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,789
You couldn't kill him.

109
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,559
Ain't so worried about
some dumb dead bastard.

110
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,461
What about 1,000 dead
dumb bastards?

111
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,931
- Different story?
- Why don't you take a tally?

112
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,300
Do what you want.
I'm gonna go get him.

113
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,602
- Daryl, wait.
- Get your hands off me!

114
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,604
- You can't stop me.
- I don't blame you.

115
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,307
He's family, I get that.
I went through hell to find mine.

116
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,108
I know exactly how you feel.

117
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,845
He can't get far
with that injury.

118
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,614
We could help you check
a few blocks around

119
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,350
but only if we keep
a level head.

120
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,554
I could do that.

121
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,060
Only if we get
those guns first.

122
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,795
I'm not strolling
the streets of Atlanta

123
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,030
with just my good
intentions, okay?

124
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,519
Hey, Jim.

125
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,557
Jim, why don't you
hold up, all right?

126
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,360
- Just give me a second here, please.
- What do you want?

127
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,129
We're all just a little
concerned, that's all,

128
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,665
Dale says you've been
out here for hours.

129
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,601
- So?
- So why are you digging?

130
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,705
Are you heading to China, Jim?

131
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,508
What does it matter?
I'm not hurting anyone.

132
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,043
Yeah, except maybe yourself.

133
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,480
It's 100â° tod.
You can't keep this up.

134
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,548
Sure I can.
Watch me.

135
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,951
Jim, they're not
gonna say it so I will.

136
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,420
You're scaring people.

137
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,023
You're scaring my son
and Carol's daughter.

138
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:40,393
They got nothing
to be scared of.

139
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,429
I mean, what the hell, people?

140
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,464
I'm out here by myself.
Why don't you all just go

141
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,667
and leave me the hell alone?

142
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,871
We think that you need
to take a break, okay?

143
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,373
Why don't you go and get
yourself in the shade?

144
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,308
Some food maybe.
I'll tell you what...

145
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,644
maybe in a little bit
I'll come out here

146
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,880
and help you myself.

147
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,815
Jim, just tell me
what it's about.

148
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,750
Why don't you just go ahead
and give me that shovel?

149
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,219
- Or what?
- There is no or what.

150
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:10,523
I'm asking you. I'm coming to
you and I'm asking you, please.

151
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,224
I don't want to have
to take it from you.

152
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,127
And if I don't, then what?

153
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,830
Then you're gonna
beat my face in

154
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,066
like Ed Peletier, aren't you?

155
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,636
Y'all seen his face, huh?
What's left of it.

156
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,572
See, now that's what happens
when someone crosses you.

157
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,541
That was different, Jim.

158
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,944
You weren't there. Ed was out of control.
He was hurting his wife.

159
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,579
That is their marriage.
That is not his.

160
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:37,049
He is not judge and jury.
Who voted you king boss, huh?

161
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,884
<i>Jim, I'm not here to
argue with you, all right?</i>

162
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,020
- Just give me the shovel, okay?
- No no no.

163
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,856
Just give me the... Jim!

164
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,825
- Okay, shh shh.
- You got no right!

165
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,560
- Stop. Shh.
- You got no right!

166
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,528
Jim, just stop it.
Hey hey hey hey.

167
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,764
- Don't! - Jim.
Jim, nobody's gonna hurt you.

168
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,699
You hear me?
Shh.

169
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,202
Jim, nobody is gonna
hurt you, okay?

170
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:59,205
That's a lie.
That's the biggest lie there is.

171
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,675
I told that to my wife
and my two boys.

172
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,445
I said it 100 times.
It didn't matter.

173
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,782
They came out of nowhere.
There were dozens of 'em.

174
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,652
Just pulled 'em
right out of my hands.

175
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,860
You know, the only
reason I got away was

176
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,529
'cause the dead were
too busy eating my family.

177
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,305
You're not doing this alone.

178
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,641
Even I think it's a bad idea and
I don't even like you much.

179
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,278
It's a good idea, okay,
if you just hear me out.

180
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,847
If we go out there in a group,

181
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,849
we're slow, drawing attention.

182
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,819
If I'm alone, I can move fast.

183
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,655
Look.

184
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,725
That's the tank, five blocks
from where we are now.

185
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,593
That's the bag of guns.

186
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,996
Here's the alley I dragged
you into when we first met.

187
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,165
- That's where Daryl and I will go.
- Why me?

188
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,433
Your crossbow is quieter
than his gun.

189
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,906
While Daryl waits
here in the alley,

190
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,707
I run up the street,
grab the bag.

191
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,342
You got us elsewhere?

192
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,710
<i>You and t-dog, right.</i>

193
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,746
You'll be in this alley here.

194
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,414
Two blocks away?
Why?

195
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,416
I may not be able to
come back the same way.

196
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,385
<i>Walkers might cut me off.</i>

197
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,921
If that happens,
I won't go back to Daryl.

198
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,956
I'll go forward instead,

199
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,358
all the way around to that
alley where you guys are.

200
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,194
Whichever direction I go,

201
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:31,197
I got you in both places
to cover me.

202
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,865
Afterwards, we'll all
meet back here.

203
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,334
Hey, kid, what'd you do
before all this?

204
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:39,104
Delivered pizzas. Why?

205
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,804
You got some balls
for a chinaman.

206
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,373
- I'm Korean.
- Whatever.

207
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,904
Whoa, don't shoot me!
What do you want?

208
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,407
I'm looking for my brother.
He's hurt real bad. You seen him?

209
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,775
<i>- Ayúdame!
- Shut up!</i>

210
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,844
You're gonna bring the geeks down on us.
Answer me.

211
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:07,026
<i>- Answer me.
- Ayúdame!</i>

212
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,728
Ayúdame!

213
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,631
<i>Ayúdame!</i>

214
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,967
Shut up. Shut up.

215
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,336
Shut up.

216
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,004
<i>Shut up.</i>

217
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,379
<i>That's it.
That's the bag, Vato.</i>

218
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,581
Take it!
Take it!

219
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,959
Get off me!
Get off me!

220
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,495
Daryl!

221
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,697
Daryl!

222
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,935
Come back here,

223
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,770
you sumbitches!

224
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,480
Whoa whoa whoa.
Stop it.

225
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,315
I'm gonna kick your nuts
up in your throat!

226
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,917
- Let me go.
- Chill out.

227
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,919
They took Glenn.
That little bastard

228
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,454
and his little bastard
homie friends.

229
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,155
I'm gonna stomp your ass!

230
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,957
Guys! Guys!
We're cut off!

231
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,660
Get to the lab. Go.

232
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,498
Come on.
Damn, let's go.

233
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,795
Jim, take some water?

234
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:38,497
- All right.
- Yeah?

235
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:40,532
All right.

236
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,437
Here you go, bud.

237
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:52,310
Pour some on my head?

238
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,979
Yeah.

239
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:02,287
Cooling you down, huh?

240
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:04,089
Yeah.

241
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,128
How long you gonna
keep me like this?

242
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:12,197
Well, yeah.

243
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,232
Until I don't think that
you're a danger to yourself

244
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:16,635
<i>or others.</i>

245
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:26,645
Sorry if I scared your boy
and your little girl.

246
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:31,016
You had sunstroke.
Nobody's blaming you.

247
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,884
You're not scared now, are you?

248
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,319
No sir.

249
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:45,363
Your mama's right.
Sun just cooked my head is all.

250
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:48,033
Jim, do you know why
you were digging?

251
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:52,104
<i>Can you say?</i>

252
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:54,773
I had a reason.
Don't remember.

253
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,678
Something I dreamt last night.

254
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:06,318
Your dad was in it.
You were too.

255
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:08,653
You were worried about him.
Can't remember the rest.

256
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,324
You worried about your dad?

257
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:15,293
They're not back yet.

258
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:17,429
We don't need
to talk about that.

259
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:19,164
Your dad's
a police officer, son.

260
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:20,932
He helps people.

261
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,835
Probably just came across some
folks needing help, that's all.

262
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,571
That man, he is tough as nails.

263
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:29,574
I don't know him well but...

264
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:32,544
I could see it in him.

265
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:33,945
Am I right?

266
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,148
Oh yeah.

267
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:41,753
There ain't nothing gonna stop
him from getting back here

268
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,889
to you and your mom,
I promise you that.

269
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,263
All right.

270
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:53,665
Who wants to help me
clean some fish, huh?

271
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:55,600
Sweet.
Come on, Sophia.

272
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:58,170
Stay with Carol, all right?

273
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:19,791
You keep your boy close.

274
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:22,861
You don't ever let him
out of your sight.

275
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:35,140
Those men you were with, we
need to know where they went.

276
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,209
I ain't telling you nothing.

277
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:40,312
Jesus, man.
What the hell happened back there?

278
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:42,747
I told you, this little turd
and his douche bag friends

279
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:44,482
came out of nowhere
and jumped me.

280
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:46,551
<i>You're the one who
jumped me, puto,</i>

281
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:49,387
screaming about trying to find his
brother like it's my damn fault.

282
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:51,690
They took Glenn.
Could have taken merle too.

283
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,125
Merle? What kind of
hick name is that?

284
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,194
I wouldn't name my dog merle.

285
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:58,597
Damn it, Daryl.
Back off.

286
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:08,406
Want to see what happened to the
last guy that pissed me off?

287
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:19,551
Start with the feet this time.

288
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:25,090
The men you were
with took our friend.

289
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:26,558
All we want to do
is talk to them,

290
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:28,026
see if we can work
something out.

291
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:38,370
You sure you're up for this?

292
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:40,705
- Yeah.
- Okay.

293
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:45,744
One wrong move,

294
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,779
you get an arrow in the ass.
Just so you know.

295
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:49,948
G's gonna take that
arrow out of my ass

296
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:52,584
<i>and shove it up yours.
Just so you know.</i>

297
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:55,253
- G?
- Guillermo.

298
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:56,855
He's the man here.

299
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:58,223
Okay then.

300
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:00,592
- Let's go see guillermo.

301
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,145
You okay, little man?

302
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,315
<i>They're gonna cut off
my feet, carnal.</i>

303
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,983
Cops do that?

304
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:01,986
<i>Not him.
This redneck puto here.</i>

305
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:04,089
He cut off some dude's hand, man.
He showed it to me.

306
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:06,958
<i>- Shut up. - Hey, that's that
Vato right there, homes.</i>

307
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:09,260
He shot me in the ass with an arrow.
What's up, homes, huh?

308
00:24:09,295 --> 00:24:11,463
Chill, ese, chill.
Chill.

309
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:14,933
This true?

310
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:17,369
He wants Miguelito's feet?

311
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:18,870
That's pretty sick, man.

312
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:21,806
We were hoping more
for a calm discussion.

313
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:23,675
That hillbilly jumps
Felipe's little cousin,

314
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:25,176
beats on him, threatens
to cut off his feet,

315
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:26,745
Felipe gets an arrow in the ass

316
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:29,314
and you want a calm discussion?

317
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,883
You fascinate me.

318
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,585
Heat of the moment.

319
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,554
Mistakes were made
on both sides.

320
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:40,859
<i>Who's that dude to you anyway?
You don't look related.</i>

321
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:43,762
He's one of our group,
more or less.

322
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:45,997
I'm sure you have
a few like him.

323
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:48,266
You got my brother in there?

324
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,802
Sorry, we're fresh out
of white boys.

325
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:53,138
But I've got Asian.
You interested?

326
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:55,874
I have one of yours,
you have one of mine.

327
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:58,042
Sounds like an even trade.

328
00:24:58,077 --> 00:25:01,246
- Don't sound even to me.
- G.

329
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,515
- Come on, man.
- My people got attacked.

330
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:05,683
Where's the compensation
for their pain and suffering?

331
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:07,986
More to the point,
where's my bag of guns?

332
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,789
- Guns? - The bag Miguel
saw in the street.

333
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:12,690
The bag Felipe and Jorge
were going back to get.

334
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:14,692
- That bag of guns.
- You're mistaken.

335
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:16,995
<i>- I don't think so.
- About it being yours.</i>

336
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:19,497
It's my bag of guns.

337
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:21,466
The bag was in the street.

338
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,668
Anybody could come around
and say it was theirs.

339
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:26,838
I'm supposed to take your word?

340
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:28,740
What's to stop my people
from unloading on you

341
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:30,608
right here and now
and I take what's mine?

342
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,113
You could do that.

343
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:38,383
<i>Or not.</i>

344
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:44,122
Come on, man.
Make the trade.

345
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:46,024
Please.

346
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:49,427
<i>Oye.</i>

347
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:05,243
I see two options.

348
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,779
You come back with Miguel
and my bag of guns,

349
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:09,514
everybody walks.

350
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:11,716
Or you come back
locked and loaded,

351
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,985
we'll see which side
spills more blood.

352
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,027
Them guns are worth
more than gold.

353
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:41,965
Gold won't protect your family
or put food on the table.

354
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:45,135
You're gonna give that up
for that kid?

355
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:47,303
<i>If I knew we'd get
Glenn back, I might agree.</i>

356
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:49,939
But you think that Vato across the
way is just gonna hand him over?

357
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:52,142
- You calling g a liar?
- Are you a part of this?

358
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:54,244
You want to hold
onto your teeth?

359
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:59,048
Question is, do you
trust that man's word?

360
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,351
<i>No, question is what are
you willing to bet on it?</i>

361
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:04,120
Could be more than them guns.
Could be your life.

362
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,189
Glenn worth that to you?

363
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:11,127
What life I have I owe to him.

364
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,862
I was nobody to Glenn,

365
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,732
just some idiot
stuck in a tank.

366
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,967
He could have walked away,
but he didn't.

367
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,502
Neither will I.

368
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,070
So you're gonna hand
the guns over?

369
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:23,706
I didn't say that.

370
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:28,144
There's nothing
keeping you two here.

371
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,280
You should get out,
head back to camp.

372
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:31,848
And tell your family what?

373
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:46,796
Come on, this is nuts.

374
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,969
Just do like g says.

375
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:27,604
I see my guns but they're
not all in the bag.

376
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:29,505
That's because
they're not yours.

377
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,274
I thought I mentioned that.

378
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:33,276
Let's just shoot these
fools right now, ese.

379
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,944
<i>All right?
Unload on their asses, ese.</i>

380
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,748
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

381
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:40,683
No, I'm pretty clear.

382
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:47,190
You have your man.
I want mine.

383
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:53,296
I'm gonna chop up your boy.
I'm gonna feed him to my dogs.

384
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,399
They're the evilest, nastiest
man-eating bitches you ever saw.

385
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,401
I picked them up from
Satan at a yard sale.

386
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,871
I told you how it has to be.
Are you woefully deaf?

387
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,774
No, my hearing's fine.
You said come locked and loaded.

388
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,412
Okay then, we're here.

389
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:18,588
Felipe! Felipe!</i>

390
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:24,127
<i>Abuela, go back
with the others... now.</i>

391
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:25,461
Get that old lady out
of the line of fire!

392
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,964
Abuela, listen to
your mijo, okay?

393
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:29,632
This is the not the place
for you right now.

394
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,902
Mr. Gilbert is having
trouble breathing.

395
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,638
He needs his asthma stuff.

396
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,273
Carlitos didn't find it.

397
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,609
<i>He needs his medicine.</i>

398
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:44,380
Felipe, go take
care of it, okay?

399
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,949
And take your
grandmother with you.

400
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:47,951
¡Abuela! Ven
conmigo por favor.

401
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:50,653
Who are those men?

402
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,389
- Por favor, ven conmigo.
- Don't you take him.

403
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,658
- Ma'am?
- Felipe's a good boy.

404
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:58,895
He have his trouble
but he pull himself together.

405
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,864
We need him here.

406
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:04,267
Ma'am,

407
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,669
I'm not here to arrest
your grandson.

408
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,671
Then what do you want him for?

409
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,674
He's...

410
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,843
Helping us find
a missing person.

411
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:15,378
Fella named Glenn.

412
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:17,981
The Asian boy?

413
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:20,450
He's with Mr. Gilbert.

414
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:23,786
Come. Come, I show you.

415
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:26,022
He needs his medicine.

416
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:28,825
Let 'em pass.

417
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,790
<i>Abuela, por favor.
Take me to him.</i>

418
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,690
All right.
All right.

419
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:37,326
Nice and easy.
Just breathe.

420
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:39,562
Just breathe. Just let it out.
Just breathe.

421
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,267
Just relax.</i>

422
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:48,237
- What the hell is this?
- An asthma attack.

423
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,339
Couldn't get his breath
all of a sudden.

424
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,942
I thought you were being
eaten by dogs, man.

425
00:31:57,514 --> 00:32:00,516
Could I have a word with you?

426
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,252
You're the dumbest
son of a bitch I ever met.

427
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:06,222
We walked in there ready to
kill every last one of you.

428
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:08,157
Well, I'm glad it
didn't go down that way.

429
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,528
If it had, that blood
would be on my hands.

430
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,764
Mine too.
We'd have fought back.

431
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:16,632
Wouldn't be the first
time we've had to.

432
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:20,403
Protect the food, the
medicine... what's left of it.

433
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:22,438
These people, the old ones...

434
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,974
the staff took off,
just left 'em here to die.

435
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,082
Me and Felipe were
the only ones who stayed.

436
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,452
What are you, doctors?

437
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:40,123
Felipe's a nurse...
a special care provider.

438
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:42,758
Me,

439
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,461
I'm the custodian.

440
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,242
What about the rest
of your crew?

441
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:01,444
The Vatos trickle in

442
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:03,779
to check on their parents,
their grandparents.

443
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:06,883
They see how things are
and most decide to stay.

444
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:09,952
It's a good thing too.
We need the muscle.

445
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:13,389
The people we've encountered
since things fell apart,

446
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:16,225
the worst kind...
plunderers,

447
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,294
the kind that take by force.

448
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:21,164
<i>- That's not who we are.
- How was I to know?</i>

449
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:24,400
My people got attacked and you
show up with Miguel hostage...

450
00:33:24,434 --> 00:33:26,936
appearances.

451
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,572
Guess the world changed.

452
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:31,774
<i>No.</i>

453
00:33:31,808 --> 00:33:35,011
It's the same as it ever was.
The weak get taken.

454
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:39,348
So we do what we can here.

455
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,517
The Vatos work on those cars,

456
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,486
<i>talk about getting the old
people out of the city.</i>

457
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,755
But most can't even get to
the bathroom by themselves,

458
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:49,892
still, it keeps the crew busy,

459
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,827
and that's worth something.

460
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:55,064
So we barred all the windows,

461
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:57,400
welded all the doors shut
except for one entrance.

462
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:58,935
The Vatos, they go out,

463
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:01,470
scavenge what they can
to keep us going.

464
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:05,141
We watch the perimeter
night and day and we wait.

465
00:34:07,444 --> 00:34:09,845
The people here,

466
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,382
they all look to me now.

467
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,952
I don't even know why.

468
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:19,622
Because they can.

469
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,312
Admit it, you only came
back to Atlanta for the hat.

470
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,014
Don't tell anybody.

471
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:47,016
You've given away half
our guns and ammo.

472
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,218
- Not nearly half.
- For what?

473
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,387
Bunch of old farts who are gonna
die off momentarily anyhow?

474
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:53,623
Seriously, how long
you think they got?

475
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:56,459
How long do any of us?

476
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:02,231
- <i>Oh my God.
- Where the hell's our van?</i>

477
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,667
- We left it right there.
Who would take it? - Merle.

478
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,805
He's gonna be taking
some vengeance back to camp.

479
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:24,923
Wrapping paper,
color tissue, anything?

480
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,424
Seriously?

481
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,126
How can you not have any?

482
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,763
Had I been informed of the impending
apocalypse I'd have stocked up.

483
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,432
It's Amy's birthday tomorrow.

484
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:37,569
I've been marking days on the
calendar just to make sure.

485
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,474
You don't give
a gift unwrapped.

486
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:46,611
Deep breath.

487
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:49,247
I'm sure I'll find
something here.

488
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:59,791
I, uh, built up
the rocks all around.

489
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,960
See? So the flames can
be a little higher

490
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,395
and have 'em be hidden.

491
00:36:06,966 --> 00:36:08,667
Hey, Jim.
How you feeling, man?

492
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:11,903
I'm better.
More myself now.

493
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:14,105
I hope you understand
the need for this...

494
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,374
this timeout.

495
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:18,977
I've got others
I've got to think about.

496
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,780
I just want to
make sure there's no...

497
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:23,682
there's no hard feelings.

498
00:36:23,716 --> 00:36:26,384
There's not.
I do understand.

499
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,820
Okay.

500
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,389
Why don't you come
join in with the rest of us?

501
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:33,425
Big ol' fish fry.

502
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:38,363
- I'd like that very much.
- Okay.

503
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:43,535
Why don't you come outside
with everybody?

504
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:46,171
Hell with them people.

505
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,473
Wouldn't piss on them
if their heads were on fire.

506
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,543
Hey!

507
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,812
Why don't you stay here?

508
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:55,213
Keep your daddy company.

509
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:00,518
Ed, she wants to join in.

510
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:03,288
<i>- Come on.
- Fine.</i>

511
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,123
Hell with the both of you.

512
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:07,492
Ain't no need to be bothering me
no more the rest of the night.

513
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,438
<i>- Pass the fish, please.</i>

514
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:23,975
- <i>Here you go.
- Man o man, that's good.</i>

515
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,413
<i>I miss this.</i>

516
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,593
I've got to ask you, man.
It's been driving me crazy.

517
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,695
- What?
- That watch.

518
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,432
What's wrong with my watch?

519
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:50,568
I see you every day,
the same time,

520
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:53,104
winding that thing

521
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:54,973
like a village priest
saying mass.

522
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:57,242
I've wondered this myself.

523
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:00,211
<i>- I'm missing the point.
- Unless I've misread the signs,</i>

524
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:03,481
the world seems to
have come to an end.

525
00:38:03,516 --> 00:38:06,184
At least hit a speed bump
for a good long while.

526
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:09,454
But there's you every day
winding that stupid watch.

527
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:13,358
Time... it's important
to keep track, isn't it?

528
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,760
The days at least.

529
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,328
Don't you think, Andrea?

530
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,431
<i>Back me up here.</i>

531
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,738
I like...
I like what, um,

532
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:30,642
a father said to son
when he gave him a watch

533
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:34,579
that had been handed down
through generations.

534
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:37,015
<i>He said,</i>

535
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:41,219
"I give you the mausoleum"

536
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:43,955
"of all hope and desire,"

537
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,492
"which will fit
your individual needs"

538
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:51,362
"no better than it did mine
or my father's before me;"

539
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:53,565
"I give it to you"

540
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,802
"not that you may remember time,"

541
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:01,773
"but that you may forget it
for a moment"

542
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,442
<i>"now and then"</i>

543
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:08,713
"and not spend all of your
breath trying to conquer it."

544
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,858
You are so weird.

545
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:23,428
It's not me.
It's Faulkner.

546
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:26,965
William Faulkner.
Maybe my bad paraphrasing.

547
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,274
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.

548
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:39,277
Jeez, you try to be
discreet around here...

549
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:48,319
Thought I told y'all to leave
me the hell alone, didn't I?

550
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,024
Hey!

551
00:39:55,161 --> 00:39:57,762
What'd I say?

552
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,600
We're out of toilet paper?

553
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,052
- Mom!
- Carl!

554
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,156
Lori, get him down!

555
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:32,230
<i>Oh my God.</i>

556
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,865
<i>Go! Go!</i>

557
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,048
I'm right here.
Shane, what do we do?

558
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:52,550
- Shane?
- Follow me!

559
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,891
No!
No!

560
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:07,332
Oh God!
Oh my God!

561
00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:10,335
Help me.

562
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:12,637
Oh God, I don't
know what to do.

563
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,038
I don't know what to do.

564
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,177
- Come on. Come on, stay close.
- Carol!

565
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:20,778
Stay close!

566
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:32,790
Come on, y'all!
Work your way up here!

567
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:34,926
Right in front
of you. Shane!

568
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:38,663
Get to the r.V.! Go!

569
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:41,399
- Shane! Shane!
- Stay with me.

570
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:46,904
Stay behind me.
Morales, work up here!

571
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:49,907
- <i>Get behind me!
- Let's go!</i>

572
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,643
<i>Stay with me.</i>

573
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:54,145
<i>Come on, make your
way to the winnebago!</i>

574
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,936
Baby! Carl!

575
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:20,171
Baby!

576
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,040
- Dad!
- Carl!

577
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:52,704
Amy.

578
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:04,349
I don't know what to do, Amy.

579
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:02,573
Oh, Amy.

580
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:20,091
Oh no no.

581
00:44:22,428 --> 00:44:24,595
Amy!

582
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:27,732
Amy!

583
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:30,268
<i>Amy!</i>

584
00:44:30,302 --> 00:44:32,603
I remember my dream now,

585
00:44:32,638 --> 00:44:35,239
why I dug the holes.
