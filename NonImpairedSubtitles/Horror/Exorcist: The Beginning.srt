The hyenas ignored Joseph.

Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin,
that you can't see?

361
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:51,225
Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

362
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:54,094
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

363
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:57,100
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

364
00:35:57,168 --> 00:36:01,104
So, "touched."
What does that mean?

365
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:05,302
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudon, France...

366
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:08,174
was plagued by possession.

367
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:10,840
Thirty-four nuns had
been touched by the devil...

368
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:12,906
committing unspeakable acts.

369
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:16,681
Having orgies including goats
doesn't make them possessed.

370
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:21,088
Simply horny... and inventive.

371
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:25,994
Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

372
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:29,864
Three of them were possessed themselves
and subsequently died.

373
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:33,392
The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

374
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:35,962
with evil.

375
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,033
That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

376
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,807
And that evil remains in Derati.

377
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:46,044
You must be careful there.

378
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:50,110
Remember, he is the father of lies.

379

an exorcism, I'm not your man.

I'm not a priest anymore.

You will always be a priest,

In this part of the world...

it could be a dozen things...
