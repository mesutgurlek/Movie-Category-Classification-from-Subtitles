00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,100
Alright.

17
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,800

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,100
How long is this gonna take mate?

25
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,300
Not long.

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,800
How long is "not long"?

27
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Well, I've almost got it.

28
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,200
Yep.
Yep! Ok.

29
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,100
Yep.

30
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,000

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Yep.
Yep..

32
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
He fancies you.

33
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,500
No he doesn't.

34
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,700
Does.

35
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,800
He fancies you.

36
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I don't think so.

37
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,000
You know, the three of us are going to be stuck in a car together for three weeks
and it'll be trying enough without "Is it me?" or "Is he being weird today?".

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
It'll drive me barmy.

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,300
Yeah. You're right.

40
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,300
He is cute though.

41
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,000
Think he's really got a girlfriend in Sydney?

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,700
Well why would he lie?

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
He's a bloke.

44
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,000
Can't believe we're leaving.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,600
I know.

46
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Feels like two years, not two weeks.

47
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,300
Want a lift?

48
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
I thought I requested purple?

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Hey for 1500 bucks we're lucky it's got doors.

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I love it!

51
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,100
Hey where's my stuff?

52
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,300
Oh we forgot about food for you, sorry.

53
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,200
Yeah we thought you'd get by on our gratitude and appreciation.

54
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

55
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
Where's the booze?

56
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,400
Oh we've made a decision. After last night never drinking again.

57
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,900
Yeah we've got to get an early start if we want to get to Wolf Creek by tomorrow night.

58
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
Uh-huh.

59
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,700
Piss off. Of course I checked.

60
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,000
How much of an organisation nazi is she?

61
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
No, she's right. In bed by 9:30.

62
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
Nothing there to smoke.

63
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,400
Knock it off!
Aww!

64
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,200
Is that your beer?

65
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Archie, pleased to meet ya.

66
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,700
Nice to meet you.

67
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,300
That's a pretty nice handshake there.

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,700
Lovely!

69
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
I can pack a punch.

70
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,800
You can pack a punch? Now why would you want that?

71
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
I would, if I had to.

72
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,600
If you had to? Oooh ho ho.
Yeah.

73
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,100
You wanna listen to some of his bullshit stories.

74
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,700
Aww, bullshit!

75
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,200
In your dreams!
Fuck off!

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,400
Boardy! Guts behind me! 10 foot damn spray!

77
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,800
I think it's past 9:30.

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,200
I got the worst taste in my mouth.

79
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
I'd like to sing, a song for you.

80
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,400
Ok, I'll restart again.

81
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,500
I love her, I really really love her.

82
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,600
Make me smile, all the time.

83
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,900
When you cook my food, when you clean my room.
I love you Mum, I love you Mum.

84
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,800
He's been playing guitar for a few weeks now.
And he's really really really crap.

85
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Really Crap. Really shit.

86
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Oh my god.

87
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,900
Yeah that's cool.

88
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,800
Thats amazing.

89
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,700
You do know you're near the world's 5th biggest UFO siting?

90
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,100
Get fucked.

91
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,700
Christy, I'm serious!

92
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,500
Well I know!

93
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,200
Well don't.. I can hear you laughing!

94
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,500
What? I'm listening!

95
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,600
Fine.

96
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,400
I'm listening. Go! Tell me!

97
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,100
Nah, don't worry about it!

98
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,300
Just tell me. I'm listening.

99
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,600
Alright, well I heard about this guy who driving on the highway out there.

100
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,900
And, he see's this light ahead of him. Around 500 metres.

101
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,400
And, first he thinks it's a truck or a semi-trailer or something
coz the light's really bright, like glowing orange and shit.

102
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,100
Yeah.

103
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:59,200
But as he gets closer he realizes the lights about 10 metres off the ground,
it's hanging in mid air.

104
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,000
So he's scared. He's freaking out.

105
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,900
And then he hears this CRACK. Like an explosion.

106
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,100
That was supposed to scare us.

107
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,500
I know, it's not scary.

108
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,700
Alright, but he did. He heard this crack.

109
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,200
Like an explosion, of a jet.

110
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,600
And it just took off into the sky. Straight up like a rocket.

111
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,500
And then as soon as it was gone, his car just stopped in the middle of the road.

112
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,700
And it was totally silent, and he was just sitting there.

113
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,300
Staring up at the stars.

114
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,400
In the middle of nowhere.

115
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
Hey!
For no reason, just stopped.

116
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Is that a true story?
Absolutely!
He's got something.. You've got something dripping off the side of your lip there.

117
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,500
Oh, it's all right. It was just bullshit.

118
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,900
Nah bullshit you mate!

119
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
What's all this shit?

120
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,700
Oh it's the tent.

121
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,100
Yeah for the tent. Here I'll do that. Start on the tent.

122
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
No, you do the tent.

123
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,200
I don't know what you two would do without me.

124
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,400
I didn't finish that.

125
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Oh sorry.

126
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I finished it for you.

127
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,100
Alright?

128
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,400
Now we've just got a six hour drive.

129
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200
Who's driving first?

130
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,000
Who's driving first?

131
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,200
I don't know, I'll go in the back. Is that alright with you?

132
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,800
Yeah.

133
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Yeah alright, we'll go in there.

134
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,600
Do you want to drive?

135
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,700
Well, well, well.

136
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,300
Hey umm, can I have the keys?

137
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,400
Oh it's ok you two. I've got it, thanks!

138
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,800
No problems guys.

139
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,700
Hows the hair?

140
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Day One, Captains Log: So far no sign of intelligent lifeforms.

141
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Starting to doubt.. Hey..

142
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,100
Howdy.
Howdy.

143
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Umm, do you wanna say hello?

144
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,000
Hello.

145
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,200
Righto, whats your name?

146
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,300
Graham.
Graham.

147
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,500
Nice to meet you Graham.

148
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,400
I'm Ben.

149
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,900
This one too?
Yeah mate.

150
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,700
I think someone's got a crush on you.

151
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah the attendant, I thught so. Graham.
No.

152
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,100
Uh uh.

153
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,600
Aww.

154
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm getting the feeling it's mutual. Am I wrong?

155
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
You know it's true.

156
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,800
Aww, do you mind?

157
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,700
I think it's absolutely fabulous.

158
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,200
Don't go dicking her around, because she's totally brilliant.
If you hurt her I'm gonna have to kill you.

159
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,600
So my advice is we all have an awesome time together.
You sort out what is going on between you and this girlfriend
you've allegedly got.

160
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,800
By the time we get to Cairns we'll find some freakishly hot man for me.

161
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,800
And we'll all go crazy together, alright?

162
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,600
Alright.

163
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,800
Mmm, she's only a little one isn't she.

164
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,200
I bet we could break that in half real quickly hey?

165
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,700
Heh, and you'd still be watching mate.

166
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,900
Here comes yours now mate.

167
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,200
What a place huh?

168
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,000
Hey uh, hey mate, oi.

169
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,200
Oi.

170
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,900
Hey come here, got a question for you.

171
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,100
Alright.

172
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,100
How you going?

173
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,100
Hey uh, me and me mates are gonna see if your girlfriends
would be interested in a little bit of a gang bang?

174
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,500
We just wanna make sure it's alright with you first.

175
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
Yeah good on ya.. fuckhead.

176
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Oi, what did you say?

177
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,200
I said..

178
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,400
I said thats um, a nice smile you got.

179
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,000
Dazza, don't be a dickhead.

180
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,200
See you later sweetheart.

181
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Bye!

182
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Fucking arseholes.

183
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,700
Bunch of morons, honestly.

184
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, forget about it Ben.

185
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,300
Ahh, should have smashed him.

186
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,400
I should have Tai Chi'd his arse.

187
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,200
I'm serious!

188
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,900
Weather's shit.

189
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
Yeah all of a sudden.

190
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,300
I think it's the start of the wet season, so..

191
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,800
Thats beautiful over there isn't it.

192
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,000
That light coming up through the mountains is gorgeous.

193
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,700
I hope it doesn't rain.

194
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,600
What?

195
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,800
I said I hope it doesn't rain.

196
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,400
Man it's gonna be cold tonight, and I mean cold.

197
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,500
Great.

198
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,100
Hey I think that's the start of it.

199
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,100
Says in there you've got to climb over the top.

200
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,800
Umm, yep.

201
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,400
Aww..

202
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
What was that?

203
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,000
Rock.

204
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,300
There's just nothing out here.

205
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,400
Yeah, it's great.

206
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,100
Here we go. Wolf Creek Crater!

207
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,500
The crater, we're here!

208
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,700
Walking trail!
Walking trail! Allow three hours.

209
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,400
Three hours?

210
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,200
So is that three hours to get all the way into the middle or just to get up to the top?

211
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,300
I'd imagine to the top.

212
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:30,700
No camping, hiking is allowed. Put your rubbish in a bin. No fires. Ok.

213
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Ok, let's go.

214
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,300
Madame.
Thankyou.

215
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,500
Wolf Creek awaits you.

216
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,900
Oh wow.

217
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Wolf Creek!

218
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,200
Wow..

219
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,500
What is with this weather?

220
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,300
Maybe we should take an umbrella.

221
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,300
Yeah.

222
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,500
Yeah definitely.

223
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Alright, so what do you want to take? Definitely this!

224
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,200
All of it.
All that what's in the esky.
All the food.

225
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
And who's carrying all this?

226
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,200
You are.

227
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,700
Just all of it.

228
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,500
Alright, three hours.

229
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,400
Let's do it!

230
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,700
Let's go.

231
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, wait!

232
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,600
Oh there's poo everywhere, yay!

233
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,000
We're on the poo planet.

234
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,600
What are you doing? It's not even raining that bad.

235
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Yeah it is.

236
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
It's freezing and I've got no jumper.

237
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,600
Where did the meteorite go?
It's in the middle.

238
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,900
It just went into the ground?
Yep.

239
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,100
Look how good it looks.

240
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,200
Cooooeee!

241
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,800
Come on!

242
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,100
You alright?

243
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,600
Wow.

244
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,000
That's impressive.

245
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Yeah you're looking at one of the biggest meteorite craters on the planet.

246
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,700
They reckon that the explosion from the impact would have been like 200 nuclear
bombs going off at the same time.

247
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,900
Some guys discovered it scouting for an ore company in 1947.

248
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
Imagine being the first person to see it.

249
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,200
Hey come on, let's go.

250
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,900
You right?

251
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,900
This is great Ben.

252
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,200
Yeah, just fantastic. Thank you.

253
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,100
Such a sweetheart arent you?

254
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,500
Loving it.

255
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Yeah.. it's great.

256
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,700
Sorry, I didn't know.

257
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,900
It'll clear, give it a couple of hours.

258
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Thankyou.

259
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,800
Back soon.

260
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,500
Where you going?

261
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
I wonder why the meteor hit here.

262
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,000
In this place. Nowhere else.

263
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,100
Maybe it was..

264
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,300
drawn to something in the earth.

265
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,100
Like when lightning strikes.

266
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,400
Hmm.

267
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah?

268
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,400
Hmm.

269
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,600
Hi!

270
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,000
Hey!

271
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,100
That's awesome.

272
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,200
I was wondering what that would be like.

273
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,800
Chris, what's the time?

274
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,700
Err, don't know, watch has stopped.

275
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,800
Looks like Niagara Falls. Woo!

276
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,300
Hey have you got the time?

277
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,600
Ahh no, it's busted.

278
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,600
I'd say it's about 7?

279
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,700
So about an hour till dark.

280
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,800
Make it back to Halls Creek easy

281
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,600
Christie's watch stopped too.

282
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,300
Bullshit.. really?

283
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,200
Yeah.

284
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,300
6:30. Mine too.

285
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,300
What? Batteries or something?

286
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,900
You got the keys?

287
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Make sure you warm her up first.

288
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,300
It's weird weather hey?

289
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,100
Yeah I reckon. God.

290
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,100
See you later Wolf Creek.

291
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,400
What's wrong?

292
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,500
I don't know.

293
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,400
Did we leave the lights on?

294
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,700
No.
No.

295
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,900
Is it.. Is it in gear?

296
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,500
Nah, Try.. Try again.

297
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,900
Ahh.. fuck.

298
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,800
Ok..

299
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,500
Shit..

300
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,300
Alright, pop.. pop the hood.

301
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,200
It's probably just the battery terminals.

302
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,400
Do you know what you're looking for?

303
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,200
You gonna tell Liz?

304
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,300
I've got a feeling she already knows.

305
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,700
I'll go see what I can do.

306
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,300
You didn't leave the lights on did you?

307
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,900
No.
No.

308
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,800
Looks like we might be spending the night.

309
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,400
This is fucked.

310
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,300
Bitch.

311
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,800
Do you think it means anything?

312
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,300
I mean.. 

313
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,500
the watches, and the car not working.

314
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,600
What do you mean?

315
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,200
Well.. you know the stories I was telling you last night about the UFO's and stuff.

316
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,100
and..

317
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,400
when they were around..

318
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,500
well.. things stopped working.

319
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,000
Could be the same kind of thing.

320
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,600
Ben I really don't think we need to be talking about that right now.

321
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,500
Ok..

322
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,400
There's something out there.

323
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,500
And it ain't no man.
No. No. I saw some lights.

324
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,200
Where?

325
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,100
Right.. 

326
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,500
Right there. There.

327
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,800
What the hell?

328
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,000
Nah, nah, nah! Don't fucking.. what?

329
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,100
Well it might be a car!

330
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,300
Well it might not be a car!

331
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,200
That don't look like no car!

332
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,900
Shit. It's coming this way.

333
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,500
Fuck it is coming this way!

334
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,600
Shit!

335
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,800
Fuck!

336
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,700
Shit it is coming this way!

337
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,900
Well should we run?

338
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,900
No, no, no, no! Just stay in the car!

339
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,900
Don't move!

340
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,100
Hang on it's a car!

341
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,600
Well how do you know?

342
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
It's a bloody car.

343
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Shit!

344
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,900
You can hear the engine!

345
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,200
Well what the bloody hell are you mob doing out here?

346
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,100
Scared the shit out of me!

347
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
We thought it was aliens!

348
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Well.. she did.

349
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,800
Hi.

350
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,600
Yeah it was pissing down with rain earlier. I was just about to chuck it in. Lucky for you mob I decided to hang around a bit longer hey?

351
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,200
Yeah, we were just getting ready to spend the night too.

352
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,600
Ahh well, we'll get you out of here quick smart.

353
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,400
Aww. If I can undo the bloody spark plug.

354
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,800
Where you heading?

355
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
Darwin, sort of.

356
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
Ahh yeah and then onto Cairns. That's where we're really headed.

357
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,300
Ahh.. long drive.

358
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,300
Yeah.
Yeah, it's too long.

359
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,400
British are ya's?
Yeah.

360
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,800
That's right, yeah.

361
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Ben's an Aussie though.

362
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,300
Yeah? Where ya from mate?

363
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,900
Sydney.

364
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,100
Poofta capital of Australia!

365
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,200
Ahh, just playing with you tiger. Never been over there myself.

366
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Lucky you sheila's are travelling with a bloke.

367
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,800
Can't be too careful.

368
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,700
Nothing wrong with the battery.

369
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,700
I told you we'd be alright.

370
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:44,000
You know he's hilarious. He's like one of those guys from the outback Australia shows. Crocodile Dundee.

371
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,200
Yeah he's a pisser.

372
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,700
Well you're an Aussie Ben. How come you don't talk like him?

373
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,600
You want the bad news or the really bad news?

374
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,900
Well your coil's rooted.

375
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,600
Cactus.. You're not going nowhere.

376
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,500
Well what can we do?

377
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,700
Fuck I hate it totally checked before we left.
Ben.

378
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
Well there must be something we can do?

379
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah well, you take the old one out, bung the new one in, and Bob's your sister.

380
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,100
Only good news is I got the gear to do it.

381
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,800
Problem is it's back at my camp, just down the road a'ways.

382
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,300
Well I'm going back down there anyways so I could give you a tow.

383
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,000
Fix it tongight, probably have you on the road by the morning.

384
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,000
Otherwise, someone will be coming through here.

385
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,300
Eventually.

386
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,900
Anyway, make up your mind coz I gotta get a rattle on.

387
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,100
Yeah Thanks.
Thankyou.
Thankyou.

388
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,300
Well what do you guys want to do?

389
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,000
Might as well.

390
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,100
Well he's not going to fix it for free is he? I mean, what if he wants a couple of hundred pounds or something?

391
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,200
A thousand? What?

392
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,600
Ok, ok, well first we gotta find out if he wants any money or not.

393
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,200
I don't have a lot of cash on me.

394
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
Me neither.

395
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,600
Neither have I.

396
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,500
Why don't we get him to tow us back into town and we'll get someone there to fix it?

397
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,300
Yeah.

398
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,700
Ok.

399
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,200
Why don't you go on? You go and ask him.

400
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
I don't want to ask him.

401
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
No go on. It's a bloke thing. Go on.

402
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Yeah you ask him, it's a bloke thing.

403
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,600
Oh, it's a bloke thing.

404
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,300
Do you need any help?

405
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
Nah I'm alright thanks son.

406
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,800
Alright.

407
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,300
Got a certain way of putting it in, you know?

408
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:28,600
I know it's a long way, but the girls were wondering if you could tow us back into town? I mean, we don't want to put you out any more than we already have.

409
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:36,500
Look I'd really like to help you mate but I'm not heading that way, you know. If you don't want the lift well that's up to you. But I'm heading south.

410
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,100
South..

411
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,400
Yeah south.

412
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,100
You wanna go north. I'm heading south.

413
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,300
Bit of a bugger.
Bugger!

414
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,900
So umm..

415
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,700
Well. with that coil and stuff.
Yeah.

416
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
How much would that cost?

417
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,100
Say if we just got..

418
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,800
It's not fucking Pitt Street mate. Course I'm not gonna charge you, ya stupid bastard.

419
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,400
You hear that?

420
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,700
How much?

421
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Ahh, you sure?

422
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,700
Ahh jesus you make me laugh.

423
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,100
You must keep the little buggers amused? Hey?

424
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,900
Yeah.

425
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,600
Amusing the bloody bejesus out of me.

426
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,200
Alright, well I'll get the girls going.

427
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,400
Well that'd be a good idea.

428
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,200
Alrighty.

429
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,600
Well off you go.
Off I go.

430
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,800
Where did he say his place was again?

431
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,100
South.

432
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,800
Feels like we've been driving for hours.

433
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,300
Well it shouldn't be too far.

434
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,200
That's what you said an hour ago.

435
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,000
Well ok, lets just get him to drop us off here then. Alright?

436
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,000
It's cool.

437
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,500
He said it was gonna be a bit of a drive didn't he.

438
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,300
It's cool.

439
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,200
Must be some sort of mining operation.

440
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,000
Mmm, looks like a ghost town.

441
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
We're here.

442
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,100
Thank god.

443
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,700
Wherever here is.

444
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Have plenty of water there if you want it.

445
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,700
Oh thank you. It's one thing we don't have plenty of.
Thank you.

446
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,400
Cheers.

447
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,300
Nothing like rain water from the top end.

448
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,500
Hey Mick, this place is amazing.

449
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,900
Can't believe they just walked out and left all this stuff here.

450
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,300
Plenty of places like this all over the outback. Thousands of them. Places people have forgotten about.

451
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,700
Sposed to be a whole town out there somewhere. Got lost in a 6 month dust storm back in the 40's.

452
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,500
People just walked away.

453
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,300
I heard of blokes getting lost in their own farms.

454
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,400
You know, just never found their way out.

455
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,800
On their own property? It's amazing.

456
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,800
There's one up here that crosses three states right.

457
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,000
Takes 6 days to drive across.

458
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,700
No.

459
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,800
I.. I used to work out there once.

460
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,600
What did you do there?

461
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,500
Head shooter.

462
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,900
You know, clearing vermin. Roo's, horses, pigs, buffalo. You name it.

463
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,600
Don't work there no more.

464
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,900
Yeah yeah, they use poisons, you know, instead of shooters.

465
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,200
Used to.. Used to fly in with the helicopters.

466
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,700
You fly in low over a herd of water buffalo.

467
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,900
Sometimes take out 50 head in an afternoon.

468
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,800
I wore out 5 bolts on a .303 one year!

469
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,400
Pigs, now pigs were different.

470
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,100
You have to get in close. Get the dogs onto them. Then you go in with a knife.

471
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,100
You had to get in under them, you know, while the pig is fighting off the dogs.

472
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,800
And you had to be quick or you'd lose your guts on it's tusk! It's sharp!

473
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:12,100
I seen a big boar pig, right, take a pit bulls head clean off one time.

474
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,200
His little legs still pumping away.

475
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,300
Fair dinkum!

476
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,300
Fair dinkum?

477
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,000
That's what I said.

478
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,000
Fair dinkum.

479
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,700
Wow..

480
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,800
Poor little fella.

481
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,800
So umm, where do you live?

482
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,900
Oh I get around you know.

483
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,700
Never know where I might pop up!

484
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,800
Man you must love the freedom.

485
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,500
What?

486
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,600
The freedom.

487
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,200
You know, you must love it.

488
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,800
Well you know, hanging out in nature and shit.

489
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,600
Right..

490
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,900
You get to like, you know, cruise around the bush.

491
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,000
Saying cool stuff like..

492
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,500
That's not a knife, this is a knife!

493
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,700
What do you actually do.. now?

494
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,800
I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

495
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,400
So you don't really shoot kangaroos do you?

496
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,100
Nah look I'm doing people a service taking out a few roos. They're everywhere out here now.

497
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,400
Like tourists.

498
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,200
Excuse moi.

499
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,500
Your turn.

500
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,400
Fair go!

501
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,200
Bloody women here son!

502
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,700
Well umm..

503
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,000
I'll let you know when I get her going. What do you reckon?

504
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Thankyou.

505
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,700
Thankyou.

506
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,900
Thanks!

507
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,100
But then I'd have to kill you.

508
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,600
What?

509
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,500
Well did you see they way he was looking at you?

510
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,300
He's just trying to impress us with his great big white hunter thing there.

511
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,500
Yeah but he's doing us a favour and he probably doesn't appreciate us cracking jokes at his expense. Seriously.

512
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,700
Lets just get the car fixed.

513
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,800
Yeah thats what we're doing. Don't freak out.

514
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,800
You right?

515
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,900
Fine thanks.

516
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,100
Thanks again for helping us out.

517
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,100
No worries.

518
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,800
Obviously it'll be great to get going as soon as possible.

519
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,100
No worries.

520
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:07,700

Please don't kill me. Please.

524
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,500
Please!

525
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,800

Don't!

529
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,000
Don't kill me!

530
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,500
Bang!

531
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,100
Well nothing happens when the bolt's open you see.

532
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,100

The look on your fucking face.

536
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,900
Why are you doing this?

537
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:12,000
Please if you let me go I won't tell anyone.

538
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,200
I won't! I won't.

539
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,300
Now now, calm down. Listen to Uncle Michael. Come on.

540
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:25,100
Now, as I keep telling you, I always use a rubber with you cunts.

See that stupid bitch over there?

571
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,600
She loved to play.

572
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,600
Oh she lasted a good few months.

573
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,100
We were great together you know?

574
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,200
Till she lost her head.

575
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,200
How about..

576
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,600
How about I cut your tits off hey?

577

581
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,800
Let her go.

To see the lights over!

601
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,400
Come with me.

602
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,100
Are you joking?

603
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,400
Come on.

604
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,200
He's going to check on us.

605
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,400
Let's go.

606

Did you see Ben?

608
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,200
She'd been alive for months.

609
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,800
We've got to move.

610
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,800
He's going to do that to us.

611
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,600
Can't go that way.

612
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,100
He's going to see we're not down there.
I know. I know!

613
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,200
I've got his set of keys. He must have more cars.

614
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,600
I'm not going back there.

615
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,300
Chris, we're in the middle of fucking nowhere. We need a car.

616
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,600
Come on.

Don't leave me! Please. What if he catches me again?

629

Just 5 minutes ok? It's ok. It's alright. It's ok.

642
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:30,900
Don't go.
