1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:03,264
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:05,741
I only want Negan.

3
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:07,210
A single bullet ain't gonna do it.

4
00:00:07,312 --> 00:00:09,078
Best case, maybe you take him out.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,846
Then make me a bullet.

6
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:13,249
Everything we have, we got from fighting.

7
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:16,419
We play by their rules,
we get some kinda life.

8
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:18,121
You led us all to the promise land,

9
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:19,755
isn't that right, Rick?

10
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:21,524
He we are!

11
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:24,060
Oh, I like it here.

12
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:25,828
Saviors can actually be quite reasonable.

13
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:32,795
Maggie.

14
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:39,902
I know people are saying things...

15
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:43,872
nice things about you and Sasha?

16
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:47,510
They are?

17
00:01:47,512 --> 00:01:49,044
They are.

18
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:51,581
About the other night...

19
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:56,152
about how they're thinking
you saved the place.

20
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:58,421
Don't let it go to your head.

21
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:03,726
Well, don't let it bother you.

22
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:05,495
It seems like it bothers you.

23
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:17,740
What you doing up there?

24
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:22,311
You gonna eat that?

25
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:24,913
Yes.

26
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:27,850
Dude.

27
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,752
You know she's pregnant.

28
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:58,947
Against the grain, kid.

29
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,918
Always against the grain.

30
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:17,694
_

31
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,558
Damn, that smells good.

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,599
Want a taste?

33
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,438
Okay.

34
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,251
Here's his damn lemonade.

35
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:10,052
I had some in my kitchen.

36
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:14,022
Denise liked it.

37
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:21,864
Thank you.

38
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:22,965
Hey.

39
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:26,969
Go home.

40
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,771
Let me take over.

41
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,441
No.

42
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:35,444
I'm fine.

43
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:39,482
I told Rick I would watch Judith.

44
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:40,983
I'm gonna do that.

45
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,190
You should go.

46
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:51,427
We're about to sit.

47
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,490
We're gonna need another setting.

48
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:50,619
Today and only today, right?

49
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:52,355
Yeah.

50
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:58,728
All these bullet holes...

51
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,296
this'll take on water quick.

52
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:09,405
We can probably make it to the canoe.

53
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,939
Probably.

54
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:14,910
If you want to stay back...

55
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:18,748
I'm going to pretend you
didn't just say that.

56
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:36,432
I'm seeing this through.

57
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,433
We both are.

58
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:05,428
I'm not waiting for your dad anymore.

59
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,097
I don't know where the hell he is,

60
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,966
but Lucille...

61
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:16,605
...is hungry.

62
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:25,481
Carl, pass the rolls...

63
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:31,019
...Please.

64
00:07:34,762 --> 00:08:12,780

65
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,384
Look at that, huh?

66
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:31,805
Easy as that.

67
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:35,175
It's just a transaction.

68
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:36,944
You look like shit,

69
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:38,245
which means you fought for this.

70
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:39,713
You did your jobs.

71
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,550
You get it, and I like that.

72
00:08:43,552 --> 00:08:45,552
Negan likes that.

73
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,991
That's... good to hear.

74
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:53,994
You play your cards right,

75
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:57,197
maybe I'll show you where we live.

76
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,966
Maybe I'll buy you a sandwich.

77
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:09,409
Just tell me when.

78
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:11,411
You like watching, haircut?

79
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:13,413
Yes.

80
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:15,049
I mean...

81
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:18,085
You mean to get
the hell out of here.

82
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:19,286
Now!

83
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:57,191
Morgan.

84
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,197
It's just some things from
the Kingdom garden...

85
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:06,233
some nectarines, some apples.

86
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,301
Thank you. I am good.

87
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,770
You can fend for yourself, I know,

88
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:12,206
but fresh produce isn't
something you can just...

89
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,140
Really.

90
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,376
I'm good.

91
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,648
Ezekiel?

92
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,550
Apparently, some people are
having a hard time believing me

93
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:26,319
when I say I just want to be left alone.

94
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:29,723
You know, I was trying to
leave you alone, and I will.

95
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:33,026
But you called me over.

96
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,161
Why?

97
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:35,428
How are you?

98
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,965
Good.

99
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,299
Good.

100
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:40,634
Now you can go.

101
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,773
I think you're going soft.

102
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:47,474
I think you're going.

103
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,682
- Hey.
- Hi.

104
00:10:57,219 --> 00:10:58,485
Carol, hi.

105
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:00,654
I'm sorry to bother you.

106
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:03,290
Morgan, I-I didn't expect
you to be here, too.

107
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:05,859
It's good you are.

108
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,527
I wanted to speak to you both, actually.

109
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:09,096
It's about something important.

110
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:17,470
Almost at the canoe.

111
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:21,041
We're taking on water quick, man.

112
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:22,176
I know.

113
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:33,320
Rick, on the left!

114
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:05,986
We're almost there.

115
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:24,338
No, no!

116
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:32,545
Hold on!

117
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:34,114
Hold on!

118
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:35,448
Stay in the canoe!

119
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,985
I can... Just...

120
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:41,488
Aaron!

121
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,290
Aaron!

122
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:52,632
Aaron!

123
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:00,007
I'm okay.

124
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,875
I'm all right.

125
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,545
I'm okay.

126
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:06,880
I'm okay.

127
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,780
Stop hugging the wall.

128
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:41,648
Watch it!

129
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:47,487
God damn it!

130
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:52,392
Go get a mop and another barrel.

131
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:54,294
We're keeping this crap?

132
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:56,663
We don't have to eat it.

133
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,465
Jesus. He hates pickles.

134
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,209
It's got hooks.

135
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:10,978
I don't know why he didn't strap it in.

136
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,513
Told him twice. His
stupid ass didn't listen.

137
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:39,740
Okay.

138
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:41,526
CONGRATS FOR WINNING BUT YOU STILL LOSE!

139
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:49,082
Bit of a sore loser.

140
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,887
Looks like the only thing
he ran out of was ammo.

141
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:57,424
We got to get this back now.

142
00:14:57,426 --> 00:14:58,492
Yeah.

143
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:03,696
Well... he's got paddles.

144
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:05,232
And with the wind picking up,

145
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:07,834
it shouldn't take long
to drift back to shore.

146
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:11,405
Easy. Easy.

147
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:13,473
We got it. Take this crap back.

148
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,375
How 'bout, this time,
you watch where you're going?

149
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:18,512
Oh, come on. Get off his back.

150
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,531
You know, back there,

151
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:41,901
I didn't mean that you couldn't do it.

152
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:45,572
It's just...

153
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:48,575
going this far, risking this much

154
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:49,876
to get things for them...

155
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:51,878
people don't agree with it.

156
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,980
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.

157
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,821
I was there.

158
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:06,493
I saw what happened on the road.

159
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:09,929
What we're doing is gonna
keep people living.

160
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:12,299
We get to do that,

161
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:15,302
it doesn't matter what happens to us.

162
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:17,471
Michonne doesn't think this is living.

163
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:24,043
Well, committing to a choice like this,

164
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:27,780
after living how we did... free...

165
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:28,881
I get it.

166
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:33,386
It's hard.

167
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:34,654
It's giving up everything,

168
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:39,959
right up until your own life.

169
00:16:39,961 --> 00:16:43,830
But either your heart's
beating, or it isn't.

170
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:45,798
Your loved ones' hearts are
beating, or they aren't.

171
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:53,406
We take what they give
us so that we can live.

172
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:30,378
So, how long you been with Negan?

173
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:38,782
Why were you out there alone?

174
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,718
Tell me!

175
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,067
You think talking won't
change how this ends for you.

176
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:00,369
But you don't know me.

177
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,309
Let's see what happens.

178
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:26,930
I'm not gonna kill him today.

179
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:29,866
I'm gonna find the way that we win.

180
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,371
I'm gonna change how this ends for me.

181
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,575
That's why I'm out here alone.

182
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:52,088
Is that an apple pie?

183
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:53,756
How did you do that?

184
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,558
I could smell it from outside the door.

185
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:58,294
You baked it?

186
00:18:58,296 --> 00:19:01,731
Some guy gave it to us
for what we did.

187
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:04,033
His little girl said you should
run for President of Hilltop.

188
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,502
"Maggie for President."

189
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,777
Do you want a plate?

190
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,746
No, I'm good.

191
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:20,383
Did Jesus give you those?

192
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:23,652
Is he still around?

193
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:27,269
There's some things I wanna
add to his list before he goes out.

194
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,060
The kids need something to
write with... pens, pencils.

195
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:32,428
Are you already president?

196
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:34,898
I've just been talking to people.

197
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,466
Jesus left this morning.

198
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,169
He told me to tell you, but I-I forgot.

199
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,239
Okay. Next time.

200
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:44,473
I'm gonna get some milk.

201
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,142
- Let me.
- No, I'm good.

202
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,851
What?

203
00:19:55,853 --> 00:19:58,955
You're lying to Maggie about Jesus.

204
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:03,626
What makes you say that?

205
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:05,361
A girl who lives in the house.

206
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:06,996
She was telling me about everyone.

207
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,231
She said Jesus is a runner

208
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:10,366
and that he left yesterday,

209
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:11,767
not this morning.

210
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:16,605
- It's for her own good.
- Why?

211
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:19,342
Because I need to do something,

212
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,843
and she'll want to help me.

213
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:24,847
You want to kill Negan.

214
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:32,355
What if you have help?

215
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,211
If we had help... a lot of people...

216
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:36,725
then I wouldn't be afraid to tell her,

217
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:39,295
because she'd know it
wasn't on her to do it.

218
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:42,131
- But if it's just me, then.
- It isn't just you.

219
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,566
You and Maggie aren't the only ones

220
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:44,800
who want to take Negan out.

221
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:45,734
- There's...
- No, Enid.

222
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:46,936
That's not happening.

223
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:48,171
And if you care about her,

224
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:49,538
you don't say anything about this.

225
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:53,576
We have to keep her safe.

226
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:57,513
You have to keep her safe.

227
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:02,285
It isn't just you.

228
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:09,558
It sure looks like it.

229
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,009
A lot of places came
together after the world fell apart.

230
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:18,147
Maybe you're both from
one of those places.

231
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:23,207
Most of those communities
and camps are gone now.

232
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,142
I lost people.

233
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:30,281
I pretty much lost hope in people.

234
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:32,849
But then I found the Kingdom.

235
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:36,320
I met Ezekiel.

236
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:37,821
I saw what he built.

237
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:40,624
But now I believe what he
built is under threat.

238
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:41,892
The Saviors.

239
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:45,862
The Saviors.

240
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,498
A few months back,

241
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,901
Ezekiel and a few guards met a
group of them in the woods.

242
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:53,504
The Saviors recognized
Ezekiel's capabilities,

243
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:55,506
and Ezekiel didn't want to fight,

244
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:56,807
so they cut a deal.

245
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:58,909
In exchange for food and supplies,

246
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:00,377
no one would get hurt,

247
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:03,046
and they'd never set
foot inside the Kingdom,

248
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:05,182
and very few of us even know.

249
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:07,384
What does any of this have to do with me?

250
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:09,286
I know Ezekiel likes you.

251
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,122
I also know that Ezekiel trusts you,

252
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,657
and that's why I'm here.

253
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:16,527
I need you to help me
convince him of something.

254
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:19,095
Right now, we have peace
with the Saviors,

255
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,598
but sooner or later,
sometimes's gonna go wrong.

256
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,834
Maybe we'll be light on a drop,

257
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:26,670
or maybe one of ours will look
at one of theirs the wrong way,

258
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:31,074
or maybe they'll just decide
to stop honoring the deal.

259
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,978
Things will go bad.

260
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,413
And when they do...

261
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:41,952
...the Kingdom will fall.

262
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,825
I had a family.

263
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:51,528
I lost it to this world.

264
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,531
I saw them die.

265
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:58,736
I'm scared that, if we
don't do something now,

266
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:01,705
that we won't only lose more people...
we'll lose everything.

267
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:05,075
I know what the Saviors are,
and I know what they do.

268
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:08,412
And I know they cannot be trusted.

269
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:13,216
And I think you know that, too.

270
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,921
What exactly are you asking?

271
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:21,776
I'm asking you to help convince Ezekiel

272
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:25,896
to attack the Saviors, to strike first...

273
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:27,097
and destroy them.

274
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,870
Is that for you...

275
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:39,342
or Negan?

276
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,013
It's for him.

277
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,384
How will you do it?

278
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,687
I'll pull the trigger.

279
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:53,389
They'll kill you.

280
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,993
As long as he goes first.

281
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:59,829
Why do you have to die?

282
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:01,998
Because he has to.

283
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,372
I agree.

284
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:10,706
But...

285
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,680
...Why do you?

286
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:22,752
There's...

287
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:28,557
...No need to lie to me if...

288
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,627
this is our last conversation.

289
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:41,604
If Abraham was alive, we could fight.

290
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,908
If Glenn was,

291
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:50,479
Maggie's kid would have a father.

292
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:54,317
Michonne and Carl can fight.

293
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,320
They have Rick.

294
00:24:57,322 --> 00:25:01,257
Aaron has Eric.

295
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,261
Eugene knows things.

296
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:07,596
Daryl's strong.

297
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:11,801
What about Sasha?

298
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,516
Look at me, Rosita.

299
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,791
It shouldn't have been you.

300
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:41,965
It shouldn't have been anyone.

301
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:44,334
We'll win,

302
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:47,636
but we need to wait for the right moment

303
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:50,639
or create it...

304
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:53,576
together.

305
00:25:53,578 --> 00:25:56,312
And you're a part of that together.

306
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:01,550
Don't do this.

307
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:08,024
We need you.

308
00:27:05,817 --> 00:27:08,151
Okay. I know
there's a lot of them.

309
00:27:08,153 --> 00:27:10,954
I'm guessing a good deal more
than we have at the Kingdom.

310
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:13,356
The element of surprise is our only hope.

311
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:14,557
We need to attack first,

312
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,858
and we need to do it now

313
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,560
while we still have the advantage.

314
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:22,898
Carol, I imagine that
violence and fighting

315
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,767
is something you haven't been a part of.

316
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:27,370
You're wrong.

317
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:29,072
You're very wrong.

318
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:31,807
She's probably the most
capable fighter in this room.

319
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:33,876
Then it's time to fight.

320
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:37,480
No.

321
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:40,283
This is something I am not a part of.

322
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,717
Then you don't have to fight.

323
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:43,519
You just have to convince Ezekiel

324
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:45,121
to bring the Kingdom to fight.

325
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,223
You're not understanding me.

326
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:48,724
I didn't want you.

327
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:50,793
I didn't want Ezekiel
or Morgan coming here.

328
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,329
And I don't want anything
to do with your lives

329
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:55,431
or your deaths.

330
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,800
I just want to be left alone.

331
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,809
People will die... a lot of them.

332
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,577
You killed a man.

333
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:10,446
I took a life to save a life.

334
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:12,748
It's the same goddamn thing!

335
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,850
We'll be taking their lives to save ours!

336
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:16,452
Only you don't know that it will!

337
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:19,022
You're gonna choose to
kill one day, Morgan,

338
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:21,024
'cause it will get that bad!

339
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:25,761
Why not choose now,

340
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:27,830
before you lose someone you care about?

341
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,332
There's a peace now.

342
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,800
I won't be a part of changing that.

343
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:33,836
And maybe we can build on that.

344
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,171
Not with these people!

345
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:37,273
When they turn on us... and they will...

346
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:39,608
that blood is gonna be on your hands!

347
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,650
But maybe you're both used to that.

348
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:53,456
You should go, too.

349
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,525
I should.

350
00:28:57,662 --> 00:29:00,896
I don't want anyone else coming around

351
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:02,731
or even knowing where I am.

352
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,967
If you somehow see anyone we know,

353
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:06,902
tell them I'm gone.

354
00:29:06,904 --> 00:29:08,571
Do that for me please.

355
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:10,306
Never meant for you to see me.

356
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:00,948
Hi.

357
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:03,917
Hi.

358
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,956
Hi.

359
00:30:17,654 --> 00:30:22,225
NO CAMPING AT THIS AREA

360
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,141
Hot date?

361
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:40,518
I'm on a good momentum
with them. Gonna try to use that.

362
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:42,683
Yeah? How?

363
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,590
By trying to get closer,
even just to start trying.

364
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:51,258
If I can do that, after a while...

365
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,593
maybe months, maybe years...

366
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:54,928
maybe then we try something.

367
00:31:56,699 --> 00:31:59,567
I think it's what my mom would have done,

368
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:00,901
so it's what I'm gonna do.

369
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:04,705
Okay.

370
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,445
Whatever it was...

371
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:14,081
I thought we had something good...

372
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,450
at least, the beginning
of something good.

373
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,885
Why'd you end it?

374
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,689
Why'd you even start it?

375
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:27,901
I was trying not to think about shit.

376
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:33,900
You're cute, tall.

377
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:37,605
You're sweet sometimes.

378
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:38,872
So I used you.

379
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:48,682
I'm sorry.

380
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:56,890
Would you be up for dinner later?

381
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,892
I really mean just dinner.

382
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,227
No strings.

383
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,133
All right.

384
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:08,302
All right.

385
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:30,791
What the hell?

386
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:41,968
It's cool, I swear.

387
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,805
Buddy, you can walk right
out that back gate there,

388
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:48,208
and I won't say anything to anybody.

389
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,344
I'm supposed to be there now,

390
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:53,380
but, listen, I'm... I'm
just trying to get by,

391
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:57,184
just like you.

392
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:58,819
Please.

393
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:01,522
Daryl.

394
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,634
Daryl.

395
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:33,487
It ain't just about gettin' by here.

396
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,356
It's about gettin' it all.

397
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,993
I got the key. Let's go.

398
00:34:42,431 --> 00:34:43,831
- No.
- I just want to talk to him.

399
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,098
I said "no."

400
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,568
Don't be an asshole, Arat.

401
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,670
Let the man pass.

402
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:59,546
Oh, crap. Is that for me?

403
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,549
We haven't officially met.

404
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:06,286
I'm Spencer Monroe.

405
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:07,220
Hi.

406
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,689
That's Negan.

407
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:36,882
Is he down there?

408
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,150
Yeah.

409
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:40,820
We're all Negan.

410
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,146
Whatever you're trying to do, you can't.

411
00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:49,217
But you still have some choices.

412
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:51,286
Go home.

413
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:54,789
Burn this car, roll it down into a lake,

414
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,658
make it disappear.

415
00:35:58,094 --> 00:36:00,161
There's a silencer in
the glove compartment.

416
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,693
Where is he?

417
00:37:04,695 --> 00:37:06,494
Negan?

418
00:37:06,496 --> 00:37:10,031
He's in your house,
asshole, waiting for you.

419
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:19,841
Hey.

420
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:21,142
Just like that?

421
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:23,745
See, we've been waiting for hours

422
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:27,515
just to see what you gonna bring us, huh?

423
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:29,851
Why don't we have a look first?

424
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:37,392
Running water, air conditioning,

425
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:39,260
a housewarming gift?

426
00:37:39,262 --> 00:37:40,795
That settles it.

427
00:37:40,797 --> 00:37:44,632
I am getting myself a vacation home here.

428
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:46,634
Cheers to that.

429
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:56,444
Oh, that is good.

430
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:59,313
You know, the only thing
missing is a pool table.

431
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:04,118
Nothing better than a
good game of 8 ball.

432
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,554
The house across the street
has one in the garage.

433
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:10,024
Oh, Spencer,

434
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:12,894
you may just be my new best friend.

435
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,631
Such a nice day, though...

436
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:17,965
too nice to be cooped up

437
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:21,469
inside some garage, don't you think?

438
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:23,137
Yeah.

439
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,407
Oh, I got a better idea.

440
00:38:35,118 --> 00:38:36,350
Not bad.

441
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:40,422
We had to go out pretty far.

442
00:38:40,424 --> 00:38:43,090
What the hell's this?

443
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:45,794
"Congrats for winning.
But you still lose"?

444
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:53,701
You leave us a little love note?

445
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:56,604
No, I just...

446
00:38:56,606 --> 00:39:00,542
I mean... We wouldn't, obviously...

447
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:01,709
Wait. What?

448
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:03,478
Did you just say it's obvious?

449
00:39:07,517 --> 00:39:08,550
We didn't do that.

450
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:11,052
It's not about the damn note!

451
00:39:11,054 --> 00:39:13,220
Hey. Don't.

452
00:39:13,222 --> 00:39:15,356
Run along to Negan, Rick.

453
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:27,535
But your friend here...
he's got no place to be.

454
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:29,838
- You...
- Back up!

455
00:39:32,408 --> 00:39:34,742
I could never do this with Rick.

456
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:38,079
He would just be standing
there, scowling,

457
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:42,049
giving me that annoying
side-eye he gives me.

458
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:46,053
That's actually what I
came to see you about.

459
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,555
I want to talk to you about Rick.

460
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,062
All right.

461
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:56,998
Talk to me, Spencer.

462
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,933
Talk to me about Rick.

463
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:10,444
I get what you're trying to do here,

464
00:40:10,446 --> 00:40:12,013
what you're trying to build.

465
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:14,448
I'm not saying I agree with your methods,

466
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,617
but I get it.

467
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:17,284
You're building a network.

468
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:20,522
You're making people contribute
for the greater good.

469
00:40:20,524 --> 00:40:23,391
It makes sense.

470
00:40:23,393 --> 00:40:26,427
But you should know that Rick Grimes

471
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:29,096
has a history of not
working well with others.

472
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,602
Is that so?

473
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:40,174
Rick wasn't the original leader here.

474
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,809
My mom was.

475
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:45,079
She was doing a really good job of it.

476
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:49,316
Then she died, not long
after Rick showed up...

477
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:51,886
same with my brother, same with my dad.

478
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:56,323
So, everything was peachy here for...
what... years?

479
00:40:56,325 --> 00:41:01,328
And then Rick shows up, and
suddenly, you're an orphan?

480
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:05,499
That is the saddest
story I've ever heard.

481
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:08,698
Good thing for you he's
not in charge anymore.

482
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,072
Doesn't matter.

483
00:41:10,073 --> 00:41:11,906
His ego's out of control.

484
00:41:11,908 --> 00:41:14,676
He'll find a way to screw things up,

485
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:17,912
to try and do things
his way, to take over.

486
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:20,347
That's what he did with my mom.

487
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,649
That's what he'll do again.

488
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:33,160
What exactly are you proposing
be done about that?

489
00:41:34,297 --> 00:41:37,164
I am my mother's son.

490
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:40,835
I can be the leader she was.

491
00:41:40,837 --> 00:41:42,169
That's what this place needs.

492
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:43,471
That's what you need.

493
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:48,476
So I should put you in charge...

494
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:49,811
that's what you're saying?

495
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:52,947
We'd be much better off.

496
00:41:56,987 --> 00:41:58,552
You're all right. You're all right.

497
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,456
All right, all right, all right.

498
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:03,691
Point made.

499
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:16,570
My heart's still beating, right?

500
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:24,879
You know, I'm thinking, Spencer.

501
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:28,215
I'm thinking how Rick
threatened to kill me,

502
00:42:28,217 --> 00:42:31,619
how he clearly hates my guts.

503
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:34,856
But he is out there right now,

504
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:37,659
gathering shit for me to make sure

505
00:42:37,661 --> 00:42:42,530
I don't hurt any of the
fine people that live here.

506
00:42:42,532 --> 00:42:45,667
He is swallowing his hate

507
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:50,571
and getting shit done.

508
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:52,306
That takes guts.

509
00:42:59,883 --> 00:43:01,916
And then there's you...

510
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:06,754
...The guy who waited for Rick to be gone

511
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:09,023
so he could sneak over and talk to me

512
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,825
to get me to do his dirty work,

513
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:13,561
so he could take Rick's place.

514
00:43:13,563 --> 00:43:15,462
So I got to ask...

515
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:18,933
if you wanna take over,

516
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:21,302
why not just kill Rick yourself

517
00:43:21,304 --> 00:43:23,971
and just take over?

518
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:24,872
What? No, no.

519
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:26,040
I didn't... I don't...

520
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:27,775
You know what I'm thinking?

521
00:43:27,777 --> 00:43:32,980
'Cause I have a guess.

522
00:43:32,982 --> 00:43:37,501
It's because you got no guts.

523
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,576
How embarrassing.

524
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:04,946
There they are.

525
00:44:04,948 --> 00:44:06,814
They were inside you the whole time.

526
00:44:06,816 --> 00:44:08,116
You did have guts.

527
00:44:08,118 --> 00:44:12,086
I've never been so wrong
in my whole life!

528
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:38,112
Now, someone oughta get up
here and clean this mess up.

529
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:51,159
Anyone want to finish the game?

530
00:44:51,161 --> 00:44:52,526
C'mon.

531
00:44:54,717 --> 00:44:56,497
Anybody?

532
00:44:57,801 --> 00:44:59,700
Anybody?

533
00:45:01,237 --> 00:45:03,871
C'mon.

534
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:05,406
I was winning!

535
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:18,980
Shit!

536
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,350
What the shit?!

537
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:24,953
Shit! You just... You tried to kill me?!

538
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,555
You shot Lucille!

539
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,090
She got in the way.

540
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:42,705
What is this?

541
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,676
What is this?

542
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,679
This little bad boy made from scratch?

543
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,515
Look at those crimps.

544
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:56,184
This was homemade.

545
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,387
You may be stupid, darlin',

546
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:03,392
but you showed some real ingenuity here.

547
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:10,332
Arat, move that knife up
out on that girl's face.

548
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:15,371
Lucille's beautiful, smooth surface

549
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,172
is never gonna look the same,

550
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,674
so why should yours?!

551
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:22,043
Unless...

552
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:29,551
Unless you tell me who made this.

553
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,053
It was me.

554
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,855
I made it.

555
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:38,360
You see, now I just think you're lying.

556
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,163
And you lying to me now?!

557
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:46,101
Such a shame.

558
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,937
Arat's gonna have to cut
up that pretty face.

559
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:52,040
One more try.

560
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,875
It was me.

561
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,881
You are such a badass!

562
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,985
Fine.

563
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,956
Have it your way.

564
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:08,957
Arat...

565
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,694
Kill somebody.

566
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,464
No. It was me!

567
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:16,699
No!

568
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,454
We had an agreement.

569
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:39,621
Rick!

570
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,725
Look, everybody, it's Rick.

571
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:45,461
Ah, your people are
making me lose my voice

572
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:46,729
doin' all this yelling.

573
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:51,299
Rick... how about a "thank you"?

574
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:57,973
I mean, look, I know we
started this relationship

575
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:01,477
with me beating the holy
shit out of your friends,

576
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,679
and because of that, we're
never gonna sit around

577
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,113
and braid each other's hair

578
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,782
or share our deepest, darkest secrets,

579
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,284
but how about a little credit?

580
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,520
I just bent over backwards

581
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:15,424
to show you how reasonable I am.

582
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:17,359
Your kid...

583
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,495
he hid in one of my trucks

584
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:22,765
and machine-gunned a
bunch of my men down,

585
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:26,635
and I brought him home, safe and sound,

586
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,271
and I fed him spaghetti.

587
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:37,312
Another one of your people...

588
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:41,817
well, he wanted me to kill
you and put him in charge.

589
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:45,621
I took him out... for you.

590
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:49,357
And another one, here...

591
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,862
she shot Lucille, trying
to kill me just now,

592
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,831
so I gave you one less mouth to feed.

593
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,434
And by looking at her...

594
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,236
that mouth did some major damage.

595
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:02,838
Now, personally,

596
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,706
I wouldn't have picked
her to be the one to go,

597
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,341
but Arat...

598
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,076
I don't know... didn't trust her.

599
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,354
Your shit's waiting for you at the gate.

600
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,656
Just go.

601
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,726
Sure thing, Rick...

602
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:28,196
right after I find the guy or gal

603
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:32,233
that made this bullet.

604
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:33,569
Arat?

605
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,774
It was me!

606
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:41,209
No, it wasn't.

607
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,286
It was me.

608
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,923
It was only me.

609
00:49:55,633 --> 00:49:56,959
You?

610
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:03,198
It required one spent casing,
one four-holed turret reloader,

611
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,467
powder, one funnel for the powder...

612
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,802
Shut up.

613
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,873
I believe you.

614
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:28,423
Lucille, give me strength.

615
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:38,800
I'm gonna be relieving you of
your bullet maker, Rick...

616
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:43,238
that and whatever you left
for me at the front gate.

617
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,974
And however much you scavenged,

618
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,143
it's not good enough,

619
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:53,015
because you're still in
a serious, serious hole

620
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,482
after today.

621
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,022
Let's move out!

622
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:04,993
No! No, no!

623
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,628
Please, just take me!

624
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,363
No!

625
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:11,332
Rick, I ain't gonna lie...

626
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:15,103
your kitchen is a goddamn mess.

627
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,540
I'll see you next time.

628
00:51:57,066 --> 00:52:02,185
CONGRATS FOR WINNING BUT YOU STILL LOSE!

629
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:19,158
Carl told me you were in here.

630
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,359
I...

631
00:52:46,387 --> 00:52:48,721
I found what I was looking for.

632
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:58,664
I wanted to go with you and Aaron,

633
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:00,700
but I couldn't.

634
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:05,137
I had to go my way.

635
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:07,239
But when I found it...

636
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:12,878
...I realized that...

637
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,083
I didn't want it to be my way.

638
00:53:17,085 --> 00:53:21,587
I wanted it to be ours... me and you.

639
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,864
There are more of them,
even more than we thought.

640
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:36,435
We are outnumbered. It's not even close.

641
00:53:36,437 --> 00:53:38,771
But that doesn't change
the way that I feel,

642
00:53:38,773 --> 00:53:42,341
because it doesn't change
the way that things are.

643
00:53:42,343 --> 00:53:45,177
We're still alive, Rick.

644
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:47,379
So much has happened,

645
00:53:47,381 --> 00:53:49,749
so much that we shouldn't
have lived through.

646
00:53:49,751 --> 00:53:51,216
And...

647
00:53:51,218 --> 00:53:54,186
and in spite of it or
maybe because of it,

648
00:53:54,188 --> 00:53:56,155
we did.

649
00:53:57,591 --> 00:54:02,594
We're still here, the two of us.

650
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:06,465
We're still standing, and
we're gonna keep standing.

651
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:10,269
So, what do we do with that?

652
00:54:10,271 --> 00:54:15,240
How do we make that mean something?

653
00:54:15,242 --> 00:54:18,377
We're the ones who get things done.

654
00:54:18,379 --> 00:54:21,914
You said that.

655
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:23,983
We're the ones who live.

656
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:32,424
That's why we have to fight...

657
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:39,298
not for us, but for Judith, for Carl,

658
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,401
for Alexandria, for the Hilltop...

659
00:54:42,403 --> 00:54:47,573
for all of us.

660
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,508
We can fight them, Rick.

661
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:53,645
We can find a way to beat them.

662
00:54:53,647 --> 00:54:57,282
We can do this.

663
00:54:57,284 --> 00:54:58,951
But...

664
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,757
But...

665
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:11,964
Only if... we do this.

666
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,974
Yeah, I know that now.

667
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,050
I know that now.

668
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:43,122
Sasha! Enid!

669
00:56:57,104 --> 00:57:00,472
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

670
00:57:00,474 --> 00:57:02,274
The baby's okay...

671
00:57:02,276 --> 00:57:03,943
all of us.

672
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:07,991
You were right...

673
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:11,450
right from the start.

674
00:57:11,452 --> 00:57:15,855
You told us to get ready to fight.

675
00:57:15,857 --> 00:57:18,190
I didn't listen, and I couldn't.

676
00:57:21,095 --> 00:57:23,595
I can now.

677
00:59:25,172 --> 00:59:34,779
