1
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:35,910
Dear Mum, Get well soon.

2
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:48,433
Tell the head nurse to stay.

3
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:57,586
Ryoko, Ryoko...

4
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:02,435
Ryoko, Ryoko

5
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:10,196
Hello!

6
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:34,395
I'm sorry,

7
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:39,835
5:28 PM

8
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:27,830
I brought this for Mum.

9
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:20,227
7 years later.

10
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,391
Hey, let's go home.
The waves are too high.

11
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:36,828
Dad, no luck again?

12
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:41,635
You don't understand.
I'm only after the big ones.

13
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:48,073
I prefer real life girls
to imaginary big fish.

14
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:49,232
Well...

15
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,436
When you grow up,
you'll understand.

16
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:55,065
It's called romanticism.

17
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:00,745
Yes, well...

18
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:06,066
I have done the planning.
I'll bring it tomorrow.

19
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:08,871
Yes... Hello

20
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:13,265
Sorry I have to go.

21
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:34,390
This is too big for us.
We'll share it with Rie.

22
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:46,150
You don't bring friends home
anymore. Is everything OK?

23
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:50,472
Did you know that black
sea bream originate as males?

24
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,872
What?

25
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:55,434
When they reach 15cm long,
they become unisex.

26
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:59,875
Then some become female.
-Oh really?

27
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:03,829
What about this one?

28
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,395
We saw ovaries.

29
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,075
Did we?

30
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:15,671
I don't know very much
about ovaries.

31
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:20,553
You don't look young anymore.

32
00:05:21,997 --> 00:05:25,592
What?
-You look very plain.

33
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,671
Gang.

34
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:48,470
Hey Dad, why don't you
get remarried?

35
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:53,946
Why do you say that?

36
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:57,069
I just simply think so.

37
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:19,627
Thanks for the dinner.

38
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,068
It's your turn for the dishes.

39
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:10,193
It's like a ceremony for worshipers.

40
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:14,546
They're pretty much the same,
lonely.

41
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:18,987
Happy people wouldn't
go to that kind of concert.

42
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:21,836
The whole of Japan's lonely.

43
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,276
Are you?

44
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:31,636
You too, right?

45
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:37,790
Boss.

46
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,996
Ueno wants to change tomorrows
meeting from 1 to 3.30pm.

47
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,671
That doesn't matter to me.
I'll be here.

48
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:49,466
I'll drop in at Starts and
then meet Yoshikawa tonight.

49
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,996
I won't be back at the office.

50
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:54,667
Any changes and I'll call
you on your mobile.

51
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:56,111
Yeah.

52
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:07,076
Well...

53
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:12,713
I'm going to marry soon.

54
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,150
Really?

55
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:19,835
Congratulations.

56
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:22,831
To whom?

57
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,432
Someone you don't know.

58
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,547
Congratulations anyway.

59
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:55,666
You're a busy man!
-It's alright but...

60
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,797
The profit margins are
getting thinner.

61
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:01,755
How about you?

62
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:03,796
Don't you know?

63
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:08,472
The movie industry is profitable.
-Really?

64
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:10,070
I'm lying.

65
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:16,070
It's like a survival game,
or a game of torture.

66
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:20,232
Is it no good?
-Seems like a bright future ahead.

67
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:23,390
But I don't know
how long we should wait.

68
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:29,190
Yoshikawa. Didn't you say
the same thing a year ago?

69
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:31,429
Did l?

70
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:39,793
Awful girls.

71
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:42,353
No class and stuck up.

72
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:47,153
Stupid as well.
Where are all the good girls?

73
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,666
Japan is finished.

74
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,076
Let me say...

75
00:09:58,677 --> 00:10:01,749
I intend to get married again.

76
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,627
Well, what made you
decide to do that?

77
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:09,156
Which one?
-I haven't got one yet.

78
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:15,506
My son said to me that I look old
and I should get married again.

79
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,875
That's the story.

80
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:21,267
You look old...

81
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:26,828
How are you going to look for one?
An arranged marriage?

82
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:31,396
No, that's not my style.

83
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,715
I wish there was a very nice
woman hiding somewhere.

84
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:46,355
What kind of female are you
looking for? Preferably young?

85
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,555
Not too young?

86
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:57,389
She could possibly have a
job, and some training.

87
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,910
Training?

88
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:04,676
For instance, playing the
piano, singing or dancing.

89
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,873
You ex-wife Ryoko
was like that.

90
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,626
Certain training gives people
confidence.

91
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:23,266
A lack of confidence brings
unhappiness.

92
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,515
Pianist.

93
00:11:27,117 --> 00:11:28,994
It'll cost you more.

94
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:32,349
She need not necessarily be
a professional.

95
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:37,230
I don't want to fail at
marriage at my age.

96
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:40,947
I'd like to have enough time
to observe her.

97
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:46,553
I'd like to see many women
then choose my ideal one.

98
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,435
What are you laughing at?

99
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:55,992
Am I expecting too much?

100
00:11:56,877 --> 00:12:00,472
I probably am.
-No, I can handle that.

101
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:02,908
I have an idea.

102
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:06,755
Have an audition.

103
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:14,910
It'll be a romantic story.
Remember your documentary?

104
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:19,509
Love triangle between dancer,
patron and a Down syndrome boy.

105
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:24,467
Teamed up with a German TV station.

106
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:27,674
I'll rearrange the story.
Any problems?

107
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:34,751
I don't see any problems, but
we're going to audition?

108
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:40,105
Trust me.
Have I ever disappointed you?

109
00:12:40,597 --> 00:12:41,996
Well no, but...

110
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:45,275
The heroine is supposed to be
in her early 20's to 30.

111
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:49,595
The conditions are that she be a well
trained person. No problems, huh?

112
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:53,067
Wouldn't it be fraudulent?

113
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:58,910
This audition is not only about finding
you a wife. It's part of making a movie.

114
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:00,869
If we collect enough capital,
we can make the movie.

115
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,187
The story isn't bad.

116
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:06,235
Well...

117
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:11,748
Am I supposed to marry
the main girl?

118
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:16,229
No, a girl with that much talent
wouldn't marry you.

119
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,826
They aren't the marrying type.

120
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:24,629
Really good ones will always
fail the second interview.

121
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:29,593
Really?
-Those are about 1% of all applicants.

122
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:33,829
They are quite attractive.

123
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:39,915
Smart, with a good upbringing.
Traditional and well trained.

124
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:42,991
Wishing her to be your
son's wife?

125
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:45,553
I don't get it.

126
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:48,993
Why can't she get the main part?

127
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:51,512
They are not unhappy.

128
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:55,706
Happy people can't act well.

129
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:03,346
And another thing. I have a plan to
work with FM, I'll combine this.

130
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:07,345
Make another program
called "Tomorrow's heroine".

131
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:13,430
Trust me.
I'm a pro at auditions.

132
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:20,672
This is Yoshikawa. I'm in
room number 2. Coffee?

133
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:25,546
Is coffee OK for you?
Bring two coffees please.

134
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:30,467
I'm in a middle of a traffic
jam, I might be late...

135
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:37,466
Please hand that tape to
Mr. Kaneda.

136
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,154
Thanks.

137
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:50,189
Tomorrow's heroine

138
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:53,275
I'm just wondering
where you are?

139
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:59,467
Wonderful things might happen. If you
encourage yourself a little bit more.

140
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:06,427
Every star has their defining moment.
Hepburn and Julia Roberts.

141
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:10,266
They led their own lives
prior to becoming heroines.

142
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:15,471
Tomorrow's heroine is living
at the same time as you are.

143
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:22,347
No, tomorrow's heroine could
be you yourself.

144
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,275
I'm home.

145
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,754
Here we go.
-You're home early.

146
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:44,992
That's right, I've got to
work at home tonight.

147
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:50,188
Please heat up your dinner.
The bigger dish is for Shigeto.

148
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:53,270
Thanks.
-See You on Monday.

149
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:57,876
My daughters here this weekend.
I've got to go shopping.

150
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,108
That's nice.
Hey Gang.

151
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:04,435
Please put your washing in the basket.
-Right.

152
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:07,593
Thanks
-Bye.

153
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,037
Hello.
-It's me.

154
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:04,588
Yoshikawa. I'm
checking the applications.

155
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:08,194
They're all good, right?

156
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:10,987
I don't know what am I
supposed to do?

157
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,825
It's like buying my
first car.

158
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:18,431
Don't mix your car and wife.

159
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:22,955
I intend holding the audition
next week. Choose 30 applicants.

160
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:25,665
30 applicants?
-That's right.

161
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:30,592
Alright. I'll let you know.
-Don't trust pictures.

162
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:34,229
Composition can be more useful.
-Understood.

163
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:36,592
See you.
-Bye.

164
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:43,668
Choose 30 from all of you?

165
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,394
You're home?

166
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:53,436
Why don't you knock at
the door? You just arrived?

167
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:58,826
Yeah. Dinner?
-I'll eat later. Why don't you eat first?

168
00:18:59,077 --> 00:19:00,192
Alright.

169
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:03,673
I'm having a guest tonight.

170
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:09,348
Girl friend?
Give her my dinner.

171
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:10,986
Thank you.

172
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,349
What did I do!

173
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,877
Asami Yamazaki.

174
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:58,591
Classical Ballet for 12 years.

175
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:12,397
I'm not sure that I can make an actress of
myself. And you probably won't choose me.

176
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:15,796
I was simply attracted to this story.

177
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:22,469
I studied ballet, but damaged
my hips when I was 1 8.

178
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:28,353
I was devastated as I intended
to practice in London.

179
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:33,987
Ballet was my priority.
So my dream collapsed.

180
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:40,236
It might sound exaggerated,
but it's like accepting death.

181
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:44,352
Living is another way of
reaching death.

182
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:50,753
I think I know these facts very well.
That's why I applied for this part.

183
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:11,671
When was this dinosaur living?
-about the latter Cretaceous period.

184
00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:15,995
The later part of Cretaceous
means...

185
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:19,873
That's a Sauropod right?

186
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:23,865
Good. What about the dinosaur
that has the Syracuse model.

187
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:26,466
I don't know.
-Do You want to see?

188
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:39,587
Hi! Good evening.
-Good evening.

189
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:41,515
I'm his father.

190
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:46,865
My name is Misuzu. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet You too.

191
00:21:47,197 --> 00:21:51,668
I often see her on the train. I thought
she was pretty. Then tried talking to her.

192
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,196
Good job.

193
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:59,666
I'm interested in biology.
He showed me his books.

194
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,028
We ate your dinner.
-Fine.

195
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,552
Was it his?

196
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:09,306
I'm sorry I ate your meal.
Terribly sorry.

197
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:14,666
I will cook something for you.
-Don't worry about it. Take it easy.

198
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:17,672
Gang.

199
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,670
Good boy.

200
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:29,427
Let's go for a walk.

201
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:33,791
Shigehiko, make sure she gets
home alright. -Of course.

202
00:22:33,997 --> 00:22:35,794
OK boy, come on.

203
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:43,190
Let's go Gang.

204
00:22:57,997 --> 00:22:59,350
Ready?

205
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:04,187
Well... I feel like a criminal.

206
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:06,756
I'm ready.

207
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:10,791
Let's start.

208
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,152
Pleased to meet you.

209
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:16,431
Please sit.

210
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:25,429
My name is Yu Tanaka.

211
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:29,710
Please have a seat. Are you nervous?
-a little bit.

212
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:33,351
Sorry, you are the first one.
-That's OK.

213
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:35,985
We're going to tape you.
But don't worry. -OK.

214
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:38,467
Do you mind if I ask what
your father's job is?

215
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:42,107
Well... my father's...
job is...

216
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:43,990
What can I say?

217
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:46,991
Next one.

218
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:52,151
I'm going to ask you frankly.
Why did you apply this part?

219
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:54,906
Have you ever had sex with
someone you don't like?

220
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:56,670
Are you interested in drugs?

221
00:23:56,877 --> 00:24:00,472
Can you act a little bit for us?

222
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:03,672
Sure.
-Go ahead.

223
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:09,670
What music do you like?

224
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:12,914
Which actress do you like?
-I like Mituko Mori.

225
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:13,867
Next.

226
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:22,750
I used to love sports.
At school, I played...

227
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:25,307
Did you ever want to work
for the sex industry?

228
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:29,716
I have a friend who is
working in that area.

229
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:31,546
Next.

230
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:44,868
What are men to you?
Have you ever seen Tarkovsky movies?

231
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,994
Ren Osugi.

232
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:52,833
We have some sex scenes. Can you
handle that? -No problem.

233
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:54,756
Are you psychic?

234
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:05,706
Next.

235
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:07,555
May I ask you a question?

236
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:09,272
Can you smile?

237
00:25:10,557 --> 00:25:12,673
What kind of men
don't you like?

238
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:15,431
Yoko Sugimura.
Nice to meet you.

239
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:20,188
If I didn't have confidence
I wouldn't be an actress.

240
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:22,146
Excuse me.

241
00:25:24,997 --> 00:25:30,025
When I was 2, mother decided
that I'd be an actress.

242
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,831
Can you walk around the chair?

243
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:35,871
Turn around.

244
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:37,305
Next please.

245
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:45,555
Nice meeting you.

246
00:25:49,157 --> 00:25:53,355
It's time for a break
from our schedule.

247
00:25:55,157 --> 00:25:58,706
We're 30 minutes late.
Let's take a 1 0 min. break.

248
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:00,066
Sure.

249
00:26:06,717 --> 00:26:09,595
You don't seem too enthusiastic.

250
00:26:10,157 --> 00:26:13,149
Don't tell me you're
not interested anymore.

251
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:15,869
It's not like that.

252
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,470
Like what?

253
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:24,587
I'm nervous myself.
I need to use the toilet.

254
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:52,875
I lived in Paris for 3 years. And have
come back to Tokyo as a designer.

255
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:55,673
I can't think about anything
else but being an actress.

256
00:26:55,877 --> 00:27:00,348
My office was only for adult videos.
-Keep her for another job.

257
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:04,106
I'm not satisfied being
called a cover girl queen.

258
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:12,588
This scar is from my 1st suicide
attempt and this is from the 2nd.

259
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,834
I've been to an asylum 3 times.

260
00:27:16,757 --> 00:27:18,270
Next.

261
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:21,671
Emi Kitani.
Pleased to meet you.

262
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:24,791
We finished your
interview before.

263
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,796
But I haven't finished
what I have to say.

264
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:31,593
You have nice career, why
do you want to be an actress?

265
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:37,226
I think I've been doing
very well, but...

266
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,109
Sorry.

267
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:43,986
I'm a children's nurse.
My work is very hard...

268
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:47,916
Next please.

269
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:50,313
Ms. Asami Yamasaki.

270
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:54,676
Please.

271
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:11,035
Asami Yamasaki.
-Have a seat

272
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:16,311
Sorry for the delay.
-It's OK.

273
00:28:17,837 --> 00:28:21,307
Have you done any movies
or TV jobs?

274
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:25,825
I've had many opportunities,
but actually haven't done any.

275
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:31,546
Do you belong to any agency?
Not really.

276
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:36,467
But I'm on keep
for a record Co. director.

277
00:28:36,837 --> 00:28:38,907
But we haven't contacted
each other recently.

278
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,587
Which record company?
-Ace Records.

279
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:47,356
Could you tell me your
personal contact's name?

280
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:51,749
Japanese music dept.
Director Shibata.

281
00:28:58,277 --> 00:29:04,307
Since you quit your previous
job, you're unemployed?

282
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:07,510
How do you manage your daily expenses?
lf you don't mind telling us.

283
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:12,389
I help at a friend's shop. 3 times a week.
-What kind of shop?

284
00:29:13,237 --> 00:29:15,705
A small bar in Ginza.

285
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:20,872
The owner used to be a class
mate in voice training.

286
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:25,113
If I keep my costs low,
I have no money problems.

287
00:29:26,237 --> 00:29:28,307
Don't you want to lead
a luxurious life.

288
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:32,312
Too poor isn't good.

289
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:37,876
But I can afford books and CDs.
That's enough for me.

290
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:41,593
Can I ask you about ballet?

291
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:43,952
Certainly.

292
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,115
You damaged your hips.
-That's correct.

293
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:51,270
It must have been awful to
quit what you'd been doing.

294
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,396
Yes.

295
00:29:55,517 --> 00:29:58,953
I must sound a bit rude but...

296
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:03,833
Your writing says that quitting
what you liked...

297
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:07,950
...is almost similar to accepting death.

298
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,989
I was highly impressed.

299
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:16,590
I think everybody has
similar experiences.

300
00:30:17,277 --> 00:30:21,509
In your lifetime when you have
something beyond your control.

301
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:25,666
What can you do but accept it?

302
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:28,956
I think that's life.

303
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:30,830
I mean...

304
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:36,235
I was amazed a young girl
like you understands that.

305
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:42,030
I think you live your life
in a very thoughtful way.

306
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:44,586
That's what I thought.

307
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:58,108
Thank you very much.

308
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,069
Are you finished?

309
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:12,313
Thank you for coming.

310
00:31:12,477 --> 00:31:15,947
We may contact you later.
-Yes.

311
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:20,748
Excuse me.

312
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:35,668
May I call the next one?
-Let's have a 1 5 min break.

313
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:36,912
Fine.

314
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:40,594
Please tell Mr. Ito I'll be late.

315
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:52,950
What do you think?
-She made me very nervous.

316
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:55,592
I wanted a cigarette.

317
00:31:57,317 --> 00:32:00,150
You decided on her before
the audition.

318
00:32:00,757 --> 00:32:05,956
I like her much more than
her nice writing.

319
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:10,106
I think you live your life
in a very thoughtful way.

320
00:32:10,277 --> 00:32:13,553
It's not an interviewer's
comment. I was stunned.

321
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:17,670
Don't joke about that.
She really impressed me.

322
00:32:23,157 --> 00:32:26,832
I'm sure she's a serious
type of girl.

323
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:32,512
She is better than her photo
and may also be good hearted.

324
00:32:35,077 --> 00:32:37,545
But I don't like her.

325
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:40,556
What's wrong with her?

326
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:43,235
Something chemical.

327
00:32:44,677 --> 00:32:48,875
Can't say exactly what's wrong.
I just don't like her.

328
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:14,347
Misuzu?

329
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:17,390
She looked nice, but...
-What?

330
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:22,748
One of those girl things.
I don't understand girls. Do you?

331
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:28,156
Thanks.

332
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:35,874
Hey dad, about your remarriage. Preferably
someone who cooks better than Rie.

333
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:40,788
Why are you in such a hurry?

334
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:44,865
New discovery of another
dinosaur, from Argentina.

335
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:48,353
That one could be older
than Euraptile. Really.

336
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,906
I'll be busy collecting
information.

337
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,549
Take a bath.

338
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,635
Yes, hello.

339
00:34:31,397 --> 00:34:33,388
Sorry for calling so late.

340
00:34:33,557 --> 00:34:38,073
This is producer Aoyama.
I interviewed you today.

341
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:42,751
Thank you for your time today.
-Not at all. Well...

342
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:51,793
I wondered if you might have
some time to talk with me.

343
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:55,390
Of course. I'd love to see you.

344
00:34:56,517 --> 00:35:01,716
When would suit you?
-Anytime would be fine, during the daytime.

345
00:35:02,037 --> 00:35:05,950
Really. Let me see.
For instance...

346
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:12,910
Good night.

347
00:35:27,717 --> 00:35:29,389
This is the Aoyama residence.

348
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:32,630
It's me.
-How is it?

349
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:37,190
About Ms. Yamasaki.

350
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:42,115
Without suspicion,
I called Ace Records.

351
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:48,509
It's no big deal, but
something didn't seem right.

352
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,710
What is it?

353
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:55,946
Director Shibata isn't
at the company.

354
00:35:56,837 --> 00:36:00,113
To be precise,
he isn't there anymore.

355
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:08,031
He's been missing for a year.

356
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:12,793
He just disappeared.

357
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:21,156
I'm nervous.

358
00:36:22,957 --> 00:36:27,747
Please relax, I won't ask
you any special questions.

359
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:35,076
You only ask of me to enjoy
this nice food and talk?

360
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:36,746
Absolutely.

361
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:40,746
That's the best request
I've ever had.

362
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:44,913
Just one question.

363
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:49,429
Your director contact.

364
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:52,867
Mr. Shibata?

365
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:59,310
I'm sorry I said so at the
audition but...

366
00:36:59,957 --> 00:37:02,755
In fact I've never met him.

367
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:07,629
I don't belong to
any actors agency.

368
00:37:08,077 --> 00:37:11,228
I was advised to answer you like that.

369
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,192
Is that so?

370
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:17,549
I didn't mean to tell a lie.

371
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:22,706
It's OK. I've clarified that
question, that's no problem.

372
00:37:25,397 --> 00:37:26,910
Here we go.

373
00:37:28,717 --> 00:37:30,469
Looks wonderful.

374
00:37:35,757 --> 00:37:37,156
Go ahead.

375
00:37:49,877 --> 00:37:52,550
Yummy.
-Good.

376
00:37:58,397 --> 00:38:01,787
I hope I'm not asking you
too much but...

377
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:04,431
If you have some free time,

378
00:38:05,357 --> 00:38:08,713
I'd like to talk to you more.

379
00:38:08,877 --> 00:38:13,792
I don't have anybody to be
frank with.

380
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:20,030
If I'm good enough,
I'd love to.

381
00:38:20,557 --> 00:38:22,513
Really? I'm very happy
about that.

382
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:26,826
I'll try not to bother you.

383
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:33,746
I don't mind any place.

384
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,507
Even on the telephone
would be fine.

385
00:38:37,437 --> 00:38:40,873
I'll write my mobile number
on my busniss card.

386
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:43,307
Please call me anytime.

387
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:48,076
Thank you very much.
Thank you for the meal too.

388
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:52,912
I've decided.

389
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:59,435
I don't care about the movie,
I'm interested only in her.

390
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:08,069
Don't worry about the movie.
I'll handle that matter.

391
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:12,511
But don't be too hasty.

392
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:16,235
You wanted to have some time
to observe your prospect.

393
00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:21,711
Why are you so negative about
her? What's wrong with her?

394
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:26,234
I only think that life
isn't so easy.

395
00:39:28,197 --> 00:39:31,712
She is beautiful, classy
and obedient.

396
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:38,428
Such a woman not having any
boyfriends is unthinkable.

397
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:43,826
I checked out her associates,
none are accessible.

398
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:48,434
The bar she was talking about
is also an unknown.

399
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:54,235
We can't reach anybody
who knows her.

400
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:58,709
I wasn't born yesterday.
I won't be fooled this easily.

401
00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:02,029
I trust myself over some
others evaluation.

402
00:40:02,597 --> 00:40:06,510
If there's any trouble, I
can solve it.

403
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:09,026
OK.

404
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:13,868
You said I could find my
ideal woman from an audition.

405
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,506
I appreciate it.

406
00:40:22,477 --> 00:40:23,512
Hey Aoyama.

407
00:40:24,477 --> 00:40:28,152
Promise me one thing.
Don't call her.

408
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:31,631
Hopefully it's my miscalculation.

409
00:40:32,237 --> 00:40:34,592
It's going to effect your
whole life.

410
00:40:34,797 --> 00:40:36,753
Don't be so hasty.

411
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,635
Cool down a bit.

412
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:51,551
Alright. I promise you.

413
00:41:58,197 --> 00:41:59,994
You're not sick are you?

414
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:04,030
It is rare for you to
take a day off.

415
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:07,714
Since I've worked for you,
I've never seen you like this.

416
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:09,752
Oh well...

417
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:15,425
It's good to have a break.
You might be a little tired.

418
00:42:15,797 --> 00:42:20,473
Since your wife died, you've
worked very hard for your son.

419
00:42:20,717 --> 00:42:26,075
Forming your own company which is
doing quite well. You work too much.

420
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:33,469
I wish my husband was like you.
My life would be easier.

421
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,872
You must have a nice
girlfriend.

422
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:01,273
I'm sure you do.

423
00:43:01,757 --> 00:43:06,273
Men can't maintain without
female support.

424
00:43:44,637 --> 00:43:47,993
I've finished.
I'm going home.

425
00:43:48,197 --> 00:43:51,394
Bye.
-See You tomorrow.

426
00:44:09,157 --> 00:44:10,715
I'm leaving.

427
00:44:12,197 --> 00:44:13,915
See you.

428
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:23,388
Do you have something
to tell me?

429
00:44:24,197 --> 00:44:27,109
Not really.
See you tomorrow.

430
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:29,756
Bye.

431
00:46:19,357 --> 00:46:21,154
Hello... This is Aoyama.

432
00:46:21,357 --> 00:46:22,506
Really? Good.

433
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:27,309
I thought you wouldn't
phone me anymore.
