No, you idiot.

you handle baggage,

overtime because I'm a union man.

134
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,079
And I work only 16 hours a day.

135

eight hours a day.

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,418
Come!

312
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,957
Hurry up. Come.

313
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,218
This better be a good one.

314
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:20,093
What's the matter, you
afraid of the dark'? No.

315
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,634
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.

316
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,605
What is this?

317
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,604
Hey, Wilbur, McDougal is here. I...
What's the matter with you?

318
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,855
Come on, snap out of it.

319
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,078
Where are they?
Where are my bodies?

320
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,422
What bodies?
There were no bodies.

321
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,414
We opened both crates. I showed
it to Wilbur. Look in there.

322
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,916
If they're not here, where are they?
I don't know.

323
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,540
They must be stolen.
My company inspected

324
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,919
the contents before
they were shipped.

325
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,379
Then they must've
been stolen en route.

326
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,451
<i>You mean, you saw mam'?
No, no, no.</i>

327
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,091
Well, then where did they go?
I don't know.

328
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,459
If they're gone, I want my
insurance money. I'm sorry.

329
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,787
My company doesn't pay off
until a full investigation.

330
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,430
Did you hear that? If you
don't produce those bodies,

331
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,671
I'm going to call the police!

332
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,341
Police?
Police!

333
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,136
I can do better
than that. Police!

334
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,712
I'll get you.
Police!

335
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,094
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Come on, go, get on.

336
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,316
Let's take it out.

337
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,697
Come!

338
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,221
Good evening,
Dr. Mornay.

339
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,179
My dear Count, it's so
good to see you again.

340
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,435
And you look more charming
than when I saw you last.

341
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:38,732
Come in, Count Dracula.
Thank you, Sandra.

342
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,484
But the name
is Dr. Lejos.

343
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,065
I wouldn't want to frighten
your technical assistant.

344
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,320
Professor Stevens?

345
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,196
Don't worry. He's completely
engrossed in his work.

346
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,246
Besides, he should be
out of here by tomorrow.

347
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,448
Excellent

348
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,160
Yes, except that he's asking
too many questions.

349
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,417
I will take care of that.
Is everything else arranged?

350
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,090
Yes. Where did you leave him?
In the cold.

351
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,792
I'll get a wrap.

352
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,311
Nervous, my dear?

353
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,735
This is risky business.

354
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,859
Not as risky as those curious
operations of yours,

355
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:29,071
that so intrigued the European police.
Yet much more profitable.

356
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:33,791
Restore the monster for me, and
you shall have anything you wish.

357
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,873
In that case, we better
start as soon as possible.

358
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,456
It's dangerous to leave him
in this weakened condition.

359
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,925
Have you mastered Dr.
Frankenstein's notebook?

360
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,971
Let me get my hand on a scalpel
again and you shall see.

361
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,049
And about the brain?

362
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,932
I don't want to repeat Frankenstein's
mistake, and revive a vicious,

363
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,638
unmanageable brute.

364
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,437
This time the monster must
have no will of his own.

365
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,941
No fiendish intellect
to oppose his master.

366
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,820
There, my dear Count, I believe I
have exceeded your fondest wishes.

367
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,452
The new brain I've chosen
for the monster is so simple,

368
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,997
so pliable, he will obey
you like a trained dog.

369
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:18,040
Good. How soon?

370
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:22,123
The day after tomorrow. Wilbur was
taking me to a masquerade ball.

371
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:26,006
But I'm sure he'd prefer to
spend a quiet evening at home.

372
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,554
Bring him through here.

373
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,268
I tell you, Chick, I saw
what I saw when I saw it!

374
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,776
Keep quiet! You babbling about
dead people walking away!

375
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,528
That's why we were arrested
and thrown in jail.

376
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,111
Do you realize that we've spent
a whole day and night in jail?

377
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,698
And we'd still be there if some
dame hadn't've bailed us out.

378
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:59,456
Chick, now stop calling
Sandra a dame!

379
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,542
And I'm tellin' ya,
they were there.

380
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,465
Oh, stop.
Two of 'em.

381
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,919
One of 'em was
about eight foot tall.

382
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,380
Way up there!
And he walked like this.

383
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,562
Just like that.

384
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,524
Now, that's the way he walked.
Stop it.

385
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,079
You don't believe that?
Certainly not!

386
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,145
Well, I saw it.

387
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,778
And the other one,
he went like this.

388
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,497
And he kept gettin'
closer and closer.

389
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,576
He had eyes that
were balls of fire.

390
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,917
He kept staring, eye to eye.

391
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,466
Eye to eye! Staring!

392
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,352
I never saw anything
like it in my life.

393
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,301
Believe me, Chick, when I tell
you I was scared to death.

394
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,260
Really I was. I was
really scared, Chick.

395
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,354
What's the matter? Chick?

396
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,187
What did I do?

397
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:09,864
Hey, Chick, I don't like you like that.
Come on, be just like you used to be.

398
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,025
Go away with it!
Attaboy! I'm happy.

399
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,294
That's just like you used to be.

400
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,241
All right. Now, stop this nonsense!
All of it.

401
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,089
You're Wilbur Grey?
Yes, sir.

402
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,840
Then you must be Chick Young.
So what?

403
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,339
I'm Lawrence Talbot. I've been
looking all over town for you.

404
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,885
You didn't have to look far.
We were in jail. Yes, I know.

405
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,807
You see, I'm the one who telephoned
you not to deliver those bodies.

406
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,887
I knew they were alive!

407
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,822
There you are, so you thought
I was imagining things, huh?

408
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,574
When I told you about the fellow
that was eight-foot tall,

409
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,785
and walking like this with the stiff legs,
and then the other fellow with this here.

410
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,938
Wait! Wait a minute. You're
crazy, and so is this screwball!

411
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:54,738
Look, bub, I have my own troubles.
Worse than you think.

412
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,784
I followed Dracula all
the way from Europe,

413
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,115
because I believe that he's going to try
and revive the Frankenstein monster.

414
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,576
We must find him and destroy
him before he can do this!

415
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,832
Wait a minute, why don't
you go down to the police,

416
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,056
tell them you know the story
about Dracula and the Monster.

417
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,459
They'd be very interested.
I can't do that.

418
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,133
Because then I'd have to
tell them who I am and...

419
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,182
Why I know what I know.

420
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,265
Soon... Soon the
moon will rise.

421
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,069
I haven't time to explain.

422
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,774
I've taken the room across the hall.
Here's the key. Lock me in!

423
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,279
Lock you in?
Yes, please. Hurry!

424
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,033
It's silly, but I'll do it.

425
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,989
He's scared too.

426
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,790
Remember, no matter what
you hear or what happens,

427
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,712
don't let me out!

428
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,314
“Lock me in." That guy is
screwier than you are.

429
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,441
He is not.
He's a nice man.

430
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,649
He's just worried about the police getting
him because he knows they're alive.

431
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,576
I'm going to bed.
Well...

432
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,742
Hey, he forgot his bag.

433
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,286
Mr. Talbot,
you forgot your grip.

434
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,292
Mr. Talbot?

435
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,260
Mr. Talbot?

436
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,134
Mr. Talbot?

437
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,611
Now, how'd he get out of here?

438
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,694
Hmm.

439
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,246
I'll leave him a note.

440
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:15,295
"I left your bag in the bedroom.

441
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,419
"Wilbur."

442
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,743
I wonder if he counted these.

443
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,704
He might've.

444
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,316
Maybe he didn't

445
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,229
Hmm.

446
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,117
A fine insurance company
I'm doing business with,

447
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,035
outsmarted by
a couple of morons!

448
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,622
Those two crooks got
out of jail. On bail!

449
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,916
We know that, Mr. McDougal,
but you see we...

450
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:34,336
In fact, I arranged it.
You? Who are you?

451
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,460
This is Miss Raymond, an
investigator from the home office.

452
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,510
It's my job, Mr. McDougal, to
find those missing exhibits.

453
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,932
I'm quite sure I can persuade the chubby
little fellow to lead me right to them.

454
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,557
Naturally, I couldn't persuade
him very well in jail.

455
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,103
Wilbur, please! I've had
nightmares all night long!

456
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,951
I don't want to hear any
more about dead bodies.

457
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,648
I saw what I saw when I saw it.

458
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,570
All right.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

459
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,233
Boy, am I glad to see you. Will
you go over and talk to that guy?

460
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,611
Sandra! Wilbur darling,
I heard what happened.

461
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,493
That's awful. They can't put
my little Wilbur in jail.

462
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,994
They can't, but they did.

463
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,576
Sandra, I wanna thank
you for bailing us out.

464
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,707
I? I only learned
about it this morning.

465
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,477
Well, didn't the policeman tell
you that a lady bailed us out?

466
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,291
He did.

467
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,761
Wilbur, pet' you haven't been
untrue to your Sandra'?

468
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,466
Sandra, how can you look me
in the face and say that?

469
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,927
How can you look him
in the face, period?

470
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,973
I only came by to remind you about
the masquerade ball tonight.

471
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,184
I was just getting ready
to pick up my costume.

472
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,066
Come by for me early,
dearest. About sunset.

473
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,441
Alone. Goodbye.

474
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,947
What I'd like to know is, what
has he got that I haven't got?

475
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,539
A brain.

476
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,920
Brain. I'd like to
know where it is.

477
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,669
(KNOCK ON DOOR} Oh. She
forgot to kiss me goodbye.

478
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,217
(SQUEALS IN SURPRISE)

479
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,634
Now, who is this? She's... She's...
She's beautiful.

480
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,561
I'm Joan Raymond.
She's Joan Raymond.

481
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,231
I'm the girl who arranged
your release from jail.

482
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,809
Well, why should you
want to spring us?

483
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,562
Do you believe in
love at first sight?

484
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:27,115
Well! As long as you
put it that way, I...

485
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,739
That's what happened to me.

486
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,321
Wilbur, darling!

487
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:33,989
(LAUGHS)

488
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:40,128
Miss Raymond, when did this mad
feeling first come over you?

489
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,456
The instant I saw you
in the baggage room.

490
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,715
I knew then that I wanted to spend every
single minute that I'm in town with you.

491
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,295
You did?

492
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,755
What are we doing tonight?

493
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,636
He's going to a masquerade ball.

494
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,134
But I'm not doing anything.

495
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,061
In that case, you'll be awfully lonesome.
Well, naturally...

496
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:01,396
Wilbur darling, I haven't been
to a masquerade ball in ages.

497
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,272
I was just hoping you'd ask me.

498
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,228
Wilbur! Come here.

499
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,197
Miss Raymond'
will you excuse me?

500
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,280
Oh, you irresistible boy!

501
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:19,577
Do you want me? Yes, I want you.
Come over here.

502
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,171
I just wanted to get a good
look at you in the light.

503
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,332
I still don't get it.
Jealous?

504
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,635
Wilbur, I'll have to go
out and get a costume.

505
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,804
That's funny. I was
just going, too.

506
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,634
I'll go down to my room and pick up a
couple things and meet you in the lobby.

507
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,014
All right. In the lobby.

508
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,391
I'll get my hat and coat.
I'll be right with you.

509
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,814
Excuse me.
Look.

510
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,984
Now you've got two dates. What
about Sandra, you bigamist?

511
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,609
Sandra? I don't know.
Joan is awful cute.

512
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,733
All right, you take Joan, I'll take Sandra.
Oh, Sandra sends me-

513
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,451
Well, then I'll take Joan.
Joan sends me too.

514
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,403
Now, listen, you
sawed-off Romeo,

515
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,567
in a minute, I'll send you!

516
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,241
You don't even appeal to me.

517
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,456
Look, Wilbur, we've always
been pals, haven't we?

518
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,878
Oh, yes.
We've always shared,

519
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,963
and shared alike, haven't we?

520
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,542
Well, now, look, let's be reasonable.
Come on.

521
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,635
I've always shared with you.
That you have!

522
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,346
If I had two cigarettes, I'd give you one.
That's right.

523
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,461
And if I had two pair of
shoes, I'd give you a pair.

524
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,193
Don't I know that?
And if I have two girls...

525
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,015
Well?

526
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:22,365
Why don't you light that cigarette, put on
those shoes and take a walk for yourself?

527
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,187
That's what I'm going
to do, but with you.

528
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:41,458
This key don't fit.
This is... Talbot's key.

529
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,376
Hey, we forgot about him.

530
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,965
Boy, what a bender he
must've been on last night!

531
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,556
Hey, Mr. Talbot.
Mr. Talbot!

532
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,818
And I thought you were such a
nice man, too. Look at yourself.

533
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,267
You're a mess!
Last night...

534
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,062
I went through another
of my horrible experiences.

535
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,853
Years ago I was
bitten by a werewolf.

536
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,906
Ever since, when
the full moon rises,

537
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,075
I turn into a wolf myself.

538
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,654
Oh, pal, that's all right.

539
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:24,626
I'm sort of a wolf myself.
And here I thought...

540
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,454
I thought that you were the
only one that would believe me,

541
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:31,508
that you were the one that
knew that I spoke the truth.

542
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:35,178
You have seen the living dead.
Mm-hmm.

543
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,591
I came all the way from Europe,

544
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,974
because Dracula and the
Monster must be destroyed.

545
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,929
Together we must find them!

546
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,408
Oh no, now, wait a minute. Let's
not start that all over again.

547
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,106
I can't go. I've got a date.
In fact, I've got two dates.

548
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:54,531
But you and I have
a date with destiny.

549
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,950
Let Chick go with destiny.

550
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,403
Won't you please?

551
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,039
You two kids stay here.
I'm going up and get Sandra.

552
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,718
She's mine too.

553
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,595
Pardon me just
a minute. Wilbur!

554
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,097
Now, look, you've
got Joan and Sandra.

555
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,721
You've got two girls! How about
the two girls we had last week?

556
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:26,844
Let's not talk about that.

557
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,324
You got no kick comin'.
I'm not kicking.

558
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,850
You had the best lookin' one.
So what?

559
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,565
You rs had teeth. Look,
Wilbur, yours had teeth too.

560
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,330
Did you see that tooth?
Yes, I happened to see it.

561
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,999
Mine had so much bridgework, every
time I kissed her I had to pay toll.

562
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,240
What's the use?

563
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,703
Wilbur, can't we both
go along, too?

564
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,952
Yes, mon amour. That's Spanish.
That's French.

565
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:49,328
How do you like that? I speak French too.
Oh, you cute little devil!

566
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,170
Stop that.

567
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,170
Come on, lead the way.
Come on.

568
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,728
Hello.
Hello.

569
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,438
Is Sandra in?
Who?

570
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,741
Sandra. You mean, Dr. Mornay?

571
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,285
Well, if that's what she is, I'm
just what the doctor ordered.

572
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,287
Come in.
Thank you.

573
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,249
I thought this Sandra
was your date.

574
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,918
Or did we both come along
for the ride? No, no.

575
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,918
Perhaps I should introduce myself.
I'm Professor Stevens.

576
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,422
This is Miss Raymond, This is
Wilbur Grey, and I'm Chick Young.

577
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,928
How do you do, Miss Raymond?
How do you do?

578
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,802
I have work to finish, but it shouldn't
take more than a few minutes.

579
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,441
If you'll wait in the
library, I'll be right down.

580
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,264
Just to keep the records clear.
We're here to pick up Sandra.

581
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,472
Of course. I'm sure she's
around somewhere.

582
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,941
Wilbur!

583
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,610
Sandra, hello.

584
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,484
That girl, who is she?

585
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,150
She's Chick's date. She's going
to the masquerade with us.

586
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,533
But I told you to come here alone.
We'll have to get rid of them.

587
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,240
I'll have to get
rid of somebody.

588
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,459
Hello, Sandra.
Hello, Chick.

589
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,162
Joan, this is Sandra.
Sandra, Joan.

590
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,632
Nice place you have here, Doctor.
Who told you I was a doctor?

591
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,376
Why, the young man
who answered the door.

592
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,803
Oh, Professor Stevens.

593
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,008
I'm on a vacation, you see,
and traveling incognito.

594
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,056
What are you doing here?
Same thing.

595
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,107
Shall we get going? Just as
soon <i>as</i> I put on my costume.

596
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,186
Would you like to powder your nose?
I'd love to.

597
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,568
I'll be right back, Wilbur.
(SIGHS)

598
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,196
I'll be right back, too, Wilbur.
(SIGHS)

599
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,782
Toodle-oo!

600
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:56,250
Chick, there's a time in everyone's
life when they get in trouble.

601
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,373
I'm in a mess of it right now.
Now, what's wrong?

602
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,255
I've got two girls.
You know the old saying?

603
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,961
"Everything
comes in threes."

604
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,217
Now, suppose a third girl
should fall in love with you?

605
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,550
What's her name?
We'll say her name is Mary.

606
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,306
Is she pretty?
Beautiful.

607
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,058
Naturally, she'd have to be.

608
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,935
Now you have Mary, you have
Joan and you have Sandra.

609
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,730
So, to prove to you that I'm
your pal, your bosom friend,

610
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,732
I'll take one of
the girls off your hands.

611
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,566
Chick, you're what I call a real pal.
It's all right.

612
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,067
You take Mary.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

613
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,121
We better answer that phone.
They're all upstairs.

614
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,744
Hello.
Hello?

615
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,292
Is Dr. Lejos there?

616
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,428
Just a minute. Somebody wants
to know about a Dr. Lejos.

617
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,452
I don't know him.

618
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,960
<i>Hello? Who is this speaking?
This is</i> Wilbur Grey.

619
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,043
I thought I recognized
your voice.

620
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,470
This is Talbot speaking.

621
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,595
Listen. I just got a line
on Dracula and the Monster.

622
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,688
<i>A certain Dr. Lejos has been receiving
a lot of electrical equipment,</i>

623
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,766
just the type necessary
to revive the Monster.

624
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,606
So what? I'm way
out on an island.

625
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,063
I've got my own problems.
Yes, but listen.

626
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:07,362
I believe you're in the
house of Dracula right now.

627
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,736
You can find the
Monster, and I'll...

628
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,036
(PHONE DISCONNECTS)

629
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,697
Hello?

630
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,157
<i>Wilbur!</i>

631
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,787
Come here!

632
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,027
Chick, you don't know what
you're doin', son! (SHUSHES)

633
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,167
What's the matter with you?
Quiet. Come here.

634
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,474
You didn't hang up the phone.
Let him hang up the phone.

635
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,499
Who?
Dracula.

636
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,903
Dracula and the
Monster live here.

637
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,929
Wait a minute. Don't start that again.
Who told you that?

638
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,219
Talbot. He also said that
we got to search the place.

639
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,345
Come here.

640
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,392
Come over here.

641
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,600
Now, listen, Talbot, enough is enough.
Now, Wilbur's scared to.-.

642
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,182
Hello? Hello'? He's gone.
So am I.

643
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,660
No, you don't. Come here. I'm gonna
settle this thing once and for all.

644
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,437
We'll search this place. Look,
Chick, it's a little past sunset,

645
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,739
and if Dracula is here, he's
gonna be wanting breakfast.

646
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,067
And I'm fatter than you,
and it ain't gonna be me!

647
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,490
Now, just a minute. Just a minute.
It ain't gonna be me!

648
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,039
Wait a minute, I'm gonna prove just how
crazy both you and Talbot really are.

649
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,082
We'll search this place,
right from the basement.

650
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,159
Look, Chick.
What?

651
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,303
We'll search it.
That's more...

652
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,637
You and I together.
Now we're talkin'.

653
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,639
Attaboy. You search the
basement, I'll search outside.

654
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,016
Oh, no, you don't!
All right, then,

655
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,642
I'll search on outside,
and you search the basement.

656
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,713
That's different.

657
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,046
(CHUCKLING) It worked!
Come on!

658
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,549
Now, let's look around here.

659
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,681
There's some doors down there.

660
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,988
You think we oughta tell
Sandra where we're goin'?

661
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,264
Certainly not.

662
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,480
You look over there.

663
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,622
Well?
Broom closet.

664
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,291
What?

665
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,621
Broom closet? Look out.

666
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,705
Come on.

667
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,342
Broom closet?

668
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,380
Come on!
Wait for me.

669
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,931
Come on.

670
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,525
Oh!

671
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,822
Chick! Open!

672
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,440
(SCREAMS)

673
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:20,903
(SCREAMS)

674
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,120
Whoa!

675
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,381
Chick! Come on. Chick!

676
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,011
Chick! You search down there
and on the inside. Shh.

677
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,133
(STAMMERING)

678
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,895
Stop!
It's the truth. Come here.

679
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:50,975
(STAMMERING)

680
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,729
All I did was like this.

681
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,542
Now, Chick, I tell you,
right over there.

682
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,783
Where are they?
Where are they?

683
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,545
They're in there. They're in there.
Now, listen.

684
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,570
(WHISTLES)

685
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,031
Wait a minute. I'm gonna look around.
You go ahead.

686
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,913
If I don't find anybody,
I'm gonna beat your ears off.

687
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,511
I'm telling you, Chick. Honest.
Well, wait here.

688
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,039
They're over there. Oh, no. I ain't
goin' near that place anymore.

689
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,964
Whoa! Ooh!

690
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,724
Open sesame!
Open sesame!

691
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,244
Well, where are they?
They must be in there.

692
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:52,545
Oh, stop. Now, listen Wilbur, I'm getting sick
and tired of this silly nonsense of yours.

693
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,999
Some guy going around...
(MIMIC-S GROANS) No, no.

694
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,006
Another guy goin'...
No, no!

695
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,008
The one guy goes...
The big...

696
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:04,216
And the other guy,
not like that, like this.

697
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,552
Yeah. All right, all right, all right.
Put your hands down.

698
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,980
Come on, the girls are waiting
for us upstairs. Come on.

699
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,314
Have you known Wilbur long?
Yes, we're old friends.

700
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,817
Will you belong?
Just a few minutes.

701
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,794
Miss Raymond?
Yes?

702
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,874
I'm ready. Shall we go?

703
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,625
Of course.

704
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,302
Here's your purse, dear.
Thank you.

705
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,017
(SCREAMS)

706
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,189
Who screamed?
You did!

707
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,271
I did?

708
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,360
Now, listen, Wilbur, if you don't
stop imagining these crazy things,

709
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,491
I'll take you to a doctor
to have you examined.

710
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,591
But I'm telling you, I saw them. And when
I see what I see, I saw it. That's all.

711
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,259
Because Mr. Talbot,
same way, he saw it too.

712
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:57,253
Talbot! He's crazy.
You're both crazy!

713
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,170
Sandra.

714
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,345
Sandra, I've just gotta tell you.
I was downstairs in the basement.

715
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,344
Basement? And what were
you doing down there?

716
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,855
I opened the door.
He opened the door'

717
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,051
and fell down the stairs.

718
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,303
Fibber.
How careless!

719
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:15,184
You should be careful! A person
can get killed that way!

720
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,185
I hope you weren't
disturbed, Dr. Lejos.

721
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,733
It's perfectly all right,
my dear. Introduce me.

722
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,652
This is Miss Raymond.
Mr. Young.

723
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,317
And this is Wilbur.

724
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:29,156
Ah, Wilbur! Why!

725
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:33,285
I heard so much about you, I
feel <i>as</i> if we have already met.

726
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:39,546
And I must say, my dear, I approve
very highly of your choice.

727
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,375
What we need today
is young blood.

728
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,380
And brains!

729
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,558
Oh, don't be bashful. Come.

730
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:57,063
Hello, Dr. Lejos. I've been
looking for you all clay.

731
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,325
You know, every time I ask Dr. Mornay what
that equipment is going to be used for,

732
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:01,692
she says to ask you.

733
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,519
Of course.

734
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,151
Didn't I hear that you were
going to masquerade ball?

735
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,822
Yes, we have our costumes out in the boat.
Oh, you young people!

736
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:14,618
Making the most
of life, while ii lasts.

737
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,915
Thank you.

738
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,377
Professor, you've
worked hard and well.

739
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:24,377
Why don't you join them, and save
your questions until tomorrow?

740
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:29,053
Under ordinary circumstances I'd
say no, but... If you don't mind?

741
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,802
Not at all.
Good. I'll get my coal.

742
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,265
Of course that would make
too many for one boat.

743
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,644
But if the professor and this lady
and gentleman go on ahead, sure.

744
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,693
Wilbur and Dr. Mornay can...
I'm afraid I can't.

745
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,110
What's the matter?

746
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,313
I've suddenly developed
a splitting headache.

747
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,324
I'm sorry, Wilbur, but you'll
have to go without me.

748
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,902
Nonsense! It will pass
as quickly as it came.

749
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:56,660
It's no use, Doctor. I shall
have to go directly to bed.

750
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:02,670
Pardon me. Well, Chick,
there goes your date.

751
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,170
Now then, what
was that all about?

752
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,129
This thing is too dangerous. The
girl is an insurance investigator.

753
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,384
Stevens is asking
too many questions.

754
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,013
And Wilbur was up to
something in the basement.

755
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,388
I think we ought to wait.

756
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:21,439
And jeopardize the success
of the operation? Never!

757
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,311
I must warn you, my dear Sandra,

758
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,735
I am accustomed
to having my orders obeyed,

759
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,610
especially by women
with a price on their heads.

760
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,613
Don't try to scare me,
Count Dracula.

761
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:45,292
<i>Hem. The Secrets m' Lite
and Death by Dr. Frankenstein.</i>

762
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:52,303
Memorize them. Operate yourself,
if you're in such a hurry.

763
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:56,508
I have other ways
of securing your cooperation.

764
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,719
You're wasting your time. My
will is as strong as yours.

765
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,930
Are you sure?

766
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,105
Look into my eyes.

767
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,567
Look!

768
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,707
Deepen

769
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,457
Tell me what you see.

(BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING)

772
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,068
Joan, Chick and I are gonna go into the
lockers and change into our costumes.

773
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,357
Come on, Professor. We'll
meet you on the dance floor.

774
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:53,155
<i>Okay.</i>

775
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,794
What did I do?
What do you mean?

776
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,741
He's dancing with my girl!
So what?

777
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,073
I'll show her!

778
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,328
(SINGING) I'm in love...

779
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,743
Okay. Come on. Pick
up those bundles!

780
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,043
Let's get dressed.
Come on.

781
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,003
So, it's you!
Ah, he knows me!

782
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,627
McDougal! Listen, fat boy,
where are my exhibits?

783
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,711
Now, you leave him alone!

784
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,671
Not until he tells me
where those exhibits are.

785
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,599
Where are they?
Where are they?

786
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,760
McDougal, now
we've got it on you.

787
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,655
You put us in jail. Now, we'll have
you arrested for assault and battery.

788
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,824
Go ahead and see what good it'll do ya.
You haven't got a witness.

789
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,226
I'm a witness! My word's
as good as yours!

790
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,562
Your word is better than his.
You keep outta this.

791
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,864
I'll get a witness. Do me
a favor, will you, fella?

792
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,691
Will you watch this?
I need a witness.

793
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,904
Go ahead. I'd like to
see you do it again.

794
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,451
Did you see it?

795
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:46,200
I'm sorry.
I couldn't see a thing.

796
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,209
Thank you.

797
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,549
Have you seen Chick
Young or Wilbur Grey?

798
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,003
Seen them? I don't
even know them.

799
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,722
I've got to know what
they found on that island.

800
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,134
Chick! Wilbur!
What did you find?

801
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,764
Was I right?
No.

802
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,642
And I wish you'd stop trying to put
those ideas in this boy's head.

803
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,315
He's not used to them. Go
put your things on, Wilbur.

804
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,392
Did you meet Dr. Lejos?
Yes.

805
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:16,652
What did he look like? Tall,
aristocratic, a faraway look in his eye?

806
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,983
All I know is he told us to
go out and have some fun.

807
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,283
Why don't you?

808
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,784
Can't I convince you that Dracula
is a very dangerous person?

809
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:28,743
You and Wilbur are just trying to scare me.
Well, it won't work!

810
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,077
(SCREAMS)

811
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,251
I scared ya.
(LAUGHS)

812
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,707
I scared ya, you big sissy.

813
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,167
This is your mask over there.
Mine?

814
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,417
(ROARS)

815
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,714
Oh, no, no. Please don't wear that.
What's the matter?

816
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,015
I know you'll think
I'm crazy, but...

817
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:47,641
In a half an hour the moon will
rise and I'll turn into a wolf.

818
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,438
You and 20 million other guys.
Listen!

819
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,854
I might tear you limb from limb!

820
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,061
Is that serious?
He'll murder ya!

821
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,770
That's serious.

822
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:01,071
It won't be if you'll just take
me and lock me in my room.

823
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,868
Please.
Oh, all right.

824
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,413
Why don't you hire
yourself a keeper?

825
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,616
Come on.

826
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,128
Hey!
(GASPS IN SURPRISE)

827
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,461
Look.
Oh, Sandra's coming.

828
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:26,391
Is it all clear? I will
take care of the girl.

829
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,140
And you'll take Wilbur
back to the castle.

830
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,018
Understand?
Yes, Master.

831
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,312
Sandra, you look...

832
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,569
So... We meet again,
Count Dracula.

833
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,367
Dracula? Yes. That's
who he says you are.

834
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:49,206
Oh, my costume perhaps. No, Talbot
here thinks you're the real thing.

835
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,409
Uh-huh. Right out of
McDougal's House of Horrors.

836
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,085
What an odd hallucination.

837
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:58,337
But the human mind is often
inflamed with strange complexes.

838
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,803
I suggest you consult
your physician, Mr. Talbot.

839
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,676
And take him along
with you, please.

840
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,766
Well, so there you are!

841
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,223
I'm glad to see
you've recovered.

842
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,689
I didn't expect to see you here, Doctor.
Sandra insisted I come.

843
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,438
Besides, I need
a little relaxation.

844
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,019
Miss Raymond, would you
honor me with a dance?

845
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,439
No. No!

846
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,819
I warn you.
He is Count Dracula!

847
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,776
How interesting.
Tell me more.

848
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,954
No, let me tell you...
While we dance.

849
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,702
Pardon me, Mr. Talbot.

850
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,706
Sandra, do you feel all right'?
Of course.

851
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,130
But I must obey
my doctor's orders.

852
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:42,005
Oh, sure! You gotta do
what the doctor tells ya.

853
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:46,388
I intend to. Let's
have a walk, Wilbur.

854
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,181
Toodle-oo.

855
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,559
Professor, do you
understand women?

856
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,730
I don't even m'.
I'm gonna get me a drink.

857
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,576
Sit here.

858
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,335
Sandra, there's something strange about ya.
You're not yourself.

859
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,587
Is there anything
I can do to help'?

860
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,007
I want you to go away
with me to the island.

861
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,676
Just me and you'?
Yes.

862
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:33,431
I want to be the only one in your life.
I want to be part of you.

863
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,604
I want to be in your blood.

864
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,105
I think I know what you mean.

865
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:49,493
Wouldn't you want a prettier fellow
than me? No. I want no one but you.

866
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:53,573
You are so full-blooded,
so round, so firm.

867
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:57,789
So fully packed.
And I want to stay that way.

868
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:58,869
(GASPS)

869
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,043
Stuck myself.
I'm bleedin'.

870
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,796
Let me see it.
Uh-uh.

871
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:09,005
There ain't enough there for the two
of us, if that's what you're thinking.

872
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,931
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.
Look into my eyes.

873
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:15,974
I'm afraid to. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

874
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,018
Look. Deeper.

875
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,266
Deeper!

876
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,144
Deepen

877
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:42,087
I looked deep enough.
I don't wanna look anymore.

878
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,335
Of course you do.

879
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,709
Don't you know
what's going to happen now?

880
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,838
I'll bite.
Oh, no... I will!

881
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,557
CHICK: Wilbur!
Joan! Wilbur!

882
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,343
Joan?
There he is.

883
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,975
Wilbur, have you seen Joan?

884
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,102
No, bull have definitely
made up my mind.

885
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,493
You can have Sandra, but make sure
you've got plenty of bandages.

886
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,111
Maybe Dracula lured Joan
into the woods and...

887
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,110
Chick, do "you know what could happen
if I meet Dracula in the woods?

888
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,942
I'll bite. Oh, no. You
gotta stand in line.

889
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,323
Let's not waste anytime.
Yeah, let's.

01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,620
Joan? Joan?

891
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,291
Joan! Chick,
we can't find her.

892
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,920
Now, let's keep on looking.
Come on. Joan!

893
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,388
Joan?

894
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,309
Chick, we're never
gonna find her.

Where did he go? Chick!

I'm gettin' tired of
lookin' for Joan.

905
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,952
Look at him.

906
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,239
Didn't Mr. Talbot tell you not
to put that mask on anymore?

907
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,450
Now, what'd you put it on for?

908
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,290
Now, take the mask off!
Come on!

909
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,224
Joan?

910
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,489
Hey, Chick, now, what are
you lookin' in there for?

911
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,033
You know you're not
gonna find Joan there.

912
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:11,403

Get up! We gotta find Joan.
