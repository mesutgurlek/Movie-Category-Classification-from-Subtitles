Father? Father!

Go away, phantom.

672
01:27:19,804 --> 01:27:23,766
- Father, it's me.
- Go away. My daughter is dead.

673
01:27:26,477 --> 01:27:28,645
Take my father out of here.

CLAUDIA: You seem quite alive...

681
01:30:30,153 --> 01:30:33,156
for a little wench
who's been rotting in the ground.

682
01:30:38,953 --> 01:30:40,663
I felt you stir...

683
01:30:43,666 --> 01:30:46,126
the moment you took your first breath.

684
01:30:50,213 --> 01:30:54,508
- It was like a knife in my heart.
- You have no heart.

685
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,220
That's too simple.

01:30:59,179 --> 01:31:02,015
I've seen what you've done to my father.

For my son.

Your baby is dead.

He's alive in this room.

01:31:29,373 --> 01:31:32,709
Dearie, don't point that thing at me.

691
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:35,545
Someone might get hurt.
