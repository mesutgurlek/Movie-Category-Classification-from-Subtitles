1
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,605
Hey...

2
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,970
Are you all right?

3
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,681
Wait...

4
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,326
Christ!

5
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,689
What did they do to you?

6
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,566
My family...

7
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,567
My family...

8
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,165
They've got the remote...

9
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,321
The door...

10
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,244
- Family... must call them.
- Wait...

11
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,210
A cell phone, please!
A cell phone...

12
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,527
Please, a cell phone...

13
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,842
- Take it easy.
- Call this number...

14
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,765
- Snit...
- Snip...

15
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,969
46... 9... 90... 44...

16
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,964
44... 44...

17
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,441
Give it to me!

18
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,691
- Hello?
- Dani, love, listen.

19
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,969
Don't let anyone in,
stay inside, call the police.

20
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,964
Don't let anyone in
until the police arrive, OK?

21
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,121
Dad,

22
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,601
they're here.

23
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,966
They shot mom.

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,288
KIDNAPPED

25
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,920
Hey!

26
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,565
You can't park there.

27
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,764
Why not? I live here.

28
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,443
- Yeah, but the truck...
- How's it going?

29
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,602
Fine, we'll be finished
in a few hours.

30
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,411
- Forgive him, he's new.
- That's OK.

31
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,001
- You got the invoice?
- Yes, it's perfect.

32
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,051
Take the car keys
in case you have to move it.

33
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,281
Hello?

34
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,521
Hello!

35
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,286
- I'll stay tomorrow.
- You'll stay today.

36
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,728
Look, I'll help you tomorrow.
Mom, I can do it then.

37
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,609
Ma'am, where does this go?

38
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,410
- Mom, listen!
- Is a, please!

39
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,485
Excuse me. Leave it in the room
at the end of the hall, please.

40
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,250
- Is a...
- I'll stay tomorrow!

41
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,842
- No, today.
- Don't do this to me, mom!

42
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,531
It's bad enough that you've made me
come and live out here!

43
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,364
This place is like a graveyard!
And now you won't even let me go out!

44
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,090
Who won't let you go out?

45
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,651
- Tell me, who?
- You!

46
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,086
That's unfair.

47
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,891
I just want the three of us
to stay in tonight.

48
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,849
But I've arranged to go out.

49
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,163
- Well, UN-arrange it.
- I can't do that, mom.

50
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,847
It's a party, don't you understand?

51
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,049
Your father and I have said no,
and we mean no.

52
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,929
Mom, dad doesn't care.

53
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,281
He does care.

54
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,489
- He won't care, if you tell him.
- Don't start that.

55
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,842
You just want to fuck me up.

56
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,287
Is a, don’t talk to me like that!

57
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,204
And lower your voice.

58
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,171
I'll ask dad.

59
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,006
Leave your dad in peace.
If I say no, it's no.

60
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,881
No, mom, I'm going.
Don’t care what you say, I'm going.

61
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,969
- What do you mean?
- I'm going.

62
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,166
Keep on like that...

63
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,401
Ma'am,

64
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,921
where does this go?

65
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,129
- At the end of the hall.
- That's mine, come with me.

66
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,443
- Is a! We haven't finished.
- My mother's being hysterical.

67
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,329
Yeah, of course.

68
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,167
Why not? Of course I'm going.

69
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,210
If you come, even better.

70
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,526
Let's meet

71
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,245
at the entrance.

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,731
I don’t know, I'll text you later
and tell you, OK?

73
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,081
See you.

74
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,649
Put that over there.

75
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,007
- Are you guys exhausted?
- Yeah, but we're almost done.

76
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,205
How did you cut yourself?

77
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,006
An accident.

78
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,126
- Do you play golf?
- No, they're my father's.

79
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,045
At the far end?

80
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,687
Yeah.

81
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,444
- Shall I help you?
- No.

82
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,725
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

83
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,970
Where do I leave the bag?

84
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,169
Leave it in that room.

85
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,526
Marta.

86
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,369
Do you know where mom is?

87
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,369
In the sitting room, I think.

88
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,601
Lots of light, like you wanted.

89
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,445
Yeah.

90
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,242
I haven't stopped all day,
I need a shower.

91
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,687
Yes, with hot water,
but it gets cut off.

92
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,208
You can't turn on both taps.
Yes, it gets cutoff.

93
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,727
This is the fifth time
I've called you.

94
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,641
I see.

95
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,161
Just a moment.

96
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,562
- Yes, love?
- The box with the files?

97
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,045
In the study, on the shelf.

98
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,486
Thanks.

99
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,086
Look, let's see
if we can sort this out.

100
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,927
Hello?

101
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,081
Hello?

102
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,044
He hung up on me.

103
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,961
Don't get angry, the-y'll fix it.

104
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,091
Yeah, tell me that
when you're having ice cold showers.

105
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,963
It won't be that bad.

106
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,121
In the summer,

107
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,325
this be great.

108
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
We might even
have settled in by then.

109
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,445
What about Internet?

110
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,441
Weren't you going to call them?

111
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,291
What? No, I'm sorry,

112
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,569
we agreed that you'd call.

113
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,360
We-'II have it by tomorrow.
Really...

114
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,802
Put it facing that way, please.

115
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,361
Careful.

116
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,124
Against the wall.

117
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,120
That's it.

118
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,287
There.

119
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,441
What are you doing?

120
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,967
Something's stuck
between my teeth.

121
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,284
- I told you to use different floss.
- Yeah, and I did.

122
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,727
There are toothpicks in the kitchen.

123
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,041
Shit

124
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,321
What?

125
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,524
I was hoping
it would get lost in the move.

126
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,485
We're stuck with that thing.

127
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,244
If it wasn't from your mother,

128
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,890
you wouldn't hate it so much.

129
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,408
- My mother never gave us that.
- No, of course not.

130
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,600
Yes?

131
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,486
Yes, speaking.

132
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,242
Yes, I've got broadband already.

133
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,524
No, I'm not interested.

134
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,167
And I'm very busy right now.

135
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,886
- Is that enough?
- Yes, thanks.

136
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,407
- Be careful, eh?
- Yes.

137
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,806
Yes?

138
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,846
Yes, speaking.

139
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,561
I just told you I'm not interested.

140
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,840
No, miss.

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,765
- The toothpicks?
- We weren't cut off. Coming!

142
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,001
I hung up.

143
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,766
What's that?

144
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,809
It's your father,
calling the gas people.

145
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,641
You look lovely!

146
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,201
- Was the water hot?
- More or less.

147
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,328
Here, put this in the fridge.

148
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,009
- You bought champagne?
- Yes, of course.

149
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,083
Tonight we have to celebrate.

150
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,290
- Now, the cheese...
- Mom...

151
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,601
Darling, get me...

152
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,604
Get me a knife for the cheese.

153
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,046
It's in that drawer.

154
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,923
- This one?
- Yes, that's it.

155
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,041
- I'm not staying for supper.
- Is a, let's not start that.

156
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,685
Dad said I could go.

157
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,644
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

158
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,609
- That's impossible.
- I'm going to change.

159
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,524
Is a, come here a minute!

160
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,571
Is a, I'm talking to you!

161
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,961
- What, mom?
- What do you mean, "What, mom?"

162
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,282
- We talked about this.
- Yeah, mom, we did.

163
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,842
- I told you I was seeing Cesar.
- Invite him here for supper.

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,445
How can I do that, mom?

165
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,329
You can open the champagne,
we'll have a toast and I'll leave.

166
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,529
- No, Is a, not like that.
- Dad let me go, talk to him!

167
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,762
- Mom, really!
- I want the three of us here.

168
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,446
- This is our first night...
- I'm getting changed.

169
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,930
Shit!

170
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,766
Jaime.

171
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,887
We have to call
the gas people again.

172
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,407
- What are you playing at?
- That was cold!

173
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,211
I'm sick of you not backing me up.

174
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,805
What have I done now?

175
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,441
It seems your daughter is going out.

176
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,804
- Yes, she said something.
- Yes.

177
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,563
A party with Cesar, or something.

178
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,805
- You like him, don't you?
- Yes, I do like him.

179
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,961
Well, then?

180
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,569
You knew I wanted the three of us
to be together tonight,

181
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,202
maybe see a movie after supper.

182
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,250
You and I can see it.

183
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,687
It's not that, Jaime.
We're a family.

184
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,242
Can't we have dinner together
on our first night here?

185
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,005
I was looking forward to it.

186
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,210
If she wants to go out with her
friends, let her. What do you care?

187
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,522
What do I care?
It's not that.

188
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,968
Where are my T-shirts?
I can't find them.

189
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,761
Everyone does their own thing here.
I'm always the last to find out.

190
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,446
Always.

191
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,761
This one.

192
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,445
And I've cooked for three.

193
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,601
Here.

194
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,002
I'm ravenous tonight,
I'll eat everything.

195
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,491
Yeah, you'll eat everything.

196
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,691
She's 18, Marta.

197
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,409
Let her enjoy herself.

198
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,608
Come on, loosen up a bit, please.

199
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,285
Don't tell me that.

200
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,970
Jaime, stop that.

201
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,642
Let go, please!
I'm being serious.

202
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,770
Why am I always the bad guy?

203
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,844
You're not,
and no one ever says you are.

204
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,450
I'm just saying
she's at a difficult age.

205
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,126
And we' re not?

206
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,962
I wonder what you were like at 18.

207
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,566
I bet you'd like that,
to see me at 18.

208
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,888
I clon't know if you're joking
or being serious.

209
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,681
Are you at that again?
What's wrong?

210
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,803
I think I've broken a tooth.

211
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,883
- Broken it?
- Or cracked it...

212
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,169
- Get it checked tomorrow.
- It's rubbing against my mouth.

213
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,448
I don't want another gumboil.

214
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,768
This is going
to be difficult for her.

215
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,651
- She won't get used to it overnight.
- I know that.

216
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,122
She's not the only one who moved.
I just want your support.

217
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,248
I want you to back me up.

218
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,686
What was that?

219
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,006
What...?

220
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,245
Is a, sweetheart...

221
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,530
Are you all right, love?

222
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,530
She's bleeding, Jaime.

223
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,803
- She's got a cut.
- She's bleeding...

224
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,321
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

225
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,404
I need a cloth,
something to stop the bleeding.

226
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,641
Please...

227
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,401
What's wrong, love?

228
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,965
Are you dizzy?

229
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,810
What's going on, dad?

230
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,091
- Calm down, love.
- What do they want?

231
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,964
Has the bleeding stopped?

232
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,960
Please, my daughter...

233
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,368
No! Please, don't hurt him!

234
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,570
Take whatever you want.

235
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,970
But don't hurt him, please.

236
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,804
Calm down, love.

237
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,486
What do you want?

238
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,240
What do you want?

239
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,562
Do you understand?
What do you want?

240
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,170
Take out the credit cards
and write down the numbers.

241
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,480
Give me your card.

242
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,964
- The code?
- 4474.

243
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,051
4474.

244
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,285
Where is it, love?

245
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,241
No, please!

246
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,964
No, please, clon't!

247
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,485
Please...

248
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,445
Here...

249
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,643
What's your code, love?

250
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,964
Your code, your number.

251
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,283
- The code for your card.
- The number, to get out money.

252
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,251
The number, love.

253
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,009
All right, all right.

254
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,322
- The code for the card...
- 2300.

255
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,607
2300.

256
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,046
That's good.

257
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,041
That's it.

258
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,531
Cell phones.

259
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,807
Cell phones.

260
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,803
- Cell phones?
- Our cell phones.

261
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,968
Where's yours, darling?
In your purse?

262
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Is it in your purse?

263
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,680
Here it is.

264
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,731
Here.

265
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,046
Where's yours?

266
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,043
I left if in the office.

267
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,450
I wanted to use it earlier
and couldn't find it.

268
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,361
Really?

269
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,926
I don't understand,
I looked for it and I couldn't...

270
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,845
Really, I was...

271
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,286
Please...

272
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,049
Please, don't touch her!

273
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,690
Leave her alone!

274
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,326
Please...

275
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,884
No, please, don't do that.

276
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,244
No, please, Jaime!

277
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,240
Please, don't!

278
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,764
Please, leave her alone!

279
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,960
Let her go!

280
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,729
She can't breathe!
Take the bag off her head!

281
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,042
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill your wife!

282
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,607
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill your wife!

283
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,525
Take the bag off her head!
Can't you see she's suffocating?

284
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,001
She's suffocating.
Please, take it off!

285
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,967
What's the number for the safe?

286
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,569
Come on!
The number for the safe!

287
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,204
2366.

288
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,761
Don't touch my daughter!
She-'s got nothing to do with this!

289
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,287
- What's the number?
- 2366.

290
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,165
- 23...
- 2366.

291
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,049
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

292
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,406
No, no, no...
Dad! Dad!

293
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,684
Let my daughter go, please!

294
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,729
Don't do anything to her, please!

295
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,882
Let her go!
Let her go, please!

296
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,051
Tell him not to hurt her!

297
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,922
Please, tell him to let her go!

298
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,561
Behave, and your girls
will be all right.

299
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,085
If not, they die.

300
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,241
OK?

301
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,686
OK?

302
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,482
I'm going to take off my hood.

303
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,370
Wait a minute...
No, please.

304
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,921
Don't, we-'II do whatever you say.

305
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,845
- I don't care.
- It isn’t necessary.

306
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,124
I know you won't tell the police.

307
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,965
It isn't necessary.

308
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,124
Please, please.

309
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,082
I don't want to see your face.

310
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,120
All right.

311
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,121
I've put it on again.
Open your eyes.

312
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,644
I didn’t have time to see it.
I don't want to see your face.

313
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,171
We-'re going outside.

314
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,330
I can't wear the hood.

315
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,449
So I have to trust you.

316
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,008
All right, all right.

317
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,004
I won't say anything.

318
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,761
Please...

319
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,281
Let's go.

320
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,650
The car keys are upstairs.

321
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,645
Where are we going?

322
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,085
Drive.

323
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,851
Close the window.

324
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,724
Where are we going?

325
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,849
Don't hurt my family.

326
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,684
- Which way? Right, left...?
- Straight on.

327
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,810
That's not up to me.

328
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,761
Who is it up to?

329
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,165
Who is it up to?

330
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,880
You.

331
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,041
Stop here.

332
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,286
Come on.

333
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,449
Get the maximum amount
from every card.

334
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,926
Aren't you coming?

335
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,731
No, the ATM has security cameras.

336
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,650
But if you speak to anyone,

337
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,451
if you ask for help,

338
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,204
or do anything stupid,

339
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,046
I'll make a call.

340
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,807
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

341
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,486
Yes, I'm on my way.

342
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,483
Five minutes, I promise.

343
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,367
You're crazy!
OK, see you soon.

344
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,166
Don't move, please.

345
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,648
No! No!
Please, don’t turn round.

346
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,040
Take it easy.

347
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,965
You must help me.

348
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,407
Calm down.

349
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,689
I'm not going to hurt you.
You have to help me, OK?

350
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,683
Don’t hurt me.

351
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,524
Have you got a cell phone?

352
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,402
You have to call the police.

353
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,081
Do you understand?
Please, do you understand?

354
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,084
- Here, this is all I've got.
- No, no, no!

355
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,968
No, don't, wait a minute!

356
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,124
Please, don't call!
It was a misunderstanding!

357
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,770
Please, wait, wait!

358
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,290
I swear I did nothing! The woman
got scared when I walked up!

359
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,807
- She must have...
- Start the car!

360
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,811
Move, move!

361
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,725
Come on, move!

362
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,683
When I went up, she must have...

363
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,246
Faster.

364
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,406
Right.

365
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,841
Right.

366
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,647
OK.

367
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,007
Right.

368
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,561
Stop here.

369
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,771
- Yes...
- What are you doing?

370
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,921
Ifs me.

371
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,202
Do what you want with the mother.

372
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,249
- No! Wait, please!
- He didn't understand.

373
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,449
- Please, don't do that! I swear...
- No, he doe-sn't care.

374
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,331
He doesn't care.

375
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,681
Come here!

376
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,768
No, please, don't!

377
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,642
Tell them to stop.

378
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,530
Shut the fuck up!

379
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,491
Shut the fuck up!

380
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,325
Stop him!
Tell him to stop, please!

381
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,007
I think I'll give him
another chance.

382
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,769
What?
Like he!

383
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,604
No! Wait!

384
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,048
I'll give you another chance.

385
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,851
Start the car.

386
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm sorry.

387
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,526
I'm sorry, I didn’t...

388
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,208
it's shit!
It's fucking shit!

389
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,765
Stop it! Stop it!

390
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,490
No one tells me what to do!

391
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,405
Stop it now! Stop it now!

392
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,288
But it won't be with you.

393
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,968
Not with an old woman.

394
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,604
He told you not to!

395
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,285
Stop, for fuck's sake!

396
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,567
You can't.

397
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,406
Are you expecting anyone?
Are you?

398
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,889
Mom! Mom!

399
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,849
Help me, please!

400
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,724
Help me.

401
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,685
- You, come here.
- No, no!

402
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,201
Who is it?

403
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,042
- Who is it?
- I don’t know! I don’t know!

404
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,361
What?

405
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,521
Who is it?

406
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,605
A friend...

407
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,805
He shouldn't be here...

408
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,608
- Who the fuck was it?
- I don’t know.

409
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,570
- What? Who...?
- A boy.

410
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,404
- A boy?
- And he went away.

411
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,369
- What boy?
- He's gone now!

412
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,330
Cesar!

413
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,647
Shout again
and I'll kill your mother.

414
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,527
One sound

415
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,840
and I'll kill

416
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,165
your daughter.

417
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,448
Is a, it's me.

418
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,131
- What'll we do?
- Give me the keys!

419
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,971
Hello!

420
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,040
Is Is a there?
It's Cesar.

421
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,686
What the hell...?

422
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,400
Who are you?

423
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,081
Who are you?

424
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,321
I'm a friend of Is a.

425
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,685
Is there anyone else?

426
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,681
No...

427
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,320
- Why would there be?
- What?

428
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,486
What?

429
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,120
I'd arranged to meet her,
and as...

430
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,807
As she didn’t come,
I came here, I saw the light...

431
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,409
- What?
- I don't know anything!

432
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,800
- What?
- I don't know...!

433
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,804
Shut up! Shut up!
Come on, faggot!

434
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,721
Fuck!

435
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,131
You bitches!

436
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,371
Open the fucking door!

437
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,129
Open the fucking door!

438
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,001
Fuck!

439
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,162
Fuck! Fuck!

440
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,844
Listen to me!
Open the door,

441
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,805
or it'll be worse!

442
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,085
It'll be worse!

443
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,364
Open the fucking door!

444
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,446
Help!

445
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,210
Help us!

446
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,523
They closed
the fucking door!

447
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,606
I won't say anything!
Fuck, I won't say anything!

448
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,207
Shut your mouth,
you little shit!

449
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,529
- Hey, you in there!
- There's no signal!

450
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,681
Lady,

451
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,371
we've got your daughter's boyfriend.

452
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,249
Open the door
or I'll kill him!

453
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,970
Listen, love!

454
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,925
Open the door, please!

455
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,043
Is a, do what they say, please!

456
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,602
You have to climb out
the window and call the police!

457
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,684
Is a, listen to me!

458
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,809
Is a, open the fucking door!

459
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,648
Open it, for fuck's sake!

460
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,004
I think she doe-sn't like you.

461
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,810
She must have
another boyfriend.

462
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,326
Climb up!

463
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,810
I can't, mom!

464
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,246
I can't.

465
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,050
No, please, don't!

466
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,565
Listen to me!

467
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,841
Take it easy.

468
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,809
- Climb up!
- I'll count to three!

469
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,001
No, please-...!

470
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,766
When I get to three,
I'll shoot him!

471
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,121
One!

472
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,282
No, please, don'tl
Please, please!

473
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,004
Climb up!

474
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,161
Two!

475
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,931
Mom, he's killed him!
He-'s killed him!

476
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,969
Please, Is a, please!

477
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,042
Listen to me, darling.

478
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,361
Listen to me.

479
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,488
You have to get help,
please!

480
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,362
The cell phone!
Is a, take the cell phone!

481
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,446
Run, run!

482
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,285
Put it away.

483
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,761
Why us?

484
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,926
What?

485
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,485
Nothing.

486
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,006
Why us?

487
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,410
- Why us?
- Keep going.

488
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,923
- I've used all my cards.
- Now your girls' cards.

489
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,846
74.

490
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,407
You won't hurt them, will you?

491
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,922
Look at the ATM.

492
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,041
Before, I didn't...

493
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,646
00.

494
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,687
I was nervous, but now I won't...

495
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,046
I won't...

496
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,087
Listen.

497
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,008
I'd just like to know that
when this is over you won't hurt us.

498
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,965
I'm sure we can come
to some kind of agreement.

499
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,086
You want it?

500
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,925
Take it.

501
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,691
Take it and fire.

502
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,251
I don't care.

503
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,649
No hard feelings.

504
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,609
I just want this to be over.

505
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,361
Very well.

506
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,205
I don't make deals.

507
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,965
I don't negotiate.

508
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,088
They're alive because ifs easy.

509
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,446
If it gets difficult,

510
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,843
their lives don't matter.

511
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,567
Alive or dead isn't important.

512
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,767
Easy or difficult is important.

513
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,729
I like things to be easy.

514
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,887
And you?

515
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,041
Easy.

516
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,530
Easy.

517
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,287
What are you doing?

518
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,405
Aren't we going home?

519
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,769
You said that when we got
the money, we'd go back home.

520
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,570
Turn off the engine.

521
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,805
Hands on the wheel.

522
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,051
We-'II wait until
one minute after midnight

523
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,010
and then we-'II get
more money from the ATM.

524
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,365
Your family is at home.

525
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,324
Be quiet, please.

526
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,570
- We should've opened the door.
- Be quiet, Is a.

527
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,406
Be quiet, please.

528
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,524
Is a, please, be quiet.

529
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,166
- Cesar didn't do anything.
- Neither did we.

530
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,049
Calm down, sweetheart.

531
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,363
- They're going to kill us!
- They' re not going to kill us...

532
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,363
Word, word, word...

533
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,529
I'm going to start crying.

534
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,881
Move.

535
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,081
Come on.

536
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,525
She can't breathe.

537
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,881
She's choking.

538
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,089
Water, please.

539
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,361
For fuck's sake!

540
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,646
What?

541
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,441
How many boyfriends do you have?

542
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,407
- What?
- Take the girl.

543
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,521
Come on!

544
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,531
Get rid of him.

545
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,969
Or your daughter dies.

546
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,441
I'll kill her.

547
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,001
Understood?

548
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,321
OK.

549
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,881
Good evening.

550
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,680
Good evening.

551
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,365
Is anything wrong?

552
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,882
I'm sorry to bother you so late,

553
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,448
but the neighbors rang
to say they'd heard screams.

554
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,331
Yes.

555
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,965
It's just that

556
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,930
my husband puts
the TV on very loud.

557
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,969
I tell him not to,
but he always does.

558
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,121
I'm sorry.

559
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,205
Are you all right?

560
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,521
What?

561
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,405
Yes, why?

562
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,769
You don't look very well.

563
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,287
I'm a bit tired

564
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,771
because

565
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,680
I've just moved house
and I'm very tired.

566
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,241
Good night.

567
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,286
I'm sorry,

568
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,124
may I come in for a minute?

569
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,727
Why?

570
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,807
I've told you nothing's wrong.

571
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,601
Why?

572
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,481
It would just be a routine check.

573
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,926
It's very late,

574
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,571
and I'm very tired.

575
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,761
I'm sorry.

576
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,201
Good night.

577
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,647
I hate to insist,
but I have to do it.

578
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,769
- It's very late.
- Good evening.

579
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,281
Is there some problem?

580
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,283
No, I was explaining
to your wife that

581
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,651
we had complaints about the noise...

582
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,600
That was my fault.
Yes, it was...

583
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,681
Well...

584
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,521
Come in.

585
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,762
Please, come in.
It's cold tonight.

586
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,241
Come on.

587
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,801
Darling,

588
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,208
why don't you turn off the TV?

589
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,760
Go on.

590
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,644
I'm sorry I disturbed the neighbors.

591
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,245
It's just that...

592
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,084
This music equipment...

593
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,400
We didn’t have them in my country.

594
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,051
Where are you from?

595
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,408
Albania. Why?

596
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,561
You're our first Albanian neighbor.

597
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,769
You seem to be doing well.

598
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,451
I can't complain.

599
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,121
Well, how's your patrol?

600
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,002
- Is there much trouble?
- No, no.

601
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,851
It's a quiet night.

602
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,806
Well, sir, we can

603
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,561
offer you...

604
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,884
Would you like some coffee?

605
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,528
Yes, thank you.

606
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,970
Darling, why don't you
heat some milk?

607
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,441
Sugar?

608
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,406
Yes, please.

609
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,281
Well,

610
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,486
I'm sorry, but...

611
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,689
we've just moved, you know?

612
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,768
Don’t worry, some other day.

613
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,604
I'll finish my patrol.

614
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,486
Excuse me?

615
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,127
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

616
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,645
Come out!

617
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,331
What did you do?

618
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,881
God!

619
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,686
You killed him!

620
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,491
You killed him!

621
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,450
- Why?
- He realized...

622
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,321
What the fuck happened in there?
I told you to take the bitch...

623
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,605
Get out of there!

624
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,411
What?

625
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,404
Now what do we do?

626
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,246
They've seen your fucking face,
you moron!

627
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,846
They won't be able to say anything!

628
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,164
You've fucked up from the start.
Ifs all your fault.

629
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,403
And what do you mean,
they won't say anything?

630
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,882
Shut up! Are you scared
that they saw my face?

631
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,921
You're crazy.

632
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,284
You're fucking insane.

633
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,251
Take the mother down
to where the boy is.

634
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,209
- Grab her!
- What are you going to do?

635
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,045
What...?

636
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,526
Take me.

637
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,041
Take me.

638
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,089
- Instead of your daughter?
- Yes.

639
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,366
- Yes?
- Yes!

640
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,840
Yes, yes, yes!

641
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,482
Why should I? Why?
You're old and she's young.

642
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,202
I won't fight you, I swear.
Take me, please, take me.

643
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,642
I love it when they fight.

644
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,250
Please, no!

645
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,164
You want me to fuck you?

646
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,810
Mom! Mom! Mom!

647
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,366
Get up, get up.

648
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,249
Ifs all right.

649
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,120
Everything all right?

650
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,725
Keep going.

651
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,887
What's wrong?
Tell me, what's wrong?

652
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,567
Did you call my home and no one
answered? Is that it?

653
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,485
What's going on?

654
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,401
Jaime,

655
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,081
ifs your wife.

656
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,608
She wants to talk to you.

657
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,081
Let's go.

658
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,600
Let's go!

659
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,808
I didn’t want this to happen.

660
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,168
I didn’t want this to happen.

661
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,171
Selfish bitch...

662
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,600
Selfish bitch...

663
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,210
You should have opened the door.

664
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,966
- You should have opened it.
- Shut up!

665
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,521
- Fucking selfish bitch!
- Shut up!

666
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,247
Shut up or I'll kill you!

667
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,640
Shut up!

668
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,042
Do you like it? Do you?

669
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,243
Come on, say nice things.

670
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,447
Come on.

671
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,402
Like This? Like This?

672
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,050
Like this?

673
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,481
Stop it!

674
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,241
Stop it.

675
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,450
Wait your turn.

676
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,250
I said, stop it, you bastard!

677
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,961
Bastard!

678
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,686
Bitch!

679
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,006
Open the door!

680
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,731
Please!

681
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,730
Please, help me!

682
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,284
Help me, please!

683
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,965
Help me, please!

684
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,040
Please, please!

685
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,721
Why?

686
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,290
Open the fucking door!

687
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,641
Come on!

688
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,645
Open the fucking door!

689
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,003
Open the door, baby.

690
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,887
Come on!

691
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,241
Now that we-'re near the house,
I'll tell you something.

692
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,447
I don't want you
to get upset in there.

693
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,011
What's happened?

694
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,083
The ATM wasn't enough.

695
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,007
We're going
to the bank tomorrow.

696
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,322
- Tomorrow?
- To get more money.

697
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,889
What can I do with
the shit you got tonight?

698
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,325
Don't worry.
Has anything happened yet?

699
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,930
Has anything happened yet?

700
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,930
Has anything happened yet?

701
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,644
Just a few more hours.

702
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,845
Then we'll leave you
in peace,

703
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,446
you, your wife,
your daughter, everyone.

704
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,486
Don't worry.

705
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,205
Stop, stop.

706
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,686
What are you doing?

707
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,490
Stop, stop!

708
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,765
Stop the car!

709
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,762
Stop the fucking car!

710
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,647
Come here, we're not done.

711
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,890
Get away from the door.

712
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,925
Get away from the door!

713
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,000
Drop it.

714
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,731
Calm down.

715
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,561
Put down the gun,
I'm not like them.

716
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,802
I'm not like them.
Put down the gun.

717
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,729
Put it clown.

718
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,566
Calm down, calm down.

719
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,004
Trust me.

720
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,523
What'll we do?

721
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,366
Dad!

722
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,521
Dad!

723
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,325
Is there anyone left?

724
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,245
I saw one of them leaving.
Is there anyone left?

725
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,485
Dad! Dad!

726
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,526
Daddy!

727
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,884
My baby...

728
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,165
My baby...

729
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,967
Are you all right?

730
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,446
Whose blood is that?

731
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,010
Where-'s mom?

732
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,242
Where-'s mom, darling?
Where-'s mom?

733
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,286
- Mom!
- Marta!

734
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,281
I'm here!

735
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,522
We have to get out of here.

736
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,606
We' re coming, Marta!

737
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,685
Down here!

738
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,121
They've gone.

739
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,361
They've gone.

740
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,921
- Jaime, down here!
- Mom!

741
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,561
Mom!

742
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,681
What did they do to you, my love?
Are you all right?

743
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,531
Jaime, please, get me out of here.

744
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,131
Where-'s the tool box?

745
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,885
The tool box, Marta!

746
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,691
- Are you OK, son?
- Yes.

747
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,281
I'll get help.

748
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,442
I've got a cell phone here.

749
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,523
In my pants.

750
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,283
There-'s no signal, Jaime.
There's no signal here!

751
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,486
Love, listen to me.

752
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,005
Is a, listen to me.

753
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,204
Take this, sweetheart.

754
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,526
Do you hear?

755
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,451
It's all over.

756
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,330
I won't be long.

757
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,486
Police.

758
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,290
This is an emergency.

759
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,488
Three men broke into my house.

760
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,362
35, Camino de Simancas.
