2
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:44,077
Suzy Bannion decided to
perfect her ballet studies...

3
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,801
In the most famous school of dance in Europe.

4
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:50,446
She chose the celebrated academy of Freiburg.

5
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:54,167
One day at 9:00 in the morning,
She left Kennedy airport, New york,

6
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:57,811
And arrived in Germany at
10:40 p.m. Local time.

7
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:20,864
Taxi!

8
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,199
Taxi, taxi!

9
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:29,380
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

10
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,610
Taxi! Taxi!

11
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,405
Can you give me a hand?

12
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,583
Uh, Escherstrausse.

13
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,690
-Was?
-Escherstrausse.

14
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,608
Was?

15
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:21,360
Ah, Escherstrausse.

16
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,623
Ja, ja.

17
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:16,064
Has it been raining this hard for long?

18
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,966
Half an hour.

19
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:31,789
Can you wait a minute, please?

20
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,658
-Hello?
-Who is it?

21
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:55,996
Suzy Bannion. I just got in from New York.

22
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:59,371
-I don't know you. Go away!
-But I have the letter you sent.

23
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:02,747
Look, it's really raining hard. You
could just let me in and I'll explain.

24
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:05,126
-Go away. Go away!
-But you don't understand!

25
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:10,880
Wait! Wait a minute. Wait.

26
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:16,174
Hello. Is anybody there?

27
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:18,092
Hello?

28
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:37,040
If you're happy enough with the couch,
you can stay for as long as you please.

29
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,416
Thanks, but I'll be leaving in the morning.

30
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,293
-I'm going away forever.
-Oh, big deal, kid.

31
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:45,710
So what if you've been thrown out of school?

32
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,546
I always got kicked out of school,
beginning in kindergarten.

33
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,883
No, that's not it. I don't give a
damn about getting kicked out.

34
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,070
Well, then?

35
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,448
It's useless to try and explain it to you.

36
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,367
You wouldn't understand.

37
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,783
It all seems so...Absurd,

38
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:03,701
So fantastic.

39
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:09,341
All I can do is get away from
here as soon as possible.

40
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,333
Would you mind if I used the
bathroom? I'd like to dry off.

41
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,634
No, of course not. Go ahead.

42
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:38,610
Hey, why don't you close it?

43
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,365
That's better. It was just the wind.

44
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:48,239
You sure are in bad shape.

45
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:51,462
You have to tell me all about it.

46
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:55,298
The wind! The windows burst open.

47
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:58,674
-I got scared.
-No. That's not it.

48
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:02,011
I mean, what it is that's got you so upset.

49
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:08,724
Okay, you can tell me about it later.

50
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:24,371
Let me in! Pat!

51
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,936
Pat! Pat!

52
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:36,723
Help me! Help me!
There's a murderer!

53
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:43,091
Help me! Help!
There's a murderer!

54
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,106
Help me! Help!

55
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,370
No! No! No!

56
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:09,599
Help me!

57
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:20,149
Help!

58
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,092
There's a murderer!

59
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:50,032
No!

60
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:41,281
Good morning. Good morning, Daniel.

61
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,199
Good morning, miss Tanner.

62
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,877
-Good morning. May I help you?
-Yes, I'm Suzy Bannion.

63
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,754
We expected you yesterday evening.
You wrote us that--

64
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:54,132
Right. I did arrive
last night about 10:00.

65
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:57,009
But the door was locked,
and somebody on the call box...

66
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,426
Said they didn't know who
I was and couldn't let me in.

67
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:02,802
-Who said that to you?
-I don't know. She didn't say her name.

68
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,679
I'm so sorry. At any rate,
Now you're here among us,

69
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,976
So welcome to our academy. I'm miss
Tanner, one of the instructors.

70
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,894
Nice to meet you.

71
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:14,771
Come along. I'd like to
introduce you to madame Blanc,

72
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:16,689
Our vice directress.

73
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:18,607
She was a very famous ballerina.

74
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,525
-Madame Blanc?
-Yes?

75
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:23,786
Suzy Bannion, our new student.

76
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:25,435
Oh, yes.

77
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:30,154
-Excuse me, gentlemen.
-Of course, madame.

78
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:35,908
You're pretty. Very pretty
indeed. They're policemen.

79
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:40,204
I knew a woman called Bannion years
ago in New York. Carol Bannion.

80
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:43,120
-She's my aunt.
-Good! She's a marvelous woman,

81
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,498
A friend and benefactress
of artists everywhere.

82
00:15:45,498 --> 00:15:48,874
I'm delighted to have her niece here.

83
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,866
Well, I offer our academy's official
welcome in the name of our directress,

84
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,245
Who unfortunately is not
here at the moment.

85
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,662
-She's traveling abroad.
-Thank you.

86
00:15:56,662 --> 00:16:00,498
Albert, please wait for me upstairs.

87
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:03,375
He's my nephew. I'm very attached to him.

88
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,293
I must tell you what I
have to say very quickly...

89
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,710
Because those gentlemen
are waiting for me.

90
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,587
Something terrible, truly
horrible, has happened.

91
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:15,382
One of our students, Pat Hingle, who was
expelled just yesterday for improper conduct,

92
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:19,448
Was murdered last night by some
madman. It's a frightening story.

93
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:21,865
But I always warn our students,
Don't I, miss Tanner?

94
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:24,244
I tell them to be careful, not to get
involved with questionable friendships.

95
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:28,080
What I wanted to tell you was that
your room here isn't free yet.

96
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,998
-Just a slight hitch.
-Yes, but don't worry.

97
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:34,333
We've found you a place to stay with one of
our third-year students who lives in town.

98
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,708
You'll have to pay 50 of your
American dollars a week,

99
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,586
But it's a good price, and you can
deduct it from your fee here.

100
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:43,923
Now I entrust you to the care of miss Tanner,
one of our veteran teachers here.

101
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:49,677
Don't be upset if she seems a little
stern or surly. It's only her manner.
She's even that way with me.

102
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:52,593
She really is an invaluable teacher.

103
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:56,774
-Come with me.
-And now, gentlemen--

104
00:16:56,774 --> 00:16:59,920
As you know, our courses last three years,

105
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,298
And you must pass an exam
at the end of each year.

106
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:05,175
So, the girl left the school
About 11:00 in the evening?

107
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:09,012
-That's my information.
-Excuse me.

108
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:12,387
When I got here last night about 11:00,
I saw a girl leaving the school.

109
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:15,725
She's a new student. She just
arrived. What did she look like?

110
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:19,599
Well, she had blonde hair and
was wearing a brown raincoat.

111
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,896
-What did she do?
-I don't know. I only saw her
for a minute in a storm.

112
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:26,773
So you see? It really was 11:00.

113
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:29,650
Coming?

114
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:34,445
We don't teach you how to dance here,
because we presume our students already know how.

115
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:38,320
This is an established academy
dedicated to specializing.

116
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,197
This is Pavlos, our general handyman.

117
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:43,806
He's really ugly, isn't he?
don't be afraid to say so.

118
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:46,568
He can't understand you, anyway.
He speaks only Romanian.

119
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:50,902
You see that gorgeous smile? He's been very
handsome ever since he got those false teeth.

120
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,616
Last year, he discovered He
had gingivitis of the gums,

121
00:17:57,616 --> 00:18:00,032
So he had all his teeth pulled.

122
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:02,910
The top row one morning.
The bottom row a day later.

123
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,828
Bang.

124
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:07,206
-Where are we going?
-To the locker room.

125
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:10,582
We also have a swimming pool,
which you can use when you want.

126
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:18,178
Miss Tanner. I have something to tell you.

127
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:21,055
-Squawk, squawk. Polly parrot.
-Who said that? Shut up.

128
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,471
That's enough of these little
games for the moment.

129
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:27,308
I want to introduce Suzy Bannion, our new student.

130
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:31,144
You'll find several fellow Americans
among these girls--Miriam, for one.

131
00:18:31,604 --> 00:18:34,021
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Your locker's over there.

132
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:36,399
You'll find everything in there except shoes.

133
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:40,235
For today, you can borrow shoes
from someone who has two pairs.

134
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:44,110
Hurry up, everybody. I'll be waiting
for all of you in the red room.

135
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:46,987
Come with me.

136
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,496
Mata Hari is going to file her report.

137
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:04,749
My name is Olga, and you're my tenant.

138
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:06,667
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

139
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,544
They tell me you have to give me $50 a week.

140
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:11,922
-Yeah.
-In advance.

141
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:14,339
Well, don't worry. If you think I'm not--Oh--

142
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:18,175
Don't get hot under the collar.
That's how people are here.

143
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:22,970
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?

144
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,847
-Yes. Me.
-Oh, thank you.

145
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:28,725
If you want to buy them, I can make
you a nice price. Fifteen marks.

146
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:31,602
Oh, no, thanks. I already have some in my suitcase.

147
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:33,520
I just need a pair for today.

148
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:35,438
But if you'd rather not--

149
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:38,315
No. Okay. Go ahead. Take them.

150
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:41,230
-But, uh, Give them back, hmm?
-Of course.

151
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:47,944
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

152
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:49,862
Oh, it's okay. It doesn't matter.

153
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:57,534
Did they shake you up with all
that talk about money?

154
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:59,452
Well, I'm not exactly used to it.

155
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:01,869
Same with me at first.

156
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,247
Then I found out it's a
charming habit around here.

157
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,418
I once read that names...

158
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:15,756
Which begin With the letter "S"...

159
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,173
Are the names of snakes.

160
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,998
Next year, after I finish the course,

161
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:28,875
I've got an offer from the
state school of ballet in Geneva.

162
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,753
What about you?

163
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:35,589
Well, I'll go back to yhe states,
but I'm not exactly sure what I'll do.

164
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:38,926
Hey, thanks.
My room is really pretty.

165
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:40,844
-Like it?
-Uh-huh.

166
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:45,179
That makes me happy. I bet we'll do
nicely together. I think you're sweet.

167
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,097
Even if I have the name of a snake?

168
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:49,015
I was just kidding.

169
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,432
Don't tell me you're as touchy as Sara.

170
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:53,811
No.

171
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,565
Hello?

172
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:02,480
Oh, hi! No, no, no.

173
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,398
You did the right thing.

174
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:07,736
-Hi.
-Hi.

175
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,884
Oh, you didn't have to bring these over here.

176
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:12,301
I could've picked them up myself tomorrow.

177
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,718
I thought you might be needing them.

178
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,636
Yes, but it really wasn't necessary.

179
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:20,932
-Anyway, thanks a lot.
-Oh, no. It's nothing.

180
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:23,349
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

181
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,226
-Don't you want to stay for a while?
-No, thanks. I can't.

182
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:30,062
I live at the school, so I've got to
be back for supper in half an hour.

183
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:31,980
-I have to.
-Just for a minute?

184
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,397
No, no, really. I have to be going.

185
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:37,274
They get very upset if you
show up late for supper.

186
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:41,571
-Okay, sunday. No, not before lunchtime.
-Well, ciao.

187
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:43,988
See you tomorrow.

188
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:45,906
Bye.

189
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:47,824
No, go on.

190
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,660
Uh-huh, I know.

191
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,496
You caught one. Yes, yes, I can
hear you very well.

192
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,414
Didn't you see how he was blushing?

193
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:00,291
He's cute, except he doesn't have any, um--

194
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,667
And he never has enough money
for room and board at school.

195
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,045
That's why that bitch Tanner
has got him under her thumb.

196
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:08,462
She gives him 1,001 errands to do.

197
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:11,339
Sure.

198
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,257
I got it. Okay.

199
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:16,135
Call me back tomorrow evening.
Give me a chance to think it over.

200
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,398
Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

201
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:20,815
Anyway, he is cute.

202
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:23,692
Poor Pat. She liked him a lot.

203
00:22:24,651 --> 00:22:27,528
That poor kid, ending up like that.

204
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:29,945
I can't even think about it.

205
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:32,323
I heard you saw her yesterday evening.

206
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:35,200
Uh-huh. Outside the school.

207
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,617
She was acting very strange.

208
00:22:38,077 --> 00:22:39,535
Mumbling to herself.

209
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:44,944
She really felt terrible when they kicked
her out, but she really deserved it.

210
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:49,739
-There was so much noise.
-God, was she difficult.

211
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:52,156
She was saying things that made no sense.

212
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:55,494
She was always arguing, causing trouble.

213
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:58,639
"Secret."

214
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:01,248
"Iris."

215
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:02,706
What?

216
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,040
Uh, I remember...

217
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,958
She mentioned the word "secret."

218
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,795
And then she...Mentioned a flower--

219
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:14,713
Iris, I think, or a lilac.

220
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:17,091
Secret flowers? What's
that supposed to mean?

221
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:19,968
I don't know. She was a busybody.

222
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:23,804
It would've been easy for her to
find out one of us was in a jam.

223
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:55,414
-How do you like it at Olga's?
-It's nice.

224
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:59,251
Those eight on the list this morning,
come with me to the yellow room.

225
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:05,005
Good morning, miss Tanner. Suzy.

226
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:07,920
-Good morning, madame Blanc.
-I've got good news for you.

227
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,797
We have it all arranged.
Your room is ready for you.

228
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:13,674
Isn't that marvelous? You can
move in today, if you like.

229
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,053
But I'd rather stay at Olga's, if it's okay.

230
00:24:16,552 --> 00:24:18,470
Doesn't matter to me, my dear,

231
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,347
But in your letter of enrollment, you
said you'd be boarding at the school.

232
00:24:21,347 --> 00:24:24,224
-I know, but--
-The room is free now.

233
00:24:24,224 --> 00:24:27,600
-Well, I didn't think it was so important.
-As you wish.

234
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,978
If that's what you want, so be it.

235
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:43,903
Sara?

236
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:49,658
I had no idea you were so strong-willed.

237
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:52,535
I see that when you make up
your mind about something,

238
00:24:52,535 --> 00:24:54,952
Nothing will change it for you.

239
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,870
My compliments.

240
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:38,607
Witch!

241
00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:36,571
And then, toward the end of the 19th century,

242
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,449
The technique of classical ballet...

243
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:42,824
Assumed a different, more stylized impostation.

244
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:46,661
All right. Let's warm up.

245
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:49,538
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

246
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:52,875
No, it's nothing. I just feel a little weak.

247
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,292
If it gets any worse, I'll just stop.

248
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:57,210
And now some exercises.

249
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,087
Daniel, you may begin.

250
00:27:05,036 --> 00:27:08,872
One, two, three and four.

251
00:27:08,872 --> 00:27:11,250
And one and two...

252
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,667
And three and four.

253
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:15,202
And one and two...

254
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,120
And three and four.

255
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:19,038
-And one--
-I'm sorry, miss Tanner.

256
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:22,414
I feel a little weak. Can I
just rest for a second?

257
00:27:22,414 --> 00:27:25,521
Weak? Come on. It's an easy step.

258
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,938
This is the first time we've worked together.

259
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,815
I want to see what you can do,
how far along you are.

260
00:27:31,313 --> 00:27:34,651
Now, come along and join the others.
Come on; let's go.

261
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:37,298
Daniel?

262
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:40,175
All together now.

263
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,970
And one and two...

264
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,847
And three and four.

265
00:27:49,305 --> 00:27:52,182
-I can't. Please.
-And one and two...

266
00:27:52,182 --> 00:27:54,100
And three and four.

267
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:59,356
And one and two and three and four.

268
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:03,460
And one and two and three and four.

269
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,527
Pay attention, Suzy. Get those legs
up higher. You're not paralyzed.

270
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:13,665
Get those legs up higher.
And one and two and three and--

271
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:16,657
Pay attention, Suzy. And one and two...

272
00:28:16,657 --> 00:28:19,035
And three and four.

273
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:22,910
And one and two and three and four.

274
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:54,712
Come on. Come on. Run along.

275
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:57,090
Come on. Drink up.

276
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,967
-Oh, you--You must drink.
-No, that's enough.

277
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:02,384
You heard what the doctor said.

278
00:29:02,384 --> 00:29:04,762
-Drink up.
-No.

279
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:06,719
You must drink.

280
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:09,711
The blood that was hemorrhaging is
going back with the intake of liquids.

281
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:13,547
-Right, professor Verdegast?
-Obviously.

282
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:15,926
My dear madame.

283
00:29:15,926 --> 00:29:19,762
Do not be concerned. It's nothing,
as I've already told the young lady.

284
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:22,639
That's a relief, professor.
How do you feel, dear?

285
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:25,516
-Uh, better.
-The fault lies with your exercises.

286
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:30,810
When somebody's been out of practice,
violent movement could cause tiny
tears in internal ligaments.

287
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,728
Thus the hemorrhaging.

288
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:36,564
You look better already. You've
even got color back in your cheeks.

289
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:38,482
-Isn't that right?
-Oh, yes. She looks much better.

290
00:29:38,981 --> 00:29:40,400
-Ow!
-Hold still.

291
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:43,776
This will get you back into shape in no time.

292
00:29:45,195 --> 00:29:49,530
Here we are. Fine, fine. A day or two,
you'll be on your feet, as good as new.

293
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:56,244
-Who brought my bags here?
-Olga. What a dear.

294
00:29:56,244 --> 00:29:59,121
The minute she heard you were ill, she
went right home and brought your things.

295
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:02,957
Oh, and she also left me your $50,
and she didn't take a penny of it.

296
00:30:02,957 --> 00:30:05,872
Why--Why did she do that?

297
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,749
-If I wanted to, I would--
-Well, my dear,

298
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:11,627
What you need now is
some peace and quiet.

299
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:14,964
If the hemorrhaging should start
again, which is very improbable,

300
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:17,381
You can telephone me.

301
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:20,718
And Tanner, she is to eat
bland food for about a week.

302
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:23,135
And you mustn't let
her have any fruit.

303
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:25,552
-A drop of vin rose?
-Yes.

304
00:30:25,552 --> 00:30:28,889
Good. A glass of red wine with
each meal. It works miracles.

305
00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:32,265
Clears up anemia and strengthens
red corpuscles. It builds the blood.

306
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:36,101
Rest well. You're in good hands.

307
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:02,264
Suzy, we're next-door neighbors.

308
00:31:02,264 --> 00:31:05,141
So, you moved in here.

309
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:08,018
Well, they moved me in here.

310
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:09,936
I really didn't want to.

311
00:31:10,397 --> 00:31:13,312
You know, as soon as I got sick,
your pal Olga ran and got my bags...

312
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:15,230
And threw me out of her place.

313
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,568
She must've thought I had
something awfully contagious.

314
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:23,363
But I can't stand to live in a
boarding school like a ten-year-old.

315
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:26,240
Oh, wow. You come back strong.

316
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,657
Yeah, you know, I feel really well.

317
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:31,994
I mean, it's almost as if nothing
had happened. It's incredible.

318
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:35,370
-And all thanks to professor Verdegast.
-Verdegast?

319
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,288
-He came to look at you?
-Yeah.

320
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,705
Come in.

321
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,001
Hi, Pavlos.

322
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:56,392
Thank you.

323
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,187
You'd better keep an eye on that
lighter. He really likes it.

324
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:03,105
Yes, but I don't think he's a thief.

325
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:05,023
At least you know.

326
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,860
-Are you eating up here?
-Yeah, they put me on a restricted diet.

327
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,737
And on a restricted diet, they give you wine?

328
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:15,573
That's professor Verdegast's idea.
Says it'll build up my blood.

329
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:24,588
The bell. Oh, god. That means
it's only 15 minutes till supper.

330
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:26,966
I'd better change.

331
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:29,843
-Ciao. See you later.
-Okay.

332
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:58,651
Where? Where?

333
00:33:58,651 --> 00:34:00,569
Everywhere. The whole floor.

334
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:03,446
It's disgusting! It's disgusting!

335
00:34:03,446 --> 00:34:05,862
-Where are they coming from?
-I don't know! Let's go and see!

336
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:09,200
-They're coming from the ceiling.
-In the meantime, everybody downstairs.

337
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:23,739
Don't let anyone come up.

338
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:20,898
I'm sorry. Truly mortified.
Please excuse me.

339
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:22,816
But it was nothing to do
with you, madame.

340
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:25,693
No, of course not, girls.
It was not madame Blanc's fault.

341
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:28,340
We ordered those cases
of food by mail...

342
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,718
From a reliable firm that
we thought to be honest.

343
00:35:31,102 --> 00:35:32,560
Obviously, It arrived spoiled.

344
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,938
In a few days' time,
you see what happened.

345
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:37,585
-Oh, it was awful.
-Yes, one got in my mouth.

346
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:41,421
I suppose we're fortunate those things
only reached the floor below the attic.

347
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:44,298
-Are the other floors all right?
-Yes. We checked them out.

348
00:35:44,298 --> 00:35:46,216
Just the floor where the
students' rooms are.

349
00:35:46,216 --> 00:35:49,094
Well, I'll take care of the problem
of fumigating in the morning.

350
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:52,469
In the meantime, for tonight, I've
thought of a makeshift arrangement.

351
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:54,848
Go and see how they're getting
along, will you, dear?

352
00:35:56,306 --> 00:35:58,684
The boys have kindly offered to help,

353
00:35:58,684 --> 00:36:01,101
And they and the servants are turning
the practice hall into a dormitory.

354
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,937
If some of you choose to find hotel
rooms, I'll have no objections.

355
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:06,855
But it's already late,
and in any case,

356
00:36:06,855 --> 00:36:08,773
The inconvenience will only
be for one night.

357
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:11,036
We'll all sleep together.

358
00:36:12,494 --> 00:36:14,412
-Bravo.
-You all right?

359
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:16,829
-Yes, thank you.
-Fine.

360
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:19,207
-Is everything all right?
-Yes, thank you.

361
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:21,125
-Good.
-Are you all right?

362
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:23,044
Yes, madame Blanc. Thank you.

363
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:25,921
-Oh, it's very comfortable. Just like being in camp.
-Good.

364
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,337
Are you sleeping here with
us, too, Madame Blanc?

365
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:30,716
Certainly, as are all the other
teachers and miss Tanner.

366
00:36:31,215 --> 00:36:33,631
Do the teachers live here at school?

367
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:35,549
No, they live in town.

368
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:38,887
They leave after supper at
9:30, just like clockwork.

369
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,958
It's very late. You won't be afraid
if I turn out the lights?

370
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:43,836
-Good night, everyone.
-Good night. Good night.

371
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:23,847
Is that guy hot for you?

372
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:25,726
-Maybe.
-That's funny.

373
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:28,527
I heard he was, uh--

374
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:33,859
-Of course, I'm not much of a gossip.
-That's a good one.

375
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:36,314
Come on. You tried to get
him and didn't make it.

376
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:38,194
-You liar! That's not--
-Why don't you two shut up?

377
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:40,649
Some of us want to go to sleep.

378
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:48,820
Hey, Sara. Forget it. It's okay.

379
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:08,804
Suzy, are you asleep?

380
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:11,413
-Were you sleeping?
-No. What's the matter?

381
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,402
You hear that snoring?

382
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:18,126
It's weird.

383
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:20,926
Hear it?

384
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:23,190
Where do you think it's coming from?

385
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:32,473
Behind the sheet.

386
00:39:32,473 --> 00:39:34,890
Lies!

387
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,846
What?

388
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:42,140
They lied to us.

389
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,557
The directress is here.

390
00:39:44,557 --> 00:39:47,895
That's her, the one who's snoring.

391
00:39:47,895 --> 00:39:50,311
She's the directress.

392
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:52,690
-How do you know?
-I'm sure it's her.

393
00:39:55,835 --> 00:39:57,792
Last year, for a while,

394
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:59,825
I lived in one of the guest rooms...

395
00:39:59,825 --> 00:40:01,896
Under the top of the stairs.

396
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:07,190
One night,

397
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,796
I heard someone coming very late in,

398
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:13,827
Getting into bed in the room next to mine.

399
00:40:14,863 --> 00:40:16,858
And then--

400
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:20,348
Then I heard this weird kind of snoring.

401
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:23,724
I tell you, it was so weird
I never forgot it.

402
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,558
Listen.

403
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:31,013
You hear that whistle?

404
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:35,041
It's exactly the same.

405
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:38,877
The next morning, madame Blanc told me...

406
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:41,256
That the directress had spent
a few hours at the school...

407
00:40:41,256 --> 00:40:44,171
And had slept in the room next to mine.

408
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:48,161
You see?

409
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:52,073
So I know she's the directress.

410
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:54,030
She's here.

411
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,979
She's there.

412
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:01,932
Right behind that sheet.

413
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,177
Thank you. I'm grateful you can take
care of the fumigating so promptly.

414
00:41:26,177 --> 00:41:29,054
-Good morning, madame Blanc.
-Good morning, Daniel.

415
00:41:29,514 --> 00:41:32,430
-Is everything in order now?
-All cleaned up, madame.

416
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,808
Just to be sure, we checked
the other floors too.

417
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:40,563
Miss Tanner. Excuse me.

418
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:42,481
Did the directress sleep
here last night?

419
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:45,358
-No, she didn't. Good morning, Daniel.
-Good morning.

420
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:49,693
You know she's away on a trip. Maybe
she'll pay us a visit two weeks from now.

421
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:53,068
Excuse me, miss Tanner, But which
class do I attend this morning?

422
00:41:53,068 --> 00:41:54,986
The second-year class in the red room.

423
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:56,905
Thank you.

424
00:42:53,296 --> 00:42:55,675
Stop!

425
00:42:55,675 --> 00:42:58,590
Stop! Stop!

426
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,467
Enough. Enough!

427
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:04,344
-Do you know what happened? Do you know?
-What day is it?

428
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:07,682
Your lousy, disgusting
dog has bitten Albert!

429
00:43:07,682 --> 00:43:09,600
He took a piece out
of Albert's arm.

430
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:12,477
-What?
-Did you all hear that?

431
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:15,392
That miserable dog tried
to mutilate a child.

432
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:19,229
Madame Blanc had to rush Albert to
a first-aid center to have stitches put in!

433
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,566
-That's impossible.
-Let's go to the first-aid center.

434
00:43:23,065 --> 00:43:25,942
Even if you can't see the blood, at least
you can hear the poor child's crying.

435
00:43:25,942 --> 00:43:27,860
That's enough now!

436
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,696
My dog's a peaceful, faithful
animal. He's never hurt anyone.

437
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:34,075
The boy must have done
something to him first!

438
00:43:34,075 --> 00:43:37,450
Oh, the poor little animal!
The poor little puppy!

439
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:41,785
If I ever see him within a mile of this
school again, I'll have him put to death!

440
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,703
Stop it!

441
00:43:43,703 --> 00:43:45,621
I won't allow such talk, you understand?

442
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:48,498
You won't allow it?

443
00:43:48,498 --> 00:43:50,877
Then get out! You and your dog!

444
00:43:51,376 --> 00:43:54,253
-Get moving!
-You bitch!

445
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:56,171
Out!

446
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:59,048
I'm going. I'm going.

447
00:43:59,048 --> 00:44:01,465
But try to understand that--

448
00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:05,301
That I'm blind, not deaf.

449
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:07,679
Get it? Huh?

450
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,597
Not deaf.

451
00:44:09,866 --> 00:44:12,244
Not deaf. You understand that?

452
00:44:12,244 --> 00:44:14,162
You understand?

453
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:19,456
Ahh, fresh air!

454
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,835
Let me out of this gilded parade.

455
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:26,170
Get out! Get out of here! Good riddance!

456
00:44:30,006 --> 00:44:33,382
Oh, Pavlos, how much longer
do I have to eat like this?

457
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:58,892
Hey, listen.

458
00:44:58,892 --> 00:45:02,728
There they go, right on schedule.

459
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:05,145
The teachers. Remember?

460
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:09,940
Can you hear them?
They're going away.

461
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:15,694
You hear them?

462
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:19,531
Yes.

463
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,899
I--

464
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:38,865
I--I don't think they'll
even miss school.

465
00:45:38,865 --> 00:45:41,742
What? What did you say?

466
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:44,159
Wake up.

467
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,455
I said, it doesn't seem to
me that they're going out.

468
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,291
A front door is on the left.

469
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:57,087
Their footsteps are going to the
right, somewhere inside the school.

470
00:45:58,544 --> 00:46:01,421
Jesus, Suzy.

471
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:02,419
-You're a genius.
-Mmm.

472
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:05,756
Fantastic.

473
00:46:05,756 --> 00:46:09,055
How come I never noticed that before?

474
00:46:09,055 --> 00:46:13,851
Suzy. If they don't leave,
Where do they go?

475
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:16,267
Wake up. Suzy.

476
00:46:16,267 --> 00:46:20,871
Come on. Wake up. Suzy!

477
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,707
I'm so sleepy.

478
00:46:24,707 --> 00:46:26,625
I don't know why. I'm sorry.

479
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:29,502
Maybe--

480
00:46:29,502 --> 00:46:31,919
Maybe we can find out where they really go.

481
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:37,673
Of course!
Yes.

482
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:43,888
Begin to count the steps as they go.

483
00:47:00,076 --> 00:47:02,378
It's like the search of alietne.

484
00:50:20,209 --> 00:50:22,242
Easy.

485
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,618
What is it? Huh?

486
00:50:25,618 --> 00:50:27,536
Come on.

487
00:50:28,955 --> 00:50:30,873
Come on; let's go home.

488
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:55,118
Who is that? Who's there?

489
00:50:56,576 --> 00:50:58,609
Easy, boy.

490
00:51:03,903 --> 00:51:05,821
What is it?

491
00:51:08,237 --> 00:51:10,271
What's happening?

492
00:51:10,272 --> 00:51:12,306
What's happening?

493
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:18,370
Who's there?

494
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:25,045
Who's there?

495
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:40,543
Wait!

496
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:35,052
Poor Daniel. Torn to pieces. Incredible.

497
00:53:35,052 --> 00:53:37,930
Oh, yeah, but you can never put
too much trust in wolfhounds.

498
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,267
They're crazy. We had two of them
once at the villa in Gestaad.

499
00:53:41,267 --> 00:53:44,182
My god. First Pat gets
murdered by a madman,

500
00:53:44,182 --> 00:53:46,561
And now Daniel is killed by his dog.

501
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:48,978
Yeah. Maybe there's a hex on the place.

502
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:53,274
Yeah. Let's call in the exorcist
and have it purged.

503
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:57,609
-What is it? Is something wrong?
-No, everything's all right.

504
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,256
Is it something personal, dear?

505
00:54:00,256 --> 00:54:02,634
No, no, it's nothing like that.

506
00:54:04,092 --> 00:54:06,471
Miss Tanner, would you mind?

507
00:54:06,624 --> 00:54:08,542
I'd like a few minutes
alone with Suzy.

508
00:54:13,798 --> 00:54:15,716
Well? What is it?

509
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:19,552
I just wanted to talk to you about some of
the things that have been happening lately.

510
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:22,928
Oh, I know you're upset by Daniel's
death, as we all have been.

511
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,846
No, but it's more than that.

512
00:54:25,344 --> 00:54:27,723
Does anybody know anything
about who killed Pat?

513
00:54:28,222 --> 00:54:29,641
I spoke with the chief of
police just this morning.

514
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,058
He told me they had
some definite clues.

515
00:54:32,518 --> 00:54:35,395
-You know that I saw her the night I arrived here.
-Yes, you told me that.

516
00:54:35,395 --> 00:54:38,771
And that she was mumbling some
strange, unrelated words.

517
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:41,648
No, you didn't tell me that.

518
00:54:41,648 --> 00:54:45,024
Because it was something that didn't
make any sense. It was in a thunderstorm.

519
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:47,901
I just didn't pay much attention to it.

520
00:54:47,901 --> 00:54:50,778
I only caught two words distinctly:

521
00:54:50,778 --> 00:54:53,157
"Secret" and "Irises."

522
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:56,532
I don't know what they mean, but
I thought they might be important.

523
00:54:56,532 --> 00:54:58,451
You've done very well. Congratulations.

524
00:54:58,451 --> 00:55:01,328
I don't know what the words
"Secret" or "Irises" mean either.

525
00:55:01,328 --> 00:55:03,744
But I think it's only right we should
let the police know about it.

526
00:55:03,744 --> 00:55:08,003
I'm only amazed you waited
two days before-- hello?

527
00:55:08,194 --> 00:55:11,685
-You really messed things up.
-What are you talking about?

528
00:55:11,685 --> 00:55:14,562
Because... Maybe Pat was talking to...

529
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,440
Someone just inside the building that night.

530
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,692
And we know that someone
wasn't one of the teachers.

531
00:55:30,176 --> 00:55:32,094
Come on.

532
00:55:34,472 --> 00:55:36,889
Now you've put them
on the hunt for somebody.

533
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:39,766
What difference does that make to you?

534
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:41,684
Big difference.

535
00:55:42,643 --> 00:55:45,520
Because I was Pat's friend.

536
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:48,397
She was telling me something
When you suddenly showed up.

537
00:55:48,397 --> 00:55:51,773
She got scared and she ran away.

538
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:54,152
She was in hysterics almost.

539
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,568
And then she was killed.

540
00:55:56,568 --> 00:55:59,906
Remember that voice when you rang the bell?

541
00:55:59,906 --> 00:56:02,323
Well, that was me.

542
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:59,942
I heard strange, incredible, absurd things.

543
00:56:59,942 --> 00:57:02,320
Pat was taking notes on them for months.

544
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,696
And before going away,
she gave me all the notes.

545
00:57:05,696 --> 00:57:09,033
I've only told one person,
a very good friend of mine.

546
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:11,911
Frank Mandel. He's here
for a convention.

547
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:15,286
I'll let you read them tonight.

548
00:57:25,491 --> 00:57:29,327
Suzy, wake up. Please. Wake up.

549
00:57:29,327 --> 00:57:32,703
The notes are gone! Someone
stole them from me!

550
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:36,309
You understand? They disappeared.

551
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:40,950
Don't fall asleep! Please help me!

552
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:44,096
-Wake up! Help me!
-I can't.

553
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:45,745
Can't?

554
00:57:48,162 --> 00:57:52,957
This is the only thing I got left,
and that's because I kept it on me. Look.

555
00:57:52,957 --> 00:57:55,374
-Look.
-What is it?

556
00:57:55,374 --> 00:57:59,671
What's the matter with you? Don't
you remember? What's going on?

557
00:57:59,939 --> 00:58:03,775
This is the key that'll get us
wherever the teachers go every night.

558
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:07,612
I thought it out yesterday evening
while I was sitting here next to you.

559
00:58:07,612 --> 00:58:13,097
Suzy, do you know
anything about witches?

560
00:58:18,353 --> 00:58:21,268
Oh, no! Please!

561
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:26,063
Don't leave me alone!

562
00:58:37,572 --> 00:58:40,449
I must get away!

563
01:00:32,005 --> 01:00:35,342
Wait!

564
01:00:54,715 --> 01:00:57,592
Wait!

565
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,081
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

566
01:06:12,003 --> 01:06:14,766
Looking for Sara? She's disappeared.

567
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:17,643
But that's impossible. I just
talked to her last night.

568
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:21,479
She left this morning, as a matter
of fact, without telling anyone.

569
01:06:21,479 --> 01:06:24,855
Just packed her bags and left. She
was heard leaving about 6:00.

570
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:28,192
-You heard her leave, didn't you?
-Sara? Oh, yes.

571
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:31,568
I heard the door close and her
footsteps going down the hall.

572
01:06:31,568 --> 01:06:35,404
And then I heard a car driving off down the
street. I guess someone was waiting for her.

573
01:06:35,404 --> 01:06:40,199
-But it's impossible.
-If she wasn't happy here, she could've told someone.

574
01:06:40,698 --> 01:06:43,076
Why sneak off like a thief?

575
01:06:52,935 --> 01:06:56,771
Hello. May I speak to Frank
Mandel, please? Yes, thank you.

576
01:06:58,191 --> 01:07:01,106
Hello. This is Suzy Bannion.

577
01:07:01,106 --> 01:07:03,983
No, we've never met. I'm a
friend of Sara's.

578
01:07:03,983 --> 01:07:08,280
Yes. Hello. Do you happen to
know where Sara is?

579
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:12,615
Well, she disappeared from
school this morning.

580
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:15,952
Yes, it seems she left and
took all her luggage.

581
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:20,287
Yes. Uh, listen, could I see
you sometime today?

582
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:24,123
Well, I'm really worried about her.

583
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:28,458
Oh, great. Where?

584
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:31,796
At the convention center.
Okay. I'll see you there.

585
01:07:31,796 --> 01:07:35,171
She didn't inform any of her classmates.
I've already asked all of them.

586
01:07:35,171 --> 01:07:38,547
It's very upsetting. I can't
understand why she did it.

587
01:07:39,008 --> 01:07:41,424
I'm the one who's held responsible
by their families.

588
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:44,877
I'll call her father in Geneva.
Perhaps she might have gone there.

589
01:07:57,344 --> 01:08:01,219
I've already phoned Sara's father.
He's the Italian consul in Geneva.

590
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:05,515
But he wasn't there today.
He was away for the weekend.

591
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:09,352
They said he'd be back by monday, and
they don't know anything about her there.

592
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:12,229
Well, do you understand
Why I'm so worried?

593
01:08:12,229 --> 01:08:16,564
Yes, but before we both get upset,
let's wait for the father's return.

594
01:08:16,564 --> 01:08:19,939
Maybe they got together this morning
and went off on their own.

595
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:25,694
I know her quite well. She was a
patient of mine three years ago.

596
01:08:25,694 --> 01:08:29,530
-Were you aware of that?
-No. I didn't even know you were a psychiatrist.

597
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:33,826
Well, she had a nervous breakdown
after her mother's death,

598
01:08:34,325 --> 01:08:36,243
And she came to me for treatment.

599
01:08:36,742 --> 01:08:40,079
After she got better again,
we remained friends,

600
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:44,874
But lately she was upset about some notions
put into her head by a friend of hers.

601
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:47,752
-Not you, I hope?
-No.

602
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,399
They were kind of wild ideas.

603
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:54,733
She had discovered that the
Tam academy was founded...

604
01:08:54,848 --> 01:08:59,183
In 1895 by a certain Helena Markos,
A Greek immigrant,

605
01:08:59,183 --> 01:09:02,521
And that the local people
believed her to be a witch.

606
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:07,815
-I guess you knew that?
-No. But I have a strange feeling...

607
01:09:07,815 --> 01:09:13,109
That somebody already told me
about it--Or something similar.

608
01:09:13,109 --> 01:09:15,027
I can't--can't remember.

609
01:09:15,027 --> 01:09:18,863
Well, that really got Sara's imagination
going. Earlier in the 19th century,

610
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:23,505
The Markos woman had been expelled
from several european countries.

611
01:09:23,505 --> 01:09:28,799
She seemed to have something about her
which urged religious people to persecute her.

612
01:09:29,297 --> 01:09:33,594
She also wrote a number of books, and
I read that among the initiated,

613
01:09:34,092 --> 01:09:37,085
She went by the name "The Black Queen."

614
01:09:37,085 --> 01:09:40,921
After she settled down here, she became
the subject of a lot of gossip.

615
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:44,757
Nevertheless, she managed to put
her hands on a great deal of money,

616
01:09:44,757 --> 01:09:47,174
And she founded the Tam academy--

617
01:09:47,174 --> 01:09:52,084
At first a sort of school of
dance and occult sciences.

618
01:09:52,084 --> 01:09:54,961
But that didn't last long,
because in 1905,

619
01:09:54,961 --> 01:09:57,838
After being hounded and
cursed at for ten years,

620
01:09:57,838 --> 01:10:01,214
Madame Markos died in a fire.

621
01:10:01,214 --> 01:10:04,552
That's all there is, as far
as witchcraft is concerned.

622
01:10:04,552 --> 01:10:09,500
The school was taken over by her favorite
pupil. The study of the occult was abandoned.

623
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,797
And soon the place became
the famous dance academy.

624
01:10:13,797 --> 01:10:18,592
But what does it mean to be a witch?

625
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:22,083
Well, as a believer in the material
world and a psychiatrist to boot,

626
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:26,418
I'm convinced that the current spread
of belief in magic and the occult...

627
01:10:26,418 --> 01:10:29,755
Is part of mental illness.

628
01:10:29,755 --> 01:10:35,049
Bad luck isn't brought by broken
mirrors, but by broken minds.

629
01:10:36,468 --> 01:10:38,847
Excuse me. Milius?

630
01:10:38,924 --> 01:10:41,340
Professor Milius can answer your
question better than I can.

631
01:10:41,801 --> 01:10:44,678
He wrote a book called paranoia
or magic, and believe me,

632
01:10:44,678 --> 01:10:46,596
It's the final word on the subject.

633
01:10:47,095 --> 01:10:50,931
Excuse me, Milius. If you don't mind,
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

634
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:54,767
-Fraulein.
-She's interested in your favorite subject:

635
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:57,184
Witches.

636
01:10:57,184 --> 01:11:00,521
Can you tell her something
about the mysterious?

637
01:11:01,979 --> 01:11:04,856
Well, I have to go. I have an
appointment to keep.

638
01:11:04,856 --> 01:11:07,234
Keep me posted, Hmm?

639
01:11:07,234 --> 01:11:09,651
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.

640
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:13,986
Ah, so, what would you like to know?

641
01:11:13,986 --> 01:11:17,323
-Do you believe in the existence of witches?
-Ah.

642
01:11:17,323 --> 01:11:21,160
I have known some women who
are said to be witches.

643
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,535
-Really?
-I have studied the phenomenon for a long time.

644
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:26,914
I am of the opinion that
it is an important appendage...

645
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:30,290
Of contemporary psychiatry.

646
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,208
You're skeptical, my dear.

647
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:35,584
Well, frankly, it is a little
hard to believe.

648
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:42,412
-What do witches do?
-They are malefic, negative and destructive.

649
01:11:42,412 --> 01:11:46,708
Their knowledge of the art of the occult
gives them tremendous powers.

650
01:11:47,207 --> 01:11:52,002
They can change the course of events and
people's lives, but only to do harm.

651
01:11:52,961 --> 01:11:56,337
-You don't believe me?
-No, I--

652
01:11:56,337 --> 01:11:59,675
Their goal is to accumulate
great personal wealth,

653
01:11:59,675 --> 01:12:03,511
But that can only be achieved
by injury to others.

654
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:06,887
They can cause suffering,
sickness and even the death...

655
01:12:06,887 --> 01:12:10,723
Of those who, for whatever
reason, have offended them.

656
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:16,017
Why do you have all this
interest in the occult?

657
01:12:16,017 --> 01:12:18,894
Because some friends spoke
to me about witches.

658
01:12:18,894 --> 01:12:21,771
I read some stuff.

659
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:24,648
Have you ever heard of Helena Markos?

660
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:27,986
Oh, yes. She was a very
famous black queen.

661
01:12:27,986 --> 01:12:30,863
A powerful witch with a tremendous
talent for doing evil,

662
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:32,819
A real mistress of magic.

663
01:12:33,164 --> 01:12:36,041
She lived and died in the city.
Did you know that?

664
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:40,837
Yes. And might there exist
a guild of witches?

665
01:12:40,837 --> 01:12:43,714
The correct term would
be a coven of witches.

666
01:12:43,714 --> 01:12:46,591
A woman becomes queen of her magic
is a hundred times more powerful...

667
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:49,506
Than the rest of the coven,
which is like a serpent.

668
01:12:49,506 --> 01:12:53,343
Its strength rests with its leader--
That is, with its head.

669
01:12:53,343 --> 01:12:57,179
A coven deprived of its leader
is like a headless cobra:

670
01:12:57,179 --> 01:12:59,557
Harmless.

671
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:03,393
Skepticism is the natural
reaction of people nowadays,

672
01:13:03,393 --> 01:13:06,309
But magic is ever present.

673
01:13:06,769 --> 01:13:09,991
In other words:

674
01:13:14,787 --> 01:13:17,203
Which means that magic is everywhere,

675
01:13:17,664 --> 01:13:20,579
And all over the world,
it's a recognized fact.

676
01:13:20,579 --> 01:13:23,610
Always.

677
01:13:36,998 --> 01:13:39,875
Mark? Mark?

678
01:13:48,046 --> 01:13:51,422
Excuse me. Where is everybody?

679
01:13:51,422 --> 01:13:55,719
They have all gone to the theater
for the opening of the Bolshoi.

680
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:58,596
-Then why didn't anyone tell me about it?
-I don't know.

681
01:13:59,094 --> 01:14:02,432
Miss Tanner obtained
tickets for everyone.

682
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:11,102
-Frank, this is Suzy. Sara's friend?
-Suzy? Hello?

683
01:14:11,102 --> 01:14:13,480
-I can't--
-Talk louder. I can't hear you very well.

684
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,856
-Did something happen?
-Well, I haven't heard from Sara,

685
01:14:16,856 --> 01:14:19,733
But a lot of strange
things are happening.

686
01:14:19,733 --> 01:14:22,955
I mean, for example,
when I eat at night, I--

687
01:14:23,454 --> 01:14:26,063
Hello? Hello, Frank?

688
01:14:26,638 --> 01:14:29,400
Hello? Can you hear me?

689
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,200
Frank? Hello?

690
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,423
Hello? Hello?

691
01:14:35,423 --> 01:14:37,341
Hello?

692
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,136
Hello, Frank, can you hear me?

693
01:16:09,025 --> 01:16:11,902
No!

694
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,615
No!

695
01:17:55,977 --> 01:17:59,315
They don't leave the school at all.

696
01:17:59,315 --> 01:18:04,072
The front door is on the left. Their
footsteps are going to the right.

697
01:18:30,963 --> 01:18:35,758
Two, three, four, five, six,

698
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:38,597
Seven--

699
01:18:41,014 --> 01:18:45,809
I can find out where they're
going by counting their footsteps.

700
01:19:55,397 --> 01:19:57,315
Twenty.

701
01:21:05,637 --> 01:21:08,054
Who's there?

702
01:21:48,679 --> 01:21:52,361
Carpet. That's why the
footsteps stop here.

703
01:22:10,046 --> 01:22:13,422
It's impossible. There's gotta
be another way out of here.

704
01:23:19,212 --> 01:23:21,859
The secret--
I saw it behind the door!

705
01:23:21,859 --> 01:23:25,081
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

706
01:23:26,386 --> 01:23:29,301
The secret--
I saw it behind the door!

707
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:31,910
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

708
01:26:16,634 --> 01:26:20,471
I told you: we must get rid of that
bitch of an american girl!

709
01:26:20,471 --> 01:26:25,649
Vanish--She must vanish! Make
her disappear, understand?

710
01:26:29,025 --> 01:26:31,902
She won't eat or drink
anything this evening.

711
01:26:38,616 --> 01:26:41,953
Vanish--She must vanish!

712
01:26:42,068 --> 01:26:44,945
She must die, die, die!

713
01:26:52,387 --> 01:26:54,804
Helena, give me power.

714
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:11,108
Sickness! Sickness!

715
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:13,985
Away with her! Away with trouble!

716
01:27:13,985 --> 01:27:18,819
Death, death, death!

717
01:29:12,868 --> 01:29:15,745
Who is it? Who's there?

718
01:29:15,898 --> 01:29:20,693
I've been expecting you.
The American girl!

719
01:29:21,154 --> 01:29:24,031
I knew you'd come.

720
01:29:24,146 --> 01:29:28,864
You wanna kill me? You wanna
kill Helena Markos?

721
01:29:42,368 --> 01:29:46,204
You wanted to kill me.
You wanted to kill me!

722
01:29:46,204 --> 01:29:50,040
What are you going to do now, huh?

723
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:56,523
Now death is coming for you!

724
01:29:58,556 --> 01:30:02,891
You wanted to kill Helena Markos!

725
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:07,917
Hell is behind that door!

726
01:30:08,377 --> 01:30:11,254
You're going to meet death now!

727
01:30:12,175 --> 01:30:14,553
The living dead!

728
01:33:29,161 --> 01:33:32,039
Witch, witch.
