1
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,471
It's last break before the climbing!

2
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:21,034
Have you forgotten anything?

3
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,362
It's too late now anyways.

4
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:29,765
Are you missing anything?

5
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,077
What?

6
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:32,087
Nothing.

7
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,229
Are you bothered by Guillaume?

8
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:37,383
Forget it

9
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:41,204
You could've told me

10
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:43,821
Why don't you take
this time to get to know him?

11
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:46,923
Got everytrhing?

12
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,050
Yeah.

13
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,379
I'm sorry

14
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,705
I had no choice
Don't worry about it

15
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:08,947
Sure?

16
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,322
It's been four years
since I've seen him.

17
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:14,544
This trip will change your mind.

18
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:16,071
It's gonna be fine, I promise.

19
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:20,958
Attention! Thanks.

20
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:23,328
We'll be arriving in 20 minutes

21
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:28,190
You'll see it's really peaceful

22
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:30,381
Along the Resnjak

23
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:31,799
There are several sections

24
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:34,735
the Stairway to Heaven
Purgatory

25
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:36,735
the Angels' Traverse

26
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,102
the Devil's Gateway.

27
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,351
And after that we arrive at

28
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,485
A ladder leading to a zip-line

29
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,896
Ok

30
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:49,628
You can ride it in 4 hours.
Then stop for drinks.

31
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:50,825
Photo?

32
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:52,387
NO!

33
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:54,017
You have no choice

34
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:55,917
NO!
Photo!

35
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:57,615
Come on, guys.

36
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:58,992
Photo!

37
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:03,666
Fred! Excuse me, thanks.

38
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,973
I'd like to be in the center

39
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:41,665
Vertigo

40
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,524
Croatia, August 18

41
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,751
Oh no, Open the window

42
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:48,101
Open it

43
00:04:48,597 --> 00:04:49,074
Give me some

44
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:51,315
Where did you get that?

45
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:53,845
At the Zagreb Station
while waiting for you

46
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:01,318
Croatia is so beautiful

47
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:10,413
Glad to see me?

48
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:12,995
I can't get the signal

49
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,234
We're leaving civilization

50
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,476
Guest what I've found?

51
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:45,135
We sang that in high school

52
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:46,653
Ok

53
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,118
Sing along
This is our song

54
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:39,597
Without hands

55
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,734
It'll be awesome

56
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:45,000
It's easy?

57
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:46,809
Anyone can do it

58
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,929
Don't worry

59
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:51,055
You're attached to
the lifeline

60
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:00,872
It reminds me of the Alps

61
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:02,381
Me, that I'm hungry

62
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:03,722
Didn't you eat lunch?

63
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,935
Wait up, Fred

64
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:21,448
Come on. Hurry up.

65
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,576
Isn't it beautiful?

66
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,315
Yeah, it's impressive

67
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:34,549
Chloe

68
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:36,951
Chloe, wait

69
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:47,587
What's with you?

70
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:49,809
Nothing. I'm happy to see you.

71
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:51,834
Can't I just tell you that or...

72
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,260
Your boyfriend look jealous

73
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,008
I'll go back to France

74
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:01,950
So?

75
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:15,678
What are you doing?

76
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:20,661
The path is closed

77
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:22,883
NO
Is there a problem

78
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,994
Apparently

79
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:28,767
We're screwed

80
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,540
Wait, maybe not

81
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,427
Fred we're not doing it
It's closed

82
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:50,220
There's not even a ladder

83
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:51,542
Who cares

84
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:53,298
Fred.

85
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,268
Come back.

86
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,266
I'll just check something

87
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:13,267
Fred, dammit!

88
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,057
It looked dangerous

89
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:27,259
It does, kids

90
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:29,887
There's a way up
I'll mark out the route

91
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:31,282
The path is there

92
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,786
Grab the rope

93
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:40,378
Got it

94
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:45,405
Fred says there's a way up

95
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:50,467
It really looks fantastic

96
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,889
If you don't want to go
we'll go back

97
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:54,785
For me it's ok

98
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:56,252
It's exciting, isn't it?

99
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:58,361
It looks completely stupid

100
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,248
At worst, we'll bring you back down

101
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:07,821
Chloe

102
00:10:08,404 --> 00:10:09,359
It's up to you

103
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:13,731
Well, here we go

104
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:20,864
Ok, Let's go

105
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:23,043
Come on

106
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,779
Shall I stay?
Get up there

107
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:38,642
Your turn

108
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:40,728
Go, go

109
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:43,271
Go ahead.

110
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:45,800
You'll see

111
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:48,351
It's good for you but
That's it!

112
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:53,766
Mademoiselle.

113
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,048
Well done Loic, Continue

114
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:06,783
You're almost there.

115
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:09,088
Super.

116
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:12,235
Use your right hand

117
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:26,836
Karine told me

118
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,765
She told you what?

119
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:30,946
About the boy in the hospital
and everything

120
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,476
I know you've done everything you could

121
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,542
You don't know anything
You weren't there

122
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,578
Hold it tight with your right hand

123
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:46,772
Go up

124
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,876
Slowly

125
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,440
Use your feet. That's it.

126
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,051
Good

127
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,473
Mademoiselle...
Fuck off!

128
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,007
You're doing okey?

129
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,370
Yeah yeah, fine, thanks

130
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,002
What about you?

131
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,562
Yeah?
uh-huh

132
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,857
Ok I'll lead

133
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,099
Karine, stay with Loic
Chloe behind them

134
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:53,222
Guillaume, you're at the end?

135
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,312
It's important you're always

136
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:59,890
attached to the lifeline.

137
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:02,681
And never more than two people
on the same section.

138
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:05,609
All Okey?
Then, let's go!

139
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:39,434
In New Zealand,

140
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:41,629
it's pretty much the same

141
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:43,217
When are you leaving?

142
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,506
Next year.

143
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:46,153
After Australia

144
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:47,388
Canada

145
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:49,872
and St. Barth
My ass in the Caribbean

146
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:51,760
And you?

147
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,152
It depends on my posting

148
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,908
Didn't you want to quit?

149
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:57,659
I don't know yet

150
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:12,029
We're almost at the bridge

151
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:27,920
Are you alright?

152
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,171
Yeah

153
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,509
You're pale

154
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,408
Loic pass me your bag

155
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,763
It gets a bit harder now
Don't worry about me

156
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:46,495
Damn

157
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:48,735
I've often heard about you

158
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,009
Ok

159
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:07,010
Here we are

160
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:10,472
If you want to turn around

161
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:12,205
it's now or never

162
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:13,972
Are you okey?

163
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:15,232
Yes, I'll come

164
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:18,738
Loic, if you've got vertigo
we'll meet you back at the car.

165
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:23,394
Well I'm going

166
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:35,102
Awesome

167
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:42,894
It's great!

168
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:09,142
You'll enjoy it

169
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:10,952
You'll see

170
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:12,327
it's a blast

171
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:18,959
Ok

172
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:50,766
One foot in front of the other

173
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:52,192
Don't look down

174
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,069
That's good, continue

175
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,779
Great
It's incredible

176
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:22,343
Isn't it awesome?
It's better than I thought!

177
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:14,278
Loic?

178
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:18,494
Loic, come to me

179
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:21,130
No!

180
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:23,051
Karine wait a minute.

181
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:33,922
Come to me

182
00:20:47,685 --> 00:20:48,561
There, come

183
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:50,889
That's good

184
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:54,393
There

185
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,776
Keep going

186
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,292
Over there?

187
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:02,074
Yes?

188
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:20,406
Come on, damnit!

189
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,110
Go! Go!

190
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:35,626
You're almost there
That's it.

191
00:21:36,315 --> 00:21:37,792
Don't touch me

192
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:39,903
I can manage on my own

193
00:21:43,572 --> 00:21:44,049
Fred

194
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:45,748
The cable

195
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:50,829
Karine!

196
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:52,850
Karine!

197
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,189
Check your rope

198
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:56,505
and keep going slowly

199
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:00,831
Don't panic

200
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:04,262
Hurry up!

201
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,794
It's not gonna hold

202
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:12,960
Keep going

203
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:14,970
Continue

204
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:21,821
Hurry!

205
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:25,089
Go!

206
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:31,911
Karine!

207
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:37,995
Hurry!

208
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:43,436
Fred!

209
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,139
Fred!

210
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:01,131
Karine!

211
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,116
Hold on

212
00:23:12,617 --> 00:23:13,845
Keep holding on

213
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:16,942
Grab this

214
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:19,047
Fred! I'm coming

215
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:24,896
Catch

216
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,167
Shit!

217
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,228
Fred

218
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:33,582
Fred!

219
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:35,972
Catch!

220
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:38,492
Hold it

221
00:23:39,642 --> 00:23:40,199
Pull

222
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:42,064
Hang on

223
00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:44,218
Pull! Pull!

224
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:50,319
Hurry!

225
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:53,913
Don't let it go

226
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:05,815
It's OK! It's OK!

227
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,715
I've got you! I've got you!

228
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,979
Now, what will we do?

229
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:44,955
I don't know

230
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:00,678
We keep going

231
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,345
We have no choice

232
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,488
We must finish the trail before nightfall

233
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:10,006
I don't understand

234
00:25:10,396 --> 00:25:12,114
can't we just go down

235
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:14,957
No, not like this
It would be climbing

236
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:16,595
And we're not equipped for that

237
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:18,430
Was that the only way out?

238
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:20,572
Yes

239
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:24,584
We're screwed because of you.
Get us out of this shithole!

240
00:25:25,202 --> 00:25:26,317
And what's your idea?

241
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,467
Nobody asked you to come!

242
00:25:28,997 --> 00:25:29,713
It's Ok

243
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:30,957
It's Ok

244
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,767
It's gonna be alright, no need
to yell at eachother.

245
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:40,868
Ok! Let's move

246
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,870
Shit!

247
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:07,823
What's wrong?

248
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,512
The lifeline snapped

249
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:13,006
What's wrong?

250
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:15,153
It's alright Loic

251
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,687
It gets easier
Shit

252
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:22,379
Loic are you okey?
Calm down

253
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:26,288
Breathe. Calm down. All is ok.

254
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:27,649
Damn

255
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:29,428
How does it look like up there?

256
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:30,936
Looks like we can make it

257
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:34,409
I'll come with you

258
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,786
Ok

259
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:37,652
Ok, Loic

260
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:41,003
Loic listen to me, you twat

261
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:42,418
What?

262
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,464
You're a coward
cow... what?

263
00:27:45,003 --> 00:27:46,277
The small slings

264
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:49,207
attach them to the anchor

265
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:52,920
I can't get it
I'll help you

266
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:55,889
There

267
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:58,394
It's done

268
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:00,859
Now you're safe

269
00:28:01,268 --> 00:28:03,020
Now attach your harness

270
00:28:03,437 --> 00:28:04,472
No, no, I can't

271
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,495
We'll pull you up. Don't move.

272
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:08,818
Ok

273
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:18,243
Loic?

274
00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:20,071
Loic okey?

275
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:22,914
Are you okey?

276
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:29,466
We'll go up and then use the tyrolean

277
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:30,797
Ok

278
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:34,274
You're tired. Try to relax

279
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,949
And above all, don't move.

280
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:45,079
Slow down, there's no pitons
If you fall...

281
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,429
I won't

282
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:47,814
Hurry

283
00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:56,022
We must go around the cliff

284
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:57,447
Let's tie the rope

285
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:07,677
Loic, Loic?

286
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,847
Remember what Fred said?
I don't care.

287
00:29:12,128 --> 00:29:13,117
You tell him

288
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,143
Listen

289
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:20,735
Loic... Loic... Loic

290
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:22,172
Loosen your grip

291
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:24,527
Loic, right there

292
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:27,651
There's nothing, There is nothing here
Loic

293
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:31,185
Look, how I'm attached
Look, look.

294
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,285
That's it, That's it

295
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,250
It's broken, there's nothing here

296
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:38,154
Hurry

297
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,936
We'll pull him up from the other side

298
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,123
Ok

299
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,838
Let's go through the forest

300
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,926
It'll be faster

301
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,817
What are they doing?

302
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,457
You see them or what?

303
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,159
Loic calm down

304
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,298
There

305
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,668
Come on! Fred!

306
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,253
I can't follow you

307
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:12,937
Come

308
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,348
Give me your hand

309
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,289
Go ahead, ok?

310
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,297
Let the rope hold you

311
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,100
Holy shit!

312
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,684
Calm down!
No

313
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,788
It's okey

314
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,485
I knew it was closed.
What?

315
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:36,952
Let go now

316
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,893
I knew the trail was closed

317
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:40,766
Let go

318
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,052
Are you crazy?

319
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,068
I thought it'd be OK

320
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,262
Loic!

321
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:50,484
I screwed up. Damn!

322
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:56,592
I'll save you

323
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:07,265
Fuck!

324
00:31:09,908 --> 00:31:11,500
Wait, Let's each pull one side

325
00:31:12,452 --> 00:31:13,328
Go on

326
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,599
I'll come get you

327
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:27,978
Fred! Fred!

328
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,600
Stop moving

329
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:47,630
Loic stop moving

330
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,901
I beg you stop

331
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,036
Go help them

332
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:57,286
Guillaume.

333
00:31:57,787 --> 00:31:58,663
Hurry

334
00:31:59,164 --> 00:31:59,880
But your leg!

335
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:01,362
Go get them

336
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:02,352
Hurry

337
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:03,463
Shit!

338
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,836
Go!

339
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,614
Go! Go!

340
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:14,493
Give me your hand!

341
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,749
Pull me up

342
00:32:20,393 --> 00:32:22,190
Help me Guillaume!

343
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:25,117
Look at me, we're not gonna fall

344
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:28,366
If you stop moving we're
not going to fall

345
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,011
Do you trust me?

346
00:32:33,614 --> 00:32:34,490
Fred!

347
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:53,352
Chloe please tell Loic to calm down

348
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:55,076
Help me Chloe

349
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:56,787
Look at me

350
00:32:57,178 --> 00:32:59,533
I can't see you
I can't

351
00:32:59,972 --> 00:33:03,089
Fred, I can't

352
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,754
Help!

353
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:14,050
Rope

354
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:15,779
Go on climb up

355
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:17,776
It's Fred

356
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:35,727
Go on, climb!

357
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:19,841
Karine?

358
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:21,885
Karine?

359
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:31,253
Chloe hurry

360
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:36,640
I'm cold

361
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:40,402
Put this on

362
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:44,637
Let's move now!

363
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:02,215
Karine?

364
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:05,509
Karine?

365
00:35:08,762 --> 00:35:09,672
Shit!

366
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:32,410
Karine?

367
00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:00,312
Fred!

368
00:36:00,812 --> 00:36:01,483
Fred?

369
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,537
Fred!

370
00:36:03,023 --> 00:36:04,138
Fred? Fred?

371
00:36:04,649 --> 00:36:05,525
Fred!

372
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:09,404
Fred!

373
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:12,976
You're sure he was here?

374
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:14,367
Yes, damn it!

375
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:19,288
There's blood.

376
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:31,509
What was that?

377
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:35,653
It was impossible to open

378
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:38,432
Fred!

379
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:40,082
Fred!

380
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:42,831
Fred! Fred!

381
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:44,271
Fred!

382
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:50,971
It will be dark soon

383
00:36:51,486 --> 00:36:52,839
Who has the flares?

384
00:36:53,363 --> 00:36:54,239
Not me

385
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,866
Oh fuck

386
00:36:57,242 --> 00:36:58,994
It's in my bag, and Fred got it

387
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,037
What the hell?
You got a problem?

388
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:05,419
Yes!

389
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,067
The trail was closed, and
there's nothing here

390
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,379
I'm sure he knew about it.

391
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,083
Okey, okey

392
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:18,914
It will be dark soon

393
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,342
We must go, Fred will find us

394
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:23,843
What if he's lost?

395
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:25,625
You just don't give a damn, do you?

396
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:28,136
We've almost died there, so
don't tell me i don't give a damn

397
00:37:28,688 --> 00:37:30,565
Since the beggining you didn't
worry about shit

398
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:32,939
Exactly! I'm here for Chloe

399
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,235
Stop!

400
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,429
We'll go find Fred, period!

401
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:46,289
Fred!

402
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:48,458
Fred!

403
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,543
Fred

404
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:53,254
Fred?

405
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,006
Fred?

406
00:37:57,883 --> 00:37:58,759
Fred?

407
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,016
Fred?

408
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:06,809
Fred?

409
00:38:18,277 --> 00:38:19,630
Fred?

410
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:24,734
Why am I even here?

411
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:26,153
Like you don't know

412
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:29,042
I warn you, when we go down

413
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,172
you'll forget about Chloe

414
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,097
Except Chloe will not forget

415
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:35,795
yeah right

416
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,843
fucking wanker
come on, go

417
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:41,551
Stop it!

418
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:43,218
Just stop

419
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,072
What's wrong?
Chloe?

420
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:47,180
Chloe!

421
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:50,506
Chloe!

422
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:52,465
Chloe answer!

423
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:54,252
Can you hear us?

424
00:39:14,915 --> 00:39:16,234
Are you okey?
Are you alright?

425
00:39:19,086 --> 00:39:20,121
Chloe, where are you?

426
00:39:28,136 --> 00:39:28,932
Karine?

427
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:31,932
Karine?

428
00:39:37,437 --> 00:39:39,314
What are you doing? Shit!

429
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:51,686
What is that?

430
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:02,169
Chloe

431
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:04,338
I see her

432
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:07,553
Is she alright?
Are you with her?

433
00:40:08,926 --> 00:40:10,200
Is she hurt?

434
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:13,514
Answer!

435
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:27,872
Tell us what's happening?

436
00:40:36,077 --> 00:40:37,146
I'm fine

437
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,538
but I can't move

438
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:44,622
Help me

439
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:46,530
You have to pull it

440
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:49,215
wait

441
00:40:50,424 --> 00:40:51,379
Karine

442
00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:53,992
Karine look at me

443
00:40:55,596 --> 00:40:56,665
Pull it out

444
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:01,977
Loic

445
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:09,151
Karine

446
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:12,737
Do it

447
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,119
Loic

448
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:21,727
Loic
Don't touch me

449
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,560
Loic... Loic...

450
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,835
Someone's out there.
Go get him.

451
00:41:33,632 --> 00:41:34,826
Karine, hurry

452
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:40,134
Do it

453
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:44,028
Do it!

454
00:42:04,495 --> 00:42:05,371
Karine

455
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:08,305
We'll find Fred, and go home

456
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:09,864
Don't worry

457
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:12,260
There were stakes everywhere.

458
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:17,488
It was... a poacher's trap

459
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:22,751
I don't get it

460
00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:24,492
They hunt anything here?

461
00:42:25,015 --> 00:42:25,811
Hunt what?

462
00:43:17,107 --> 00:43:18,381
Karine what can you do?

463
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:21,399
Karine, what do we do?

464
00:43:22,362 --> 00:43:25,081
We must find help. Karine!

465
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,800
NO... no...

466
00:43:38,503 --> 00:43:39,458
Look at me

467
00:43:40,129 --> 00:43:42,404
Karine look at me

468
00:43:43,548 --> 00:43:45,903
You can't give up, you hear me

469
00:43:46,468 --> 00:43:48,106
Come on

470
00:43:48,637 --> 00:43:49,513
Look at me

471
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:52,648
Look at me, look at me

472
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:55,288
Look, everything will be ok

473
00:43:55,978 --> 00:43:56,854
Look

474
00:43:58,396 --> 00:43:59,272
We'll sing

475
00:44:01,149 --> 00:44:02,423
We are young

476
00:44:05,695 --> 00:44:06,844
We are young

477
00:44:07,697 --> 00:44:09,210
We run green

478
00:44:10,116 --> 00:44:11,390
Keep our teeth

479
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:13,584
Nice and clean

480
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:15,644
See our friends

481
00:44:16,163 --> 00:44:17,437
See the sights

482
00:44:17,832 --> 00:44:19,868
Feel alright

483
00:44:22,086 --> 00:44:23,485
OK? OK?

484
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:32,866
We'll tie ourselves, and
go along the forest

485
00:44:33,472 --> 00:44:35,349
Ok
Ok we'll do that

486
00:44:36,183 --> 00:44:37,059
Ok?

487
00:44:37,935 --> 00:44:39,607
I'll tie the rope
you go ahead

488
00:44:40,854 --> 00:44:42,845
keep the rope stretched

489
00:44:43,273 --> 00:44:44,786
We go together

490
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,175
Be careful where you stand

491
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:25,731
Fred?

492
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:33,780
- Fred?

493
00:45:35,823 --> 00:45:36,699
Fred?

494
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:44,165
Fred?

495
00:45:57,303 --> 00:45:58,179
Fred?

496
00:45:59,846 --> 00:46:00,722
Fred!

497
00:46:02,308 --> 00:46:03,184
Fred?

498
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:05,435
Fred?

499
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:10,129
Fred? Fred!

500
00:46:13,151 --> 00:46:14,106
Fred?

501
00:46:16,363 --> 00:46:17,318
Fred?

502
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:31,627
Fred?

503
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:40,719
Fred?

504
00:46:53,565 --> 00:46:54,441
Karine?

505
00:46:57,027 --> 00:46:57,903
Karine!

506
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:00,530
What is it?

507
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,224
Karine! Karine!

508
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,769
Karine! Karine!

509
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:09,928
Karine! Karine!

510
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,393
Guillaume, hurry!
Chloe!

511
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,440
No! Karine!

512
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:20,633
Karine...

513
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:23,605
Karine

514
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,373
Loïc!

515
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:30,726
Guillaume!

516
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:11,473
Karine!

517
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,667
Karine!

518
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,278
Karine?

519
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:10,734
Karine?

520
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:15,640
Karine! Karine!
Chloe!

521
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:17,563
Stay there, stay there.

522
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:19,944
Karine!
Don't go there.

523
00:49:20,498 --> 00:49:21,294
Stop!

524
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:22,462
Karine!

525
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:23,834
Answer me!

526
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:37,013
Karine...

527
00:49:40,017 --> 00:49:42,053
Don't stay here, Come!

528
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:43,645
Come on!

529
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,817
No! Karine! No.

530
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,027
Come come

531
00:50:14,424 --> 00:50:16,096
Shouldn't we do something?

532
00:50:17,052 --> 00:50:18,770
She'll eventually die of cold.

533
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:22,869
We must find the zip line

534
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:25,602
Here we go.

535
00:50:26,394 --> 00:50:27,429
Chloe come on

536
00:50:28,312 --> 00:50:29,427
Come
Let's go

537
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:45,621
Wait

538
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:47,812
What's that?

539
00:50:48,207 --> 00:50:49,083
It's nothing

540
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,900
Watch your steps there

541
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:54,725
No choice
Have you seen how's Chloe!

542
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,871
We made a mistake coming up here

543
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:01,595
Let's go

544
00:51:15,316 --> 00:51:16,715
Looks like someone is there

545
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:17,986
hush

546
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:05,031
Fred!

547
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,051
We need to bandage his wounds

548
00:52:07,783 --> 00:52:08,659
Fred!

549
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,173
Breathe.
Stay with me.

550
00:52:11,745 --> 00:52:12,939
Fred! Fred!

551
00:52:13,456 --> 00:52:15,333
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

552
00:52:18,127 --> 00:52:19,196
Fred, look at me.

553
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,049
We can't stay here

554
00:53:30,112 --> 00:53:31,261
We need to get away

555
00:53:31,948 --> 00:53:35,099
Not without the flares.
We must return to get the backpack

556
00:53:35,576 --> 00:53:37,248
Fuck!
I'm not going back in there.

557
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:41,540
I'll go

558
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:28,491
Anton

559
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:02,442
Hurry up

560
00:57:09,448 --> 00:57:10,563
What are you doing?

561
00:57:14,328 --> 00:57:15,522
He's alone

562
00:57:16,037 --> 00:57:16,514
Who?

563
00:57:17,497 --> 00:57:20,250
The poacher. He sleeps in a cage.

564
00:57:21,751 --> 00:57:22,706
There are heads

565
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:24,610
There are bodies everywhere

566
00:57:27,173 --> 00:57:28,083
You got the flares?

567
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:29,786
Inside
Give me that

568
00:57:30,301 --> 00:57:30,938
I'll carry it.

569
00:57:31,427 --> 00:57:32,177
Give it to me!

570
00:57:44,773 --> 00:57:45,649
Come on Chloe

571
00:57:46,025 --> 00:57:47,538
Huh?
Too bad for him.

572
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:48,820
What have you done?

573
00:57:49,194 --> 00:57:51,071
He's fucked in this shit
You're sick!

574
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,996
- Chloe?

575
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:30,804
Chloe? Chloe?

576
00:59:31,209 --> 00:59:32,722
Look at me, Chloe?

577
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,756
Chloe?

578
00:59:37,424 --> 00:59:38,300
Chloe?

579
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,437
Wake up

580
00:59:39,926 --> 00:59:40,995
Look at me

581
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,263
We'll get out of here

582
00:59:43,805 --> 00:59:45,875
Agree Ok?
Try to free yourself

583
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:52,783
I'm almost out

584
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:55,415
Go on

585
01:02:01,687 --> 01:02:02,563
Pull!

586
01:02:21,707 --> 01:02:23,663
No... No... No...

587
01:02:43,978 --> 01:02:44,774
NO!

588
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:04,070
Don't touch her!

589
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:07,300
Don't touch her! Stop!

590
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,803
Stop! Let her go!

591

01:05:50,074 --> 01:05:51,348
Anton.
His name is Anton!

609
01:05:51,866 --> 01:05:53,094
Chloe talk to him

Come let me out Chloe

611
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,447
Did he hurt you?
Did he hurt you?

612
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:53,198
We have to find a weapon

613
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:04,034
