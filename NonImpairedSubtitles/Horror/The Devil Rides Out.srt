1
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:01,001
- Hello, Nicholas.
- Hello, Rex. How are you?

2
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:03,084
Fine. Fine.

3
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:09,084
Where's Simon?

4
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:13,209
When did you last see him?

5
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,709
- Three months ago.
- Three months?

6
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:18,917
- Do you think he's in trouble?
- Wouldn't he have told me?

7
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:20,626
Perhaps he told Richard
or Marie.

8
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:23,334
They haven't seen him
since Christmas.

9
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,501
Something MUST be wrong.
Let's go to his club.

10
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:29,542
He isn't there, Rex. He bought
a house, a large one.

11
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,792
- What on earth for?
- Exactly.

12
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,126
Do you know where it is?

13
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,126
Mr Simon Aron's house.

14
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:43,292
(Doorbell)

15
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:52,042
Mr Aron?

16
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:59,459
(Hum of conversation)

17
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,667
Good Lord.

18
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,667
- Nicholas!
- Simon.

19
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,626
- Rex!
- Hello, Simon.

20
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:41,751
What a wonderful surprise.

21
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:44,501
We apologise for
breaking in on your party.

22
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:48,292
Oh, it isn't a party.
It's just a meeting of a little...

23
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,084
astronomical society
I've joined.

24
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,251
Really?

25
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:58,334
Well, let me introduce you
to the members.

26
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:03,251
Countess, may I introduce
my friends?

27
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:06,709
The Duc de Richleau.

28
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:09,167
<i>- Madame.
- Enchantée.</i>

29
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,001
(Simon) And Rex Van Ryn.
Countess D'Urfey.

30
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:15,126
- Madame.
- Monsieur.

31
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,626
Tanith? Mr Mocata?

32
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:25,667
I'd like to introduce you
to my friends.

33
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,667
The Duc de Richleau.

34
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,501
Mr Van Ryn, Miss Carlisle.
Mr Mocata.

35
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:34,417
(Mocata) It's a pleasure
to meet Simon's friends.

36
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,917
- Mademoiselle.
- Monsieur.

37
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,417
- Mr Van Ryn.
- We have met before.

38
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:43,001
Have we? I don't remember.

39
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:45,584
You joined an astronomical
society, Simon?

40
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:47,501
We were pleased
to welcome him.

41
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:52,792
Yes. It explains why I haven't
seen you for a few months.

42
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:57,001
And why you appear to have
forgotten our reunion tonight.

43
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:59,792
- Well, I was...
- Would you excuse me?

44
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:03,084
There's something
I must say to Simon.

45
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,376
- You're friends of Simon's?
- Yes, indeed, mademoiselle.

46
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,501
His father, Rex and I
were companions

47
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:13,084
in the Escadrille Lafayette.

48
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:17,084
Then when he died, you vowed
to keep an eye on Simon?

49
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,417
Yes.

50
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,876
When did you join this group?

51
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,667
We were never told that...

52
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:32,584
I don't understand. We're not
meant to be more than 13.

53
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,917
- We're not members.
- What?

54
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,667
We just stopped by
to see Simon...

55
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,751
Excuse me.

56
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:50,334
What's going on now?

57
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,876
We're going to be asked
to leave.

58
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:57,709
Move among the guests
and listen to what they say.

59
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,792
(Simon) Rex, old friend.

60
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:02,751
I hate to say it,
but I have to throw you out.

61
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,792
The meeting's due to start.

62
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,834
But we must learn
to control them.

63
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,376
Control?
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

64
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,501
An organisation...

65
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,709
Shall we have a good meeting?

66
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:18,834
If the weather improves,
we shall learn much.

67
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,876
His natal conjunction
will help immeasurably...

68
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,084
Two years ago in Berlin,

69
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,834
I experienced exactly
similar conditions.

70
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,001
That is most interesting...

71
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:32,126
Mars in conjunction
with Saturn, of course.

72
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,417
You mustn't call him Abraham

73
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:37,209
- until Deed Poll is executed.
- Why is that?

74
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:40,751
There's got to be
an initiation ceremony first...

75
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:45,376
This looks like a splendid wine,
Simon.

76
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,751
You always had excellent taste.

77
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:52,001
I feel dreadfully embarrassed.
I'd love to have you stay.

78
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,751
It's not an ordinary meeting,
you see,

79
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:57,626
and you and Rex
not being members...

80
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:01,417
Don't worry, my dear chap.
We understand perfectly.

81
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,709
- Don't we, Rex?
- Of course.

82
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:12,751
I feel terrible about
missing our reunion.

83
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:15,876
We must get together soon.
Perhaps tomorrow?

84
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:18,626
Simon, I see you've got
an observatory.

85
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:20,834
I'm very interested
in astronomy.

86
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,417
I'd like to look through
your telescope.

87
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,542
I'll only be five minutes.

88
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:45,126
What do you want to look
at his blasted telescope for?

89
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:47,126
I don't.

90
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:08,501
Simon, those charts.

91
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,126
They're not astronomical,
are they?

92
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,709
Good Lord, no.
They're just for decoration.

93
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,959
Relics, Middle-Ages nonsense,
you know.

94
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:22,126
It's clever of you to extend
the decorative scheme to the floor.

95
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,209
Yes.

96
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,292
(Scraping)

97
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,334
If you'd like to see the...

98
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,501
(Scraping continues)

99
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,209
Sounds like mice.

100
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,626
You have to go now.

101
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,626
(Rex) What in the name of...?

102
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,626
You fool!
I'd rather see you dead

103
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:00,292
than meddling
with black magic!

104
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,292
Let go of me.

105
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:12,584
I didn't ask you
to come here tonight.

106
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,959
Even my oldest friends
have no right

107
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:17,126
to butt in on my private affairs.

108
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:20,501
- Will someone please...?
- I'm sorry, Simon.

109
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,501
I feel like a father

110
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:25,584
who sees his child picking
live coals out of a fire.

111
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,084
Will someone tell me
what's going on?

112
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,709
Chickens in a basket,
diagrams on a floor.

113
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:33,501
Do these mean something
to you?

114
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:35,667
It means that Simon is playing

115
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:38,501
the most dangerous game
known to mankind.

116
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:42,209
- Oh, come on, Nicholas.
- You're making too much of it.

117
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:43,709
You've no objection if we stay?

118
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,876
You aren't members
of the circle.

119
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:49,167
- Circle?
- Society.

120
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:54,167
If we stayed, there'd be more
than 13, wouldn't there?

121
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:58,501
Simon, you will admit that,
whilst Rex and I have been

122
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,959
your closest friends
for ten years,

123
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:05,167
we have never stressed our
age or our greater experience.

124
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,792
Tonight, I'm going
to break that rule.

125
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,834
I'm considerably older
than you are, Simon,

126
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,042
and I've made a deep study
of these esoteric doctrines.

127
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,001
I beg of you,

128
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:22,876
as I've never begged anything
in my life before,

129
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:25,751
give up this dangerous
adventure

130
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:29,417
and leave this house
with us immediately.

131
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:32,709
- I can't.
- Then, let us stay.

132
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:34,917
Impossible.

133
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:15,542
(Car pulls away)

134
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:21,292
Put him down there, Rex.

135
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:28,667
Thank you, Max.
Can you wait outside?

136
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,001
I wonder what
he's going to say.

137
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:38,167
Nothing. I'm bringing him round
to put him to sleep again.

138
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,459
Makes as much sense
as anything else tonight.

139
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:52,126
Tilt the lampshade
towards me, Rex.

140
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:00,751
Look into the mirror, Simon.

141
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,667
Look into the mirror.

142
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:09,001
Keep looking

143
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:11,126
and listen to me.

144
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:17,126
You have been hurt
and your mind is troubled.

145
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:19,792
But you are with your friends now,

146
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,584
and there is nothing more
to worry about.

147
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,042
I'm going to send you to sleep,
Simon.

148
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:31,709
Your eyes will close
as soon as I touch them.

149
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:45,751
You will wake up at
ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

150
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:49,334
Your mind will be free
from all pain

151
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:51,626
and from all anxiety.

152
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,417
Open your eyes, Simon.

153
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:19,084
Stand up.

154
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:28,084
I'm going to place this symbol
of protection round your neck.

155
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,042
Once it is there,
you will not remove it.

156
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,084
You will go directly
to my bedroom,

157
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,459
where you will lie down
and fall into an immediate sleep.

158
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:48,917
Max?

159
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:51,292
Show Mr Aron to my room.

160
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,084
- Thank God that's over.
- I might agree with you,

161
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:08,459
if I knew what
you were talking about.

162
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:15,459
We can certainly make
good use of these.

163
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,667
To our reunion, Rex.

164
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,959
- No questions?
- Hocus-pocus.

165
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:25,167
Mumbo-jumbo. Black magic?

166
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,542
Rex, do you believe in evil?

167
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,501
As an idea.

168
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:33,167
Do you believe
in the power of darkness?

169
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:36,584
- As a superstition.
- Now, there you are wrong.

170
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:40,626
The power of darkness
is more than a superstition.

171
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,834
It is a living force

172
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,626
which can be tapped
at any given moment of the night.

173
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:36,126
(Choking)

174
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,667
These people
are Devil worshippers.

175
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,167
That's ridiculous.

176
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:55,501
These are facts, Rex,
not superstition.

177
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:57,709
The proof was in the hamper.

178
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:01,126
They were about to practise
the sacrifice to their master -

179
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,667
the slaughter of a black
cockerel and a white hen.

180
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:04,834
(Knocking)

181
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,042
Yes?

182
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:11,876
I thought I'd better
bring this to you, Excellency.

183
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:14,667
- My God!
- He's all right now, sir.

184
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,084
- Did you remove this, Max?
- Yes, sir.

185
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,626
- Why?
- It was choking him to death.

186
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:34,584
He rang for me. His face was
black, his tongue protruding.

187
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,834
- I should have known.
- I'm sorry, sir...

188
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,667
It's not your fault.

189
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,834
We can only hope
that he's gone to his house.

190
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:28,334
Shall I look upstairs
while you try down here?

191
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:31,792
- It's better we stay together.
- Rubbish.

192
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:35,792
Don't worry. I'll scream
if I so much as smell anything.

193
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,001
All right.

194
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:17,251
(Clock chimes)

195
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:40,376
Well?

196
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:43,001
Not a sign. You?

197
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:45,126
He's not here.

198
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,709
Unless...

199
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,834
(REX) Up there.

200
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:53,667
It's possible.

201
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:20,626
Is it getting colder
or is it my imagination?

202
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:21,917
No.

203
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:25,417
It isn't your imagination.

204
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,584
At least we saved your lives.

205
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:21,626
(Shuts hamper)

206
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:25,084
But no Simon.

207
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,501
No. It might help us locate him

208
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:30,667
if we knew the real names
of those people tonight.

209
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,126
- Real names?
- Yes.

210
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:38,001
In order to become a follower
of the so-called Left Hand Path,

211
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:41,001
one has to be rebaptised
in the cause

212
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:45,084
and take the name of some
past notable of the occult.

213
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:48,334
That girl, for instance -
Miss Carlisle.

214
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,834
- I have seen her before.
- You have? Where?

215
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,709
Biarritz, at the casino.

216
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,834
She was with that old woman,
the cigar-smoker.

217
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,917
Simon called her Tanith.

218
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,334
So?

219
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:05,167
Tanith is the name of the Moon
Goddess of the Carthaginians.

220
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:08,001
You mean
she's been rebaptised?

221
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,417
Probably.

222
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:12,292
Let's see what we can find,

223
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:14,626
and get out of here.

224
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,751
What is it?

225
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:44,126
Fantastic!

226
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:49,251
- The Clavicule Of Solomon.
- Valuable?

227
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:53,001
Invaluable.

228
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,251
What's it made of, cork?

229
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,251
(Shivering) It's cold.

230
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:29,126
My God!

231
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:38,126
Don't look at the eyes, Rex.

232
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:50,084
Don't look at the eyes.

233
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:57,626
Don't pull away!

234
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,834
Try to hold back.

235
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:17,917
Fundamenta ejus
in montibus sanctis.

236
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:24,751
Run!

237
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,209
Oh, I take back
everything I said.

238
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:35,334
I've never been so scared
in all my life.

239
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:38,501
- I'm sorry, Rex.
- Sorry? For saving my life?

240
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:41,126
I should never have
allowed you in that place.

241
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:44,709
Forget it. We're out.
That's all that matters.

242
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:48,292
- Wasn't very pleasant, was it?
- Pleasant?

243
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:51,001
What in God's name was that?

244
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:52,792
Some infernal spirit

245
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,709
given entry into the world
by Mocata's powers.

246
00:24:55,834 --> 00:25:00,542
Mocata is one of the great adepts,
even an lpsissimus.

247
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,501
- A what?
- An lpsissimus.

248
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:06,834
A master of the highest grade.
Simon is in his hands.

249
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:10,084
He's about to be baptised
into the service of evil.

250
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,917
- When does it take place?
- Baptism must take place

251
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:17,126
on a true Sabbat, with at least
one coven of 13 believers.

252
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:21,709
I can't believe they would dare
hold another meeting, unless...

253
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:25,501
What is it, Nicholas?

254
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:28,376
Do you realise
what today's date is, Rex?

255
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:31,626
April the, er...29th. Why?

256
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:34,959
Mocata isn't going to miss
the chance of giving Simon

257
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:37,626
his Devil's baptism at
the grand Sabbat of the year.

258
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:40,542
- What are you talking about?
- Tomorrow night.

259
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,417
The eve of May Day.

260
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,584
In 24 hours, Simon could
be lost to us for ever.

261
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:49,292
- What can we do?
- We find the girl.

262
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:52,459
Thank you. Goodbye.

263
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,876
It's all right, Rex.

264
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,751
- I found her.
- Where?

265
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:23,167
In a London hotel,
the London Plaza.

266
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,751
I never knew there were
so many hotels in London.

267
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:29,126
- It was the 28th one I tried.
- You should have woken me.

268
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:31,334
Just as well you slept.

269
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:35,417
You need to be more alert today
than any day of your life.

270
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:38,501
- Let's go, then.
- You'll have to go alone, Rex.

271
00:26:38,626 --> 00:26:41,167
It's vital I go
to the British Museum

272
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:44,334
to examine certain
occult volumes.

273
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,542
The curator's a friend of mine.

274
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,751
Do you want me
to bring Tanith here?

275
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:49,959
No.

276
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:53,584
I want you to keep her as far away
from London as possible.

277
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:56,542
Well, what if I take her
to Richard's house?

278
00:26:56,667 --> 00:27:00,959
Yes. Perfect. I'll telephone to say
you're on your way down.

279
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:03,167
I'll see you there about three.

280
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:05,376
It should give you
plenty of time.

281
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,751
We'll be there. Oh...

282
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,751
- May I borrow a car?
- Yes. Take any of them.

283
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:11,917
Thanks.

284
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:21,959
What do you have
to say to me?

285
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:25,084
I haven't much time
before we leave.

286
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,542
- "We"?
- The Countess and I.

287
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:30,834
- We're travelling together.
- To the...Sabbat?

288
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:38,584
Of course. Couldn't you
have spoken to me there?

289
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,417
In front of Mr Mocata?

290
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:46,209
I'm hoping that
whatever you have to say

291
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:48,834
has nothing to do
with my loyalty to him.

292
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,209
- It doesn't.
- What is it, then?

293
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:53,501
Well, it's just...

294
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:55,917
I just wanted
to take you to lunch.

295
00:27:56,876 --> 00:28:00,334
- If you're free, that is.
- Take me to lunch?

296
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:03,334
Does that sound
such a bad idea?

297
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:06,876
Mr Van Ryn,
you know that neither of us

298
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:09,626
is free to give our lives
to such things.

299
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:12,542
Why not let me
be the judge of that?

300
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:15,667
I think you'd better
drive me back.

301
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,084
Mr Van Ryn?

302
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,751
(Tyres screech)

303
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,001
Don't ever do that again.

304
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:41,542
What has Mocata done
to make you so afraid of him?

305
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,834
It's what he'll do.

306
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,959
Oh, God!

307
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:50,292
It's what he'll do!

308
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:57,751
- Where are you taking me?
- To see de Richleau.

309
00:28:57,876 --> 00:29:00,834
Look, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

310
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:05,126
You know better than that.
If I'm not at the Sabbat...

311
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:09,584
- Is that so important to you?
- My satanic baptism?

312
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:14,334
You haven't been rebaptised yet?
But your name, Tanith?

313
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:17,501
- I was named that at birth.
- Then you have a chance.

314
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:19,376
Chance?

315
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:24,376
De Richleau can help you.
Believe me, Tanith. He can.

316
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:26,626
I've known him for many years.

317
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:29,584
If there's anyone
you can trust, it's him...

318
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,667
(Van Ryn's voice fades away)

319
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:34,501
(Mocata) 'Tanith?

320
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:39,084
'Look at me, Tanith.
In the mirror.

321
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:43,667
'Listen carefully to what I say.'

322
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:49,001
...nothing to worry about,

323
00:29:49,126 --> 00:29:51,834
once we get to Richard
and Marie in the country.

324
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:55,626
- In the country?
- Yes. Where we're going.

325
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,792
Haven't you been listening?

326
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:03,042
Yes. I've been listening.

327
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:16,917
(Man hums idly)

328
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:24,126
Peggy! Run and wash
your hands, will you?

329
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:27,167
Oh, Mummy! Must I?

330
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,626
Oh, Peggy! Yes, you must.

331
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:32,126
Uncle Rex will be here
in a minute.

332
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:35,001
Won't he have to wash
his hands?

333
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,001
Yes, I expect so.

334
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,876
Why can't I wait till Uncle Rex
comes, then go and wash?

335
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,167
- Then I won't be late.
- Off!

336
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:46,751
- And take that hat off.
- It's to protect my head.

337
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:50,084
We're having a picnic luncheon,
not a gymkhana.

338
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:52,709
If I fall over
and split my head open...

339
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,626
It's my fault and I'll be
very sorry. Now, hurry.

340
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,626
She'll go like a bird now.

341
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:59,167
(Horn honks)

342
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:01,834
This must be Rex
and his mysterious woman.

343
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:05,417
- There's a car coming!
- Probably be Uncle Rex.

344
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:08,292
- Uncle Rex!
- (Marie) Careful!

345
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,542
Uncle Rex!

346
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:25,001
- Uncle Rex!
- Hello, Peggy.

347
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:26,792
Marie.

348
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:28,334
Richard.

349
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,709
(Engine revs)

350
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:40,334
I must take your car.
Simon's life depends on it.

351
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:55,542
He didn't stay long, did he?

352
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:03,334
(Mocata) 'Do not be afraid.
I'm still with you.

353
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:06,084
'He will never catch you.

354
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:52,959
'Listen, Tanith.

355
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:55,417
'Listen and obey.'

356
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:10,251
(Brakes screech)

357
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:16,626
(Crash)

358
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:00,084
(Car approaches)

359
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:58,626
(Panting)

360
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:21,542
(Mocata) Eko, eko, Adonai.

361
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:25,334
(Followers) Eko, eko, Adonai.

362
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:27,209
Eko, Babalon.

363
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:29,334
(Followers) Eko, Babalon.

364
00:38:29,459 --> 00:38:31,751
(Mocata) Eko, Osiris.

365
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,209
(Followers) Eko, Osiris.

366
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,876
(Gasping)

367
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:02,417
(Phone rings)

368
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,584
Hello?

369
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:07,417
Rex? What?

370
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:11,084
It's started. I couldn't phone earlier.
I'd have lost them.

371
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,292
Where are you?

372
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:17,292
Crossroads.

373
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,001
Yes? Yes?

374
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,917
Yes, I've got that. Listen.

375
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:29,626
You're not to do anything until
I get there, anything at all.

376
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,126
Right.

377
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:48,126
Three turns to the left,
then one to the right.

378
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:51,376
- It has a very rough surface.
- Well done, Rex.

379
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:53,751
- Take these.
- What are they?

380
00:40:53,876 --> 00:40:56,209
The results of my research
at the British Museum.

381
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:58,959
- Put one in each pocket.
- May I ask what they are?

382
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:03,001
Salt and mercury.
They will protect you and Simon.

383
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:05,376
- If we can save him.
- And you?

384
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:07,501
I have other protection.

385
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:09,751
(Frenetic music)

386
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:11,459
(Laughter)

387
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:33,417
(Distant music and laughter)

388
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:13,542
There.

389
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:21,501
We must get them out of here.

390
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:24,084
- Them?
- Tanith, too.

391
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,376
Tanith is her real name.

392
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:30,959
- This is her baptism as well.
- We'll do what we can.

393
00:43:01,126 --> 00:43:02,209
Baphomet!

394
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,501
(Music stops)

395
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:07,917
(Followers chant)
Baphomet! Baphomet!

396
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:11,459
Baphomet! Baphomet!
Baphomet!

397
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,251
My God!

398
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:39,459
The Goat of Mendes.

399
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:43,126
The Devil himself.

400
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:05,876
- Let go!
- It's not your life you're risking.

401
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:08,292
It's your very soul! Oh, God!

402
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:10,709
If only there was some light!

403
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:15,417
That's it. That's it!

404
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:21,834
I'll drive.
You get on the running board.

405
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,459
Kneel and face your master.

406
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:35,959
Throw that in the face
of that damned monstrosity.

407
00:44:36,084 --> 00:44:38,626
- Right.
- God help us, then.

408
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:45,167
Whoso dwelleth under
the defence of the most high

409
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:47,417
shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

410
00:45:10,126 --> 00:45:12,167
Come on, Simon.

411
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,334
(Clamour of voices)

412
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:08,834
(Doorbell)

413
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:17,626
Hell of a way to turn up
on their doorstep,

414
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:21,126
after not having seen them
since Christmas.

415
00:46:25,042 --> 00:46:26,501
Good morning, Your Grace.

416
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:30,709
Good morning, Malin. Are my niece
and her husband up yet?

417
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:33,042
Yes, sir. Won't you come in?

418
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,501
Rex and Uncle Nicholas!

419
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:40,417
What's the matter?
You all look so ghastly.

420
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:44,626
I'll explain, but first,
rooms for Miss Carlisle and Simon.

421
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:47,167
They're both badly
in need of sleep.

422
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:49,709
- Yes, of course.
- No, I mustn't.

423
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:51,917
Do as I say, my dear.

424
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,334
Everything's going to be all right.

425
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:56,959
- Marie.
- Yes. This way.

426
00:46:57,084 --> 00:47:00,001
- Simon.
- I want to hear what you say.

427
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:03,417
And to make my apologies
to you all.

428
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,084
Very well.

429
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:09,626
Rex, you stay with Tanith.

430
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:14,126
And if anything happens,
you call me immediately.

431
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:23,001
You could do with
some sleep yourself.

432
00:47:23,126 --> 00:47:25,876
He could.
He's been up all night.

433
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:30,709
I'll take a nap later,
but now, we must talk.

434
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:33,876
- Bring us some coffee, Malin.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,584
There.

436
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:43,126
I'll go before it's night again.

437
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:45,792
You stay as long as you like.

438
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:49,209
No, no. I'll go before it's night.

439
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:53,459
You try and get
some sleep now.

440
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:59,751
Oh, Rex. What's this all about?

441
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:02,417
Well...

442
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:06,459
Your uncle will explain.

443
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:10,126
I wouldn't know where to start.

444
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:32,292
Go to sleep. I'll be here.

445
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,501
Promise me.

446
00:48:34,626 --> 00:48:36,209
Promise.

447
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:40,667
I don't want to harm any of you.

448
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:48,001
No.

449
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:57,001
Why couldn't we have met
some other way?

450
00:48:57,126 --> 00:49:00,001
- The way doesn't matter.
- It does.

451
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:01,959
It does.

452
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:09,501
Does your friend possess
any powers to resist Mr Mocata?

453
00:49:09,626 --> 00:49:12,626
We got you out of that bedlam
last night, didn't we?

454
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:17,126
You've got nothing
to worry about.

455
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,417
I have everything
to worry about.

456
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:24,126
You're quite serious
about all this?

457
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:26,501
Deadly serious.

458
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:29,959
It's all true, Richard. All of it.

459
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:32,626
God knows I wish it wasn't.

460
00:49:33,876 --> 00:49:38,334
- None of us may eat today?
- Fruit. A biscuit or two.

461
00:49:38,459 --> 00:49:41,334
- Some water.
- And no alcohol?

462
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:44,501
- I'm sorry.
- That is, if we're to stay.

463
00:49:44,626 --> 00:49:48,334
- Of course you're staying.
- But the danger?

464
00:49:48,459 --> 00:49:51,292
You think we'd let you
face it alone?

465
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:54,751
You mean you believe all this?

466
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:56,834
Well, I'm damned.

467
00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:00,501
You will find a talk with Rex
most valuable, Richard.

468
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:04,001
His scepticism was fully
the equal of yours.

469
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,167
- Now he believes?
- Ask him.

470
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:08,209
How can we help?

471
00:50:08,334 --> 00:50:11,126
You're already helping, my dear.

472
00:50:11,251 --> 00:50:13,501
Simon's resistance
is practically nil.

473
00:50:13,626 --> 00:50:16,542
He's been under the influence
of Mocata for so long.

474
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:18,501
The same applies to Miss Carlisle.

475
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:22,792
Rex and I are at a very low ebb
after last night.

476
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:27,501
Your coming fresh to the battle
is of paramount importance.

477
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:33,084
I've got to leave you all
for a short while.

478
00:50:33,209 --> 00:50:35,167
I'll be back before nightfall.

479
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:38,626
Richard, I want you to sit
with Simon while he sleeps.

480
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:43,542
You are not to allow him to get up,
under any circumstances.

481
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:45,792
Once he gets his head down...

482
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,126
Under any circumstances.

483
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:51,376
All right.

484
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:54,834
He is not to be left alone
for an instant.

485
00:50:54,959 --> 00:50:58,292
You understand?
Not for an instant.

486
00:51:40,709 --> 00:51:41,959
(Doorbell)

487
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:55,001
Good morning. I would like
to see Mrs Eaton, please.

488
00:51:55,126 --> 00:51:58,459
- Here's my card.
- Please wait here, sir.

489
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:05,001
There's a gentleman
to see you, madam. Mr Mocata.

490
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,167
Well, you'd better call Mr...

491
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:16,292
No. Wait a minute.
I'll see him in the library.

492
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:19,167
And Malin, if I ring, come at once.

493
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:21,167
You understand? Immediately.

494
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:23,334
Yes, madam.

495
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:27,751
Will you come this way, sir?
Thank you.

496
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:38,334
Please forgive me for calling
without an introduction.

497
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:41,501
I'm here on an errand of goodwill.

498
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:42,959
Goodwill?

499
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:45,834
I'm returning the property
of a friend of yours,

500
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:48,376
the Duc de Richleau -
his motorcar.

501
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:51,876
- Oh. Thank you.
- May I introduce myself?

502
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:54,376
Mocata.
Perhaps you've heard my name?

503
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:56,501
I've heard a great deal about you.

504
00:52:56,626 --> 00:53:00,876
Oh. I thought
that might be the case.

505
00:53:01,001 --> 00:53:05,167
Whether the facts have been
correctly represented to you

506
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:07,334
is something else again.

507
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:11,126
May I, er...?

508
00:53:11,251 --> 00:53:14,001
Very well, but please be brief.

509
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:15,417
Of course.

510
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:19,834
I shan't intrude a moment longer
than is necessary.

511
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:29,626
Well, now,
as you probably know,

512
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:33,709
Miss Tanith and Simon
are very close friends of mine.

513
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:35,501
- Indeed?
- Yes.

514
00:53:35,626 --> 00:53:37,792
I believe they're here now.

515
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:40,001
Is that correct?

516
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:42,501
How did you know that,
Mr Mocata?

517
00:53:42,626 --> 00:53:44,709
They arrived a short while ago.

518
00:53:44,834 --> 00:53:47,209
(Chuckling) That is neither
here nor there.

519
00:53:47,334 --> 00:53:51,501
The point is,
there are certain matters,

520
00:53:51,626 --> 00:53:55,959
of which you are unaware,
which make it imperative

521
00:53:56,084 --> 00:53:59,084
that I take them back
to London immediately.

522
00:53:59,209 --> 00:54:01,292
I'm afraid that's impossible.

523
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:03,792
I feared you would
take that attitude.

524
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:06,542
The Duc de Richleau
has filled your mind

525
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:09,376
with preposterous nonsense
about me.

526
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:11,334
I know that what he said is true.

527
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:15,959
Tanith and Simon could be
in considerable...danger

528
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:18,584
if they do not
leave this house.

529
00:54:18,709 --> 00:54:22,084
On the contrary.
They will be safe nowhere else.

530
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:25,417
Mrs Eaton, it's obvious
that you distrust me.

531
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,626
After what your friends have
told you, I'm not surprised.

532
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:32,709
However, your obvious intelligence

533
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:37,126
emboldens me to think that
I will serve my purpose best

534
00:54:37,251 --> 00:54:42,501
by, er...putting my cards
on the table, as it were.

535
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:44,709
- There is no more to be said.
- Please?

536
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:47,626
Hear me out.

537
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:52,292
Dear lady.

538
00:54:57,709 --> 00:55:02,001
I do not propose to discuss
with you the rights and wrongs

539
00:55:02,126 --> 00:55:05,126
of practising the Magic Art.

540
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:07,334
I will confine myself to saying

541
00:55:07,459 --> 00:55:10,167
that I am a practitioner
of some experience.

542
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:14,126
Monsieur de Richleau has,
no doubt, led you to believe

543
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:16,334
that I am thoroughly evil.

544
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:18,126
Such is not the case.

545
00:55:18,251 --> 00:55:21,167
In magic,
there is neither good nor evil.

546
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:23,334
It is merely a science,

547
00:55:23,459 --> 00:55:25,917
the science of causing...

548
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:29,209
change to occur
by means of one's will.

549
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:32,542
The sinister reputation
attaching to it

550
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:36,792
is entirely groundless
and is based on superstition,

551
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,292
rather than
objective observation.

552
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:41,626
The power of the will
is something

553
00:55:41,751 --> 00:55:43,959
people do not understand,

554
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:48,334
attributing to it mysterious
qualities it does not possess,

555
00:55:49,209 --> 00:55:52,584
being merely the power
of mind over matter,

556
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:58,126
or in the greater number of cases,
the power of mind over mind.

557
00:55:58,251 --> 00:56:00,709
As your mind
is succumbing to mine.

558
00:56:02,084 --> 00:56:06,709
For, as you look into my eyes
and listen to my voice,

559
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:10,334
your will is leaving you,

560
00:56:10,459 --> 00:56:12,709
slipping away-

561
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:16,209
You are now beneath
my influence.

562
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:21,584
Although your eyes are open
and you seem aware,

563
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:23,959
you are, in fact, asleep,

564
00:56:24,084 --> 00:56:26,792
your faculties dormant,

565
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,626
your abilities to act and think

566
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:32,542
subservient to my will.

567
00:56:33,917 --> 00:56:36,042
My will.

568
00:56:37,334 --> 00:56:39,126
Mrs Eaton,

569
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:42,417
my will is yours at this point.

570
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:47,417
You cannot function
in the least, unless I say so.

571
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,042
Can you?

572
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:52,084
Answer me, Mrs Eaton.

573
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:55,667
No.

574
00:56:57,959 --> 00:57:00,292
Where is Simon?

575
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:03,501
Upstairs.

576
00:57:03,626 --> 00:57:08,167
- Alone?
- My husband is watching him.

577
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:09,834
And Tanith?

578
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:13,126
- Upstairs.
- Alone?

579
00:57:13,251 --> 00:57:16,626
No. Rex is with her.

580
00:58:26,126 --> 00:58:28,084
Mummy, would you come...?

581
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:37,626
(Bell)

582
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:41,709
Get out of this house,
do you hear me?

583
00:58:41,834 --> 00:58:44,292
I want the girl and Simon.

584
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,626
- Show him out.
- I am leaving.

585
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,917
I shall not be back.

586
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:02,084
But something will.

587
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:06,459
Tonight, something will come
for Simon and the girl.

588
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:30,376
- Richard, what's happened?
- Nothing.

589
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:33,209
Apart from an attempt
to strangle me.

590
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:34,376
What?

591
00:59:34,501 --> 00:59:38,709
He woke up, tried to choke me
then went back to sleep.

592
00:59:40,084 --> 00:59:42,459
Mocata, he was here.

593
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,334
Why didn't you tell me?

594
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:49,126
Uncle Nicholas said that
Simon must not be left alone.

595
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,459
Better see if Rex is all right.

596
01:00:04,459 --> 01:00:06,334
Rex.

597
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:09,126
Rex, wake up. She's gone.

598
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:28,959
What are you trying to do?

599
01:00:30,459 --> 01:00:33,417
What's the matter, Tanith?
We'll go back.

600
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:36,001
No. I'm not going back there.

601
01:00:36,126 --> 01:00:37,917
Why not?

602
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:40,376
I almost killed you.

603
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:42,917
Mocata was there.

604
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:46,292
- Mocata?
- He came for me and Simon.

605
01:00:47,459 --> 01:00:49,626
But he didn't succeed.

606
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:52,292
He won't give up.

607
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:55,917
Can't you see?
I can't go back there.

608
01:00:56,042 --> 01:01:00,542
He'll make me do something
terrible to you and your friends.

609
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:03,417
I don't want to hurt you.

610
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:07,209
I don't want to hurt any of you.

611
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:10,959
All right. All right.

612
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,959
We won't go back. We'll find
somewhere safe until morning.

613
01:01:31,626 --> 01:01:35,834
I saw you coming.
You look terribly tired.

614
01:01:37,459 --> 01:01:39,126
Uncle Nicholas...

615
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:43,417
- Mocata's been here.
- What?

616
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:46,376
- He returned your car.
- He didn't harm you?

617
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:48,542
- No...
- Where's Simon?

618
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:50,376
- Asleep.
- You're sure?

619
01:01:50,501 --> 01:01:53,417
- Richard's watching him.
- What about the girl?

620
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:56,376
- She's gone.
- Gone?

621
01:01:56,501 --> 01:02:00,001
Rex is with her. He telephoned
but he wouldn't say where.

622
01:02:00,126 --> 01:02:03,292
Fool! Doesn't he realise yet
what we're up against?

623
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:05,876
She ran away.
Rex went after her.

624
01:02:06,001 --> 01:02:09,501
Why on earth didn't he bring
her back here, then?

625
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:11,751
He explained on the phone.

626
01:02:11,876 --> 01:02:16,292
It's through Tanith that
Mocata makes his attacks.

627
01:02:16,417 --> 01:02:20,959
She's his medium.
She doesn't want to be close to us.

628
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:22,917
Then why is Rex with her?

629
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:27,334
To try and prevent Mocata
from gaining control over her.

630
01:02:27,459 --> 01:02:29,626
Pray God he can.

631
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:34,126
As long as it's light,
it may be possible.

632
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:37,751
But once the darkness
begins to fall...

633
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:40,126
(Anguished cries)

634
01:02:40,251 --> 01:02:42,292
(Screams)

635
01:02:57,042 --> 01:02:59,292
It's nearly dark.

636
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:04,709
- Where's Simon?
- Saying good night to Peggy.

637
01:03:04,834 --> 01:03:07,709
What do you want
to do about supper?

638
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:10,334
Water, Richard. Just water.

639
01:03:11,459 --> 01:03:13,084
All right.

640
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,417
- God bless you, my angel.
- Good night, Mummy.

641
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:21,626
(Simon) Good night.

642
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:26,584
I've cleared the furniture
out of the drawing room,

643
01:03:26,709 --> 01:03:28,876
- as you requested.
- Thank you, Malin.

644
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:33,126
You're to stay with Miss Peggy
until I tell you otherwise.

645
01:03:33,251 --> 01:03:35,501
Now, to work.

646
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:37,501
(Screaming)

647
01:03:37,626 --> 01:03:39,792
(Stops screaming)

648
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,126
All right now?

649
01:04:04,876 --> 01:04:06,959
He must be getting weaker.

650
01:04:07,084 --> 01:04:10,501
He's been attacking you
all afternoon.

651
01:04:10,626 --> 01:04:12,959
No. He won't stop.

652
01:04:13,084 --> 01:04:15,542
It's too important for him.

653
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:18,292
Why doesn't he come at me
with a gun?

654
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:23,459
He never risks himself
in any way.

655
01:04:24,459 --> 01:04:27,667
I believe that, but this isn't
doing him any good.

656
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:15,209
What now?

657
01:05:15,334 --> 01:05:17,042
Now, we wait.

658
01:05:58,751 --> 01:05:59,792
No.

659
01:06:48,126 --> 01:06:50,126
(Wind howls)

660
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:04,959
Frankly, I think we're behaving
like a pack of idiots.

661
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:08,709
- It begins.
- What?

662
01:07:10,251 --> 01:07:11,959
What begins?

663
01:07:12,084 --> 01:07:15,626
Mocata is working on you.
You are the weakest link.

664
01:07:15,751 --> 01:07:18,626
- I...
- From his point of view.

665
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:20,792
You are the sceptical one.

666
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:24,917
He is looking for an easy way
to break the circle.

667
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,542
Come on!
ls there anything I could say

668
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:30,542
that you wouldn't interpret
in your own suspicious way?

669
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:33,417
- Richard.
- Well, it's all superstition.

670
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:36,376
Black magic.
Hell! I'm going for a drink.

671
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:38,084
Richard!

672
01:07:39,126 --> 01:07:42,751
You and I have been friends
for many years, haven't we?

673
01:07:42,876 --> 01:07:45,626
- I don't follow you
- If I begged you,

674
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:49,667
for the sake of that friendship,
to do something, would you?

675
01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:51,917
- You know I would.
- Very well.

676
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:54,751
Will you stay with me
in the circle tonight?

677
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:59,292
You are unafraid. I am not.

678
01:07:59,417 --> 01:08:02,917
It's a pretty low trick,
appealing to friendship.

679
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,251
Will you stay?

680
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,917
What else can I do?

681
01:08:19,334 --> 01:08:21,709
I wish we had some water.

682
01:08:23,084 --> 01:08:25,334
- We have.
- What?

683
01:08:25,459 --> 01:08:26,917
There.

684
01:08:29,126 --> 01:08:30,834
Yes.

685
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:45,126
Where do you get
your water from? A swamp?

686
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:47,709
- Taste it.
- No. Don't touch it.

687
01:08:47,834 --> 01:08:49,834
- I'll get some fresh.
- No!

688
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,876
That's exactly
what he wants you to do.

689
01:08:58,126 --> 01:08:59,876
What is it?

690
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:04,876
I'm not certain, but...

691
01:09:06,084 --> 01:09:08,084
(Marie) What?

692
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:11,709
The lights.

693
01:09:11,834 --> 01:09:14,792
(Richard) What about the lights?

694
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:20,126
- They seem to be dimmer.
- No, they're not.

695
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:21,751
Yes.

696
01:09:21,876 --> 01:09:24,709
I don't know what you're...

697
01:09:28,626 --> 01:09:32,417
- It's getting colder.
- This is to be expected.

698
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:36,626
It's only the beginning.

699
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:42,334
(Wind howls)

700
01:09:57,792 --> 01:10:01,209
Get up quickly!
Back-to-back. Join hands.

701
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:06,334
(Wind howls loudly)

702
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:11,334
(Mutters)

703
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:23,417
(Wind stops)

704
01:10:25,459 --> 01:10:28,501
Easy, darling. It's all over now.

705
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,501
(Knocking)

706
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:56,876
(Rex) What's going on?
Let me in.

707
01:10:57,001 --> 01:10:58,501
Stay still.

708
01:10:58,626 --> 01:11:00,001
No!

709
01:11:00,126 --> 01:11:03,334
(Rex) Come on.
It's cold out here. Let me in.

710
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:07,167
- We must let him in.
- Who? You think that's Rex?

711
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:08,876
(Knocking)

712
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:11,084
Let me in.

713
01:11:11,209 --> 01:11:13,876
(Fading) Let me in.

714
01:11:25,334 --> 01:11:27,334
What's that?

715
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:40,292
(Marie screams)

716
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:03,709
Don't leave the circle!

717
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:10,501
There's a light in the hall.

718
01:12:16,459 --> 01:12:17,542
Peggy!

719
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:21,709
- No, Marie!
- Peggy! Let me go! Run!

720
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:24,084
- It's not Peggy.
- You're out of your mind.

721
01:12:24,209 --> 01:12:25,792
Simon!

722
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:32,001
- (Screams)
- I tell you, it's not Peggy!

723
01:12:32,126 --> 01:12:35,251
(Marie sobs)

724
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:45,792
- Let go of me!
- She's upstairs, asleep.

725
01:12:56,334 --> 01:12:57,751
(Screams)

726
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:43,167
I won't!

727
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:45,167
Do you hear me? I won't!

728
01:13:45,292 --> 01:13:47,292
Simon! No! No, Simon!

729
01:13:57,792 --> 01:13:59,626
(Marie sobs)

730
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:01,959
Back-to-back. Quickly.

731
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:11,792
Can't we do anything
but just stand here?

732
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:14,751
Isn't there any way
of fighting back?

733
01:14:14,876 --> 01:14:17,126
- Only one.
- What?

734
01:14:17,251 --> 01:14:20,084
The last two lines
of the Sussamma Ritual.

735
01:14:20,209 --> 01:14:21,917
What are you waiting for?

736
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:25,501
I daren't use them
until our very souls are in peril.

737
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:28,834
It would destroy us as effectively
as it stops Mocata.

738
01:14:28,959 --> 01:14:30,709
It can alter time and space...

739
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:32,917
(Horse walking)

740
01:14:36,917 --> 01:14:39,001
(Marie) What is it?

741
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:42,709
He has given up
trying to get Simon.

742
01:14:42,834 --> 01:14:44,417
(Galloping hooves)

743
01:14:44,542 --> 01:14:48,667
He has sent
the Angel of Death to claim him.

744
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:51,209
And us?

745
01:14:51,334 --> 01:14:54,042
If he once breaks into the circle.

746
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:58,334
If we once catch sight of his face.

747
01:14:58,459 --> 01:15:00,459
(Horse whinnies)

748
01:15:13,417 --> 01:15:16,751
- For God's sake, say it!
- I can't.

749
01:15:29,459 --> 01:15:32,876
(Whinnies and snorts)

750
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:56,292
Richleau!

751
01:15:59,542 --> 01:16:03,001
Uriel seraphim. Eo potesta.

752
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:06,459
Zati, Zata. Galatim, Galatah!

753
01:16:07,751 --> 01:16:09,542
(Screams)

754
01:16:50,959 --> 01:16:55,751
- It's over?
- Yes, Simon. It's all over.

755
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:45,501
- She's dead.
- I know, Rex.

756
01:17:47,126 --> 01:17:49,167
The Angel of Death
was summoned.

757
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:52,292
He cannot return empty-handed.

758
01:18:12,251 --> 01:18:14,751
I'll go and see how Peggy is.

759
01:18:18,626 --> 01:18:21,042
Miss Peggy, she's gone.

760
01:18:21,959 --> 01:18:24,834
- What?
- What happened?

761
01:18:24,959 --> 01:18:27,667
Suddenly,
a darkness came over me.

762
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:31,001
I couldn't see. There was nothing
I could do, I swear it.

763
01:18:31,126 --> 01:18:32,542
I know, Malin.

764
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:34,626
No.

765
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:42,709
Oh, my God!
He's got her, hasn't he?

766
01:18:42,834 --> 01:18:44,917
(Car engine starts)

767
01:18:49,126 --> 01:18:50,292
Simon!

768
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:53,626
Don't try to follow him.
Mocata knows he's coming.

769
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:57,292
- To follow would be suicide.
- How will we find Mocata?

770
01:19:26,334 --> 01:19:29,209
Before me, Raphael.

771
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:33,751
Behind me, Gabriel.

772
01:19:34,834 --> 01:19:37,667
On my right hand, Michael.

773
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:41,792
On my left hand, Auriel.

774
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:44,376
In the name
of these mighty spirits,

775
01:19:44,501 --> 01:19:47,334
I conjure you, Tanith,
wherever you may be.

776
01:19:47,459 --> 01:19:50,792
Join us in this circle
that you may speak with us.

777
01:19:54,251 --> 01:19:56,959
With salt, I summon thee.

778
01:20:01,626 --> 01:20:04,001
With hair, I summon thee.

779
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:15,834
With blood, I summon thee.

780
01:20:19,459 --> 01:20:21,417
(Sizzles)

781
01:20:27,209 --> 01:20:29,292
The sign of Osiris slain.

782
01:20:32,626 --> 01:20:35,626
The sign of Osiris risen.

783
01:20:45,626 --> 01:20:48,792
(Tanith) You have called me.
I am here.

784
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:53,126
Are you in truth Tanith?

785
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:55,501
I am.

786
01:20:55,626 --> 01:20:59,501
Do you acknowledge our Lord,
Jesus Christ?

787
01:20:59,626 --> 01:21:01,126
I do.

788
01:21:03,917 --> 01:21:07,292
Did you come here
of your own free will?

789
01:21:07,417 --> 01:21:09,542
I came
because you summoned me.

790
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:11,334
I came willingly.

791
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:19,334
There is one here whose grief
at your passing is very great.

792
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:23,709
He has agreed that
you will be summoned back

793
01:21:23,834 --> 01:21:28,751
only in the hope that you will
protect his friends from evil.

794
01:21:28,876 --> 01:21:30,709
Will you help him?

795
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:35,626
I will...because I love him.

796
01:21:38,626 --> 01:21:41,126
Then tell us where Mocata is.

797
01:21:43,001 --> 01:21:47,084
- I do not know.
- Try to find him.

798
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:51,709
I cannot see him clearly.

799
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:55,959
He covers himself
with a cloak of darkness.

800
01:21:57,709 --> 01:22:00,792
- I see the child, a little girl.
- Where?

801
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,834
- I cannot enter.
- You must.

802
01:22:06,334 --> 01:22:10,542
I cannot. The winged serpent
guards the way.

803
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:14,501
- I cannot enter.
- Where?

804
01:22:16,501 --> 01:22:19,084
- I cannot see.
- You must see.

805
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:22,876
You must enter.

806
01:22:24,084 --> 01:22:26,876
I command you to enter.

807
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:29,292
No. Please.

808
01:22:29,417 --> 01:22:32,501
He is in there, the dark one.

809
01:22:32,626 --> 01:22:35,542
Please, don't make me enter.

810
01:22:35,667 --> 01:22:37,917
- You must enter.
- No.

811
01:22:38,042 --> 01:22:41,084
- No, please.
- I command you to enter.

812
01:22:41,209 --> 01:22:43,667
- No!
- Yes! Now!

813
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,751
- I cannot!
- Stop it!

814
01:22:45,876 --> 01:22:47,417
(Screams)

815
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:51,209
You fool! You damned fool!

816
01:22:52,459 --> 01:22:56,834
- She's all right.
- You might have killed her.

817
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:04,126
A winged serpent
guarding the way?

818
01:23:05,626 --> 01:23:07,834
But where?

819
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:11,917
On the gates of that house.

820
01:25:04,834 --> 01:25:08,084
Welcome back, my son.

821
01:25:40,084 --> 01:25:42,417
All right. I'm back.

822
01:25:42,542 --> 01:25:46,167
- You can release the child.
- Yes, I have you back.

823
01:25:46,292 --> 01:25:50,084
Now I don't have to release
the child, do I?

824
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:52,501
What do you mean? You...

825
01:25:52,626 --> 01:25:56,751
- You have no use for her.
- Ah, but I do, my son.

826
01:25:56,876 --> 01:26:00,126
A most...important use.

827
01:26:02,959 --> 01:26:05,334
I have you back.

828
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:08,292
Now, the only one I need is Tanith.

829
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:11,417
- You wouldn't...
- Dare?

830
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:13,626
(Mocata chuckles)

831
01:26:37,084 --> 01:26:38,792
Take your place.

832
01:26:51,084 --> 01:26:54,709
Now that our coven of 13
has been restored,

833
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:57,417
we can begin the ceremony.

834
01:26:58,751 --> 01:27:00,959
Bring in the child.

835
01:27:58,126 --> 01:28:02,709
Whatever you see,
whatever happens, stay close to me.

836
01:28:02,834 --> 01:28:05,292
God knows what we will find.

837
01:28:13,459 --> 01:28:18,376
Almighty and all-powerful Set,

838
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:20,584
father of darkness,

839
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:25,376
king of death,
I pledge this knife to you...

840
01:28:25,501 --> 01:28:27,001
(Woman screams)

841
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:30,542
Rex! No, Richard! No.

842
01:28:30,667 --> 01:28:31,834
Mocata!

843
01:28:41,709 --> 01:28:43,876
Welcome to our circle.

844
01:28:46,334 --> 01:28:48,501
What have you done to my baby?

845
01:28:48,626 --> 01:28:53,376
She does not hear you.
She's in a state of deep hypnosis.

846
01:28:53,501 --> 01:28:56,626
In the name of God,
you dare not!

847
01:28:57,709 --> 01:29:01,584
Scarcely in the name of God,
Monsieur le Duc.

848
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:04,584
What's he going to do with her?

849
01:29:04,709 --> 01:29:06,292
Uncle?

850
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:11,334
Take me instead, Mocata.

851
01:29:11,459 --> 01:29:13,792
You, Monsieur le Duc?

852
01:29:13,917 --> 01:29:17,584
Your soul in preference
to that of an unstained child?

853
01:29:17,709 --> 01:29:20,167
- What are you talking about?
- He isn't going to...?

854
01:29:20,292 --> 01:29:24,542
Yes. The transference of souls.

855
01:29:26,292 --> 01:29:29,876
That of your child
for that of Tanith.

856
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:31,334
No!

857
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:39,126
Now, if our two remaining guests
will permit,

858
01:29:39,251 --> 01:29:41,292
we may proceed.

859
01:29:44,751 --> 01:29:49,334
Almighty and all-powerful Set,

860
01:29:49,459 --> 01:29:54,001
father of darkness,
king of death,

861
01:29:54,126 --> 01:29:58,751
I pledge this knife to thee,
to do thy work...

862
01:30:00,084 --> 01:30:02,126
...and be thy servant.

863
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:05,126
Those words you said before,
say them again.

864
01:30:05,251 --> 01:30:07,376
(Mocata) ..the blood of this child...

865
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:10,167
- I cannot.
- You must.

866
01:30:10,292 --> 01:30:13,167
My baby's going to die
if you don't.

867
01:30:13,292 --> 01:30:15,626
You must speak
those words again.

868
01:30:16,459 --> 01:30:18,417
The bride of chaos.

869
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:20,959
(Followers) The bride of chaos.

870
01:30:21,084 --> 01:30:26,126
- The rider upon the beast.
- The rider upon the beast.

871
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:32,542
With this knife

872
01:30:32,667 --> 01:30:36,334
do I draw out the blood

873
01:30:36,459 --> 01:30:38,459
which is thy life.

874
01:30:39,626 --> 01:30:43,167
(Tanith) Only they who love
without desire

875
01:30:43,292 --> 01:30:47,292
shall have power granted them
in the darkest hour.

876
01:30:53,501 --> 01:30:55,626
(Followers gasp)

877
01:31:15,292 --> 01:31:17,709
(Tanith) Peggy, get up.

878
01:31:26,459 --> 01:31:29,959
Repeat after me the words
of the Sussamma Ritual.

879
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:32,626
Uriel seraphim.

880
01:31:33,667 --> 01:31:36,084
Uriel seraphim.

881
01:31:36,209 --> 01:31:40,334
- Eo potesta.
- Eo potesta.

882
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:44,751
- Zati, Zata.
- Zati, Zata.

883
01:31:44,876 --> 01:31:49,334
Galatim, Galatah.

884
01:31:49,459 --> 01:31:50,626
(Thunder clap)

885
01:31:54,459 --> 01:31:55,626
(crying)

886
01:31:59,001 --> 01:32:00,459
(Screaming)

887
01:32:05,001 --> 01:32:06,542
(Screams)

888
01:32:54,126 --> 01:32:55,501
It's over?

889
01:32:56,459 --> 01:32:59,626
Yes, Simon. It's all over.

890
01:33:06,209 --> 01:33:07,501
Oh.

891
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:11,917
Peggy.'-

892
01:33:23,459 --> 01:33:25,042
Wasn't...?

893
01:33:25,959 --> 01:33:27,001
Tanith?

894
01:33:53,751 --> 01:33:56,084
Come in, my friends.

895
01:33:59,709 --> 01:34:02,542
She's all right. Tanith!

896
01:34:04,834 --> 01:34:07,959
Time itself has been
reversed for us.

897
01:34:08,084 --> 01:34:10,959
Tanith's death,
Peggy's abduction,

898
01:34:11,084 --> 01:34:13,626
the ride to Chilbury,
the ritual in the cellar,

899
01:34:13,751 --> 01:34:16,417
all these things happened.

900
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:19,917
But now,
they have not happened.

901
01:34:21,876 --> 01:34:23,751
We are back.

902
01:34:23,876 --> 01:34:29,001
- We are all safe again.
- And is Mocata also safe?

903
01:34:29,126 --> 01:34:32,876
You will remember what I said
about the Angel of Death.

904
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:36,751
- Once summoned...
- Cannot return empty-handed.

905
01:34:36,876 --> 01:34:37,917
Exactly.

906
01:34:38,042 --> 01:34:40,667
Tanith has been restored to us,

907
01:34:40,792 --> 01:34:44,709
but the age-old law
demands a life for a life,

908
01:34:44,834 --> 01:34:47,001
a soul for a soul.

909
01:34:47,126 --> 01:34:49,709
There is only one man
in all this world

910
01:34:49,834 --> 01:34:52,626
who can replace her life, her soul.

911
01:34:52,751 --> 01:34:55,917
The man who invoked
the Angel of Death.

912
01:34:57,876 --> 01:34:59,626
Mocata is dead.

913
01:35:01,459 --> 01:35:04,876
- Thank God.
- Yes, Simon.

914
01:35:09,417 --> 01:35:12,126
He is the one we must thank.
