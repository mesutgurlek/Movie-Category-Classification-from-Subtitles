1
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:57,267
Do you know fear?

2
00:00:58,537 --> 00:01:03,600
Do you know what it's like to feel
your heart beating so intensely...

3
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:07,173
...that you can't even breathe?

4
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,438
This is a story...

5
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:12,709
...of monsters. creatures.

6
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:16,047
Hideous nightmares that crawl
in the night.

7
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,552
l've seen them.

8
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:19,953
l've seen them in visions.

9
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:24,522
And you will too.

10
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:28,099
l know you're saying to yourself :

11
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:31,895
,,what is this brother doing
in this godforsaken place?,,

12
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,005
The truth brought me out
to the only place...

13
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:38,574
...where l can speak the truth
and they can't get me.

14
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:42,338
That's right. Right here at KFRD,
freedom radio.

15
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:46,245
The source for the inside dope
on conspiracies, aliens...

16
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:49,876
...and up-to-the-minute reports
on when they'll invade.

17
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:52,819
It's morning here
in Prosperity, Arizona...

18
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:56,625
...and it's time for America
to wake up, people!

19
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:59,389
Wake up before it's too late!
But no.

20
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,725
Of course you're still asleep.

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,232
You still think we landed
on the moon...

22
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:09,272
...that Oswald killed Kennedy, and that
a black man's vote in Florida counts!

23
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:10,430
Wake up!

24
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:15,576
Look to the skies.
Look to the skies, my friends.

25
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:18,944
Unless you're driving.
I don't want nobody suing.

26
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:23,679
Got enough government problems.
Can barely pay for this damn trailer.

27
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:32,854
Keep talking, buddy.
Say something that has caffeine in it.

28
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:37,429
It's a hard life spreading the truth.
Never made Gandhi rich.

29
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:41,129
Never made Mother Teresa rich.
L. Ron Hubbard?

30
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:44,241
Actually, he did pretty good
for himself.

31
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,402
lnteresting.

32
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,889
Joshua?

33
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:24,640
Joshua?

34
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:49,660
You're a big fella.

35
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,602
Joshua! You trying
to scare me to death?

36
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,005
Hello, Mike.

37
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:06,875
The Lycosa narbonensis looks different
today. lt's bigger.

38
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:10,021
lt's their diet.
l made a discovery.

39
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:14,955
These have been in the pond
for the past three days.

40
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:16,354
crickets?

41
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:20,625
They're like...spider steroids.

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,128
l see dead people.
l see dead people.

43
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:27,865
He loves that movie. l don't....

44
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,599
There they go! Look, look!

45
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:36,370
-He was hungry!
-As they grow, their appetites do too.

46
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:40,678
l've never seen spiders this big.
lt's because of those crickets?

47
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:43,116
l'm gonna make a fortune.

48
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:45,051
Jumping spiders!

49
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:47,691
Yeah, Habronattus orbus.

50
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:53,396
Look, look how they kill.

51
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:56,892
l call this an arach-attack.

52
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:59,764
-Get it?
-Yeah. lt's good.

53
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:04,667
Have the orb weavers come in?

54
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:07,505
Took me forever to get
that mating pair.

55
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:12,378
l had to bribe every customs agent
from Santiago to Tucson. But here.

56
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:19,185
That is too cool.

57
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:23,418
See, the male orb weavers compete
for the female's attention.

58
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:27,622
They all try to give her
the best present. Like bugs...

59
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:31,997
...or, you know, rats
or the occasional parrot.

60
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:35,334
Let me show you something.

61
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:42,110
You see, the prey is cocooned alive
so she can eat them in her nest.

62
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,942
You know how women
like breakfast in bed.

63
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:46,606
Look at it.

64
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:48,912
Look at this, look at her.

65
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:52,982
The female is three times as big
as the male.

66
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:56,226
Say hello to consuela.

67
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:01,694
She fills her prey
with digestive acid...

68
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:05,427
...to liquefy it so she can
drink it from inside out.

69
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:07,294
while it's alive.

70
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,576
Man...

71
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,237
...am l in trouble.

72
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:20,646
l have to go.
l'll call you later, okay?

73
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,879
Next week, l bet they're twice
as big as today.

74
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:26,148
Bye, Josh. See you next week!

75
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:40,469
where did you go, little fella?

76
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,294
l see dead people!
l see dead--!

77
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:13,592
Sorry, sonny. we aren't hiring.

78
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,393
You sure? l'm a pretty good engineer.

79
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:19,594
Do l look like a woman who isn't sure?

80
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:21,538
Yeah, well....

81
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:26,310
-l used to know my way around here.
-we aren't hiring.

82
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:31,048
we're laying off. we're three months
from a going-out-of-business sale.

83
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,609
-Got the picture?
-Yeah, l got the picture.

84
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:36,720
But my name's not Sonny.

85
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:39,049
lt's chris.

86
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:46,794
chris?

87
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:50,924
Aunt Gladys.

88
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,430
welcome home.

89
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:59,635
Bad dog! No!

90
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:14,817
-Pete, what are you doing out here?
-well, we got a....

91
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:18,224
No. Question is,
what are you doing out here?

92
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:22,298
-You were supposed to stay home.
-what did you find, Mom?

93
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:25,800
Some jerk tossed a barrel of chemicals
off the road.

94
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,030
Looks like it's been out here
a couple of weeks.

95
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,739
who knows how much contamination
it's caused.

96
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,379
The water is contaminated?

97
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,914
Pete, send a sample down
to the EPA lab in Phoenix.

98
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,415
Let's see what they come up with.

99
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:44,987
-l have to tell Joshua!
-That's where you were going?

100
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:48,887
l told you no more visits
to that spider farm, didn't l?

101
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,121
-You're grounded.
-But l have to tell Joshua about this.

102
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:57,394
l don't want you hanging out with him.
Those spiders are dangerous.

103
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:01,801
They give you nightmares,
and you keep me up all night.

104
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:05,204
You know what happens
when l don't get enough sleep, right?

105
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:06,775
Bad mood?

106
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,969
Put your bike in the truck.

107
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:14,311
-can you help him with his bike?
-Yeah, okay, sure.

108
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:37,698
Hang on, Mike.

109
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:56,050
Party's over, gentlemen.
Off the bikes.

110
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:58,092
Great, this is all l need.

111
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:07,595
She is the sexiest sheriff
in the country.

112
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,205
l know, it's weird.

113
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:14,969
-You bought yourself a reckless, Bret.
-Give them a break.

114
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:17,546
-Get in the truck, Ashley.
-Mom!

115
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,046
Now.

116
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:26,482
-Give me your license.
-come on, sheriff.

117
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:32,225
-Anything you say can be used against--
-Shut up!

118
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,060
You have a right to an attorney.
lf you can't afford an attorney....

119
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:42,571
Larry, do we know anybody at city Hall
who might be able to take care of this?

120
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,436
Bret, isn't your stepfather the mayor?

121
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:51,305
Put my daughter in danger again, l'll
show you how little that means to me.

122
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,677
we're cool, sheriff.

123
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,186
-Do you think G-string or underwear?
-Definitely thong.

124
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:01,951
-You're kidding. Gonna pay for this?
-No.

125
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:04,185
-Sweet.
-That was really sweet.

126
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:06,964
-l heard that!
-whatever.

127
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:11,693
Bret, l can't believe my mom gave you
a ticket. lt was humiliating.

128
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:15,270
-l need the phone.
-You don't. You have no friends.

129
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:20,472
l can't get any privacy around here,
you know?

130
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,112
Hello?

131
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:29,843
My God.

132
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,992
Anybody know what's going on
with the phone?

133
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,709
come on, Joshua. Pick up!

134
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,429
-How much?
-lt don't make sense.

135
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:21,967
wait. This is a town meeting,
not the wwF.

136
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:23,298
Mayor?

137
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:27,137
why can't those of us
that want to sell, sell?

138
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:31,280
viroanol wants all of our properties
or none of them.

139
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:36,113
Let's face it, the town's going broke.
They'll pay us to relocate.

140
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,451
How do we know this isn't another
one of your get-rich schemes...

141
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,492
...like building this ridiculous mall
out here?

142
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:46,494
They scrapped plans to run
a freeway here--

143
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:51,428
-or that stupid ostrich farm of yours.
-lt's good meat. lt's healthy.

144
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:55,003
Everybody here is having
some financial problems.

145
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:59,371
l want to get out from under this.
The rest of you should too.

146
00:14:59,544 --> 00:15:02,445
This is a government cover-up,
isn't it?

147
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:06,549
-what are you talking about?
-why they giving so much money?

148
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:08,617
Just to get to the mines?

149
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:12,449
They want to put the empty mines
to use. lt's safe.

150
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:15,922
The only reason that we've kept
this town going...

151
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:20,496
...is the hope the Mccormack mines
could turn their selves around...

152
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:25,068
...and put everybody back to work.
lt is not happening.

153
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:28,831
old man Mccormack, God rest his soul...

154
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:30,863
...he's dead.

155
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:35,237
-As dead as those mines.
-well, Mr. Mayor...

156
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,176
...before he died...

157
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:40,314
...he claimed he'd seen that vein.

158
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:43,818
Let's be honest, Leon.
The man was hallucinating.

159
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:46,684
Those mines are filled
with methane gas.

160
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:50,058
You're gonna load that gun
with toxic waste?

161
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:55,491
-This is for landowners only.
-l am a landowner, wade.

162
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:59,568
chris Mccormack!
l didn't know you were back.

163
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:03,332
My father said he'd found
the Agua Mesa lode. l believe him.

164
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:05,999
He said a lot of things near the end.

165
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:10,377
l'm not selling the mine.

166
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:15,947
chris! wait up!

167
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:20,082
-You're being foolish.
-Back off.

168
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:22,590
Your father was delusional.

169
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,059
Shut the hell up about my father.
l'm warning you.

170
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,860
Since when did you care about
the mines? You've been gone 10 years.

171
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:32,127
wade....

172
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:34,371
Don't make the town suffer...

173
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:38,270
...because you feel guilty you weren't
around when your father died.

174
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,069
l'm talking to you.

175
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:43,140
l warned you!

176
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:46,750
-what the hell are you doing?
-That's it!

177
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,443
l'm pressing charges.
l want him arrested.

178
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:52,317
Go home, wade.
Put some ice on your nose.

179
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:58,053
curve around 20 feet away from
the scene of a misdemeanor. Thank you.

180
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:01,062
Ten years and you have
not changed a bit.

181
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:07,832
-Lay low for a couple days, all right?
-Good to see you again, Sam.

182
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:09,472
Just like old times.

183
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,575
Everything will be sorted out
in the morning.

184
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:16,509
-So you still like men.
-what are you talking about?

185
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:21,277
Nothing. l just saw you staring
at his butt when you handcuffed him.

186
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:24,250
who said it's okay to talk
to me like this?

187
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:27,585
He's pretty cute for an old-fogy
kind of guy.

188
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:31,153
He just needs a shave.

189
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,622
okay, folks. Show's over. Move along.

190
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:37,859
Night, Sam.

191
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:40,333
Nothing to see here, folks.

192
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:43,938
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

193
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:04,256
Honey, give it a rest. lt's so late.
lt's almost midnight.

194
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:10,159
You told me to finish the job.
l'm trying to actually finish the job.

195
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:14,065
Let's give Zekie his snack
and go to sleep. where is Zeke?

196
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:16,069
well, he's just....

197
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,141
Don't tell me he went
into the dry wall again.

198
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:23,404
l was meaning to get a grille.
They don't have the right size--

199
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:28,579
You were gonna finish remodeling
this place. over a month ago.

200
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:31,620
l don't think you know
what you're doing.

201
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,247
we'll have to give Zeke cat food,
and he hates that.

202
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:40,261
God forbid a cat should have to eat
cat food. That cat is spoiled rotten.

203
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:43,491
lf he was a kid,
we'd send him to military school.

204
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:45,258
Poor Zekie.

205
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:48,303
-Let's lie and say it's tuna.
-okay.

206
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:51,339
You won't trick him. He's smart.

207
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,807
Zekie-doodle.

208
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:56,173
Look what we got for you.

209
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:58,747
we got tuna.

210
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:06,178
Get your furry cat ass out of there!

211
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:27,032
Zeke.

212
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:51,927
what's going on?

213
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:02,308
oh, my God!

214
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,348
She's divorced now, you know.

215
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:08,952
l don't want to talk
about Sam Parker right now.

216
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,017
Man in a flea circus don't wanna itch,
but he still does.

217
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:18,151
Something on your mind, Gladys?

218
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:23,791
-l know why you left town 10 years ago.
-l left for a lot of reasons.

219
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:28,098
You wanted to avoid telling Sam
why you beat up her husband.

220
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:31,708
That was a long time ago.
l'm a changed man now.

221
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:33,500
Prove it.

222
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:37,374
March down to Sam Parker's
and tell her everything.

223
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:39,842
why you broke
her husband's nose.

224
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:43,509
why you left town without
so much as a fare-thee-well.

225
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:47,589
And tell her once and for all
how you really feel about her.

226
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:50,853
Lose the face fuzz before you do.

227
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:54,088
Makes your mouth look like
a stripper's crotch.

228
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,695
That's disgusting.

229
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,702
Hello?
Hey, Pete. what's up?

230
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,179
-Can you talk?
-l can talk. what's the matter?

231
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,183
-Something ate Zeke.
-what?

232
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:19,845
-He got in the dry wall.
-Something ate your cat?

233
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,125
oh, my God. what do you think it was?

234
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,408
Unbelievable.

235
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:47,711
-How is Emma taking it?
-well, she left me.

236
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:51,252
-She's gone to stay with her mother.
-l'm so sorry.

237
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:53,421
-You okay?
-l'm fine.

238
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:57,357
-You sound like you're crying.
-No, no.

239
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:01,828
l just....
l have an intolerance to dairy.

240
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:05,093
l'm just a little bit mucousy
right now.

241
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:06,293
That's it.

242
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:24,620
Sam, l need to tell you something.

243
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:31,060
-lt's Bret. l'm gonna get it.
-wait. Hang on a second. come here.

244
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:35,125
l'm worried about things
you've been doing lately, Ash.

245
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,668
This bad-girl thing you're going
through could get you in trouble.

246
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:43,671
l have something that l want you
to keep with you, okay?

247
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:48,107
-l really don't want to do this now.
-Just a sec!

248
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:53,072
l'm a man. You're a woman.

249
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,308
what am l doing?

250
00:22:56,453 --> 00:23:00,583
-Take this. Protection.
-ls that a stun gun? Are you kidding?

251
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:05,252
-l knew guys like Bret at your age.
-Mom, l'm not you, okay?

252
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:07,829
l'm not gonna get pregnant at 16.

253
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:13,197
l'm not gonna stay here for the rest of
my life and be a trailer-trash sheriff !

254
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:16,262
Thanks for the flashback.

255
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,779
l didn't deserve that.

256
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,310
l'm sorry, okay?

257
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:29,315
l'm really sorry.

258
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:36,219
can l have the stun gun, please?

259
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:45,194
-Be careful with it, all right?
-okay. Thank you.

260
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:47,499
Get out of here.

261
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:53,336
oh, it's you.

262
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:59,407
-l was wondering if your mom was home?
-Mom! lt's for you.

263
00:24:03,587 --> 00:24:06,249
-Morning, chris.
-Morning, Sam.

264
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:10,221
l wanted to come by
and apologize for yesterday.

265
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:12,954
l can handle wade.
Don't worry about it.

266
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:14,888
Great.

267
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:18,933
And since l'm back in town
for a little while...

268
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:22,429
...l thought maybe l could....

269
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,266
Sam...

270
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:26,906
...before l left....

271
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:31,177
ls there something you wanna tell me?

272
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,116
Do you think we could...

273
00:24:35,486 --> 00:24:38,853
...meet somewhere? Hook up?
Not hook up.

274
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:43,153
l mean, meet somewhere
and catch up on things?

275
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:46,296
Sure, chris. we could do that.

276
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:50,297
-Great. All right. l'll be in touch.
-okay.

277
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:53,565
who are the flowers for?

278
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:56,902
well, they're for you, actually.

279
00:24:57,307 --> 00:24:58,899
l picked them myself.

280
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,310
-Nice.
-Nice.

281
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:03,910
All right, bye.

282
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:08,181
Picked them myself.

283
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,580
come on.

284
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,306
Joshua?

285
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:53,396
There's no sign of Joshua...

286
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:55,031
...his parrot...

287
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:58,029
...or any of the arachnids.

288
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:03,965
Just these huge, intricate webs
they've left behind.

289
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:33,295
l've discovered several arachnid
tracks outside.

290
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,531
From my initial estimate,
the spiders have doubled.

291
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:39,236
No...

292
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:43,442
...more like they're five times
their original size.

293
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,446
l found this map in my dad's study.

294
00:27:25,822 --> 00:27:30,282
Leon, is this the section he was
working on when he died?

295
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,722
l thought so.

296
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:36,025
l want to concentrate all our energy
in these tunnels here.

297
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,330
Those mines have the highest
concentration of methane gas.

298
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:44,304
l'm not gonna make the same mistake
my dad did.

299
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:47,272
l want all men to wear masks
at all times.

300
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:52,040
lf you feel disoriented, get to
a higher chamber as soon as possible.

301
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:56,346
lt's nice to know you didn't forget
everything we taught you.

302
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:14,629
-can you give me a ride into town?
-Sure. Hop in.

303
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:16,272
Great, thanks.

304
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:27,142
what's that?

305
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:32,383
l think it's an exoskeleton
of a male orb weaver's pedipalps.

306
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:34,421
okay.

307
00:28:34,858 --> 00:28:36,985
lt's a spider's leg.

308
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:40,594
That seems awful big
to be a spider leg.

309
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:44,325
That's the problem.
But nobody's gonna believe me.

310
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,166
Believe what?

311
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,396
Do you really want to know?

312
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:53,873
-Try me.
-okay, the situation is this:

313
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:58,674
My friend Joshua sells spiders.
They've been growing bigger and bigger.

314
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:03,752
Now they've broken out of their cages
and headed down to the mineshafts.

315
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,686
Joshua is nowhere to be found.
They might've killed him.

316
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:12,318
But you won't believe me. l'm the kid.
They never believe the kid.

317
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:14,321
Let me see it.

318
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:19,167
lt does kind of look
like an old piece of cactus.

319
00:29:19,336 --> 00:29:20,826
See?

320
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,124
So...

321
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,100
-...where were you?
-l went to Joshua's.

322
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:04,763
-what did l say about that?
-His spiders are gigantic!

323
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:08,206
The town could be in danger.
They could destroy everything!

324
00:31:08,378 --> 00:31:11,711
People could get killed.
Just hear me out.

325
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:14,812
l swear to God it's the television.

326
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:17,886
This is exactly your problem,
right here.

327
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:22,423
l don't want to hear any more
of your media-induced nightmares.

328
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:23,889
Mom, listen to me!

329
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,221
Add a week to how long
you're grounded.

330
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:29,729
-Please.
-And no Tv.

331
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:42,478
l know, l thought it was a slam-dunk.

332
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:46,480
who knew chris Mccormack would
suddenly get gold fever?

333
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,550
l'm trying my best here.

334
00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:51,812
Do you know what people
would do if they knew...

335
00:31:51,988 --> 00:31:55,856
...we were storing toxic waste
without their consent?

336
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:58,358
wade, l'm going out now.

337
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:01,361
Now, look. l let you guys run tests...

338
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:04,989
...putting that stuff in the mines
under my property.

339
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:08,296
-l'll be back late.
-You owe me on this.

340
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:14,033
Going off to get wasted, have an orgy.
Might steal a car, want one?

341
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:18,511
Bret, l'm on the phone. Go have
some fun. l'll see you later.

342
00:32:18,682 --> 00:32:23,051
-we stand together or we fall together.
-Thanks for caring, man.

343
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:44,264
l'll do what l can.

344
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,748
what the--?

345
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:15,921
Good Lord.

346
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:52,229
I've been warning you for years,
but you wouldn't listen.

347
00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:56,304
Now it's emerging as a trend
in our sleepy little town.

348
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:59,965
The police wire says Bob Stuck's
dog Skippy's missing.

349
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:03,340
lt's the fourth missing-pet call
we've had today.

350
00:35:03,513 --> 00:35:05,413
lt's strange. lt's strange.

351
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:09,985
People are saying it's coyotes,
it's wolves. But we know the truth.

352
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:13,486
we all know about those cows
and the probe.

353
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:15,147
The anal probe.

354
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:21,259
Let's talk about the probe. Let's talk
about the anal probe. what is that?

355
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:24,491
what are they looking for?
That's just wrong.

356
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:29,230
Skippy didn't do anything to anybody.
He doesn't deserve that!

357
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:32,898
what will you find in a dog's--?
lt's just wrong!

358
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:35,544
You're all ostriches with
your heads in the dirt.

359
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:38,708
Which just leaves your ass
up in the air!

360
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:44,115
You're inviting the aliens in! They
have no choice but to probe your butt.

361
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:49,354
Aunt Gladys, how can you listen
to this wacko?

362
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:51,858
l think he's very informative.

363
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,000
Do Floyd and Leroy still
have that barbershop?

364
00:35:59,169 --> 00:36:01,433
Good idea. People are talking.

365
00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:05,070
You can't light those matches?

366
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:07,300
Maybe it's a sign to quit.

367
00:36:07,477 --> 00:36:10,310
If the aliens come
and try to anal-probe me...

368
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,313
...l'm telling you,
l'm not taking that!

369
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:17,044
lf you want a piece of me,
don't take that piece!

370
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,848
So how much is a shave these days?

371
00:36:20,023 --> 00:36:22,719
-Four bucks.
-Four bucks?

372
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:26,020
-lt's a good deal.
-Got to give a good deal.

373
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:31,190
can't charge around here what
a barber can charge in other places...

374
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:32,994
...where they got money.

375
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:35,968
And jobs.

376
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:42,844
of course, some people don't know
a good deal when they see one.

377
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:46,470
-Maybe l don't need a shave.
-Hold still.

378
00:36:47,016 --> 00:36:49,075
l wouldn't want to cut you.

379
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:05,094
Bret, slow down.

380
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:10,235
-l thought you loved me.
-l do. l do.

381
00:37:10,406 --> 00:37:12,738
-But, l just....
-But, what?

382
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:19,113
l don't want to lose my virginity
in the front seat of a truck.

383
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:22,615
why didn't you say so?
l got a blanket in the back.

384
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:26,916
No. That's not it.
l just don't think l'm ready.

385
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,787
-Tammy and Larry do it every night.
-Fine, call them.

386
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,622
Have a ménage à trois if you want.

387
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:38,734
-That dirty talk just drives me nuts.
-Bret, no.

388
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:40,460
Bret, please.

389
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:44,300
-l'm warning you, okay?
-l can't help it.

390
00:37:44,474 --> 00:37:46,874
You just bring out the beast in me.

391
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:48,736
Back off !

392
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:52,741
My balls!

393
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:57,119
God, my balls!

394
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:07,529
Damn it! l pissed my pants!
Don't you think you're overreacting?

395
00:38:07,697 --> 00:38:10,325
-l was just copping a feel!
-overreacting?

396
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:13,331
l can't believe my mom
was right about you.

397
00:38:13,503 --> 00:38:16,836
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing that is?

398
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:21,208
Ash, wait. l'm sorry!

399
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:47,127
check out Bret.

400
00:38:48,304 --> 00:38:52,968
Let's go! They're coming.
come on, let's go! Get on your bikes!

401
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:58,673
-Dude, did you piss your pants?
-we gotta go.

402
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:00,110
They're coming!

403
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:03,548
Looks like the only thing going
is you, dude.

404
00:39:09,993 --> 00:39:11,620
Holy crap!

405
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,930
They're getting closer! Move it!

406
00:39:55,638 --> 00:40:00,337
we have ostriches, cats and dogs
disappearing all over town.

407
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,570
Last time I checked, cats and dogs
are not fish.

408
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:06,374
And ostriches farmed are not game.

409
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:10,815
There has to be somebody
at Fish and Game who can help.

410
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:53,419
Hey, watch it!

411
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:44,186
Yes.

412
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:55,093
what the hell are these things?

413
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:24,633
Here we go again.
The phone lines are down.

414
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:27,534
They'll tell you
it's a technical error.

415
00:42:27,707 --> 00:42:31,144
But you know what it is.
They're shutting us down!

416
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:36,374
l know what you're saying to yourself.
,, He's paranoid. He's crazy.,,

417
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:39,213
But you know,
there's an old saying:

418
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:42,619
Just because l'm paranoid doesn't
mean people aren't following me.

419
00:42:42,858 --> 00:42:46,157
All of a sudden there's
a communication blackout.

420
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:50,595
At the bottom of the bag.
lt's where they always put the food.

421
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,204
Here it is.

422
00:43:02,381 --> 00:43:04,042
Here we go, Bruisie.

423
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,242
Bruisie?

424
00:43:27,276 --> 00:43:28,334
Bruiser?

425
00:43:29,278 --> 00:43:30,745
Aunt Gladys?

426
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:37,415
Bruiser?

427
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,358
oh, my God.

428
00:43:47,032 --> 00:43:48,624
oh, Lord.

429
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:51,002
Are you in there?

430
00:44:03,152 --> 00:44:04,813
oh, my God!

431
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:08,884
l'm coming, baby.
l'm coming.

432
00:44:09,057 --> 00:44:11,925
Aunt Gladys, l lost the face fuzz.

433
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,366
Bruiser?

434
00:44:48,804 --> 00:44:50,271
Aunt Gladys?

435
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:34,082
This ain't no cactus.

436
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:57,674
Mike!

437
00:46:02,223 --> 00:46:03,656
Mike! Sam!

438
00:46:06,294 --> 00:46:08,195
-can l talk to Mike?
-why?

439
00:46:08,363 --> 00:46:09,796
l can't explain now.

440
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:15,231
-Look what l found in my basement.
-That thing is huge!

441
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,667
Give me a second!

442
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,336
Hold this.

443
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:28,547
what's going on?

444
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:31,820
So check this out.

445
00:46:31,991 --> 00:46:35,324
After taking careful measurements of
the exoskeleton l found at Joshua's...

446
00:46:35,494 --> 00:46:38,487
...l calculated the spider
was the size shown here.

447
00:46:39,032 --> 00:46:42,729
-what spider?
-The hole in the basement was bigger.

448
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:44,025
what hole?

449
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:49,006
Let's input the measurements from
your exoskeleton and see what happens.

450
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,441
That's more like it...

451
00:46:53,615 --> 00:46:54,912
...unfortunately.

452
00:46:55,217 --> 00:47:00,713
-what the hell is this?
-lt's my media-induced nightmare.

453
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:17,804
oh, God.

454
00:47:17,977 --> 00:47:21,414
So you're telling me a giant spider
ate Gladys?

455
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:25,914
-Maybe not. was there webbing around?
-Yeah, lots of it.

456
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:29,318
She might have been attacked
by a male orb weaver.

457
00:47:29,491 --> 00:47:31,288
what's the difference?

458
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:34,588
Males compete for the female
by bringing her presents.

459
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:38,598
The prey is cocooned alive so
she can feed on it in her nest.

460
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:43,172
-women like breakfast in bed.
-So Gladys might still be alive?

461
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,289
That's Ashley! come on!

462
00:48:39,805 --> 00:48:40,999
Look out!

463
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:47,041
Keys. Keys, keys, keys!

464
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:54,044
Mike, get out of here!

465
00:48:59,161 --> 00:49:01,528
-Throw me the scissors!
-Scissors?

466
00:49:02,098 --> 00:49:03,690
Scissors! Here you go!

467
00:49:06,503 --> 00:49:09,234
Sam! Help!

468
00:49:15,847 --> 00:49:17,405
Hey, spidey!

469
00:49:27,961 --> 00:49:29,087
Thank you.

470
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:31,732
Pete! Come in, Pete.

471
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:34,162
Hold on to your shirt.

472
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:41,769
ls that you, Sam?

473
00:49:42,478 --> 00:49:45,971
l don't know what's going on,
but the phones are down.

474
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,141
l know. Take the weapons
and get to my house.

475
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,255
Guns? why would we be needing--?

476
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:53,515
Just do it!

477
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:56,286
okay. All right. okay.

478
00:50:33,938 --> 00:50:37,203
winchester, 30.06...

479
00:50:38,443 --> 00:50:40,275
...Mossberg pump...

480
00:50:40,779 --> 00:50:43,339
...and the Lee Harvey oswald rifle.

481
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:46,349
why we have that, l do not know.

482
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:51,990
Why don't you stomp them hills out
and get some room to grow...

483
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:56,425
-...before you start making brags!
-Brags, is it?

484
00:51:09,012 --> 00:51:10,981
l'm closing up.

485
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:14,049
You're always talking at me
about something.

486
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:19,085
can you turn that thing down?
You're already deaf from it.

487
00:51:22,994 --> 00:51:24,860
l said, turn that thing down!

488
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:27,764
what did you say?

489
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:57,727
Bob?

490
00:52:00,872 --> 00:52:05,366
First Emma leaves, now Sam's
got me doing spring-cleaning.

491
00:52:05,544 --> 00:52:07,445
can't get any worse.

492
00:52:36,313 --> 00:52:39,545
So, what happened
with you and Brian anyway?

493
00:52:42,153 --> 00:52:45,351
He wasn't exactly the faithful type.

494
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:48,919
l've been trying to tell you
this for a long time....

495
00:52:49,094 --> 00:52:51,655
You can handle one of these, right?

496
00:52:55,034 --> 00:52:59,199
-Ashley, Mike, you guys ready?
-Just a minute, Mom.

497
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:04,277
-How many spiders did Joshua have?
-l don't know. 100, maybe 200.

498
00:53:04,446 --> 00:53:09,009
-Two hundred? Are you kidding me?
-Hurry up, guys. Time to go.

499
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:13,622
Joshua's spiders are nocturnal hunters.
They're coming out to feed.

500
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,283
-we have to warn everybody.
-The phone lines are down.

501
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:20,692
To spread the word,
to look into the dark places...

502
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:26,132
-...our government-controlled media--
-we could broadcast a warning!

503
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:28,296
who'll believe that lunatic?

504
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:42,079
what was that?

505
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:44,956
what the...?

506
00:53:47,095 --> 00:53:49,063
what the hell is going on?

507
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:52,360
lt's Pete. He's waiting.
come on, let's go.

508
00:53:52,535 --> 00:53:53,900
See you, Ash.

509
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,504
l don't think that was Pete.

510
00:54:11,757 --> 00:54:13,520
oh, my God.

511
00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:20,428
Holy moly!

512
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:24,561
Everybody get in the car, now!
Ashley, go!

513
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:28,067
come on!

514
00:54:28,243 --> 00:54:30,303
Look out, Sam!

515
00:54:37,654 --> 00:54:38,951
come on!

516
00:54:42,827 --> 00:54:45,193
what are you waiting for? Go!

517
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:47,628
Habronattus orbus.

518
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:49,497
The jumper.

519
00:55:07,322 --> 00:55:10,814
Stay in the car.
Pete, honk if there are any problems.

520
00:55:10,992 --> 00:55:12,118
You got it, Sam.

521
00:55:12,294 --> 00:55:14,559
-Mom.
-Stay in the car!

522
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,391
Guys, stay.

523
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:22,872
-what are you doing?
-l need to make a broadcast.

524
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,102
-You can't oppress me--
-Show me how this thing works.

525
00:55:27,278 --> 00:55:30,942
consider this a government conspiracy
to take over your station.

526
00:55:31,116 --> 00:55:32,606
Here.

527
00:55:32,785 --> 00:55:33,809
Friends...

528
00:55:34,586 --> 00:55:36,884
...our local authorities have...

529
00:55:37,056 --> 00:55:40,458
...an emergency message
for our little community.

530
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:44,359
This is Sheriff Parker.
l have an important announcement.

531
00:55:45,533 --> 00:55:48,058
Pete, turn on the radio.

532
00:55:48,235 --> 00:55:51,967
This is not a prank or
one of Harlan's crazy stunts.

533
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,234
We have a crisis situation
on our hands.

534
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:59,871
The town is being overrun
by giant spiders.

535
00:56:00,249 --> 00:56:04,243
l know how this sounds,
but you must trust me on this.

536
00:56:04,455 --> 00:56:07,652
l want everyone to arm
themselves immediately.

537
00:56:07,825 --> 00:56:09,157
l repeat:

538
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:13,097
Giant spiders are all over the town.

539
00:56:13,264 --> 00:56:18,703
-Did she just say giant spiders?
-That's just Harlan's show.

540
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:22,638
Giant spiders? what the hell
kind of bullshit is that?

541
00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:25,539
Aliens you believe,
this you have a hard time with?

542
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:34,519
why didn't someone say something?
Look at me. God.

543
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:52,476
l gotta warn Sam.

544
00:56:52,644 --> 00:56:55,169
No! Noise will just attract it.

545
00:56:55,347 --> 00:56:58,579
-what should l do?
-Give me the walkie-talkie!

546
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:04,350
-Mom, are you there?
-Yeah, Mike.

547
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:07,926
-ls everything okay?
-Don't make any noises.

548
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:11,496
There's a giant tarantula headed
your way.

549
00:57:12,801 --> 00:57:14,132
copy that.

550
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:24,638
oh, my God!

551
00:57:24,815 --> 00:57:27,181
They're here!

552
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,218
You're just food to that thing!

553
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:39,458
Attention, people.
Everyone meet at the Prosperity Mall.

554
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,248
l repeat:

555
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:00,322
The Prosperity Mall!

556
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,285
-why the mall?
-concrete walls, steel doors.

557
00:58:22,515 --> 00:58:24,507
Did you see that thing?

558
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,087
come on!

559
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:05,023
l have four more payments
on this shit!

560
00:59:10,037 --> 00:59:12,801
-come on! Hurry!
-lt's coming this way!

561
00:59:13,874 --> 00:59:15,206
Go! Go!

562
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,110
come on!

563
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:37,874
-can l get a refill, carol?
-Help yourself, sweetie.

564
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:46,347
-That was an excellent ostrich burger.
-well, thank you.

565
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,148
Kind of slow today, huh?

566
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,754
lt's always slow here, wade.

567
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:59,130
There's no way you're telling me
that thing back there is from Earth.

568
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:03,259
All right! They're spiders from Mars.
You happy?

569
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,432
No.

570
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,870
lt's the invasion!

571
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:39,604
l'm telling you, it's the invasion!
l told you!

572
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:44,615
Everyone, just get to the mall
as quick as you can!

573
01:02:48,824 --> 01:02:52,693
Get to the Prosperity Mall
as soon as possible.

574
01:02:59,036 --> 01:03:00,799
Arach-attack.

575
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:32,367
lf you build it, they will come.

576
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:56,535
Get everyone inside
and get the gate down.

577
01:03:56,736 --> 01:03:58,260
Kids, go with him.

578
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:00,433
oswald's gun.

579
01:04:00,607 --> 01:04:03,007
This is the weirdest day of my life.

580
01:04:05,413 --> 01:04:07,040
what is going on?

581
01:04:07,415 --> 01:04:09,315
Look behind you!

582
01:04:32,544 --> 01:04:34,569
-How do you lower the gate?
-Key.

583
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,271
-Do you have it?
-Yeah.

584
01:04:36,883 --> 01:04:38,680
-Hurry up!
-okay.

585
01:04:39,886 --> 01:04:43,220
-That's the back gate. The lavatory.
-come on!

586
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:47,554
-You're making me nervous!
-l'm making you nervous. Give me that!

587
01:04:48,062 --> 01:04:51,658
-could it be the ,,front gate,, one?
-Yeah, front gate.

588
01:04:54,002 --> 01:04:55,527
-come on!
-come on!

589
01:04:56,172 --> 01:04:57,833
Get inside! Hurry!

590
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,351
Mom, hurry up! come on!

591
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:15,060
Mom, hurry! Hurry!

592
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:21,994
Mom, come on! Hurry up!

593
01:05:29,377 --> 01:05:30,935
Mom, are you okay?

594
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:36,550
what exactly is that?

595
01:05:36,952 --> 01:05:38,545
Spider, man.

596
01:05:42,325 --> 01:05:45,693
How's the lock-down holding?
This one's pretty good.

597
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:48,798
They're holding, but we
don't have much time.

598
01:05:50,067 --> 01:05:53,162
okay. All the doors are locked
and secured.

599
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:58,504
No breaches out front. l haven't heard
a sound. l think the doors will hold.

600
01:05:58,678 --> 01:06:02,045
-Someone ought to get back there....
-Go.

601
01:06:02,214 --> 01:06:04,775
we have a right to know
what's going on!

602
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:07,044
Those things killed Leroy.

603
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:11,180
Bob Miller, my best customer,
was hanging from my ceiling.

604
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,293
what am l doing on the radio?

605
01:06:13,461 --> 01:06:16,829
l've been telling you about
the invasion for months.

606
01:06:16,999 --> 01:06:19,729
Am l talking to myself?
l'm here for you.

607
01:06:20,202 --> 01:06:24,264
-You saying those things are aliens?
-You're not listening....

608
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:26,875
Mom, they have to be quiet.

609
01:06:27,043 --> 01:06:30,377
Those were big-ass spiders!
Really big ones!

610
01:06:30,548 --> 01:06:32,379
Shut up!

611
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:35,611
Let's listen to the kid. For once.

612
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:37,049
Go on, Mike.

613
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,829
First of all, the spiders are attracted
to vibrations. That includes:

614
01:06:45,998 --> 01:06:50,060
Loud noises, movement and talking.

615
01:06:50,237 --> 01:06:54,174
So everybody needs to stay as calm
and quiet as possible.

616
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:58,904
-why didn't you call in the Army?
-where have you been, wade?

617
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,380
-The phones are dead.
-Does anyone have a cell phone?

618
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:05,612
Use mine. You have to climb a mountain
for a signal.

619
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:10,351
Use the antenna on the mall.
That's how l get my broadcast out.

620
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:14,487
-Have someone climb and get a signal.
-That's a great idea.

621
01:07:14,665 --> 01:07:16,394
Be a hero.

622
01:07:18,237 --> 01:07:19,602
l'll do it.

623
01:07:19,772 --> 01:07:21,467
No, Sam. Let me.

624
01:07:21,774 --> 01:07:24,039
l got your back.

625
01:07:25,378 --> 01:07:28,006
-Great.
-l've fought aliens my whole life.

626
01:07:28,181 --> 01:07:31,811
About time l busted up a few of them.
Face to face.

627
01:07:31,986 --> 01:07:34,420
They're not aliens. They're spiders!

628
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:37,649
Those of you without weapons,
arm yourselves...

629
01:07:37,826 --> 01:07:42,821
...with anything that you can dig up.
Then we'll meet back here.

630
01:07:45,802 --> 01:07:46,962
Norman?

631
01:07:48,104 --> 01:07:50,665
-Show me the way to the roof.
-where?

632
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:54,004
-The roof, Norman!
-The roof. The roof !

633
01:08:27,116 --> 01:08:29,243
-How's it looking?
-Roof's clear.

634
01:08:29,485 --> 01:08:30,782
Be careful, chris.

635
01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:33,320
Thanks, Sam.

636
01:08:33,858 --> 01:08:38,228
l've been trying to say something
to you, so l'll just say it.

637
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:42,264
-okay, take these. You'll need them.
-Perfume?

638
01:08:42,434 --> 01:08:47,463
Spiders have a developed sense of
smell. The perfume could confuse them.

639
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:52,578
-Great. we die, we die smelling nice.
-Nobody is dying, okay?

640
01:09:11,501 --> 01:09:14,163
That's the one who busted up
my trailer!

641
01:09:14,337 --> 01:09:16,898
l bet you he's their leader.

642
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:42,193
come on.

643
01:09:45,674 --> 01:09:48,166
-You have the phone?
-l thought you did.

644
01:09:48,344 --> 01:09:50,005
You said you had it.

645
01:09:50,313 --> 01:09:52,782
Yeah, l got it. Sorry.

646
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:54,677
l got confused.

647
01:10:22,984 --> 01:10:24,009
Damn it.

648
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:46,037
-l got a signal!
-Great. Now, how about dialing?

649
01:10:46,778 --> 01:10:48,246
911 emergency.

650
01:10:48,414 --> 01:10:52,373
l'm calling from Prosperity, Arizona.
My name is chris Mccormack.

651
01:10:52,752 --> 01:10:57,053
l know how this sounds, but believe me.
lt's the truth.

652
01:10:57,224 --> 01:11:02,629
our town is being attacked by giant
spiders. we need military intervention.

653
01:11:02,797 --> 01:11:05,698
-This is not Dial-a-Joke.
-This is not a crank.

654
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,927
-I'm hanging up on you.
-Don't hang up. Please!

655
01:11:09,104 --> 01:11:11,004
lt's an invasion!

656
01:11:11,173 --> 01:11:13,972
They're here! They're here!

657
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:16,806
That's what l've been telling you!

658
01:11:18,515 --> 01:11:21,451
l don't know if those gates will hold.

659
01:11:21,619 --> 01:11:23,416
l have to find wade.

660
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:26,954
Has anyone seen wade?

661
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:29,919
He went through a door back there.

662
01:11:30,095 --> 01:11:33,088
Between the Sewing center
and the cinemaplex?

663
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:36,599
He's going into the mines
through the storage room.

664
01:11:36,769 --> 01:11:40,672
Take everyone who's hurt and the kids
to that storage room.

665
01:11:40,841 --> 01:11:43,605
Norman, show them.
Now! Go!

666
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:51,042
Here we go!

667
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:01,893
Get ready.

668
01:12:04,368 --> 01:12:08,429
-Get ready!
-oh, yeah!

669
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:47,645
Got one!

670
01:12:55,294 --> 01:12:58,662
Everybody get to the basement, now!
Hurry!

671
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,481
Pete, come on!

672
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:56,560
Go, Sam! Get downstairs!
l'll find another way out!

673
01:14:00,237 --> 01:14:01,431
Guys, go!

674
01:14:22,929 --> 01:14:24,362
come on!

675
01:14:28,202 --> 01:14:30,136
-lt's locked!
-what?

676
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:33,502
He must have locked it.
we're trapped.

677
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:28,135
Get back! You eight-legged freaks!

678
01:15:28,305 --> 01:15:31,832
-My God! There's so many!
-Harlan, get up here!

679
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:35,708
l'm afraid of heights.

680
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:40,277
Heights? Are you afraid of spiders?!

681
01:15:42,688 --> 01:15:45,852
-come on, Harlan!
-l'll try to lead them away.

682
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:47,184
You'll what?

683
01:15:47,361 --> 01:15:49,693
Defend the human race.

684
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:54,498
what are you, insane?

685
01:16:02,845 --> 01:16:06,441
You'll never get that anal probe
near me!

686
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,444
Harlan, no!

687
01:16:26,906 --> 01:16:29,740
You know what?
Let's just go back inside.

688
01:16:30,244 --> 01:16:31,404
Locked.

689
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,011
Plan B?

690
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:39,083
l tell you what.
we're just gonna run away.

691
01:16:39,254 --> 01:16:40,380
Yeah?

692
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:41,955
okay.

693
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,589
Bret?

694
01:17:44,096 --> 01:17:45,256
wade?

695
01:17:45,664 --> 01:17:48,656
-what are you doing here?
-l can't find my way out.

696
01:17:48,834 --> 01:17:52,134
You won't believe me, but
l've been chased by giant spiders.

697
01:17:52,305 --> 01:17:53,829
Down here?

698
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:58,911
A second ago they were right behind me,
but l think l lost them.

699
01:18:02,518 --> 01:18:04,076
No, you didn't.

700
01:18:05,487 --> 01:18:07,148
Go! Go, go!

701
01:18:33,987 --> 01:18:35,318
Sam!

702
01:18:35,556 --> 01:18:38,855
-chris, where are you?
-Sam, l'm up here!

703
01:18:39,227 --> 01:18:41,718
what the hell are you doing up there?

704
01:18:41,896 --> 01:18:45,298
-Just chilling. Get me out of here!
-Back up.

705
01:18:48,537 --> 01:18:51,438
wait. You push and l'll pull.

706
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,668
Ashley?

707
01:19:50,142 --> 01:19:51,439
Mom?

708
01:19:52,778 --> 01:19:55,179
wade locked the door.

709
01:20:01,722 --> 01:20:05,283
-They're all around us!
-Everybody hide. Take cover!

710
01:20:12,468 --> 01:20:13,799
Bret?

711
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:15,801
Behind you!

712
01:20:35,695 --> 01:20:38,358
-Bret?
-Ashley.

713
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:43,036
-we better hurry!
-Everybody, let's move. come on!

714
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:47,064
lnto the mines. Hurry!

715
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,471
There's gotta be flashlights
or something.

716
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,442
Grab one of these.

717
01:20:55,618 --> 01:20:59,349
cool, a miner's helmet.
l always wanted to try one.

718
01:21:04,028 --> 01:21:09,433
-can you lead these people out of here?
-You bet. come on, everybody! Let's go.

719
01:21:21,615 --> 01:21:22,980
This should hold him.

720
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,014
l hope.

721
01:21:31,259 --> 01:21:32,887
How do we get out?

722
01:21:33,062 --> 01:21:38,466
we follow the power lines to a
generator. They're always near an exit.

723
01:21:39,336 --> 01:21:42,737
-come on! Not that way. Hurry!
-This way.

724
01:21:42,973 --> 01:21:44,497
Follow the kid!

725
01:21:46,444 --> 01:21:47,775
Hurry up!

726
01:21:48,312 --> 01:21:52,306
You went back for that?
Lose that thing. lt'll slow us down!

727
01:21:52,484 --> 01:21:55,681
This saved my ass so many times today!

728
01:21:59,926 --> 01:22:01,291
what's that smell?

729
01:22:01,461 --> 01:22:03,122
wasn't me.

730
01:22:03,964 --> 01:22:05,989
Methane gas. A lot of it.

731
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,327
Listen up!

732
01:22:07,601 --> 01:22:11,868
The slightest spark or an open flame
can blow us all to hell.

733
01:22:12,774 --> 01:22:15,607
So be careful. Let's go.

734
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:20,779
cables lead to a generator.
Follow the cables.

735
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,110
cables.

736
01:22:22,286 --> 01:22:24,220
way to a generator.

737
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:27,623
You guys!

738
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:29,657
lt's this way!

739
01:22:32,664 --> 01:22:36,931
Follow the cables.
The cables lead to a generator.

740
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,860
Follow the cables.

741
01:23:03,366 --> 01:23:06,165
Norman! Somebody save him!

742
01:23:09,206 --> 01:23:12,973
No gunfire! No gunfire!
lt will set off the gas!

743
01:23:17,182 --> 01:23:18,650
catch!

744
01:23:27,861 --> 01:23:31,559
come on, hurry!
lnto the tunnel. Follow the cables.

745
01:23:31,733 --> 01:23:33,098
Let's go!

746
01:23:38,908 --> 01:23:40,375
People, hold on!

747
01:23:41,477 --> 01:23:43,207
what the hell is this?

748
01:23:45,148 --> 01:23:47,207
-what's going on?
-l don't know.

749
01:23:47,384 --> 01:23:51,116
That spider back there,
was that the female?

750
01:23:51,289 --> 01:23:53,757
No. That was just another male.

751
01:23:53,925 --> 01:23:57,521
The female is three times as big.

752
01:23:57,696 --> 01:24:00,563
So she's probably still close by,
right?

753
01:24:00,732 --> 01:24:02,633
Yeah, l'd say so.

754
01:24:02,802 --> 01:24:06,898
Go back with your sister.
Go back with your sister!

755
01:24:11,578 --> 01:24:13,546
-why are you here?
-Mom sent me.

756
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,149
-why?
-You don't want to know.

757
01:24:21,257 --> 01:24:24,954
we have to do it.
lt's the only way out.

758
01:24:27,798 --> 01:24:29,356
oh, my God.

759
01:24:31,335 --> 01:24:32,860
what the hell?

760
01:24:41,347 --> 01:24:42,336
what is it?

761
01:24:45,352 --> 01:24:47,047
l think it's alive.

762
01:24:51,492 --> 01:24:53,187
Don't touch it.

763
01:24:54,495 --> 01:24:56,395
Don't....

764
01:25:04,707 --> 01:25:06,470
lt's wade.

765
01:25:06,642 --> 01:25:09,544
Bret, just go, okay? Just go.

766
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:13,416
Let's get him down.

767
01:25:19,924 --> 01:25:21,551
wade.

768
01:25:22,028 --> 01:25:24,588
-l don't feel so hot.
-Hold on a second.

769
01:25:45,621 --> 01:25:48,853
Look at the size of that!

770
01:25:55,099 --> 01:25:57,727
what the hell is this place, Mike?

771
01:25:57,902 --> 01:26:01,498
-lt looks like an orb weaver den.
-Get us out of here.

772
01:26:01,673 --> 01:26:03,163
-l can't.
-why not?

773
01:26:03,341 --> 01:26:07,176
ls there a chance that Gladys
is still alive?

774
01:26:07,346 --> 01:26:10,179
-lt's possible.
-Are you crazy?

775
01:26:10,383 --> 01:26:13,547
You'll have to get out without me.
Follow the wires.

776
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,188
There's a shed outside
with a generator.

777
01:26:16,356 --> 01:26:19,190
-Start it quickly.
-what are you up to?

778
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,123
l got an idea.

779
01:26:25,768 --> 01:26:28,396
l get it. Everybody, come on.

780
01:26:28,571 --> 01:26:31,040
Follow the cables. This way. come on.

781
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:33,768
-Bret, l'll need your bike.
-My bike?

782
01:26:33,977 --> 01:26:37,709
-Just do it.
-All right, kids, come on.

783
01:26:37,882 --> 01:26:41,113
Leave it there. l've been trying
to say this for a while.

784
01:26:41,419 --> 01:26:45,823
-Now?
-Yes, l may not get another chance.

785
01:26:45,991 --> 01:26:49,018
-l should've said this a long time ago.
-l know.

786
01:26:49,195 --> 01:26:51,720
You beat up my ex because you found
out he was cheating.

787
01:26:51,898 --> 01:26:54,526
You couldn't tell me because
you didn't want to break up my family.

788
01:26:54,701 --> 01:26:56,567
And you've always loved me.

789
01:26:56,737 --> 01:27:00,366
And if you'd said something,
maybe our lives would be different.

790
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:02,066
Exactly.

791
01:27:02,244 --> 01:27:04,405
Your father told me.

792
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:05,841
My dad told you?

793
01:27:06,014 --> 01:27:09,280
Now, get moving so you can
make it up to me later.

794
01:27:10,453 --> 01:27:11,886
Go on.

795
01:27:12,788 --> 01:27:14,484
That was easy.

796
01:27:24,135 --> 01:27:25,466
Gladys.

797
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,955
This way. Follow me. come on.

798
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:03,470
Breathe.

799
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,257
You're alive.

800
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:17,753
You look like an angel.

801
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:20,797
All that gold.

802
01:28:21,803 --> 01:28:23,566
Gold?

803
01:28:23,738 --> 01:28:25,262
Right behind you.

804
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:30,443
The Agua Mesa lode.
He found it.

805
01:28:35,418 --> 01:28:37,409
we need to find the generator.

806
01:28:37,587 --> 01:28:40,489
Mark, get everybody
away from the mines.

807
01:28:40,658 --> 01:28:43,786
Hurry up. Get away from the mines.
Get up there.

808
01:28:43,961 --> 01:28:47,762
Mom, what about that one?
come on.

809
01:29:02,616 --> 01:29:04,607
l knew he wasn't crazy.

810
01:29:10,325 --> 01:29:12,021
what are you doing?

811
01:29:12,194 --> 01:29:14,526
No, no. No smoking.

812
01:29:14,797 --> 01:29:16,856
we gotta get out of here.

813
01:29:26,077 --> 01:29:27,271
Stand back.

814
01:29:27,979 --> 01:29:30,949
Shoot it! Shoot it!

815
01:29:31,216 --> 01:29:33,980
l'll set off the gas! l can't!

816
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,149
Get back.

817
01:29:51,873 --> 01:29:54,501
Mike, you saved us.

818
01:29:57,947 --> 01:29:59,744
l need this more than you.

819
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:16,801
-Damn it. why isn't it working?
-lt needs fuel.

820
01:30:17,603 --> 01:30:20,164
-See?
-All right, find gas tanks.

821
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:23,366
Anything you can find.
we need gasoline.

822
01:30:26,981 --> 01:30:28,949
Hurry! Hurry!

823
01:30:30,084 --> 01:30:33,816
-what are you doing?
-lt'll set off the gas.

824
01:30:39,162 --> 01:30:40,459
Hurry!

825
01:30:54,913 --> 01:30:59,851
-All the gas cans are empty.
-we just need one electrical surge.

826
01:31:00,186 --> 01:31:03,020
Keep looking, everybody.
Don't give up.

827
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:07,718
Here, will this work?

828
01:31:08,829 --> 01:31:10,991
Ashley, you're a genius.

829
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:35,291
Switch. Put this on.

830
01:31:40,733 --> 01:31:41,859
Mom, it worked.

831
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:07,761
Adios, consuela.

832
01:32:09,666 --> 01:32:10,895
Fire!

833
01:32:36,031 --> 01:32:38,363
Aunt Gladys, are you okay?

834
01:32:51,615 --> 01:32:54,744
Not my mall. Not my mall.

835
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:59,218
Not the mall. Please, not the mall.

836
01:33:06,098 --> 01:33:08,397
l hope the insurance pays for this.

837
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:29,952
Let's go! Let's go!

838
01:33:30,126 --> 01:33:33,255
l thought you said 911
didn't believe you.

839
01:33:33,531 --> 01:33:34,657
They didn't.

840
01:33:34,832 --> 01:33:36,925
They listen to my broadcast.

841
01:33:37,168 --> 01:33:38,659
we never miss a show.

842
01:33:38,837 --> 01:33:42,000
we drove from Tucson.
lt sounded like you needed help.

843
01:33:42,174 --> 01:33:44,143
where are the aliens?

844
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:48,610
How many times do l have to tell you?
They're not aliens, okay?

845
01:33:48,781 --> 01:33:52,878
They're spiders who grew
because they ingested toxic waste.

846
01:33:53,053 --> 01:33:55,681
That's a more believable explanation.

847
01:33:55,856 --> 01:34:00,055
l had to drag that barrel out
of the water. l got covered in it.

848
01:34:00,228 --> 01:34:03,062
-And your point is?
-Point?

849
01:34:03,232 --> 01:34:09,001
See this? All brand new. Brand new
growth. check it out. Brand new.

850
01:34:09,172 --> 01:34:10,833
Are you all right?

851
01:34:11,008 --> 01:34:13,636
-Do you smoke?
-No.

852
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:14,971
Good.

853
01:34:15,647 --> 01:34:20,346
Dangerous habit. Disgusting. causes
explosions. wish l'd never started.

854
01:34:20,752 --> 01:34:25,816
-Any more people down in those mines?
-My aunt was the only one alive.

855
01:34:25,991 --> 01:34:29,587
l checked the other cocoons,
but nobody made it.

856
01:34:29,763 --> 01:34:33,130
we got cocoons! Told you
it would be worth the ride!

857
01:34:33,299 --> 01:34:35,461
Glad you came back home?

858
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:39,874
Yeah, l am.

859
01:34:40,909 --> 01:34:42,399
Me too.

860
01:34:43,078 --> 01:34:47,072
That is the story of how the aliens
attacked our sleepy town.

861
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:50,617
To this day, people refuse to believe
what happened here.

862
01:34:50,787 --> 01:34:54,383
They'd lead you to believe
l would embellish this story.

863
01:34:54,558 --> 01:34:56,958
But we know the truth.

864
01:34:57,127 --> 01:35:00,325
Two things l forgot to tell you.

865
01:35:00,498 --> 01:35:04,902
one: They never did get that probe
near me.

866
01:35:05,071 --> 01:35:10,031
And two: As far as chris Mccormack
reopening the gold mines...

867
01:35:10,209 --> 01:35:13,509
...and putting everyone
back to work....

868
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:16,240
well, that, my friends...

869
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:19,318
...is another story altogether.

870
01:39:12,591 --> 01:39:13,580
