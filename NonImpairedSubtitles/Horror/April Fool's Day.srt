1
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,683
Go. Go!

2
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,487
Oh. Um. Hi.

3
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,656
Uh. My name is Mary O'Reilly
O'Toole O'Shea. And. Uh...

4
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,632
Don't be nervous.

5
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:39,661
Somewhere out there
is the island my friend Muffy owns.

6
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,764
It's spring break...

7
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,832
and she's invited us
over there for the weekend.

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,844
- And...
- Uh-huh.

9
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:49,473
We're waiting for the ferry now
to take us there. And...

10
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,780
I don't know what else to say.

11
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:59,223
Well. Why don't you tell us
something about yourself?

12
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,159
Oh. All right.
Something about myself.

13
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,958
Yeah.

14
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,363
I want to work
with handicapped children.

15
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,461
And my parents are my best friends.

16
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,998
Oh. And I start convent school
next semester...

17
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,440
and I fuck on the first date.

18
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,448
April Fool's.

19
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,984
Well. Nikki.
baby. You're outrageous!

20
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,577
Ha. Now get out of here.
you knucklehead.

21
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,557
All right.
Uh. Kit. Kit. How about you?

22
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:37,358
- Uh. Pass.
- Uh. Arch. Skip. Where are you?

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,298
- Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Yeah.
- Come on. Help me out.

24
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:46,236
Yeah. Sure. Uh-huh.
I fuck on the first date.

25
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,740
Didn't we? We did.
On the first date.

26
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,743
- Didn't we. Honey? He's an animal.
- Get off of me.

27
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,979
Oh. Shit!

28
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,542
Need any help down there?

29
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,784
No. Clara. Thanks. I'm just trying
some last minute straightening up.

30
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,759
God. I don't think
I've worked so hard in my life.

31
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,797
- Ow.
- Sure you don't want me to stay?

32
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,801
There'll be nobody to help till the
first ferry back Monday. You know.

33
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,396
No. Clara. You're a peach.
This one's mine.

34
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,839
I told my father I'd do it.
and I will. My way.

35
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,844
We don't want him
to have any excuses.

36
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,847
All right then.
Have a nice party.

37
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,284
Nice?

38
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,378
It's gonna be better than nice.

39
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,514
It's gonna be
bloody unforgettable.

40
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:39,857
Good luck.

41
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,964
Here comes the ferry.

42
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,961
- Come on.
- I call shotgun.

43
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,272
- Is this the St. John house ferry?
- Yeah. Any second now.

44
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,149
Oh. Thank goodness. I didn't know
if I was on the right road or not.

45
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,552
Here. Let me help you. Kit Graham.

46
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,284
- Nan Youngblood.
- Hi. And that's Nikki Brashears.

47
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,556
Are you planning
on staying a while?

48
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,119
Um. No. It's just some...

49
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,167
Some work for finals
when we get back.

50
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,260
- I'm so far behind.
- Hi. How's it going?

51
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,737
- I got it. Hi. Arch Cummings.
- Hi. Nan.

52
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,899
- I've seen you around. Jewett Hall?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,944
Chaz Vyshinsky.
You've got great legs.

54
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,674
Chaz. Now that she
already has her bags...

55
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,547
I only met Muffy this term
in Drama Society.

56
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,112
I volunteered to do their costumes.

57
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,351
I like to sew.

58
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,485
- Did you see her in Ghosts?
- No.

59
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,554
Oh. She was wonderful.
She's so talented.

60
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,566
Yeah. She is.

61
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,122
Guy. Your fly is open...

62
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,284
and your Hostess Twinkie
is hanging out.

63
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,294
Huh?

64
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,192
Come on if you're coming.

65
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,327
Um. Excuse me. Sir. But
we're still waiting for someone...

66
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,100
This is Friday... my last run
of the week. I don't get overtime.

67
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,972
But you have to wait because
this is the only way over...

68
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,375
and if he misses this one.
then how is he sup...

69
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,725
Wait up!

70
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,161
Go. Go. Go. Go!

71
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,927
Sorry. Guys.
Nik. Chaz. Hi.

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,934
- Rob Ferris. Hi.
- Hi.

73
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,165
Whoa! Hi.
Harvey Hal Edison. Jr.

74
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:57,642
But call me Hal. Only my folks call
me Harve. And I can't stand it.

75
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,644
Uh. Sure is a pretty spot here.
isn't it?

76
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,740
You're friends
with Muffy St. John?

77
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,808
Sure am.
We sit together in Econ 345.

78
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,684
I let her copy
my marginal utility curves.

79
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,121
Oh. I get it.
That's a joke!

80
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:16,025
- Harve...
- Hal! Springsteen! Still the Boss!

81
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,092
Okay. Let's go.
We don't have all day.

82
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,936
You all. Uh. Buddies?

83
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,767
Except for Skip and Nan.
They only just met.

84
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,466
But we will be.

85
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,101
Careful what you say to him.
though. He's Muffy's cousin.

86
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,203
- Oh. No kidding!
- Distant.

87
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,047
Over the horizon. Otherwise.
I wouldn't have been invited.

88
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,313
Old money never mixes
family with friends.

89
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,356
This is true.
for as long as I've known her.

90
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,857
Or to protect her family.
I guess.

91
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,326
No. To keep her friends.

92
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,727
Choose your weapons. Big guy.

93
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,357
- Hey. Hey. What's this?
- You up for a game of stretch?

94
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,596
- Okay.
- Skip. Your fly is open.

95
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,604
Eat it.

96
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,007
Ah. Rob.

97
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,669
Your fly is open.

98
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,512
Okay. Don't believe me.

99
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,517
Oh. Nice.

100
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,519
We're off.

101
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,053
Bye.

102
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,495
First round. The champ!

103
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:07,762
You know what I find amazing?
Muffy's her real name.

104
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,767
I mean. My name's Harvey.
but they call me Hal.

105
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:12,804
So I figured Muffy must stand
for something... Muffin?

106
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:17,365
Muff-child. Moffo.
the Muffster. Muff'n' stuff.

107
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,377
Muff dive.

108
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:30,321
Hi. What are you reading?

109
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:32,880
Uh. Milton's Paradise Lost.

110
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,518
For Professor Russo's course
in English epic.

111
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,757
- Hmm.
- You know. It's a shame.

112
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,697
- It's a dying form.
- Dying.

113
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,828
Not too many people read it
nowadays. Even in college.

114
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:49,738
Really?

115
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:51,469
What about you?

116
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:55,206
Oh. Treasure island. The history
of pornography in America.

117
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:59,112
Kit. I'm a state university boy.

118
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:01,675
I don't have the perks like some
of you private college kids do.

119
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:03,186
Don't give me that.

120
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,485
First. I'm hoping to interview
with her daddy's company...

121
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:08,526
southern regional sales.
next year before graduation.

122
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:11,893
You know. He's worth more than
50 million over the counter.

123
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,728
But I don't think that's why
she invited me. Do you?

124
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,936
I mean. My God.
we're not going to be sheltered...

125
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,939
little college kids our whole life.

126
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:24,271
Wake up. Smell the bacon. Nan.

127
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:33,708
It's research
that I can do all on my own.

128
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:35,343
And this is the best part.

129
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,718
I never get tired of it.

130
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,725
You wanna take a look?

131
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,833
Bruce's car was in the shop.

132
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:59,968
- I mean. It was really...
- But that's not my point.

133
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:02,070
Fuck!

134
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:03,944
Oh. My God!

135
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:12,089
We're gonna spend a weekend there?

136
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,891
What are you. A fucking wimp?

137
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:22,763
Hey. I'm really
not that interested anymore.

138
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:25,667
Come on. Man. Just one more!
Double or nothing!

139
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:28,035
Here. Enough's enough.

140
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:30,734
- Oh. What? What are you. Scared?
- Hey. I said give it a rest!

141
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,436
Oh. Fuck!

142
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:40,251
I'll get him. I'll get him.

143
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:49,451
- Where is he. Guys?
- Where is he?

144
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:57,201
What you looking for?

145
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,171
We got 'em!
Oh. Yeah. Did we nail 'em!

146
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,231
Ha. Ha. Ha. April Fool's.
Very funny.

147
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:07,608
What's wrong with you? Somebody
could have gotten hurt out there.

148
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,740
Oh. At least we don't go for
"this shoelace is untied" crap.

149
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:14,149
You know that.

150
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,448
Oh. Great! Shit!

151
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,885
Okay. Buck.
Come on out of there.

152
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,894
Come on.
I'm gonna need some help up here.

153
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:26,055
No. No.
I'll just do it from here.

154
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:27,496
Throw me the line.

155
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:30,967
- This one?
- That's the one. That'll work.

156
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:33,596
Thank you.

157
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:36,004
Some hero you turned out to be.

158
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:38,702
I took off my jacket and shoes.
What do you want from me?

159
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,836
There were three guys in the water.

160
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,847
- I'm only kidding.
- Nikki. Can we borrow your towel?

161
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:47,749
Yeah.

162
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,485
You guys got to admit
it was a hell of a trick.

163
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:55,992
- I loved it.
- Unforgettable.

164
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,544
Buck. Iook out!

165
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:37,596
- Oh. Shit!
- Call a medic!

166
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:44,407
Calm him down!

167
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,542
- We gotta get him to a doctor!
- Cal!

168
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,952
- Cal!
- The boat!

169
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,545
The boat!

170
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:59,647
Calm him down!

171
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:08,656
They did it! They did it!

172
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:19,409
What's going on?
Sam. What happened?

173
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:24,479
Tricks. Pranks.
Ask your friends.

174
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,780
- Is your dad around?
- No. He's in Sutton Place. Why?

175
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:31,949
You haven't heard from him
or anyone else?

176
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:34,821
Uh. Iook. I'm gonna have to borrow
your boat to get back to shore.

177
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,586
We keep all the keys on a board
in the kitchen.

178
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:41,154
But I think there's an extra one
underneath the cushion there.

179
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:46,869
Look. You people.

180
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:49,406
Stay put. All of you.

181
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:51,942
If anything else happens
or if anything happens to Buck...

182
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,477
I wanna know where to find you.

183
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,654
Skip. It's not your fault.

184
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:06,122
It was an accident.
You didn't know.

185
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,353
Sure. Did you see his face?

186
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:18,632
Muffy. Nothing bad
ever happens to her.

187
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,210
Well. There's an awful lot
to be done with this place.

188
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,748
- You sound as if you own it.
- I will.

189
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:34,683
If all goes well.
next month. When I turn 2 1...

190
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:36,721
it's my first stage
of inheritance.

191
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,813
First stage?
What's your second?

192
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,826
Taxes. You may be talking
to your future boss. Harve.

193
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,521
Nikki...

194
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:48,657
burn my bags. Baby.

195
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:51,065
I am home!

196
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,697
Oh. Yeah!
I could get really used to this.

197
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:58,436
We used to spend all our summers
here before my mother died.

198
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,671
This is a very special place
to me.

199
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:02,713
It's like a dream.

200
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,045
On a clear day.
you can see the Kennedys.

201
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:08,517
Wow! You guys. Iook at this.

202
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:17,759
Oh. Muffers!
Our very own place settings...

203
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,593
with our very own place cards...

204
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,463
and a his and her little dolly!

205
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:27,130
- It's just like in Agatha Christie.
- And sporks!

206
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:30,663
- "Sporks"?
- And napkins with bunnies on 'em.

207
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:33,210
Gee. Muff.
you really spared no expense.

208
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,212
Well. Now how do you think Daddy
made his money?

209
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,805
The old-fashioned way...
he inherited it.

210
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:40,248
I used to have
all of her outfits.

211
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:42,650
Hold it!
Now don't anybody move...

212
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:45,986
but before this night is over.
somebody in this room...

213
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:51,255
will pull his wang.

214
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:58,529
"My first experience was. 'A. '
painful and degrading...

215
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:01,401
"'B. ' not so hot.
but I really cared about him...

216
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:03,964
"'C. ' I was ready to try again...

217
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:08,809
or 'D. ' wildly exciting...
I had an orgasm."

218
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:14,407
"A" and part of"B."

219
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:18,582
"Painful and degrading." "Not so
hot. But I really cared about him."

220
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:23,023
Aw. That's so sweet!

221
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,159
I'll take "B."

222
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,324
"Not so hot.
but I really cared about him."

223
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,698
Was it Rob?

224
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:33,294
Uh. No. It wasn't Rob.

225
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:35,362
Uh. What about you. Nikki?

226
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,931
Um. "A" and "D"...

227
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:41,376
"Painful and degrading." "Wildly
exciting... I had an orgasm."

228
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:43,573
What can I say? Uh...

229
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:45,741
Anyway. "The one thing
I haven't tried yet...

230
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:49,947
"but am intensely curious about is:

231
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:52,888
"'A. ' oral sex...

232
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:56,449
"'B. ' anal entry...

233
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:59,190
"'C. ' S and M. 'D. ' group sex...

234
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:05,032
'E. ' lesbian sex
or 'F. ' all of the above."

235
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:09,172
What was "C"?

236
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,869
Hi. My name is Mary O'Toole
O'Reilly O'Shea...

237
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:17,278
and I want to go to convent
school and things like that.

238
00:19:17,348 --> 00:19:20,215
Welcome. Welcome to my home...

239
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,379
and lifestyles
of the rich and undeserving.

240
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:26,549
Uh. My name is Arch Cummings.
and I'm on a mission here.

241
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:31,391
I'm on a mission to bed as many
women as humanly possible.

242
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,057
Nan's out. To be honest.

243
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,464
Uh. She likes the theater...

244
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:38,096
and. Well.
you know what I'm saying.

245
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:42,256
She's out of first round draft
choices. If you know what I mean.

246
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:58,239
Poor boy can say.
"Fuck you. Dad.

247
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:02,341
I'm my own person."

248
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:06,941
What's his father gonna do.
kick him out of the house?

249
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:09,953
Disinherit him?

250
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:11,955
His life won't have changed much.

251
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:17,085
He's got nothing to lose.

252
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:19,095
His father's love.

253
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:27,329
That was lost
a long. Long time ago.

254
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:34,139
Skip. Blaming yourself
won't make Buck any better.

255
00:21:36,414 --> 00:21:38,348
- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:44,715
- Ta-da!
- Boy. Muffy. You sure know...

257
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:47,553
how to make a guy look forward
to dessert.

258
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,559
Please. God.
let it be Ding-Dongs.

259
00:21:49,627 --> 00:21:53,256
St. John hospitality
taken to the extreme.

260
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:56,266
I think it's real friendly.
Makes me feel right at home.

261
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:58,996
How are we gonna feel
after these beans?

262
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:08,845
You guys!

263
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,606
Care for some beans?

264
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:49,143
I wonder how Buck's doing.

265
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,348
- Should call or something?
- I'll call later.

266
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:55,881
I'm sure he's getting the best
medical care available. Right?

267
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,394
You guys.
let's change the subject.

268
00:23:00,364 --> 00:23:02,832
Well. Uh...

269
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,666
Harve's got his job interview
all figured out.

270
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:08,705
What about the rest of us?
Does anyone know...

271
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:11,241
what they're gonna be doing
after graduation?

272
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:22,584
- Good choice. Arch.
- This is incredible.

273
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:26,054
Here we are.
privileged. Independent...

274
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:28,523
the hope for the future
right at this table.

275
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:32,255
None of us knows what we're gonna
do with the rest of our lives.

276
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,594
- Rob knows.
- Kit. Come on.

277
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,656
Rob is going to medical school.

278
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:38,827
No shit.
You got early acceptance?

279
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:41,030
We can talk about this
at some other time.

280
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:43,096
Why? You already had the meeting
with your counselor.

281
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:46,666
Kit. I don't think he wants to talk
about it in front of everybody.

282
00:23:46,744 --> 00:23:50,475
- No. No. I don't mind.
- We're all friends here. Right?

283
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:51,810
Sort of.

284
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,984
He said to forget it.

285
00:23:57,221 --> 00:24:00,782
He said that my grades
might be okay...

286
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:04,555
but. Well. Basically. I possess
an essential lack of seriousness.

287
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:06,562
And that's what they look for.

288
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,396
Him too? That's what my guy said.
I said. "You gotta be kidding.

289
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:13,904
"I mean. How can anyone
be serious about anything...

290
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:16,098
"when some moron can steal
a bomb or push a button...

291
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:19,165
and nuke us all
until our shadows glow?"

292
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:20,904
He wasn't impressed with that.
but...

293
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:27,878
Oh. What's this?
Dom Perignon sparkling rose?

294
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:29,879
Smells like Ripple.

295
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:31,979
You have outdone yourself again.
St. John.

296
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:34,388
Can I make a toast?

297
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:39,027
Well...

298
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:41,496
someone once said to me...

299
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:44,557
to cherish the friends
you make in college.

300
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:47,103
I try to cherish
all the friends I make.

301
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:50,504
- Stop it!
- Because...

302
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:54,374
they'll be the friends you cherish
most for the rest of your life.

303
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:59,382
So. Well. Here's to us.

304
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,315
And here's to my life...

305
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:03,319
because I'm very glad
to be here...

306
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:05,412
and to be a part of all of you.

307
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,722
Muffy. Anything
you want to add to that?

308
00:25:09,794 --> 00:25:11,762
Why me?

309
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:14,354
Because you're the hostess.

310
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:26,734
Okay. In his Life ofJohnson...

311
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:29,336
James Boswell said...

312
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:34,112
"We cannot predict the precise
moment when friendships are formed.

313
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:38,779
"As in filling a vessel.
drop by drop...

314
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:41,290
there is at last one
which makes it run over."

315
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,961
"So. In a series..."

316
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,966
"So. In a series of kindnesses...

317
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:54,403
"there is at last one...
which makes the heart run over.

318
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,674
"So. With his toast...

319
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:03,679
may our hearts run over
and our friendships be formed."

320
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:04,907
- All right.
- Oh. Cheers!

321
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:07,507
- Cheers!
- Going down.

322
00:26:10,054 --> 00:26:12,955
- Oh. My God!
- Oh. No!

323
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,593
April fool.

324
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:41,351
Wow. What is this.
the bridal suite?

325
00:26:41,418 --> 00:26:44,444
You like it?
I thought you needed the room.

326
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:46,456
I'll find a use for it.

327
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:55,429
Um. I know you and Arch had
something going before I met him.

328
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:58,366
Arch is sweet.
but he only has two expressions...

329
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:00,300
collar up and collar down.

330
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:02,305
Yeah. I found that out.

331
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:05,865
Um. Guess what I'm trying
to say now is...

332
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:10,342
Um. Well. You always seem
to get there first...

333
00:27:10,414 --> 00:27:12,382
but this time Chaz is mine. Okay?

334
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:14,041
What about Hal?

335
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:19,385
Harvey? Mr. Junior Achievement?
Oh. Please!

336
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:23,392
Yuck!

337
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,191
Don't try to tell me you hadn't
thought of me in that way. Muffy.

338
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:30,290
Why. I felt
the spark between us...

339
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:33,859
the very first time
we ever laid eyes on each other.

340
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:36,270
In Econ 345.

341
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:41,101
Why. Just think of it. Muffy.

342
00:27:41,178 --> 00:27:45,205
With my talent...

343
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:47,216
and your...

344
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:51,020
money...

345
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:59,552
All right. Ladies.

346
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,064
We're gonna have some privacy.

347
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:08,538
You gotta be kidding.

348
00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:13,543
Unless Muffy knows something
about us we don't.

349
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:15,636
Hold me. Big fella. Hold me!

350
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:18,273
Just holster it. Cowboy. Will ya?

351
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:22,115
Let's play hide the sausage.

352
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:23,744
Giddyap!

353
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:27,313
- Oh. Hold me like a man. General!
- Stop it!

354
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:30,588
Why. Just think of it. Muffers.

355
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:34,791
With my raw. Drivin' talent...

356
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:41,671
and your. Uh...

357
00:28:43,874 --> 00:28:45,808
And your...

358
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,970
Wrong room.

359
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:27,443
Shit.

360
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:12,331
Aw. Come on.

361
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:11,842
Are you still angry with me?

362
00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:15,885
About dinner?

363
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:18,447
No.

364
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:23,019
I'm sorry. I'm not angry at you.
I'm just angry.

365
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:15,437
Ow! Jesus!

366
00:33:26,293 --> 00:33:28,227
Very funny.

367
00:33:57,724 --> 00:34:00,591
Boo! Muffy.

368
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,254
Arch.

369
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,891
- Hi. Muff. Hi.
- Ah. Ah. Hmm.

370
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:10,403
Um. Do you know
what time it is. Iove?

371
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,870
- Mm-hmm!
- Oh. My God!

372
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:18,076
Good night.

373
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,092
Wait.

374
00:35:28,114 --> 00:35:29,308
Real funny. You guys!

375
00:35:31,317 --> 00:35:33,251
Better ride than you can give me!

376
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,168
Hello?

377
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:06,745
Shit.

378
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,348
Who's there?

379
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:26,421
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

380
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:28,433
Fuckin' cat.

381
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,429
Oh. God.

382
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,254
Mornin'.

383
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:32,393
I was having a nightmare about Buck.
and I don't know what to...

384
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:36,001
Good morning.

385
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,300
I was just hungry.

386
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:41,499
I must look a mess.

387
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:44,943
- Oh!
- Good morning. Muff.

388
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,945
I forgot to get dressed.

389
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:55,748
- So who made her night?
- I don't know.

390
00:38:58,191 --> 00:39:01,524
- Where's Skip?
- That depends what he's on.

391
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:04,358
- You guys have gotta be kidding.
- Bye-bye.

392
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,524
Hey. Nan.
Nan. What about it? Come on.

393
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,091
No. Thanks.

394
00:39:10,169 --> 00:39:13,104
Besides. I thought I'd wait
to see what Muffy wanted to do.

395
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:29,021
Chaz. Calm down!

396
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:31,283
- Whoa!
- He comes down with it!

397
00:39:31,357 --> 00:39:34,349
- I got it!
- No. That's my bad knee!

398
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:37,123
I got it! I got Nikki.
you get the ball.

399
00:39:42,735 --> 00:39:45,636
I've got her. She's covered.

400
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:50,808
Good one. Harve!
Good one. Harve!

401
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:55,947
Behind ya. Baby!

402
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,622
Hey. Rob. What's wrong?

403
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:33,757
I'm just thinking...

404
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,358
about that meeting
I had with my adviser.

405
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:40,038
I feel like I'm going nowhere.

406
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:42,631
He always said
you weren't serious enough.

407
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:47,875
Kit. Maybe it's crazy
you investing so much energy in me.

408
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:54,580
Oh. Yeah. Sure.
You feel this way about me now.

409
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:57,714
What about a year from now
when I'm a TV repairman.

410
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,816
All those other guys
up there are...

411
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:03,760
- You're right.
- I know. I told you. I'm right.

412
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,758
- You're right.
- I know.

413
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,960
I'm right.
I said I'm right.

414
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,265
- There's no question.
- I'm right.

415
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:15,273
You're a jerk.

416
00:41:17,176 --> 00:41:21,510
Huh! God. I am.

417
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:36,361
Wait a minute.

418
00:41:37,697 --> 00:41:39,631
Come here. Baby.

419
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:24,842
Skip. You son of a bitch!

420
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:34,079
Respectable young Quaker couple...

421
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:37,452
returning from quiet afternoon
of nonviolent sex.

422
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:39,218
So how was it?

423
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,452
Where's Skip?
Has anybody seen him?

424
00:42:41,527 --> 00:42:43,461
- Who wants to know?
- Goddamn it!

425
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:45,997
Can't you just give me
a straight answer?

426
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:49,228
We just saw him down at the
boathouse. Drifting by on a boat.

427
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:52,896
And he wasn't moving. He looked
dead. Unless he was joking...

428
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:55,463
- Well. If it was Skip...
- I saw his face. Chaz!

429
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:57,975
Look. Has anybody seen him
since last night?

430
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,849
Jesus Christ!

431
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,283
We'll look for him.
I'll go with you.

432
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:09,287
I'm coming too.

433
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,783
What's happening?

434
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:17,862
Is something wrong?

435
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,764
Skip? Hey. Asshole!

436
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:24,200
- Hey. Skip!
- Hey. Wait a minute.

437
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:27,972
Look at this.

438
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:31,042
Skip's knife.

439
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:36,572
Think it was that guy on the ferry?

440
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:39,948
I don't know.
Man. I don't know what to think.

441
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:41,953
I say we go looking for him.

442
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:43,955
Him or Skip.
One of'em has gotta be around here.

443
00:43:44,023 --> 00:43:46,116
- You mean split up?
- Let's not...

444
00:43:46,192 --> 00:43:49,252
No sucker's taking me in.

445
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:22,391
I know why you're avoiding me.

446
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:25,089
I guess it's your idea of a joke.

447
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:29,157
That's why you invited me here.
isn't it? Isn't it?

448
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:32,227
How did you find out.
from one of your preppy friends?

449
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:35,603
I don't know
what you're talking about.

450
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:40,441
Oh. You mean the tape
just got there. Just appeared?

451
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:44,881
You know.
I thought you wanted to be friends.

452
00:47:12,131 --> 00:47:14,065
Any sign of Skip?

453
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:17,766
No luck here.

454
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:21,328
- Well. Where's Arch?
- He was with you!

455
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:24,501
Shit! That's it.

456
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:28,307
I don't like this. I definitely
don't think I like this.

457
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,371
It's time to call the police.

458
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:33,543
8248. Constable Potter
has an office at his home.

459
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:36,611
- Come on.
- Who wants tea?

460
00:47:39,158 --> 00:47:41,092
It'll relax the nerves.

461
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:44,826
Is she kidding?

462
00:48:40,252 --> 00:48:42,584
I didn't know what kind
anybody would like...

463
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:45,020
so I brought them all.

464
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,752
Well. Here. Let me help you.
I'll get you some water.

465
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,031
Has he reached the constable?

466
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:56,897
We haven't been able to get
through to the mainland yet.

467
00:48:59,805 --> 00:49:03,002
- Oh!
- Oh. The main.

468
00:49:03,075 --> 00:49:06,533
- It's probably broken.
- There's no water?

469
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:08,773
- What's happening?
- There's no water!

470
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:12,749
- What?
- It happens sometimes.

471
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:15,309
But there's still the well.

472
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:18,288
Jesus. I'll go. Just point me
in the right direction.

473
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:20,291
Uh. Not without me.

474
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:29,462
I'm not worried about those two...

475
00:49:29,535 --> 00:49:31,730
Skip and Art.

476
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:36,433
They're probably playing
some kind of stupid trick.

477
00:49:39,111 --> 00:49:41,909
Yeah. Probably.

478
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:51,918
Is that it?

479
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:56,955
Boy. When she said well.
she really meant well.

480
00:49:57,029 --> 00:49:59,361
Who dug this thing. Pocahontas?

481
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:03,197
Oh. Here. Let me do that. I probably
have more experience than you.

482
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,239
You mean back home on the farm?

483
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,571
I know you think I'm a hick.

484
00:50:13,645 --> 00:50:16,705
I'd like to change your mind about
that if you'd give me a chance.

485
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:18,716
Why?

486
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:25,750
Because I would really like
to plow your field.

487
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:29,326
Draw me some water.

488
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,708
Oh. Crap!

489
00:50:36,842 --> 00:50:39,470
- What happened?
- I lost the bucket.

490
00:50:39,544 --> 00:50:41,136
Harve.

491
00:50:41,213 --> 00:50:44,944
Hal! And the rope was rotten.
Any fool could have seen that.

492
00:50:45,016 --> 00:50:46,483
You didn't.

493
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:48,849
Would you shine your light down
there so I can get a fix on it?

494
00:50:51,122 --> 00:50:54,683
- Oh!
- Nice going.

495
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:56,886
Okay. So I spazzed out.
Now we're even.

496
00:50:56,962 --> 00:50:59,055
Uh-huh. And what do we do now?

497
00:51:03,401 --> 00:51:06,837
Well. Iook. There are little rungs
leading down the side.

498
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:07,837
So?

499
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:11,637
- So you'd better get a move on.
- Are you crazy?

500
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,339
I don't relish spending the rest
of the weekend without water.

501
00:51:15,413 --> 00:51:18,712
Well. I'm not going down there.

502
00:51:18,783 --> 00:51:21,183
- Okay. Fine.
- Whoa. Whoa!

503
00:51:21,253 --> 00:51:24,689
- Wait a minute. What are you doing?
- What's it look like?

504
00:51:24,756 --> 00:51:26,690
Well. I don't think
you ought to do that.

505
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:28,692
Uh. Nikki? Nik...

506
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,694
Harvey. I'm a big girl now.

507
00:51:30,762 --> 00:51:34,027
I think I can handle
a few spiders and frogs.

508
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,267
Just be careful down there.
all right?

509
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:39,929
- Watch what you're doing.
- Watch what I'm doing.

510
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:42,872
That's a hot one.
I can barely see a thing.

511
00:51:44,543 --> 00:51:48,411
Well. Just watch out anyway. Okay?

512
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,415
Just be careful.

513
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:58,081
Nikki? Nikki! Hey. Answer me!

514
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,090
I'm fine. I'm fine.

515
00:52:20,779 --> 00:52:23,043
Help! Uh. Nikki!

516
00:52:23,114 --> 00:52:27,312
Nikki! Help! Answer me!

517
00:52:27,385 --> 00:52:30,411
Uh. Help! Rob! Kit! Help!

518
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,784
Nikki. Damn it! Answer me! Nikki!

519
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:39,562
Nikki! Shit!

520
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:52,233
Oh. My God!

521
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:55,245
Come on! Grab my hand!

522
00:52:55,313 --> 00:52:57,975
Nikki! Nikki! Come on.

523
00:52:59,484 --> 00:53:01,918
Come on! Come on! Reach!

524
00:53:01,987 --> 00:53:05,923
Damn it. Come on!
Come on! Come here!

525
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:10,224
Come on!

526
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,169
It's okay now.

527
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,104
With the others. They were outside.

528
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:25,108
But. You see. We're inside.
so we're safe now.

529
00:53:25,176 --> 00:53:28,668
It's all because of what happened
at the ferry. Isn't it?

530
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,181
It was an accident.
Christ. Don't they know that?

531
00:53:33,424 --> 00:53:36,985
Uh. Muffy.
where do you keep your guns?

532
00:53:37,061 --> 00:53:38,289
Guns?

533
00:53:39,363 --> 00:53:42,127
We don't keep guns in this house.

534
00:53:46,137 --> 00:53:48,662
- Here.
- God. Not the water!

535
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:51,640
It's all right. It's Perrier.

536
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:53,643
Here.

537
00:53:55,713 --> 00:53:57,305
Hello?

538
00:53:57,381 --> 00:54:00,942
Oh. Constable Potter.
Listen. Man. You gotta help us!

539
00:54:01,018 --> 00:54:03,282
Arch and Skip and Nan...

540
00:54:03,354 --> 00:54:06,289
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

541
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:10,727
That ain't possible.

542
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:14,162
And I'm telling you. I'm at the
hospital right now visiting Buck.

543
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:26,109
With Muffy?

544
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:33,850
What are you saying?

545
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:36,944
Yeah. All right.
all right. All right.

546
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:40,013
Look. Just please.
please get here. Okay?

547
00:54:44,495 --> 00:54:46,429
He's on his way.

548
00:54:46,497 --> 00:54:49,728
He wants us to wait here
and stay together.

549
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,200
- What about the ferryman?
- It wasn't him.

550
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:53,999
They've been together all day.

551
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:56,904
- What?
- I don't understand.

552
00:54:58,142 --> 00:55:01,009
I don't either.

553
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:03,808
Look. He's gonna send up a flare
as soon as he's nearing the dock.

554
00:55:03,881 --> 00:55:07,009
And then we go down as a group
and meet him there.

555
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,844
In the meantime.
we just wait here.

556
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:24,727
It's my father's study.

557
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:31,558
Oh. I just came in to make sure
that everything was secure.

558
00:56:31,635 --> 00:56:34,627
I had to lock those windows.

559
00:56:34,705 --> 00:56:37,105
Good idea.

560
00:56:37,174 --> 00:56:38,368
Sometimes...

561
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:41,138
with the tides.
it could take somebody...

562
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:44,044
all night to get here
from the mainland.

563
00:56:44,114 --> 00:56:48,517
And even then sometimes
they don't make it.

564
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:00,496
Yeah. Yeah.

565
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:33,926
What is taking him so long?

566
00:57:33,997 --> 00:57:37,057
Maybe it's the tides.

567
00:57:37,134 --> 00:57:41,161
Wait a minute. Aren't we supposed
to be staying together?

568
00:57:41,238 --> 00:57:42,933
What about Rob and Muffy?

569
00:57:43,006 --> 00:57:46,533
- Rob's out back checking the doors.
- Yeah. Well. What about Muffy?

570
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:49,608
She's been acting
less than normal anyway.

571
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,513
- What do you mean?
- All day and you haven't noticed?

572
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:55,278
- Well. Who isn't?
- Those are nurse's shoes.

573
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:57,286
What nurse's shoes?

574
00:57:57,354 --> 00:58:00,881
The clodhoppers she's been walking
around in today. Crepe soles?

575
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:05,486
Uh. She was arguing
with Nan in the hall...

576
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:08,656
before you and Rob
came back alone...

577
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:10,666
from the woods.

578
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:14,097
About something Nan found
in her room.

579
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:18,107
- Something...
- What?

580
00:58:18,175 --> 00:58:20,507
Something about an abortion.

581
00:58:22,512 --> 00:58:24,639
I found something in my room too.

582
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:29,346
- I don't think it was for me.
- Oh. Really?

583
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:32,582
- Oh. Fuck you. Chaz.
- What did you find?

584
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:35,991
I didn't find anything.

585
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:38,323
Uh-huh. And we're just
supposed to believe that. Right?

586
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:41,694
That's right. I spent
the night with Nikki. Harve.

587
00:58:41,765 --> 00:58:43,494
- What about you?
- What about me?

588
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:46,127
What's your little secret. Huh?

589
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:49,502
- What are you talking about?
- Oh. Come on. Sporto.

590
00:58:49,573 --> 00:58:52,770
I came into your room. You were
jumping like your ass was on fire.

591
00:58:52,843 --> 00:58:57,371
That was nothing! Some newspaper
clippings of some car accidents.

592
00:58:57,447 --> 00:58:58,709
Nothing personal in that?

593
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:02,274
- Who hasn't had a car accident?
- I haven't.

594
00:59:02,352 --> 00:59:03,683
Knock it off. Chaz!

595
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:17,657
What I wanna know is. How did Muffy
find out about this stuff and...

596
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:20,464
Stop it!
Just stop it. You guys!

597
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:23,404
What's wrong with us?
What happened to our talk...

598
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:26,909
about friendship
and undying loyalty?

599
00:59:26,977 --> 00:59:29,707
Do you know what we're saying?
We're actually sitting here...

600
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,272
discussing the possibility that
Muffy. A good friend of ours...

601
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,910
has invited us
all here this weekend to...

602
00:59:42,793 --> 00:59:44,624
I'm going upstairs.

603
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:47,219
Muffy. Listen.
we should all stay together.

604
00:59:48,532 --> 00:59:51,000
This is my home.

605
00:59:51,068 --> 00:59:53,935
I'll be in my room.

606
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:12,586
She does have a point there. We're
getting on each other's nerves.

607
01:00:12,662 --> 01:00:17,429
As long as we all just stay within
shoutin' distance of each other.

608
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,967
Are you coming?

609
01:00:26,643 --> 01:00:28,543
I'm gonna find a way
up to the attic.

610
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:29,805
Why?

611
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:33,110
I can probably see the constable
better from up there.

612
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:36,584
It's all right.
I can keep watch on the stairs.

613
01:01:13,189 --> 01:01:15,783
- Nikki. Come on.
- "Nikki. Come on."

614
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:18,384
Don't give me any of this
"Nikki. Come on."

615
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:22,762
- What are you doin'?
- What does it look like I'm doin'?

616
01:01:22,832 --> 01:01:24,356
Look. Stay if you like.

617
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:27,369
Lock your door.
dig a trench. Hang out.

618
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:29,928
But once I leave this place.
I'm never coming back.

619
01:01:31,141 --> 01:01:33,006
We were supposed to all
stay together.

620
01:01:33,076 --> 01:01:35,010
Oh. Yeah.
that has been real effective!

621
01:01:35,078 --> 01:01:37,410
What are you...
So what are you gonna do?

622
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,142
Waltz down to the end
of the pier by yourself?

623
01:01:40,216 --> 01:01:42,241
Check your bags
with the porter and wait...

624
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:45,344
for a stray ocean liner
to happen by and pick you up?

625
01:01:50,193 --> 01:01:54,459
I can't stay here anymore.

626
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:56,931
What if the constable
never even shows?

627
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,595
Then I'll swim all the way back
to the mainland if I have to!

628
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,138
Okay. You relax.

629
01:02:03,206 --> 01:02:06,403
Oh. Great. Three people are dead.
and you are telling me to relax.

630
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:08,876
Nikki. Just wait a minute.
Okay. Nikki? Look at me.

631
01:02:09,746 --> 01:02:12,442
Nikki. Iook at me!

632
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:16,851
Okay. I know you've
been through a lot.

633
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,980
We have all been through a lot.

634
01:02:20,056 --> 01:02:22,547
Now. Am I nervous? Yes.
Am I a little bit scared? Yes.

635
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:26,117
But am I running around like
a chicken with its head cut off?

636
01:02:26,196 --> 01:02:28,756
- Oh. Nice image.
- No!

637
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:32,268
I mean. You gotta just
lighten up a little bit.

638
01:02:35,505 --> 01:02:36,870
Come on. Hey!

639
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:40,740
Would the birdman of S and M worry?

640
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:43,108
Very funny. Chaz.

641
01:02:43,179 --> 01:02:45,773
You gotta look at
the bright side of things.

642
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:49,148
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Would you take that thing off?

643
01:02:50,587 --> 01:02:52,987
Okay. Okay.

644
01:02:53,056 --> 01:02:54,990
How about this one?

645
01:02:58,728 --> 01:03:00,753
You are such a jerk.

646
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:03,594
This one's turning you on.
I can tell.

647
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:06,134
Kiss me. You savage she-devil!

648
01:03:06,202 --> 01:03:08,136
Get away from me!

649
01:03:09,272 --> 01:03:12,537
Stop it. Stop it some more.
I love it when you're rough.

650
01:03:12,609 --> 01:03:14,770
Of course. It would help a little
if I could breathe in here.

651
01:03:14,844 --> 01:03:16,436
Just a little.

652
01:03:19,148 --> 01:03:22,675
Come and get it!

653
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,975
Very subtle. Chaz.
What am I supposed to do?

654
01:03:50,046 --> 01:03:53,504
Just throw off my clothes
and jump on top of you?

655
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:56,814
Just wind her up and watch her go.

656
01:03:56,886 --> 01:03:59,480
You have got a lot to learn. Buddy.

657
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,194
What is this. Show and tell?
You show me yours...

658
01:04:06,262 --> 01:04:08,492
and then I get to show you mine?

659
01:04:08,565 --> 01:04:10,157
Well. Forget it.

660
01:04:12,101 --> 01:04:16,197
You can just take that thing and
shove it right back in your pants.

661
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:28,781
Oh. Come on. Chaz.
Just say something.

662
01:04:52,508 --> 01:04:54,738
No one's been up here in years.

663
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:01,214
Here.

664
01:05:06,623 --> 01:05:08,056
Do you see him?

665
01:05:08,124 --> 01:05:11,753
No. He must not
have a light on his boat.

666
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:14,092
Maybe he's chosen not to use it.

667
01:05:16,265 --> 01:05:19,530
He said something else
about Muffy on the phone.

668
01:05:19,602 --> 01:05:22,833
- What?
- He said not to trust anyone.

669
01:05:22,905 --> 01:05:25,100
That's why we were
supposed to stay together.

670
01:05:25,174 --> 01:05:28,234
No one was to be left alone
with anyone else.

671
01:05:28,311 --> 01:05:31,576
Then he said.
"Especially not with Muffy."

672
01:05:31,648 --> 01:05:34,082
- Well. What did he mean by that?
- He wouldn't explain it.

673
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,983
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it? Think about it.

674
01:05:37,053 --> 01:05:39,044
He's known her a lot longer
than we have.

675
01:05:47,397 --> 01:05:49,888
Wait. Wait. Rob.

676
01:05:49,966 --> 01:05:51,558
What's that?

677
01:05:53,536 --> 01:05:55,128
Just the dolls.

678
01:05:56,706 --> 01:05:59,174
- Rob. She's been up here.
- So?

679
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:24,232
Jesus!

680
01:06:29,105 --> 01:06:31,403
It's Arch. Skip and Nan.

681
01:06:31,474 --> 01:06:33,567
There's two over there.

682
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:44,920
Hey. He's here.
Come on.

683
01:08:47,944 --> 01:08:50,174
- I can't find Harvey.
- I can't find anyone.

684
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:54,783
Nikki's door's locked.

685
01:08:59,088 --> 01:09:00,953
Rob. It was locked.

686
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,391
- Oh. Jesus!
- Wait. Rob! What about Muffy?

687
01:09:09,465 --> 01:09:10,830
- Forget her!
- She's my friend!

688
01:09:13,636 --> 01:09:14,898
Muffy. Open the...

689
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:22,568
Run. Kit! Run!
Get out of here!

690
01:09:25,848 --> 01:09:27,281
Come on!

691
01:09:40,763 --> 01:09:42,355
Constable Potter?

692
01:10:16,165 --> 01:10:18,099
Hey. Wait. Rob.

693
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:20,101
Rob. Don't go in there.

694
01:10:23,606 --> 01:10:25,574
If there's another flare.
we can signal him.

695
01:10:29,912 --> 01:10:32,380
Maybe he already went
back up to the house.

696
01:10:47,082 --> 01:10:49,380
Shit. There's no key.

697
01:10:49,451 --> 01:10:50,884
Damn it.

698
01:10:54,022 --> 01:10:55,614
Wait. Wait. Wait.

699
01:10:57,092 --> 01:10:58,525
Look.

700
01:11:03,065 --> 01:11:04,327
"State Hospital.

701
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:07,459
Pursuant to our previous
communications. Please be advised...

702
01:11:07,536 --> 01:11:10,300
that the patient under discussion
has still not been found...

703
01:11:10,372 --> 01:11:12,465
and returned to custody.
and is now believed...

704
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:15,009
to be attempting to return
to her home in your jurisdiction.

705
01:11:15,077 --> 01:11:17,477
If encountered.
exercise extreme caution...

706
01:11:17,546 --> 01:11:19,514
and notify us immediately...

707
01:11:19,581 --> 01:11:22,982
as Miss St. John has been
a patient here for three years...

708
01:11:23,051 --> 01:11:27,249
and is still considered incorrigibly
unstable and extremely dangerous."

709
01:11:28,056 --> 01:11:30,650
Miss St. John?

710
01:11:30,726 --> 01:11:32,785
Muffy hasn't been in
an institution for three years.

711
01:11:32,861 --> 01:11:35,489
She's been at Vassar.

712
01:11:35,564 --> 01:11:38,362
We gotta get this boat started.

713
01:11:38,433 --> 01:11:39,866
How?

714
01:11:42,938 --> 01:11:44,337
The house.

715
01:11:44,406 --> 01:11:47,466
Didn't Muffy say there was a key
in the kitchen back in the house?

716
01:11:47,543 --> 01:11:50,341
I can't go back up there.
I can't go back...

717
01:11:50,412 --> 01:11:53,040
We've got no choice.
We've gotta go back.

718
01:12:00,522 --> 01:12:01,648
Rob. Iook.

719
01:12:01,723 --> 01:12:05,022
The doors... they've been closed.

720
01:12:15,504 --> 01:12:16,937
There.

721
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:21,539
That's how we're goin' in.

722
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,872
Here. Hold this.

723
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:37,150
Yeah. Good idea.

724
01:12:37,225 --> 01:12:39,159
Now. Where are the stairs?

725
01:12:40,228 --> 01:12:41,820
What's that?

726
01:12:47,102 --> 01:12:49,070
Rob. Iook.

727
01:13:16,999 --> 01:13:18,899
Oh. My God.

728
01:13:18,967 --> 01:13:21,697
- It's Muffy's clothes.
- I don't get it.

729
01:13:27,709 --> 01:13:29,438
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
- What?

730
01:13:29,511 --> 01:13:31,411
What's that?

731
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,072
I don't know.

732
01:13:43,191 --> 01:13:45,751
Oh. My God.

733
01:13:45,827 --> 01:13:48,762
The picture of the girls
in the study.

734
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:50,388
That letter.

735
01:13:51,266 --> 01:13:53,894
And what the constable
was trying to tell you.

736
01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:56,369
It's not Muffy.
It's her twin sister. Buffy.

737
01:13:56,438 --> 01:13:59,874
She's got a twin sister!
Rob. Don't you see?

738
01:14:04,613 --> 01:14:06,205
Oh. My God!

739
01:14:14,022 --> 01:14:15,614
Pull it away.

740
01:14:20,262 --> 01:14:21,991
- Rob. I can't pull it...
- Pull it away!

741
01:14:48,156 --> 01:14:50,090
The boat key...
it's gotta be in here somewhere.

742
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:51,887
Where is it?

743
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:55,088
Look on the walls!
Is there a key board?

744
01:14:57,466 --> 01:14:58,956
Jesus!
Look in the cupboards!

745
01:15:00,268 --> 01:15:02,133
I can't find it!

746
01:15:03,472 --> 01:15:05,440
I can't find it!
Goddamn it!

747
01:15:09,344 --> 01:15:11,403
Damn it!
Where is it?

748
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,818
Let me out. Kit!
Let me out of here!

749
01:15:36,805 --> 01:15:39,399
Run. Kit! Run!

750
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:45,246
Please. Just leave us alone. Okay?

751
01:15:45,313 --> 01:15:48,749
Please. We're just
gonna go home now.

752
01:15:54,523 --> 01:15:55,683
Come on.

753
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,638
- Stop!
- Babe!

754
01:16:10,705 --> 01:16:12,263
Please. Just let us leave.

755
01:16:14,609 --> 01:16:18,238
Buffy. You can stop now.

756
01:16:21,049 --> 01:16:22,448
Stop!

757
01:16:22,517 --> 01:16:24,678
Buffy. No!

758
01:16:24,753 --> 01:16:26,345
I love you. Kit!

759
01:16:26,421 --> 01:16:29,219
Please. Please don't.

760
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:31,452
Please.

761
01:16:35,931 --> 01:16:39,628
Please. Buffy.
Just let us go. Please.

762
01:17:33,455 --> 01:17:35,389
That's really funny. You guys!

763
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:37,789
Really funny.

764
01:17:37,859 --> 01:17:39,292
Fuck you!

765
01:17:44,799 --> 01:17:47,927
Kit. I love you!

766
01:17:48,003 --> 01:17:51,302
Kit. I love...

767
01:17:51,373 --> 01:17:53,807
I love you too. Babe.

768
01:18:01,383 --> 01:18:05,114
...two. Three!
April Fool's!

769
01:18:40,255 --> 01:18:43,053
You guys are so terrific.

770
01:18:43,124 --> 01:18:46,787
I love you all. And I wanna thank
you from the bottom of my heart...

771
01:18:46,861 --> 01:18:48,590
for being such good sports.

772
01:18:48,663 --> 01:18:51,063
Yeah. Sure.
Hey. Quite welcome. Anytime.

773
01:18:54,269 --> 01:18:56,669
You and Kit.
you two were the best!

774
01:18:56,738 --> 01:18:59,070
You figured it all out.

775
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:01,472
The clues... they really worked.

776
01:19:01,543 --> 01:19:04,774
- What clues?
- What's this all about?

777
01:19:04,846 --> 01:19:07,508
And don't anyone say April Fool's
again. Or I'll rip 'em apart.

778
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,909
April Fool's!

779
01:19:10,986 --> 01:19:13,181
How about I tell ya...

780
01:19:13,254 --> 01:19:16,519
it's a script for a weekend special
that's gonna help me keep the house.

781
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:19,355
Look. Next month...

782
01:19:19,427 --> 01:19:22,555
I get the house as part of my
mother's inheritance. It's true...

783
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:25,724
but only if I could show my father
that it could carry itself...

784
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,735
what with taxes
and expenses and all.

785
01:19:28,803 --> 01:19:30,828
Otherwise. He's gonna
sell it out of the family.

786
01:19:30,905 --> 01:19:34,534
So I decided to turn it
into a country inn.

787
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:38,545
But not just a stuffy old
run-of-the-mill country inn.

788
01:19:38,613 --> 01:19:41,776
One that specializes
in offering...

789
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:45,411
a once-in-a-lifetime
whodunnit weekend.

790
01:19:47,022 --> 01:19:48,956
I needed a rehearsal.

791
01:19:50,025 --> 01:19:52,391
I had to try my idea
out on somebody.

792
01:19:54,462 --> 01:19:55,724
So you guys all had
a part in this. Right?

793
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,171
Don't look at me.

794
01:19:58,039 --> 01:20:01,008
We got sucked into this
just as badly as you did.

795
01:20:01,075 --> 01:20:02,975
Once you were all
killed off. Yes.

796
01:20:03,044 --> 01:20:06,445
But everybody had to cooperate.
or none of it would've worked.

797
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:09,915
So then I guess there's no
twin sister Buffy. Then.

798
01:20:09,984 --> 01:20:13,010
There's a crazy twin. All right.
but his name isn't Buffy.

799
01:20:13,087 --> 01:20:15,180
- His name?
- Skip?

800
01:20:15,256 --> 01:20:18,623
- He's your brother?
- You bastard!

801
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:21,184
- You were in on the whole deal too.
- Only the setup.

802
01:20:21,262 --> 01:20:24,254
She told me to say I was her cousin
so we could pull the ferry prank.

803
01:20:24,332 --> 01:20:26,300
And I had no idea
what was gonna happen to Buck.

804
01:20:26,367 --> 01:20:30,770
Buck Williams.
makeup artist par excellence.

805
01:20:30,838 --> 01:20:34,205
I got somethin' for you. Big guy.
Here. Catch.

806
01:20:35,943 --> 01:20:38,810
These were old props I redressed
with help from Muffy's photographs.

807
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,370
Sure fooled me.

808
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:43,645
So I take it that
this isn't the constable.

809
01:20:43,718 --> 01:20:47,154
Kit Graham. I want you to meet
my uncle Frank St. John...

810
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:49,485
of St. John et Freres
of Wall Street.

811
01:20:49,557 --> 01:20:52,720
Hi. Harvey "Hal" Edison. Jr.
Pleased to meet you. Sir.

812
01:20:54,195 --> 01:20:58,222
How did I do?
I never done no actin' before.

813
01:20:58,299 --> 01:21:01,268
I was really shakin'.

814
01:21:01,335 --> 01:21:06,204
Cal is our regular ferryman between
the mainland and the islands.

815
01:21:06,274 --> 01:21:08,799
But I thought he was up
to the dramatic challenge.

816
01:21:11,379 --> 01:21:15,042
You know. Muff. You were so lucky.
You could've gotten yourself killed.

817
01:21:15,116 --> 01:21:19,780
Well. I nearly did
with Harve over there.

818
01:21:19,854 --> 01:21:23,085
And who could've known about
the snake in the woods with Arch.

819
01:21:23,157 --> 01:21:27,491
But with the paying guests. They're
gonna know what they're in for...

820
01:21:27,562 --> 01:21:29,996
and the scenario
won't be nearly so extreme.

821
01:21:30,064 --> 01:21:32,157
I do regret...

822
01:21:32,233 --> 01:21:34,895
some of the fake clues
that I put into the bedrooms...

823
01:21:34,969 --> 01:21:37,403
were taken a bit too seriously...

824
01:21:37,471 --> 01:21:39,405
and I'm sorry about that.

825
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,771
But we had fun. Didn't we?
Come on!

826
01:21:43,844 --> 01:21:47,007
I'm never gonna forget
this weekend as long as I live.

827
01:21:47,081 --> 01:21:48,776
You're tellin' me.

828
01:21:48,849 --> 01:21:51,841
When I was out there swingin' in the
woods. I nearly crapped my pants.

829
01:21:51,919 --> 01:21:54,854
What you mean. Nearly?
I was there. Remember?

830
01:21:57,491 --> 01:22:00,221
You browned your trousers?

831
01:22:00,294 --> 01:22:03,058
Well...

832
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,428
- You know. I was...
- It's all right. Arch.

833
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:07,194
They'll be out of the dryer soon.

834
01:22:14,442 --> 01:22:17,138
Come on. Drink.
Drink.

835
01:22:17,211 --> 01:22:19,145
Come here. You maniac.

836
01:22:22,783 --> 01:22:25,445
Wait. Muffy. What are you...
What are you doing?

837
01:25:48,789 --> 01:25:50,222
April fool.
