1
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,377
When did you say that?

2
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:10,229
It was the voice of a man.

3
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:19,055
I do not think it will be much longer now.

4
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:32,766
Where is it that you think I meant?

5
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:43,314
I was speaking about the other night.

6
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:50,345
I do not know where Jack is.

7
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:06,459
I was near the harbor after it happened.
It was raining.

8
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,725
It is 8:35 PM.

9
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:26,073
Who was on the phone?

10
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:38,305
It is still raining.

11
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,583
It has always been like that.

12
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,744
When did you go out?

13
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,884
I have known since I was seven.

14
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,715
It happens all the time.

15
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,162
There is no moon tonight.

16
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:02,777
I said it looks like it is still raining.

17
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:12,381
Where was it exactly, do you remember?

18
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:19,612
Is it that late?

19
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:37,022
Since then?

20
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:45,570
And getting darker.
