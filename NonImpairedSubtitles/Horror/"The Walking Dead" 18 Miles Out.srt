Get out of here!

I'm sorry!

7
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:17,398
We can't leave him!

8
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:22,189
We give him a canteen,take him out
to the main road, send him on his way.

-  He knows where we are.
- He's not a threat.

10
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:29,509
Shane thinks I'm his. He thinks the
baby is his. He is dangerous.

I wanted to talk.

Been waiting a week
till we were gonna do this.

at the school.

39

being here--

No, man, I know
you wouldn't have.

43
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:40,328
You don't think I can keep
Lori or Carl safe?

44
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,248
I didn't say that.

45

Rick, you can't just be the

48
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:52,924
Okay? Not anymore.

49
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,143
I'm not the good guy anymore.

50
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,396
To save Carl's life,

51

I would've done
anything-- anything.

52
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:04,069
Now Lori says you're dangerous,

53
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,404
but you're not
gonna be dangerous.

54

Not to us, not to me,
not anymore.

You and Lori--

57
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,375
I get what happened.

58
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,847
When I figured it out-- and I
figured it out pretty quickly--

59
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,182
I wanted to break your jaw,

60
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:37,219
let you choke on your teeth.

61
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,038
But I didn't.

62
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:44,109
That wasn't weakness.

63
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,728
It took everything.

64
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:53,318
That is my wife.
That is my son.

65
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,370
That is my unborn child.

66
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:58,990
I will stay alive
to keep them alive.

67
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:09,751
You don't love her.

68
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:12,837
You think you do,
but you don't.

69
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,678
Now the only way
you and me keep on...

70
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,848
Is that you accept
everything I just said

71
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,267
right here, right now,

72
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:28,019
and we move forward
with that understanding.

73
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:46,972
When it started
it was just--

74
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,624
It was a couple of weird
stories on the news.

75
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:54,545
Then-- then it was
so quick.

76
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,184
Everything--
It just happened.

77
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:03,054
Two weeks later,
I'm in the hospital

78
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,190
and there were soldiers
shooting people in the halls.

79
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,275
They were shooting people,
man, not walkers.

80
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,394
Then the walkers came through.

81
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:14,065
You know,
I tried to get you out,

82
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,234
I tried, but we weren't
gonna make it.

83
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,736
Man, there was no way
and I knew it.

84
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,872
But I couldn't live with it.

85
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,075
I couldn't live,
knowing--

86
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,662
( Sighs ) But I had to.

87
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,415
I didn't keep Lori
and Carl alive, man.

88
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,050
They kept me alive.

89
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:39,841
I want you to know that I
didn't look at her before that.

90
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:42,927

take it all back, I would.

One guy-- one guy

It ain't hard, man.

00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:57,095
- That's not an option.
- Of course it is.

322

She doesn't need to be yelled
at or treated like a child.

323
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,100
She needs a loaded gun, right?

324
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:04,603
You'll understand if
I don't send you in there.

325

I came through it.

326
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,807
And became such a productive
member of the group.

this on their own.

Cooking, cleaning
and caring for Beth.

00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:40,722
And you-- you don't
care about anyone

You sit up on that RV,

I took down two walkers.

Crashing her--

353
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:10,919
- You're insane.
- No, you are.

354
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,754
And you're the one
that's self-centered,

all for granted.

356

You don't get it, do you?

361

Your husband came back
from the dead,

362
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:31,022
your son too.
And now you've got a baby on the way.

00:37:37,954 --> 00:37:39,871
Go for the back door!

481
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:41,706
<i>Come on!</i>

482
00:37:46,595 --> 00:37:48,596
Come on, get in!

483
00:37:48,598 --> 00:37:51,099
Go, man, go!
Come on!

484
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:02,643
<i>( Walkers growling )</i>

485
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,614
Whoo-- Yeah!
Hell yeah!

486
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:08,483
You see that?
You see what we did?

487
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:10,818
- Just keep driving.
- ( All panting )

488
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:24,415
( Door slams )

489
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,384
- Where were you?
- I heard. Is she all right?

490
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:28,719
She would be if you had
stayed with her. Where were you?

491
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:31,088
- How bad is she?
- It wasn't deep.

492
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,843
She wants to live.
She made her decision.

493
00:38:35,845 --> 00:38:38,345
- She tried to kill herself.
- No, she didn't.

494
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:39,847
My father is stitching
her wrist right now.

495
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,266
She'll live.

496
00:38:42,268 --> 00:38:44,435
Stay away from her.

497
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:46,320
From both of us.

498
00:38:46,322 --> 00:38:48,689
Don't you dare
step foot inside this house again.

499
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:03,504
I'm not gonna say
she was right,

500
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:04,705
but Beth has
made her choice.

501
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:08,676
She wants to live
and now she knows it...

502
00:39:08,678 --> 00:39:11,479
And sometimes you have to
cross the line.

503
00:39:13,632 --> 00:39:16,083
Mmm.

504
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:42,627

( Music continues, muffled )

507
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:09,020
If you wanna kill me,

508
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:11,405
you're gonna have to do
better than a wrench.

509
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,495
Probably gonna
have to kill that boy,

510
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:23,284
but I am gonna
think about it a night.

511
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:26,087
It can't be that easy,
killing someone,

512
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:28,589
killing anyone.

513
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:31,208
You know that.

514
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:40,635
That is my wife.

515
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,672
That is my son.

516
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:48,025
That is my child.

517
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:54,649
If you're
gonna be with us,

518
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:57,151
you gotta follow my lead,
you gotta trust me.

519
00:41:11,717 --> 00:41:14,919
It's time for you
to come back.

On the next episode
of AMC's The Walking Dead...

536
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:30,298
- I didn't do anything! - You shot at
my boys, tried to take this farm!

537
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:32,198
And you're trying to
tell me you're innocent?

538
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:34,862
He has got a gun and
I'm looking for my friend.

539
00:42:35,004 --> 00:42:37,386
- You're just gonna kill him?
- People are scared!

540
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,572
They need to be safe!
I owe them that.

541
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,092
- Rick's the leader of this group.
- We all chase that.

542
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:46,436
If we do this, the people we worded,
the world that we knew is dead!

543
00:42:46,553 --> 00:42:49,454
Now three episodes left this season.

544
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:52,200
A special look at a scene from
next week's The Walking Dead

545
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:54,900
will be revealed during the first
commercial break of Comic Book Men.

546
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,574
