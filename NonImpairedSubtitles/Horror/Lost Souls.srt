1
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:18,933
Look at you. Come here.

2
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:23,680
I told you, you've got to
double-knot those things.

3
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,920
One of these days...

4
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,618
we'll have to get you
some zipper shoes.

5
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:12,487
Father...

6
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,395
why are we doing this?

7
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:20,101
I know, Maya.

8
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,166
But you'll understand
when you see this man.

9
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:28,272
Ensemble pour toujours,
quoi qu'il arrive.

10
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,015
He's in torment...

11
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:34,714
the way you were when I met you.

12
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:21,064
I've got patients.
I've got sprinklers.

13
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,070
I've got a flood.
I'm ready to build an ark.

14
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:27,005
Hook me up with maintenance.
You're killing me!

15
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:31,070
Your court order, Dr. Allen.

16
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:36,506
You know I'm not
comfortable with this.

17
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:40,812
The patient
is legally entitled to it.

18
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:45,011
The patient has been plagued
by temporal lobe seizures.

19
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,419
It is the patient's request,
Doctor.

20
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:51,855
I am aware of that,
but I don't think...

21
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:54,621
he's in any condition
to make requests.

22
00:06:54,661 --> 00:07:00,930
I'm trying to appeal
to your logical self, Father.

23
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:04,425
I'm concerned
about harm to my patient.

24
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,073
Father Jeremy...

25
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:12,873
Deacon John Townsend
of St. Ursula's...

26
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:16,143
and our associate, Maya Larkin.

27
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:18,446
Associate?

28
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:21,180
Secular assistants
can be permitted...

29
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:24,520
if they are regarded
as qualified.

30
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,392
I'm going in with you.

31
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:30,521
You wouldn't last five minutes.

32
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:34,561
Just open the door.

33
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,825
What do you think
of the color of this room?

34
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:05,524
It's supposed to be relaxing.

35
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,601
Hello, Henry.

36
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,002
You know why we're here.

37
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:20,043
I'm really
looking forward to it.

38
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,050
Let us prepare the room.

39
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,361
Get the other one.

40
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,830
Please, do the other one.

41
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:56,104
God, the Holy Spirit,
have mercy on us.

42
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:59,908
God, the Holy Trinity, one God,
have mercy on us.

43
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,073
Holy Mary, pray for us.

44
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,481
-Holy Mother of God.
-Pray for us.

45
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,246
-Holy Virgin of Virgins.
-Pray for us.

46
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:09,743
Saint Michael. Saint Gabriel.
Saint Raphael.

47
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,381
Holy angels and archangels.

48
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:13,790
All holy orders
of blessed spirits.

49
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:15,384
Saint John the Baptist.

50
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:16,759
Saint Joseph.

51
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:19,287
All holy patriarchs
and prophets.

52
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:21,596
Saint Peter. Saint Paul...

53
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,368
...our sins
or those of our forefathers.

54
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:28,840
Hail Mary, full of grace...

55
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,173
Do not punish us
for our offenses.

56
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,405
Lead us not into temptation.

57
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:35,640
Hail Mary.

58
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:38,047
Do not punish us
for our offenses.

59
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:42,418
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

60
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,905
-They're all still in there.
-What the hell is that?

61
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:03,932
-It's in Birdson's room.
-Jesus!

62
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:07,639
Get Haldol, Cogentin, Ativan,
five, two, and two IM.

63
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,107
Open the door!

64
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:26,057
Father!

65
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:35,905
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

66
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,603
Blessed art thou
amongst women...

67
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,584
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

68
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,719
Blessed art thou
amongst women...

69
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,832
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

70
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,166
Blessed art thou amongst women.

71
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:07,400
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus...

72
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:15,039
Mr. Silberman...

73
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,641
you worked for your whole life
at the same company.

74
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,776
-Is that correct?
-That's correct.

75
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:21,844
And you worked with
the defendant George Viznik...

76
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:23,822
for the last two years
in the same room?

77
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:24,982
Right.

78
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,151
How would you describe him?

79
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:31,789
Quiet. Real quiet.

80
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:35,028
And on the day of the murders,
his state of mind?

81
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:41,529
He seemed on edge. A little.

82
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:45,874
On the day of the murders,
what did the defendant request?

83
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,210
He asked to go home early.

84
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:49,509
He said he was bothered...

85
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,040
by all the people
who kept telling him what to do.

86
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:57,582
He said he was bothered...

87
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:00,023
by all the people
who kept telling him what to do?

88
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:01,390
Is that what you said?

89
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:12,034
Tell the jury how many people
work in that office...

90
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,868
with you and Mr. Viznik.

91
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,303
How many people?

92
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:19,140
Well, just me.

93
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:21,339
Could those voices
have come from outside?

94
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,975
Next room?

95
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:29,047
-Hey, Mr. Kelson.
-Hi, Robert.

96
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:31,451
Thanks.

97
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,051
Here's the stuff you wanted
on pathological narcissism.

98
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:38,359
What about that psychic?
What's his name? Szabo?

99
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:39,864
He can see you Thursday.

100
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,129
I still think
it's a waste of time.

101
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:45,331
The police used him
as a witness in the case.

102
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,566
I'll be at my brother's tonight
if you need me.

103
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:53,104
"D" equals two.

104
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:55,238
"E" equals three.

105
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:59,741
So four should be five.

106
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,982
"H" is six. One equals seven.

107
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:05,456
"J" equals eight.

108
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,925
"K"...nine.

109
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,626
"N"...twelve.

110
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:30,346
So "E" equals...

111
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:48,064
"K"..."P" is twenty-four.

112
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,069
Thirteen..."E."

113
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,536
Two..."T."

114
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:54,436
Thirteen..."E."

115
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:55,963
Twenty-six..."R."

116
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:06,985
"Kelson."

117
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,681
We welcome Peter Kelson...

118
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:12,714
author of the current
bestseller "Vicious lntent"...

119
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,726
as part of today's story
on the trial...

120
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,024
of mass murderer George Viznik.

121
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:19,122
Thank you so much
for joining us, Peter.

122
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:20,723
Thanks for having me, Sally.

123
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:24,463
Peter, you're making a career of
studying sensational murderers.

124
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:27,336
How does it feel,
day after day...

125
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,773
face to face with killers?

126
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,209
Long-term exposure
to these things...

127
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:35,236
tends to give you a sort of
clinical understanding...

128
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:37,146
of the subject.

129
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:39,913
It sounds as if you're saying
the closer you get to evil...

130
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,544
the less evil it becomes.

131
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:44,488
No, the less mystifying.

132
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:47,959
Good and evil
are only illusions.

133
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:51,019
I don't believe in evil
with a capital "E."

134
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,896
That suggests
some kind of external force...

135
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:57,096
some third-party bad guy
pulling all the strings.

136
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,161
Are you referring
to the defense's efforts...

137
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:02,971
to prove that George Viznik
is tormented by demonic voices?

138
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:04,635
There were no voices.

139
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:07,908
Not even from mental illness
as the defense asserts?

140
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,847
Are you trying
to get me to say...

141
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:11,975
there's another cause
for little voices?

142
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:17,885
No. Viznik's a manipulator.

143
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:21,359
He has what I call
malignant narcissism.

144
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:36,472
Hey, beautiful.

145
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:58,389
Uncle James.

146
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:02,329
-How you doing?
-Fine, thank you.

147
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:05,662
That's great.

148
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:09,504
And you? Lovely as always.

149
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,373
You ready?

150
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,742
Yeah. These guys
have been doing this...

151
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,269
twice a week for ten years...

152
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:18,010
and they still
can't get it right.

153
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,950
All right,
you shrieking harpies!

154
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,647
Enough of that racket!
Be off with you!

155
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:42,271
Claire!
You guys are a little late.

156
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:44,367
Hey, little brother.

157
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,106
-Hey, Will.
-It's about time, man!

158
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:48,807
I'm starving!

159
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:52,381
It's good to see you guys
out of the house.

160
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:54,613
You got to come out here
more often.

161
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:56,780
Here, Claire, after you.

162
00:17:56,822 --> 00:18:00,155
Bless us, O Lord,
for these Thy gifts.

163
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,161
Through Thy bounty,
through Christ our Lord.

164
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,095
And a special blessing...

165
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,190
for Peter and William's
mother Andrea...

166
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:11,032
and their father Jack...

167
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,403
in whose memory
we gather here every year.

168
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,035
May their souls and the souls
of the faithfully departed...

169
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:20,705
rest in peace. Amen.

170
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,111
Amen.

171
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:32,215
Well, dig in.

172
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:36,388
I made a reservation at Marco's
for Peter's birthday dinner...

173
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:38,794
but I'm thinking
I should have you cater it.

174
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:40,025
Thank you.

175
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:42,966
-What time did you make it for?
-8:00. Is that good?

176
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:47,703
Remember that dream I used
to have when I was little...

177
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,176
about the bear on the mountain?

178
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:54,509
You know, right after--

179
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:59,711
I don't know. Maybe the trial's
been getting to me...

180
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:02,243
because I've been having
this weird dream every night.

181
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:03,812
Really?

182
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:05,790
You didn't say anything to me.

183
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:08,452
It's probably trivial.

184
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:11,292
If it's recurring,
maybe it's not so trivial.

185
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,195
OK, I'll tell you.

186
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:14,665
I'm reading this book...

187
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,864
and I can't remember what
the book is when I wake up...

188
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:20,872
but I realize
halfway through it...

189
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:23,033
it's something
that I've written...

190
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,508
or will write, actually.

191
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,706
And, anyway,
I get to the end of the book...

192
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:33,412
and I'm feeling very satisfied.

193
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:36,421
And I close the cover
to read the title...

194
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:41,415
and the title,
it just says "X-E-S."

195
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,657
Just three letters.

196
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:47,427
For some reason,
that makes me feel great.

197
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:49,024
Then I wake up.

198
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:51,332
It usually makes me
feel great, too.

199
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,099
But I fall asleep
right afterwards.

200
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:55,470
What do you mean?

201
00:19:56,475 --> 00:20:00,070
"X-E-S"
is "sex" spelled backwards.

202
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:03,343
What can I say?

203
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:05,782
I'm not a master of the obvious.

204
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:10,016
Not even from mental illness
as the defense asserts?

205
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:11,545
Are you trying
to get me to say...

206
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,354
there's another cause
for little voices, Sally?

207
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:18,295
No, Viznik's a manipulator.
He's clever.

208
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,993
He has what I call
malignant narcissism.

209
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:25,800
He's dangerously self-obsessed,
but not psychotic.

210
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:27,066
He's incapable.

211
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:29,074
He has no capacity
to understand...

212
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:32,441
or ability to recognize
any higher authority.

213
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:34,002
What about Peter Kelson?

214
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:37,641
Where is your moral compass?

215
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:39,810
I like to think
I'm the actual needle...

216
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:41,285
on the compass.

217
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,151
Morality is which way
you're facing...

218
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:44,450
depending on the dilemma...

219
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,017
but the needle,
it always points north.

220
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:55,066
"Best-selling author...

221
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,727
"New York native...

222
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:00,933
"Own parents murdered
in an unsolved crime."

223
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:10,642
John, I know who he is.

224
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:12,708
What's going on?

225
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:15,481
Birdson's repeating numbers.

226
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:17,489
It's a code I found
in the papers...

227
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:19,548
that I took from his room.

228
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:21,855
It spells "Peter Kelson."

229
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:24,419
So he's the one.

230
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:26,658
We have to check the criteria.

231
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:30,430
Baptismal records, blood type.

232
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:33,905
I found his doctor,
so that's a start.

233
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:35,702
And then what?

234
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:37,709
If Father Lareaux's
not up to this...

235
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:41,474
I filed a report
with Father Frank.

236
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:43,947
A lot of good that'll do.

237
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:46,416
The Church dismisses this
completely. You know that.

238
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:50,286
We need all the help we can get
right now, John. We really do.

239
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:54,015
-Here?
-There.

240
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,253
Thanks, Mike.

241
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:57,057
Sure thing, Peter.

242
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:58,427
Hey, James.

243
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,673
Seems Viznik isn't making
too many friends in lockup.

244
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:10,174
He got beat up.

245
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:12,143
I'll get my smokes.
I'll be back.

246
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:13,337
All right.

247
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,757
What's the matter with you?

248
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,089
He was looking right at me.

249
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,101
He could see me.

250
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,398
Viznik.

251
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:14,937
Your time's up.

252
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:17,875
I don't know.

253
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,607
Maybe he was looking
right at himself, right?

254
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,437
Maya, the diocese
has rejected your report.

255
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:52,443
And I have to tell you...

256
00:23:52,477 --> 00:23:55,002
I agree with them.

257
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:58,676
I believe
that these are projections...

258
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:01,015
caused by
your unfortunate childhood.

259
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:05,285
Maya, Satan is not
what you think he is.

260
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:09,426
If you really
believed in God, Father...

261
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:11,429
why is it
so inconceivable to you...

262
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:13,988
that His adversary
could be just as real?

263
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,435
The Church...

264
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:23,134
will not tolerate
your obsessions.

265
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:28,243
If you want to stay here,
leave this alone.

266
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:37,948
Idiots.

267
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,104
Is anybody in there?

268
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,406
You're not real.

269
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:07,705
Excuse me.

270
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:08,899
May I help you?

271
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,407
Yes. I'm from St. Ursula's.

272
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:13,275
I was told you could help me
with some baptismal records...

273
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:14,972
for one of our new parishioners.

274
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:16,173
The person's name?

275
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:17,806
Peter Kelson.

276
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:26,317
Here you are.

277
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:28,087
Great. Thank you.

278
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,332
Hey! What are you doing home?

279
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:19,809
I forgot my car keys.

280
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:21,472
What are you doing
on this floor?

281
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:24,880
We got Mr. Kowalski's mail
again.

282
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,783
Lucky Mr. Kowalski.

283
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:29,252
Hey, come here.

284
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:04,879
Just an outside observer.

285
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:07,486
...what I've heard...

286
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:10,927
it seems that Mr. Viznik
is probably not schizophrenic.

287
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:37,986
Can I help you?

288
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:40,647
Peter Kelson?

289
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:47,053
I saw you
on television yesterday...

290
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:50,158
and I thought
you were brilliant.

291
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,197
Thank you.

292
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:57,334
You work in the building
or coming from the party?

293
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,707
You said something
really interesting.

294
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:04,340
You said malignant narcissism
was not evil.

295
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:06,914
Yes, I did.

296
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,045
Not pure evil.
That's correct.

297
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:10,213
And also that--

298
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:12,416
I'm sorry,
but I'm running late.

299
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:17,360
And that there was no such thing
as evil with a capital "E."

300
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:20,853
It's not the most
popular opinion, but yes.

301
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:25,764
What if I told you
I was a malignant narcissist?

302
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:28,329
Have a seat.

303
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,671
I probably wouldn't believe you.

304
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:32,677
A narcissist wouldn't admit it.

305
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:35,908
It's basically an extreme form
of self-denial.

306
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:38,245
-Do you mind?
-Please, be my guest.

307
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:39,750
You want a drink?

308
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:41,411
No, thank you.

309
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:50,325
What if I told you that
I believe in God and the Devil?

310
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:53,092
In fact, I know that they exist.

311
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:58,232
Sorry.

312
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:10,075
I know.

313
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,949
Is that your girlfriend?

314
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:17,919
Excuse me?

315
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:20,447
Are you familiar with the case
or Henry Birdson...

316
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:25,225
the math professor who went home
and murdered his entire family?

317
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:27,663
Yeah.
What's that got to do with you?

318
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:30,099
Last week,
the Catholic Church...

319
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:32,968
certified him
as genuinely possessed.

320
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:36,371
You realize how rarely
they make that ruling?

321
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:37,807
Yes, I do.

322
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,970
An exorcism
was held for Mr. Birdson...

323
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:45,210
and it failed disastrously.

324
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,377
Is that right?

325
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:48,977
Thank you.

326
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:56,818
I really think
you should meet him.

327
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:59,022
With your book on Viznik...

328
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:02,830
I think you'd find him
very, very interesting.

329
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,062
I'm sure I would.

330
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:08,539
You seemed so self-assured
on television.

331
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:12,202
I thought that someone
with your confidence...

332
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:17,476
would be up for letting someone
try to prove you wrong.

333
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:20,075
Please, prove me wrong.

334
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:22,143
The world would be
so much simpler...

335
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:25,281
if it were all
just about good and evil.

336
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:27,291
Unfortunately,
I find it a much more--

337
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:31,193
I actually think
it is that simple.

338
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:37,301
This is a tape
of the Birdson exorcism.

339
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,474
I'll be in front of
the public library...

340
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:45,032
at 2:00 tomorrow.

341
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:47,977
If you're at all interested
in meeting him...

342
00:32:48,012 --> 00:32:50,708
I can take you to where he is.

343
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:02,921
Hey, Joe.

344
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:04,189
How's it going?

345
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:09,166
-Some dirt.
-Thanks.

346
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,724
What a racket.

347
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:12,760
How do you live
with that all day?

348
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,669
What else can I do?

349
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:19,375
Mrs. Levotsky. Jesus.

350
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:36,984
Keep your hands off me.

351
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,514
What are you looking at?

352
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,110
Why don't you go inside
and make more noise?

353
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:03,643
Go play your music.

354
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:07,283
Play it so loud that nobody
could sleep. Go ahead.

355
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:08,917
Noisemaker.

356
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:14,964
Inconsiderate. Selfish.

357
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,593
-Holy Virgin of virgins.
-Pray for us.

358
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,927
-Saint Michael.
-Pray for us.

359
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:56,024
-Saint Gabriel. Saint Raphael.
-Pray for us.

360
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:58,331
Holy angels and archangels...

361
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:13,015
Stop it!

362
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:17,555
Come on!

363
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,580
Come on, I turned it off!

364
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:05,234
Where are you?

365
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:10,873
I'm sorry.

366
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:15,345
It's just this strange woman
waltzes into my office today...

367
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,474
says she can get me in
to see this killer.

368
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:20,882
You're not getting involved
in this, are you?

369
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:25,546
No, of course not.

370
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,670
So, I got you a latte.

371
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:14,228
Thank you.

372
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,297
Didn't know what you wanted.

373
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,671
I'm glad you came.

374
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:23,509
Take the Williamsburg Bridge.

375
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:28,312
What did you think of the tape?

376
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,446
I think you gave me
the wrong one.

377
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:32,649
What do you mean?

378
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,555
It was blank.
There was nothing on it.

379
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:37,060
You gave me the wrong one.

380
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,063
Are you sure?

381
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:42,066
I cranked it all the way up.
Nothing but hum.

382
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:44,666
So, what'd I miss?

383
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:54,573
Shouldn't we wait
for the doctor?

384
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:56,603
I'm sure she won't mind.

385
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,013
It's right here.

386
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:01,951
It's not locked?

387
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:04,614
Not necessary anymore.

388
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:22,032
-Mr. Kelson.
-Hello, Doctor.

389
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:24,371
What a pleasure to meet you.

390
00:39:24,408 --> 00:39:26,899
I have to say,
your instincts are impeccable.

391
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:28,206
I am a fan.

392
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:30,771
Thanks, Doctor. Coming from you,
that's quite a compliment.

393
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:36,186
When your secretary phoned...

394
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,211
she didn't mention
her coming along, too.

395
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:39,484
My secretary?

396
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:42,152
You are aware
that this woman was party...

397
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:44,627
to the so-called exorcism?

398
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,325
No, I didn't, actually.

399
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:50,493
I've never felt that Mr. Birdson
needed anything...

400
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:53,129
but professional
psychiatric care.

401
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:57,335
Minutes after these people left,
he suffered a stroke.

402
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,002
He's completely comatose.

403
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:01,011
There's no brain-wave activity
at all.

404
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:05,311
What do you believe
put him in this condition?

405
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:07,840
They put him under
severe mental stress.

406
00:40:07,885 --> 00:40:09,409
That caused the aneurysm.

407
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:13,389
Could you tell us what you heard
when you tried to open the door?

408
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,889
I certainly hope you're not
lending any credence to this.

409
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:20,796
Just tell him what you heard.

410
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,900
Well, the patient
was in severe distress...

411
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:29,873
so naturally he was yelling.

412
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:32,432
And when you opened the door,
was he yelling...

413
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,808
or was he sitting here calmly?

414
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:39,547
There's a medical explanation
for everything that happened.

415
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:42,246
You heard the voices.

416
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:43,981
You know you did.

417
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,116
Sounded like a hundred voices
to me.

418
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:52,422
I've already said
that Mr. Birdson was agitated.

419
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:55,660
Victor, would you check on
the patient in room 5, please?

420
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:01,401
Could you just describe it
to me, the scene?

421
00:41:02,573 --> 00:41:04,666
He opened his eyes.

422
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:09,837
He just opened his eyes.

423
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:12,709
I'm surprised at you,
Mr. Kelson.

424
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,275
Allen, he just opened his eyes.

425
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:17,787
-Please leave.
-Excuse us, Doctor.

426
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:20,416
I'm not making this up.
I swear!

427
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,086
-Let's go now.
-I did not hallucinate that!

428
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:24,685
He just opened his eyes!

429
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,930
Where do you get off
pretending to be my secretary?

430
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,530
I had to.

431
00:41:35,573 --> 00:41:38,565
Did you? And this is evil?

432
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:40,577
The guy had an aneurysm.
Now he's in a coma.

433
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:42,670
That's their explanation.

434
00:41:42,713 --> 00:41:44,840
I know you don't believe me.

435
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:47,077
Yeah, well, why should l?

436
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,456
Maya, wait a minute. Wait.

437
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,365
Detective Smythe, please.

438
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:12,205
Hey, Mike, it's Peter.

439
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:13,733
I'm good, thanks.

440
00:42:13,778 --> 00:42:16,838
Could you pull some prints
off something for me?

441
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:18,075
Great.

442
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,207
Father.

443
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,487
It's Maya.

444
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,787
Can you hear me?

445
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:31,054
Leave him alone.

446
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:39,068
Once upon a time...

447
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:45,205
He's not going to respond.

448
00:42:45,242 --> 00:42:47,904
The doctor's afraid
that he might not even recover.

449
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:50,345
He will. He has great strength.

450
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:54,907
-What was he saying in there?
-I don't know.

451
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,216
Besides, it's useless.

452
00:42:57,254 --> 00:42:59,188
I mean, look at him.

453
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,251
What are you doing?

454
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:05,888
You can't back out on me now.

455
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,397
We need to be sure.

456
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:08,989
He couldn't hear the tape.

457
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:11,729
What other proof do you need,
Maya?

458
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:15,170
I'm not going to sit around
until it's too late.

459
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:20,075
Oh. And what is that, John?

460
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:23,012
What is that?

461
00:43:24,582 --> 00:43:26,948
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

462
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:28,474
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

463
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:30,248
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

464
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:31,777
Please give me the strength.

465
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:35,216
Live through me.

466
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:37,985
Give us this day
our daily bread...

467
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:39,462
and forgive us our trespasses...

468
00:43:39,497 --> 00:43:41,727
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

469
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:43,427
I'm in the dressing room.

470
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:44,934
...but deliver us from evil...

471
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:47,403
I picked your tuxedo up
from the cleaners.

472
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:49,269
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

473
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:50,603
Blessed art thou
amongst women...

474
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:52,506
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

475
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:53,737
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

476
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:56,178
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

477
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:59,205
It is the biggest
publishing party of the year.

478
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:03,181
You'd better hurry up.

479
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,448
Don't fail me.

480
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:08,390
Give me the grace, strength,
the courage to do your work.

481
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:11,828
Show me the way.

482
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:32,104
I saw you on the news.
I think you're even better live.

483
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:34,379
He is.

484
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:37,444
By the way, Lauren, did you
finish your book on tattoo art?

485
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:39,456
I hear your publisher
wants his advance back.

486
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,014
That's not true.

487
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:43,856
So, Peter,
how crowded is the field now?

488
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:46,385
I mean, there are, what,
7 books about the Viznik case?

489
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:47,692
Six, actually.

490
00:44:47,731 --> 00:44:50,564
But no one has the access
that I have.

491
00:44:50,601 --> 00:44:52,569
Is it true
the cops used a psychic?

492
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:55,697
I saw a psychic once.

493
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:57,604
Those guys
are definitely for real.

494
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:04,079
I saw some cable show about...

495
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:05,412
Cookbooks.

496
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:06,916
No, thanks.

497
00:45:08,352 --> 00:45:10,286
God will forgive me.

498
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:12,619
The time of transformation
is near.

499
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:13,816
What?

500
00:45:31,742 --> 00:45:33,573
You OK?

501
00:45:33,611 --> 00:45:35,044
Sweetheart.

502
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:49,715
Thanks for handling this.

503
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,625
Sure thing.

504
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:56,326
I think I got enough between
your preliminary statements...

505
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:58,267
and all the eyewitness accounts.

506
00:45:58,302 --> 00:45:59,894
You can go home.

507
00:45:59,937 --> 00:46:02,633
Give me till morning
to find out who this guy is...

508
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:05,005
and till then,
don't sweat it, huh?

509
00:46:07,645 --> 00:46:09,272
Thanks again for everything,
Mike.

510
00:46:09,313 --> 00:46:11,008
Don't thank me.

511
00:46:11,048 --> 00:46:12,811
Somebody up there likes you.

512
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:25,955
Thanks, bro.

513
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:51,044
Good evening,
Mr. Kelson, Miss Claire.

514
00:46:52,223 --> 00:46:54,521
I want to tell you something.

515
00:46:54,558 --> 00:46:55,855
I'm so upset.

516
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:59,590
Your neighbor, Mrs. Levotsky,
she's dead.

517
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,188
-What?
-She's dead.

518
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:03,427
-That's horrible.
-What happened?

519
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:07,062
Apparently, sometime last night,
she killed herself.

520
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:12,632
The paramedics told me
that she hung herself.

521
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,234
Climbed up on her dresser.

522
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,303
A stocking around her neck.

523
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:19,874
But I don't know.
She was completely rheumatoid.

524
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:22,477
It's a shame.

525
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:24,919
Anyway,
I thought you should know.

526
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:44,040
It's funny.

527
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:47,566
All my life, I thought I was...

528
00:47:47,611 --> 00:47:55,416
I was someone
who didn't believe in any of it.

529
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:57,749
It doesn't matter.

530
00:47:57,788 --> 00:47:59,688
He believes in you.

531
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,696
But it's true.
I have no faith, James.

532
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:11,730
It's strange.

533
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:17,036
When that gun was pointed
in my face tonight...

534
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:20,237
I was surprised,
but I was never frightened.

535
00:48:20,277 --> 00:48:22,837
Not for one second.

536
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:33,446
It was as if I knew nothing
could possibly happen to me.

537
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:37,724
In that one moment...

538
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:40,963
I didn't care about anything.

539
00:48:40,998 --> 00:48:43,432
Not even my own life.

540
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:48,461
Peter, you must care
about your own life.

541
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:54,107
I respect that you
have such faith, James.

542
00:48:54,144 --> 00:48:56,078
I don't understand it, but...

543
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:03,577
I want you to know
that I admire you.

544
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,316
I admire you, and I always will.

545
00:49:07,324 --> 00:49:08,985
I appreciate you saying that.

546
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,322
I think I'd better go.

547
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,354
Thanks for coming.

548
00:49:19,536 --> 00:49:21,094
Good morning, Father.

549
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:30,006
Father, what's wrong?

550
00:49:34,351 --> 00:49:36,342
It's about John.

551
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:41,213
Last night,
he tried to shoot Kelson.

552
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:45,421
What?

553
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:47,259
Maya, John's dead.

554
00:49:57,374 --> 00:49:59,103
Coffee for you, miss?

555
00:50:00,677 --> 00:50:02,076
Thank you.

556
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:14,422
I can't do this.

557
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:21,230
-Excuse me.
-Oh, God.

558
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:23,859
You have to put
your napkin in your lap.

559
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:25,061
Gina!

560
00:50:26,537 --> 00:50:28,835
How's this? Better?

561
00:50:28,872 --> 00:50:31,136
I'm sorry.
She's really into rules.

562
00:50:31,175 --> 00:50:32,767
That's fine.

563
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:35,108
Doesn't your daughter
put her napkin on her lap?

564
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:36,840
I don't have a daughter.

565
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,848
Aren't you lonely?

566
00:50:38,882 --> 00:50:40,213
That's enough.

567
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,242
I have someone
who takes care of me.

568
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:46,254
But he's dead.

569
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,121
Jesus is dead.

570
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:52,261
Jesus is dead.

571
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:01,664
You are so weak.

572
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:25,651
-How you doing?
-I'm good.

573
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:27,357
-How you doing?
-Good.

574
00:51:27,397 --> 00:51:28,955
So, what have you found?

575
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:33,095
Well, we traced this guy
to a seminary in Newark.

576
00:51:33,136 --> 00:51:36,162
Now, if you can believe this,
he was a deacon.

577
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:37,366
Really?

578
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:41,036
I talked to the man in charge,
a Father Frank Page...

579
00:51:41,078 --> 00:51:43,979
and he said that the gunman,
John Townsend...

580
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:47,040
had been caught up in some kind
of nonsense about the Devil...

581
00:51:47,084 --> 00:51:49,985
along with a priest
named Lareaux...

582
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,921
and a woman named Maya Larkin.

583
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:56,824
Same woman whose prints we took
off that coffee cup you gave us.

584
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,454
So, what's going on here?

585
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:04,933
-Can we go for a walk?
-Yeah. Sure.

586
00:52:04,968 --> 00:52:06,299
Thanks.

587
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:08,361
She came to my office
the other day...

588
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:11,704
and tells me this weird story
about demonic possession.

589
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,774
She's got a juvenile record
from New Orleans.

590
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:17,507
Her parents died
when she was thirteen.

591
00:52:17,548 --> 00:52:18,674
Her parents died?

592
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:21,377
Yeah. Murder-suicide.

593
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:25,479
Anyway, she was a runaway.
Arrested for vandalism...

594
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:28,047
petty theft, drugs,
the whole bit.

595
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:30,059
Parole records show
that she graduated...

596
00:52:30,093 --> 00:52:33,790
from community college,
moved into a retreat house...

597
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,731
and teaches some classes
at the seminary school.

598
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:39,964
Hasn't been
in any trouble since.

599
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:52,045
Le pain.

600
00:52:54,618 --> 00:52:57,314
Le chien.

601
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,650
Le chapeau.

602
00:53:01,692 --> 00:53:03,216
I need to go to the bathroom.

603
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,557
OK, Daniel.

604
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:07,826
-La fleur.
-I need to go to the bathroom.

605
00:53:07,864 --> 00:53:09,263
OK, go ahead, Daniel.

606
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:14,529
La glace.

607
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:17,997
Le poulet.

608
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:20,936
Very good.

609
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:23,276
Le chat.

610
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:28,614
Le chapeau.

611
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:29,846
Good.

612
00:53:31,388 --> 00:53:33,083
We need to talk.

613
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:35,387
-Peter, I'm in the middle of a--
-Now.

614
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:39,027
Children,
just stay in your seats.

615
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:40,723
I'll be...

616
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:46,859
A guy named John Townsend
tried to shoot me.

617
00:53:46,903 --> 00:53:48,427
Now I find out you knew him.

618
00:53:48,472 --> 00:53:50,667
What the fuck is going on?

619
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:56,603
Why did he try to kill me? Why?

620
00:53:56,647 --> 00:54:00,447
Townsend believed that just
as God became man in Christ...

621
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:02,281
Satan will assume human form.

622
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:03,445
Oh, my God.

623
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:05,580
I believe it, too.

624
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:07,419
And the point is?

625
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:09,652
At the exorcism,
Birdson boasted...

626
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:12,685
that Satan was about
to take over the body of a man.

627
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:17,864
You are that man, Peter.

628
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:19,300
What?

629
00:54:19,336 --> 00:54:22,464
It's true. He knew your name.

630
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:24,406
He was writing it
in this numerical code.

631
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:26,602
I figured it out.
It spelled your name.

632
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:33,614
You should really think hard
about getting professional help.

633
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:34,810
You're already--

634
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:37,877
Get your hands off me.

635
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:41,187
You're already contaminated,
Peter.

636
00:54:41,224 --> 00:54:44,557
That's why
you couldn't hear the tape.

637
00:54:44,594 --> 00:54:47,893
There's probably a pentacle
near your bed to sanctify you.

638
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:49,990
-I'm won't be drawn into this.
-Look for it.

639
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:51,660
I know it sounds crazy.

640
00:54:51,702 --> 00:54:53,670
You need proof.
Check your parents' blood types.

641
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:55,365
No, don't.
My parents are dead!

642
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:59,364
Are you sure your parents
are your birth parents?

643
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:00,740
My parents are dead.

644
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,877
You're becoming the Antichrist
who is born unholy...

645
00:55:04,915 --> 00:55:07,577
and becomes the door to eternal
suffering in this world.

646
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:10,985
If you or any
of your lunatic friends...

647
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:12,682
ever come near me again...

648
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:17,919
You have no messages
at this time.

649
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:12,626
Melvin Szabo,
this is Peter Kelson.

650
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:14,227
Peter, this is the psychic.

651
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:15,863
I'd appreciate it
if you'd put that back.

652
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:17,737
You're the younger one of two.

653
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:19,674
You're afraid of committing
to this girl...

654
00:58:19,709 --> 00:58:21,643
but she worships you.

655
00:58:21,678 --> 00:58:25,170
Your mother is dead,
but your father is alive.

656
00:58:25,215 --> 00:58:27,581
Nothing you couldn't find out
from reading the papers...

657
00:58:27,617 --> 00:58:29,915
and you're already wrong
on one count.

658
00:58:29,953 --> 00:58:33,616
Viznik will get off, and Robert
has got a crush on you.

659
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:36,251
How dare you?
You know what?

660
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:37,590
You can go.

661
00:58:37,627 --> 00:58:38,889
Suit yourself.

662
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:40,055
I will.

663
00:58:40,096 --> 00:58:43,964
But does this mean
anything to you?

664
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:52,103
You do know, don't you,
that these are also numbers?

665
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:53,769
Greek numbers--

666
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:56,472
six hundred, sixty, and six.

667
00:58:56,513 --> 00:58:59,539
Or the sign of the Devil.

668
00:58:59,582 --> 00:59:00,879
Get out of here.

669
00:59:05,255 --> 00:59:07,780
Wait a minute.

670
00:59:07,824 --> 00:59:09,724
"God will forgive me."

671
00:59:10,894 --> 00:59:13,795
"The time of transformation
is near."

672
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:18,358
Get the fuck out of here.

673
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:25,471
-Look, I'm--
-Just get out.

674
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:02,996
Help me.

675
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:10,772
Show--

676
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:35,058
I don't understand
what's going on.

677
01:02:38,034 --> 01:02:42,471
This has been planned
since your birth.

678
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:46,566
You fit all the criteria
that we know of.

679
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:50,204
Never baptized, devoid of faith,
born of incest.

680
01:02:50,246 --> 01:02:52,612
I was baptized.

681
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:55,345
I was certainly
not born of incest.

682
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:56,716
You were never baptized.

683
01:02:56,753 --> 01:02:59,119
At least, I don't believe
it was Christian.

684
01:03:00,256 --> 01:03:02,850
Your baptism was performed
by your uncle...

685
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:04,757
James MacKenzie, right?

686
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:05,920
Yes, I know.

687
01:03:05,962 --> 01:03:08,021
The only baptism
he ever performed...

688
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:10,658
in seven years
as pastor at Bedford.

689
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,065
Yeah, so what?

690
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:16,403
Seven years. One baptism?

691
01:03:16,439 --> 01:03:18,373
Your mother's only brother?

692
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:24,309
Do you know
your parents' blood types?

693
01:03:25,815 --> 01:03:29,808
My father was O-positive...

694
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:32,514
and my mother, A-negative.

695
01:03:37,527 --> 01:03:40,428
You're an AB-negative.

696
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:42,226
There is no way...

697
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:44,699
that your birth father
could be an O-positive.

698
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:46,326
It's impossible.

699
01:03:52,408 --> 01:03:53,807
This is ridiculous.

700
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:56,539
There's been a mistake.
I don't believe any of this.

701
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:58,206
Then why are you here?

702
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:24,464
When Townsend tried to kill me,
he said something.

703
01:04:29,746 --> 01:04:32,579
"The time of transformation
is near."

704
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:36,846
What does that mean?

705
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:41,422
He must've figured something out
on his own.

706
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:44,153
Maybe we should go to his house.

707
01:05:25,068 --> 01:05:27,901
It's hot in here.

708
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:36,805
What are we looking for exactly?

709
01:05:36,846 --> 01:05:39,747
I don't know.
Papers, anything.

710
01:05:42,552 --> 01:05:44,213
He's bought all my books.

711
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:47,587
What's this?

712
01:05:55,098 --> 01:05:56,793
Spells.

713
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:20,254
What was that?

714
01:06:20,289 --> 01:06:21,586
It's just a bulb.

715
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:23,683
It blew. It's OK.

716
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:29,161
There's nothing here.
I'll check upstairs, OK?

717
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:30,358
All right.

718
01:07:35,398 --> 01:07:38,925
There's nothing upstairs
except empty rooms.

719
01:07:38,968 --> 01:07:40,333
You got anything here?

720
01:07:40,369 --> 01:07:42,360
It's not what we're looking for.

721
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:47,532
I'll keep looking.

722
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:43,088
No. Not again.

723
01:09:48,965 --> 01:09:51,126
You're not real.

724
01:09:56,839 --> 01:09:59,273
Watch out. It's sharp.

725
01:10:02,278 --> 01:10:06,647
Henry, I know you don't
want to do this.

726
01:10:08,017 --> 01:10:12,920
Henry, I know you don't
want to do this.

727
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:14,582
I know you don't.

728
01:10:21,998 --> 01:10:23,431
Put it down.

729
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:27,158
Put it down.

730
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:43,649
Shit.

731
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:02,500
Peter, he can't hurt you.

732
01:11:21,557 --> 01:11:22,683
You OK?

733
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:24,716
Keep it up.

734
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:29,664
Your thirty-third birthday.

735
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:32,190
That's the transformation
Townsend was talking about.

736
01:11:32,234 --> 01:11:34,702
He found it
in one of Lareaux's books.

737
01:11:34,737 --> 01:11:35,897
What are you doing?

738
01:11:35,938 --> 01:11:37,337
It's going to happen...

739
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:41,036
at the exact moment
of your birth.

740
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:45,810
My birthday's tomorrow.

741
01:11:45,848 --> 01:11:47,509
What?

742
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,786
Oh, my God!

743
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:56,412
Know what the last thing
I said to my mother was?

744
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:01,582
"See you tomorrow."

745
01:13:06,629 --> 01:13:09,860
And she said, "You know it."

746
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:14,136
And I can see her face...

747
01:13:16,539 --> 01:13:18,200
smiling.

748
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,105
A real smile.

749
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:50,965
Why didn't you just
go along with Townsend?

750
01:13:54,343 --> 01:13:58,439
Because until it happens,
you're still a person.

751
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:04,315
What about after?

752
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:09,849
You're gone.

753
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:16,589
But if you die...

754
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:29,808
then Satan can't stay.

755
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:34,539
Unless we stop
the transformation.

756
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:42,952
It should be in here.

757
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,162
Here it is.

758
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:58,871
Tomorrow afternoon, 4:55.

759
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:03,509
Maybe there's something
in one of Lareaux's books.

760
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:06,241
They're in the car.
I'll check. Just stay here.

761
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:11,402
What are you doing
on this floor?

762
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:15,440
We got Mr. Kowalski's mail
again.

763
01:16:15,484 --> 01:16:18,248
Yeah? Lucky Mr. Kowalski.

764
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:29,213
Here he is.
He's right here.

765
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:32,978
Sweetheart, where have you been?

766
01:18:33,021 --> 01:18:35,546
I've been so worried.

767
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:38,424
Is this the person
you were telling me about?

768
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,951
What are these?

769
01:18:40,996 --> 01:18:43,658
I don't know. What are they?

770
01:18:43,699 --> 01:18:46,634
I found them
behind your picture.

771
01:18:46,668 --> 01:18:49,262
They're the spare set.

772
01:18:49,304 --> 01:18:52,432
I thought the spare set
was in the kitchen drawer.

773
01:18:52,474 --> 01:18:54,271
You were hiding them.

774
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:56,470
Darling, you're tired.

775
01:18:56,512 --> 01:18:58,343
I found the pentacle.

776
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:03,344
The pentacle?
What are you talking about?

777
01:19:05,187 --> 01:19:07,178
I found the pentacle, Claire.

778
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,093
She's been stalking you, Peter.

779
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,891
No. Give me the gun, Claire!

780
01:20:23,498 --> 01:20:25,762
Maya, look.

781
01:20:29,938 --> 01:20:32,406
Little one! Ah, yes.

782
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:34,466
Thank God you're better.

783
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:43,111
We really need your help.

784
01:20:43,151 --> 01:20:45,915
We only have
a couple of more hours.

785
01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:49,117
Don't worry.

786
01:20:49,157 --> 01:20:51,216
Not about the transformation.

787
01:20:53,328 --> 01:20:55,626
What do you mean,
don't worry about it?

788
01:20:55,664 --> 01:20:58,064
In my prayers...

789
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:02,434
I came to realize that we've
been fooling ourselves.

790
01:21:02,471 --> 01:21:05,565
Probably blown this out
of all proportion.

791
01:21:06,908 --> 01:21:09,809
And that God...

792
01:21:09,845 --> 01:21:13,246
would never allow
a thing like this to happen.

793
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:16,945
I told you.
This was a myth all along.

794
01:21:19,688 --> 01:21:20,916
So we won.

795
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:26,189
That's right, Maya.

796
01:21:26,228 --> 01:21:28,924
We won.

797
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:33,027
Christ triumphed over Satan.

798
01:21:36,805 --> 01:21:38,830
That's right, Maya.

799
01:21:38,874 --> 01:21:44,244
So if Christ won, that means--
What does that mean, Father?

800
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:47,442
Satan is the weak one.

801
01:21:47,482 --> 01:21:51,919
He's the coward who trembles.

802
01:21:51,953 --> 01:21:55,081
The whimpering slave of God.

803
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:57,523
Maya, that's enough.

804
01:21:57,559 --> 01:21:59,186
Come here.

805
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:15,772
He will make Christ crawl...

806
01:22:17,179 --> 01:22:18,806
through the shit!

807
01:22:31,226 --> 01:22:34,627
He's our best chance
if we can get him back.

808
01:22:40,736 --> 01:22:42,033
What can I do?

809
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:44,732
Just wait outside.

810
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:56,050
So are you going to do it?

811
01:22:56,084 --> 01:22:58,143
I don't have the expertise.

812
01:22:59,421 --> 01:23:01,355
Father Thomas should officiate.

813
01:23:02,758 --> 01:23:04,885
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

814
01:23:04,926 --> 01:23:07,895
Help me overcome all fear
and selfishness.

815
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:09,897
Help me find
and keep my strength.

816
01:23:09,931 --> 01:23:12,229
Help me fight the evil
I'm about to see...

817
01:23:12,267 --> 01:23:14,497
with all the courage
you can give.

818
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:16,470
Amen.

819
01:23:16,505 --> 01:23:17,767
Amen.

820
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:31,639
Father, please don't die.

821
01:25:32,707 --> 01:25:34,538
Don't die.

822
01:25:43,451 --> 01:25:44,748
Go...

823
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:49,623
and find his uncle.

824
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:57,191
Don't die.

825
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:03,804
"God appears,
and God is light...

826
01:26:03,838 --> 01:26:06,864
"to those poor souls
who dwell in night.

827
01:26:06,908 --> 01:26:08,341
"But does a human form...

828
01:26:08,376 --> 01:26:11,937
"display to those
who dwell in realms of day?"

829
01:26:15,016 --> 01:26:16,643
Welcome.

830
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:37,628
Did you really think
that you could just end this?

831
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:43,373
They had
their two thousand years.

832
01:26:43,411 --> 01:26:46,175
Now it's our turn.

833
01:27:05,233 --> 01:27:06,757
Everything you said...

834
01:27:06,801 --> 01:27:09,167
Everything you did...

835
01:27:09,204 --> 01:27:11,502
I did for you, Peter.

836
01:27:11,539 --> 01:27:13,700
I love you.

837
01:27:13,742 --> 01:27:15,266
Think of it.

838
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:18,245
I'm giving you a gift.

839
01:27:18,279 --> 01:27:20,304
Absolute power.

840
01:27:20,348 --> 01:27:24,182
Peter, absolute knowledge.

841
01:27:24,219 --> 01:27:27,450
But you raised me
like your own son.

842
01:27:27,489 --> 01:27:30,788
Why, yes.
You are my son, Peter.

843
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,918
You are my son.

844
01:27:35,296 --> 01:27:38,026
Peter, don't you see
the opportunities...

845
01:27:38,066 --> 01:27:39,761
that lie before you?

846
01:27:42,103 --> 01:27:45,038
You killed my parents.
How could you?

847
01:27:45,073 --> 01:27:46,199
I had to.

848
01:27:46,241 --> 01:27:48,971
No! It's what they want.

849
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:50,807
Don't do it, Peter!

850
01:27:50,845 --> 01:27:55,544
Do it! It will be
my ultimate sacrifice.

851
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:58,711
If you commit murder,
you accept evil.

852
01:28:02,957 --> 01:28:04,356
Drop it.

853
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:18,836
You have no idea how much you
look like your mother right now.

854
01:28:32,353 --> 01:28:35,550
Thank you, Maya.
You served us quite well.

855
01:29:58,606 --> 01:30:00,039
Go ahead.

856
01:30:03,378 --> 01:30:07,280
I'm not strong enough for this.

857
01:30:26,634 --> 01:30:28,602
Listen to me.

858
01:30:28,636 --> 01:30:31,264
I'll see you tomorrow.

859
01:31:09,077 --> 01:31:12,376
It didn't happen. Maya.

860
01:31:12,413 --> 01:31:15,871
It didn't happen.

861
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,485
I'm OK.

862
01:31:23,258 --> 01:31:25,692
Put the gun down.

863
01:31:25,727 --> 01:31:28,855
Maya, please, it's me.

864
01:31:28,897 --> 01:31:31,695
It's me. It's me.
