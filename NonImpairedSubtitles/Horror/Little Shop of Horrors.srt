of the month of September...

2
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:19,746
...in an early year of a decade
not too long before our own...

3
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:26,421
...the human race suddenly encountered
a deadly threat to its very existence.

4
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:32,758
And this terrifying enemy surfaced,
as such enemies often do...

5
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:38,331
...in the seemingly most innocent
and unlikely of places.

Very little, Mr. Mushnik!

31
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:33,003
...and at his press conference today,
President Kennedy fielded questions...

...here in the window, then maybe....

158
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,084
Maybe what? Maybe what?

159
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:40,862
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

160
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:44,924
Just because you put a strange plant
in the window people don't suddenly--

161
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,697
Excuse me. l couldn't help noticing
that strange and interesting plant.

162
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:50,739
What is it?

163
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:53,102
lt's an Audrey ll.

164
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,570
l've never seen anything like it before.

165
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:56,613
No one has.

166
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:58,075
Where did you get it?

167
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:04,349
Remember that total eclipse of the sun
about a week ago?

168
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,353
I was walking
in the wholesale flower district that day.

169
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:13,696
And I passed by this place
where this old Chinese man....

170
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:18,324
He sometimes sells me
weird and exotic cuttings.

171
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,204
'Cause he knows strange plants
are my hobby.

172
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,143
He didn't have anything unusual
there that day.

173
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:32,010
So I wasjust about to,
you know, walk on by...

174
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:40,315
...when suddenly and without warning,
there was this...

175
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:43,188
...total eclipse of the sun.

176
00:13:43,794 --> 00:13:45,284
It got very dark.

177
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,326
And there was this strange humming
sound, like something from another world.

178
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:54,098
When the light came back,
this weird plant wasjust sitting there.

179
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:57,798
Just stuck in among the zinnias.

180
00:13:57,942 --> 00:13:59,466
''Audrey ll.''

181
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:02,541
I could have sworn
it hadn't been there before...

182
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,147
...but the old Chinese man
sold it to me anyways...

183
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:08,778
...for $1.95.

184
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:24,498
Well, that's an unusual story,
and a fascinating plant.

185
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:30,663
Oh, while l'm here,
l might as well take $50 worth of roses.

186
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:32,140
$50!

187
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:35,708
Can you break $100?

188
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,678
$100?

189
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:38,576
No.

190
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,977
Then l'll just have to take twice as many.

191
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,207
Twice as many?

192
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:43,577
Twice as many!

193
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:45,285
Twice as many!

194
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,324
That plant in the window,
it's simply amazing!

195
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:53,663
That plant in the window,
wherever did you get it?

196
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:57,132
-There it is, Marge.
-Oh, my gosh, it's peculiar.

197
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:18,813
Thank you very much, sir!

198
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:20,155
Thank you!

199
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:21,885
Thank you! Come again!

200
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,120
Come and look at the weirdo plant
some more!

201
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:27,164
lt's just going to get bigger
and more interesting.

202
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:32,536
Just don't stand there! Quick, quick!

203
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:34,969
Put the plant back.... What did you call it?

204
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,971
Audrey ll.

205
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,441
Put that Audrey ll back in the window
where passersby can see it.

206
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:43,244
l never thought this could happen!

207
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:45,509
l'm taking us all out to dinner tonight!

208
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,042
l'd love to, Mr. Mushnik, but l have a date.

209
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:52,152
With that nogoodnik?

210
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:56,023
You don't need a date with him.
You need major medical.

211
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,888
He's a rebel, Mr. Mushnik,
but he makes good money.

212
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,127
Besides...

213
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:05,900
...he's the only fella l got.

214
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:08,661
Enjoy dinner. Goodnight, Seymour.

215
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:10,964
Goodnight, Audrey.

216
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:13,398
Poor girl.

217
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:15,342
Are we still going out?

218
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:24,250
You're not going anywhere!

219
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:27,256
You're staying right here
and taking care of that sick plant!

220
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:31,553
l told you it's been giving me trouble.
Audrey ll is not a healthy girl.

221
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,995
Between us, neither is Audrey l.

222
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:35,698
lf l only knew what breed it was.

223
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:38,860
Who cares what breed it is?
Look what it's done for business.

224
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:42,667
Work. Nurse this plant back to health.
l'm counting on you.

225
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,832
-l know.
-You do?

226
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:46,069
-l do.
-So fix. Good night.

227
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:28,180
Twoey, l don't know what else
l can do for you.

228
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:31,449
Are you sickly, little plant,
or are you just plain stubborn?

229
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,487
What is it you want?

230
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:36,619
What is it you need?

231
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:41,765
''l've given you sunshine
l've given you dirt

232
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,037
''You've given me nothing
But heartache and hurt

233

Oh pod, how you tease

238
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:18,458
''Now please, grow for me

239
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:23,699

00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:27,038

Like l'm supposed to

241
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:29,346
''You're barely alive

242
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:32,539
''l've tried you at levels of moisture

''From desert to mud

00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:38,118
''l've given you grow lights
And mineral supplements

245
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,622
''What do you want from me?
Blood?''

246
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:43,716
Damn roses! Damn thorns!

247
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:57,457
''l've given you sunlight
l've given you rain

''Looks like you're not happy

''...grow for me! ''

254
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,674
W-S-K-I-D.

255
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:15,875
Skid Row radio.

256
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:19,471
You're listening to radio station WSKID,
home of the hits.

257
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,144
Injust a few minutes we'll bring you
Wink Wilkensen's Weird World...

258
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,712
...where wonderful people
bring in their weird things.

259
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:28,792
But first, the weather.

260
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,296
Thank you. The weather today will be
partly cloudy with a chance of rain. Sorry.

261
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:38,266
The high temperature will be
in the low 50s tonight....

262
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:43,933
-Excuse me. l was told to come--
-You're next.

263
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:47,704
High tomorrow should be in the low 70s
with the low in the high 60s.

264
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:50,906
In the suburbs, the sun should be out
through most of the day...

265
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:54,781
...except for some cloudy patches
towards the evening.

266
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:57,243
The barometer reading should be 21.6.

267
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:58,788
The wind will be about...

268
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,720
...I'd say 12 miles per hour.

269
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,423
The sun will be rising tomorrow
at about 7:17 a.m...

270
00:22:07,497 --> 00:22:10,398
...and it should be setting around 6:29 p.m.

271
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:13,761
The cold front is moving in
from the southwest.

272
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:15,429
It should brighten up by noon.

273
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,268
The weekend should be mild.

274
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:20,974
The average mean temperature
for the season....

275
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:27,811
You're listening to radio station WSKID.

276
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,619
And now, Wink Wilkensen's Weird World,
with your host, Wink Wilkensen.

277
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,252
Hi! lt's Weird Wink Wilkensen,
laughin' and scratchin' at ya.

278
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,557
How's everybody today?

279
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:43,191
l got a bit of a stiff neck.
Let me just fix this up.

280
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:44,598
That feels a lot better!

281
00:22:44,668 --> 00:22:48,434
l got a great show for you today
with some wonderful weird stuff!

282
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:51,368
What are you doing here?

283
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:55,509
Please, put your clothes back on!
You can't do this to me!

284
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,444
What if your husband were to walk in?

285
00:22:57,514 --> 00:22:59,414
l'm here, Wink. l love your show...

286
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:02,475
...but l've got to kill you both
with this machine gun.

287
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:05,443
You got me!

288
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:10,823
l feel so very weird!

289
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:14,186
Our first guest is a young man...

290
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:17,290
...you probably read about
in the newspapers by the name of...

291
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:20,194
...Seymour Krelborn. ls that correct?

292
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,296
Who has discovered a new breed of plant
unknown on this planet.

293
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:26,069
Let me play you down
to your seat, Seymour.

294
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:29,837
Hello, Seymour!

295
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:32,980
Hello, Wink.

296
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,677
l wish you folks at home could see this.

297
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:38,983
Seymour, where did you get
such a weird plant?

298
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:46,660
Well, you remember that total eclipse
of the sun about a week ago?

299
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:51,759
And thus we conclude our interview
with the young botanical--

300
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:53,700
Mind if I call you a genius?

301
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,794
Gosh, no!

302
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:58,102
The genius who has discovered
this amazing, unidentified plant.

303
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:01,440
I'd like to remind our listeners
that the Audrey II is on display...

304
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:04,275
...exclusively at
Mushnik's Skid Row Florists.

305
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:06,145
-Did l miss it?
-Mushnik's.

306
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:09,116
The address!

307
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,587
The address!

308
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:14,556
l said, mention the address!

309
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:19,860
Oh, well. lt's still good advertising.

310
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:22,788
Seymour's first radio broadcast.

311
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:26,597
l wanted to hear it so bad.
l tried to be on time, but--

00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:52,095
l wish l had that stamina.
l can only go so long.

633
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:55,627
That's how l want to be.
l don't ever want to have to be just--

634
00:46:56,903 --> 00:46:57,961
Comfy?

635
00:46:58,505 --> 00:46:59,904
Yes, Doctor.

636
00:47:01,074 --> 00:47:03,008
l remember the first time
l went to a dentist.

637
00:47:03,076 --> 00:47:05,738
l thought, ''What a neat job!
lf only l were a dentist.''

638
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:07,973
The dentist l went to had the greatest car.

639
00:47:08,048 --> 00:47:12,382
He had a Corvette. Everybody calls him
''Doctor'' and he's not really a doctor.

640
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:14,117
Oh, my God!

641
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:21,053
l got out of there okay,
but after it was all finished...

642
00:47:21,595 --> 00:47:24,530
...they gave me a candy bar.
l thought, ''l get a candy bar?''

643
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:28,968
You go through that and get chocolate.

644
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:34,000
You work with incredible professionals,
using incredibly wonderful equipment....

645
00:47:34,274 --> 00:47:35,741
Let's look at that mouth.

646
00:47:37,844 --> 00:47:39,072
Say, ''Aaah.''

647
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:00,322
Yeah, great!

648
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:03,632
You are something special.

649
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:05,102
You are something special!

650
00:48:08,575 --> 00:48:10,008
Thank you!

651
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:18,645
lt's your professionalism that l respect.

652
00:48:20,053 --> 00:48:23,216
Don't stop, Doc! Don't stop!
Come on! More!

653
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:27,625
What do you want? Say, ''Please! ''

654
00:48:37,904 --> 00:48:40,372
l'm going to get a candy bar!

655
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:05,993
Get out!

656
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:07,566
What's wrong?

657
00:49:07,634 --> 00:49:08,760
Get out of here!

658
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:14,165
What's the matter?

659
00:49:17,477 --> 00:49:19,035
Go on! Get out of here!

660
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:21,237
This way.

661
00:49:21,314 --> 00:49:24,681
l'm gonna tell each and every one
of my friends about you--

662
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:27,182
What's this?

663
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:31,856
Goddamn sicko!

664
00:49:34,694 --> 00:49:37,060
Let me ask you something.
Does this scare you?

665
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:37,989
Yes.

666
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:41,659
Would you like if l took this and made
straight for your goddamn incisors?

667
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:42,861
lt'd hurt, right?

668
00:49:43,103 --> 00:49:44,502
You'd scream!

669
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:46,138
Get your ass in there!

670
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:51,406
-Don't l know you?
-Seymour Krelborn. We met yesterday.

671
00:49:51,644 --> 00:49:53,669
Your mouth's a mess, kid.

672
00:49:54,047 --> 00:49:57,539
That wisdom tooth.
We'll rip that bugger right out of there.

673
00:49:57,617 --> 00:50:01,314
What do you say?
There's always time for dental hygiene.

674
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:05,057
You ever seen the results
of a neglected mouth?

675
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:07,348
Look, Seymour.

676
00:50:08,128 --> 00:50:10,153
This could happen to you.

677
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:13,092
Unless l take immediate action!

678
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:14,530
What's that?

679
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:15,823
The drill.

680
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:17,362
lt's rusty!

681
00:50:17,437 --> 00:50:18,734
lt's an antique.

682
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:21,306
They don't make them like this anymore.

683
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:22,439
Sturdy...

684
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:24,139
...heavy...

685
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:25,435
...dull.

686
00:50:29,315 --> 00:50:31,647
l'm going to want some gas for this.

687
00:50:32,919 --> 00:50:35,752
Thank God.
l thought you wouldn't use any.

688
00:50:35,822 --> 00:50:38,950
The gas isn't for you, Seymour. lt's for me.

689
00:50:39,092 --> 00:50:41,925
You see, l want to really enjoy this.

690
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:46,356
ln fact, l'm going to use
my special gas mask!

691
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,594
l find a little giggle gas before l begin
increases my pleasure enormously.

692
00:50:57,577 --> 00:50:59,044
Here we go!

693
00:51:12,158 --> 00:51:14,126
Oh, Seymour, l'm flying!

694
00:51:16,062 --> 00:51:18,530
The things l'm going to do to that mouth!

695
00:51:39,018 --> 00:51:40,645
What the hell is that?

696
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:41,981
A gun?

697
00:51:43,423 --> 00:51:45,550
The kid's got a goddamn revolver!

698
00:51:48,661 --> 00:51:50,322
l'm in trouble now, huh?

699
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:54,433
Wait till l turn this gas off.

700
00:52:00,807 --> 00:52:02,570
Give me a hand, would you?

701
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:05,103
No, l guess you wouldn't, would you?

702
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,642
l could asphyx--

703
00:52:24,664 --> 00:52:26,097
What'd l ever do to you?

704
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,600
Nothing. lt's what you did to her.

705
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:31,303
Her who?

706
00:52:33,773 --> 00:52:35,832
Oh, her.

707
00:53:36,836 --> 00:53:38,326
Chop it up.

708
00:53:38,871 --> 00:53:39,895
What?

709
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:41,436
Feed me!

710
00:53:41,507 --> 00:53:42,769
Okay, okay.

711
00:56:23,169 --> 00:56:25,160
Audrey, what'd they say to you?

712
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:26,530
Who?

713
00:56:26,973 --> 00:56:27,962
The police.

714
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,371
Oh, nothing.

715
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,037
Talk to me. Tell me what they said.

716
00:56:33,946 --> 00:56:35,971
lt's Orin. They say he's disappeared!

717
00:56:37,316 --> 00:56:38,749
The police told you that?

718
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:40,979
They suspect foul play.

719
00:56:42,522 --> 00:56:43,682
They do?

720
00:56:43,756 --> 00:56:47,021
His receptionist, this morning,
found the place a shambles.

721
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,455
Gas masks everywhere.

722
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:51,626
Things all over the floor.

723
00:56:52,665 --> 00:56:54,064
They think....

724
00:56:55,334 --> 00:56:57,632
l can't even think about what they think.

725
00:57:10,149 --> 00:57:11,810
Don't cry, Audrey.

726
00:57:13,352 --> 00:57:16,378
Would it be so terrible
if something had happened to him?

727
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,949
Seymour, what a thing to say!

728
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:22,317
Well, would it?

729
00:57:23,963 --> 00:57:25,954
lt wouldn't be terrible at all.

730
00:57:26,999 --> 00:57:28,398
lt'd be a miracle.

731
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:32,935
Not to mention all the money l'd save
on Epsom salts and Ace bandages.

732
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,966
You see?

733
00:57:36,008 --> 00:57:38,499
But l'd still feel guilty.

734
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:43,377
lf he met with foul play
or some terrible accident of some kind...

735
00:57:43,616 --> 00:57:46,141
...it'd be partly my fault just because...

736
00:57:47,987 --> 00:57:49,887
...secretly l wished it.

737
00:57:49,956 --> 00:57:53,858
Don't you waste another minute
thinking about that creep!

738
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,987
There's a lot of guys that'd give anything
to go out with you.

739
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:01,427
Nice guys.

740
00:58:01,968 --> 00:58:04,869
l don't deserve a nice guy, Seymour.

741
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:08,465
-That's not true.
-You don't know the half of it!

742
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,600
l've led a terrible life.

743
00:58:10,776 --> 00:58:14,735
l deserved a creep like Orin Scrivello, DDS.

744
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:18,607
You know where l met him?

745
00:58:20,953 --> 00:58:22,443
ln The Gutter.

746
00:58:22,755 --> 00:58:24,017
The Gutter?

747
00:58:24,156 --> 00:58:26,624
The Gutter. lt's a nightspot.

748
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:30,822
l worked there on my nights off
when we weren't making much money.

749
00:58:30,897 --> 00:58:32,455
l'd put on...

750
00:58:32,632 --> 00:58:36,068
...cheap and tasteless outfits,
not nice ones like this.

751
00:58:37,303 --> 00:58:39,897
Low and nasty apparel.

752
00:58:40,306 --> 00:58:42,501
That's all behind you now.

753
00:58:42,675 --> 00:58:44,734
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

754
00:58:45,544 --> 00:58:48,536
You're a very nice person.
l always knew you were.

755
00:58:50,016 --> 00:58:53,417
Underneath the bruises and the handcuffs,
you know what l saw?

756
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,412
A girl l respected.

757
00:58:56,822 --> 00:58:58,221
l still do.

01:01:24,603 --> 01:01:26,594
''Yes, you can

797
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:31,665
''Learn how to be more

798
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:35,370
''The girl that's inside me

799
01:01:36,515 --> 01:01:39,643
''With sweet understanding

800
01:01:40,553 --> 01:01:43,545
''With sweet understanding

801
01:01:49,562 --> 01:01:56,434
''Seymour's your man''

802
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:11,835
You love her madly, don't you, schmuck?

803
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:14,004
Mr. Mushnik, you scared me.

804
01:03:14,446 --> 01:03:18,382
l scared him?
After what l've seen, l scared him?

805
01:03:19,952 --> 01:03:22,716
Do you think l didn't know, huh?
Oh, l knew.

806
01:03:22,955 --> 01:03:25,822
l knew you'd lay down here,
on your pathetic little cot...

807
01:03:25,991 --> 01:03:27,322
...and dream about her.

808
01:03:27,393 --> 01:03:29,861
But l didn't know the lengths
to which you'd go...

809
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:32,193
...the depths to which you'd sink!

810
01:03:32,831 --> 01:03:35,356
What depths? What sink?
What are you talking about?

811
01:03:35,434 --> 01:03:37,629
Little red dots all over the linoleum.

812
01:03:38,037 --> 01:03:40,528
Little red spots on the concrete outside.

813
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:45,472
l'm talking blood, Krelborn.
l'm talking under my own roof.

814
01:03:46,845 --> 01:03:48,073
An axe murderer!

815
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,846
''He's got your number now''

816
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:52,679
l saw everything.

817
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:55,117
''He knowsjust what you've done''

818
01:03:55,187 --> 01:03:57,280
Everything you did to her boyfriend.

819
01:03:57,356 --> 01:03:59,916
''You've got no place to hide''

820
01:04:00,092 --> 01:04:01,559
l saw you chopping him.

821
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:04,024
''You've got nowhere to run''

822
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:07,260
lt's true. l chopped him up,
but l didn't kill him!

823
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:09,392
''He knows your life of crime''

824
01:04:09,568 --> 01:04:11,433
Tell it to the police.

825
01:04:11,537 --> 01:04:14,233
''l think it's suppertime!

826
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,801
''Come on, come on

827
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,172
''Think about all those offers

828
01:04:22,248 --> 01:04:24,341
''Come on, come on

01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,615
''Your future with Audrey

01:04:26,685 --> 01:04:28,414
''Come on, come on

831

''Ain't no time to turn squeamish

832
01:04:31,924 --> 01:04:33,016
''Come on

01:04:33,092 --> 01:04:35,322
''l swear on all my spores

834
01:04:35,527 --> 01:04:39,156
''When he's gone

835
01:04:54,947 --> 01:04:58,041
''lt's suppertime''

836
01:05:03,389 --> 01:05:06,290
You know, Krelborn, it kills me doing this.

837
01:05:07,993 --> 01:05:12,089
But considering you're almost
like a son to me, l'm thinking...

838
01:05:12,164 --> 01:05:14,394
...maybe we don't have to go to the police.

839
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:16,329
We don't?

840
01:05:17,102 --> 01:05:18,535
l'm thinking...

841
01:05:18,904 --> 01:05:23,307
...what if l kept my mouth shut and
gave you a one-way ticket out of town?

842
01:05:24,777 --> 01:05:25,937
You'd do that, sir?

843
01:05:28,113 --> 01:05:31,412
You could lay low for a while,
say 30, 40 years.

844
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:34,646
Meanwhile, l would keep the plant.

845
01:05:35,721 --> 01:05:36,688
The plant?

846
01:05:36,755 --> 01:05:40,748
Of course, you'd have to teach me
how to take care of it while you're away.

847
01:05:41,026 --> 01:05:44,018
Give me your secret gardening tips.

848
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,065
But then, if you'd rather hang....

849
01:06:00,012 --> 01:06:01,877
What do l have to do?

850
01:06:02,815 --> 01:06:04,305
Just feed it.

851
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:06,144
Feed it what?

852
01:06:12,624 --> 01:06:13,613
Minerals.

853
01:06:16,095 --> 01:06:18,586
Thursdays, you should give it water.

854
01:06:25,104 --> 01:06:26,435
But whatever you do....

855
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:28,634
Yes?

856
01:06:32,644 --> 01:06:33,804
Whatever you do....

857
01:06:33,912 --> 01:06:35,311
Yeah?

858
01:06:40,486 --> 01:06:41,783
What the hell is...?

859
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,564
''lt's suppertime''

860
01:06:59,772 --> 01:07:01,137
Seymour Krelborn!

861
01:07:01,373 --> 01:07:05,434
Finally, we meet you! What an occasion!
Let's toast it. Up yours. Relax.

862
01:07:06,211 --> 01:07:07,838
Let's talk turkey. Sign here.

863
01:07:07,913 --> 01:07:10,279
-We'll book you on lecturing tours.
-Yes, darling.

864
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:12,078
We're sending photographers Thursday.

865
01:07:12,151 --> 01:07:14,517
So get the plant ready
and wear a clean shirt.

866
01:07:14,586 --> 01:07:16,247
-Just sign this release.
-Need a pen?

867
01:07:16,321 --> 01:07:18,915
Aren't you thrilled?
lt's the cover of Life magazine!

868
01:07:18,991 --> 01:07:19,787
Dessert?

869
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:21,955
Son, it's a cinch to get ratings.

870
01:07:22,027 --> 01:07:24,359
-The title is Marvin's.
-The concept is mine.

871
01:07:24,596 --> 01:07:26,996
The first weekly gardening show
on the network!

872
01:07:27,065 --> 01:07:29,625
-And you're gonna host it, you lucky kid.
-Sign!

873
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:34,035
''They say the meek shall inherit
You know the Book doesn't lie

874
01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:38,971
''lt's not a question of merit
lt's not demand and supply

875
01:07:39,445 --> 01:07:41,606
''They say the meek are gonna get it.

876
01:07:44,483 --> 01:07:47,145
''You know the meek are gonna get
what's coming to them''

877
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:14,169
Oh, my God!

878
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,548
And here he is himself,
Mr. Seymour Krelborn!

879
01:08:19,284 --> 01:08:21,411
Mr. Krelborn, there are many questions...

880
01:08:21,487 --> 01:08:24,115
...the people in our television audience
have for you.

881
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:26,657
Come and tell our viewers
at home and elsewhere...

882
01:08:26,725 --> 01:08:30,320
...about this particularly amazing
agricultural phenomenon...

883
01:08:30,395 --> 01:08:34,491
...that's made you one of the most talked
about plant scientists in the country--

884
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:38,525
Cut!

885
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:40,968
What happened
to the goddamned greenery?

886
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:43,607
-lt just needs to be fed.
-So feed it.

887
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,607
l can't feed it. Not now.

888
01:08:46,678 --> 01:08:48,839
Then l'll feed it. Where's the plant food?

889
01:08:48,914 --> 01:08:52,179
lt doesn't eat plant food.
And l can't feed it now.

890
01:08:53,018 --> 01:08:54,178
Leave me alone.

891
01:08:54,253 --> 01:08:55,447
All of you.

892
01:08:56,054 --> 01:08:57,146
Just go away.

893
01:08:57,222 --> 01:08:59,486
Leave me alone. Get out of here.

894
01:08:59,558 --> 01:09:01,253
Go away. Leave me alone!

895
01:09:03,695 --> 01:09:04,855
Everybody go away!

896
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,056
Leave me alone!

897
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:08,130
You're hysterical.

898
01:09:08,634 --> 01:09:09,794
l know. l'm sorry.

899
01:09:21,547 --> 01:09:23,572
What am l gonna do?

900
01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:27,576
l never should've started, but l did.
Now, if l don't feed it, it'll die.

901
01:09:27,653 --> 01:09:29,814
l'll lose her, l'll lose everything.

902
01:09:30,923 --> 01:09:32,356
Who are you talking to?

903
01:09:33,258 --> 01:09:34,452
Nobody.

904
01:09:34,893 --> 01:09:36,656
You're acting funny.

905
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:39,262
lt wasn't nice throwing those people out.

906
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:42,164
Those men said
Seymour Krelborn's Gardening Tips...

907
01:09:42,301 --> 01:09:44,895
...is sure to be a very big TV show.

908
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:47,605
l know. l'm sorry. l feel terrible.

909
01:09:47,673 --> 01:09:48,731
Well, you shouldn't.

910
01:09:48,807 --> 01:09:52,265
They're coming back tomorrow
and they'll bring you a great big check.

911
01:09:54,246 --> 01:09:56,214
l wish you were enjoying your success.

912
01:09:57,749 --> 01:09:59,683
They said they're coming back
with money?

913
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:00,911
Tomorrow.

914
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:03,646
Then we could afford to get out of here.

915
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:04,848
What do you mean?

916
01:10:04,923 --> 01:10:07,653
That's it. After tomorrow
we could leave here together.

917
01:10:08,093 --> 01:10:09,219
Together?

918
01:10:10,596 --> 01:10:12,257
lf you'll have me.

919
01:10:12,331 --> 01:10:13,821
Audrey, will you have me?

920
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:15,792
What do you mean?

921
01:10:16,768 --> 01:10:18,429
Marry me, Audrey.

922
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,137
Seymour, this is so sudden.

923
01:10:20,639 --> 01:10:21,503
Will you?

924
01:10:27,846 --> 01:10:28,710
Sure.

925
01:10:29,915 --> 01:10:32,440
Then that's it!
We'll go get married right now.

926
01:10:33,518 --> 01:10:37,750
Tomorrow l'll be on TV, get the money
and then we'll live happily ever after.

927
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:41,190
Oh, Audrey, l'll give you a wonderful life
with no plants, l promise.

928
01:10:41,259 --> 01:10:43,921
-No plants at all.
-You're talking peculiar again.

929
01:10:43,996 --> 01:10:46,396
We'll start tonight.
We'll go to City Hall, get married...

930
01:10:46,465 --> 01:10:49,628
...and spend the night somewhere safe.
Some nice hotel.

931
01:10:51,737 --> 01:10:53,637
l've got to get ready!

932
01:10:53,705 --> 01:10:55,263
Hurry. Hurry.

933
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:02,407
Feed me.

934
01:12:03,542 --> 01:12:05,373
Under no circumstances.

935
01:12:05,444 --> 01:12:06,604
Feed me.

936
01:12:07,245 --> 01:12:09,406
l will not, so stop asking.

937
01:12:09,514 --> 01:12:10,845
Feed me!

938
01:12:11,016 --> 01:12:12,210
No! No more!

939
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:14,181
l can't take living with the guilt.

940
01:12:14,786 --> 01:12:16,253
Tough titty.

941
01:12:16,588 --> 01:12:18,146
Watch your language.

942
01:12:18,223 --> 01:12:20,783
Cut the crap. Bring on the meat.

943
01:12:23,261 --> 01:12:26,424
l'll run to the corner, pick you up
some nice ground round.

944
01:12:26,665 --> 01:12:29,998
-How about that?
-Don't do me no favors!

945
01:12:32,471 --> 01:12:34,769
lt's my last offer. Yes or no?

946
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:39,636
You sure do drive a hard bargain.

947
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:43,270
Done. Fine. Great.

948
01:12:45,884 --> 01:12:48,478
Don't think you're getting dessert.

949
01:14:24,983 --> 01:14:27,611
-Hello.
-''Hey, little lady, hello''

950
01:14:29,187 --> 01:14:30,415
Who is this?

951
01:14:30,488 --> 01:14:33,048
''You're looking cute as can be''

952
01:14:33,358 --> 01:14:34,723
ls this someone l know?

953
01:14:34,793 --> 01:14:37,125
''You're looking mighty sweet''

954
01:14:38,864 --> 01:14:40,058
Seymour!

955
01:14:40,165 --> 01:14:42,998

No, and you ain't in Kansas, neither.

''Sure do. l'll drink it straight''

But it was so cute and harmless...

984
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,971
...and we started doing business
and making money and you liked me--

985

987

You mean, you'd still like me
even if l wasn't famous?

988
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:22,760
l'd still love you, Seymour.

...and a sweet little house.

You're the most wonderful person
that ever lived.

993

Patrick Martin, Licensing and Marketing,
World Botanical Enterprises.

1007

Son, kid, boy, are we gonna make
a fortune together!

-He's not interested.
-He will be.

1009
01:18:28,593 --> 01:18:31,756
Me and the guys at the home office
have been following this plant of yours.

1010
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:34,958
We've come up with one incredible idea.

1011
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,363
We're very proud of it.

1012
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:39,034
Picture this.

1013
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:43,799
We take leaf cuttings,
develop little Audrey lls...

1014
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:47,637
...and sell them to florist shops
across the nation.

1015
01:18:48,613 --> 01:18:51,878
Pretty soon every household in America
could have one.

1016
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:54,318
Every household in America!

1017
01:18:54,919 --> 01:18:57,547
For starters, kid. Why this thing could go...

1018
01:18:58,189 --> 01:18:59,156
...worldwide!

1019
01:18:59,757 --> 01:19:00,746
Worldwide?

1020
01:19:00,992 --> 01:19:02,482

Audrey lls everywhere!

1022
01:19:04,929 --> 01:19:08,330
With the right advertising,
this thing could be bigger than Hula-Hoops.

1023
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:09,730
Bigger than Hula-Hoops?

1024
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:13,032
What do you say, Seymour?
Do we have a deal?

1025
01:19:15,206 --> 01:19:18,767
No! Keep your contract.
Nobody's touching that plant.

1026
01:19:18,843 --> 01:19:20,504
We're offering a lot of money.

1027

Keep it and get out of here!

-Yeah, l'm nuts.

He'll keep eating until there's nothing left.

1034
