147
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,220
       What was your son's name?

148
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,123
    I said after.

149
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,127
        Well, these are actually
        two separate rooms

150
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,896
          and we already cleared
          that one, so...

151
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,236
           Andre.

152
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,707
        His name was
        Andre Anthony.

153
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,248
Make sure there
isn't a box of cookies
hiding in there.

154
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,919
              Did you have
              any other kids?

155
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,255
      Rules of the game,
          my friend.

156
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,996
        So?

157
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,397
       Did you?

158
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,134
           ( scoffs )
           You know, you could
           be a spy.

159
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,136
                Or a cop.

160
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,741
               ( sighs )

161
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,476
                  No.

162
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,412
         One was enough for me.

163
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,182
        And Andre was a handful,
        like you.

164
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:48,453
       Does this hallway
       count as a room?

165
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,222
           If you can find
           something we can use.

166
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,777
 This is the only thing
 I could find.

167
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,779
    Does it count?

168
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,115
              Technically, yes.

169
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,486
                    So?

170
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,891
  How long has it been?

171
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:34,398
      It happened after--

172
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,901
        you know, after
     everything happened.

173
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,806
    Does my dad know?

174
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,142
        Never told him.

175
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,513
             <i>Never told anyone</i>

176

        till just now.

177
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,391
          Your secret
       is safe with me.

178
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,296
   It's not really a secret.

179
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,567
   It's still safe with me.

180
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,431
                ( sighs )

181

00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,582
             Michonne?

183
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,254
 Everything okay?

184
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,323
             Yeah, it's fine.

185
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,731
  There's a baby in there.

186
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,333
                It's a dog.

187
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,682
  My dad let me name her.

188
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,557
      Maybe--

189
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,597
  maybe her and Andre
  are together somewhere.

    Your dad will wonder

    I don't know.

222
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,573
We were fighting biters
and you passed out

223

right after
we left the prison.
I didn't know what to do.

The back of the truck
seemed safer than
the side of the road.

         Yeah.

231
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,800

              How long since
              we passed it?

233
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,908
  Three hours.

234
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,280
         - Hey.
         - ( tapping )

235
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,616
         Hey, stop the truck.

   Hey, numbnuts,
   stop the truck.

             Stop the truck!

238
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,362
             Stop the truck!

239
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,848
Where the hell
are you going?

240
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,750
 Where the hell
 is he going?

241
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,752
  I don't know what your
  lady friend's told you

242
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,553
  about the special nature
  of the mission we're on,

243
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,855
      but this shit
      is time-sensitive

244
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,890
           and we're already
           way behind schedule.

245
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:23,827
       So I need you to turn
       your ass around and get
       back in the truck.

246
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,963
     - I gotta go.
     - It seems like
       neither one of you's

247
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,333
    been paying close enough
    attention to the hell on
    earth we've been living in.

248
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:32,670
 So let me tell you how
 to best avoid winding up
 just another dead-alive prick.

249
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,573
          You find some strong,
          like-minded comrades

250
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,043
     and you stay stuck together
     like wet on water.

251
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,812
                We need people.

252
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,848
         The more the better.
         We need each other,
         partner.

253
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,351
         Even with all that
         gear on your shoulder,
         you won't last a night.

254
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,687
              Not by yourself.

255
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,789
  I'll take my chances.

256
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,891
        I'm gonna have to insist

257
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,327
               that you hold
               the hell up.

258
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,028
             All right,
             believe it or not,

259
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,631
         the fate of the entire
         damn human race

260
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,933
          might depend on it.

261
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,405
    What the hell
    are you talking about?

262
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,775
     Who is this guy?

263
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,377
      I'm Sergeant Abraham Ford.

264
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,413
     And these are my companions
     Rosita Espinosa

265
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,115
        <i>and Dr. Eugene Porter.</i>

266
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:21,385

       Eugene to Washington, DC.

267
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,987
       Eugene's a scientist

268
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,024

00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,692
  I don't know
  how else to say it--

399
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:58,928
  saving the world
  is just--

400
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,698
( chuckles )
is just more important.

401
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,804
      I mean, even if he does
      find his wife,

402
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:10,540
               so what?

403
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,942
        How long do you think
        they'll live happily
        ever after

404
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:15,578
        if we don't get Eugene
        up to Washington?

405
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,915
    You think because
    I'm following Glenn,
    that makes me a good person?

406
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,850
              I'm not.

407
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:23,286
       ( laughs )

408
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,288
       You're good.

409
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,757
          You don't know
          anything about me.

410
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,660
      Just like I don't know
      anything about why you're
      going to Washington.

411
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,296
                 I get why
                 Eugene's going.

412
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,265
         He's the only one that
         knows how to end this.

413
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:38,968
      And Rosita, she loves you.
      She'd follow you anywhere.

414
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,971
     But why the hell you agreed
     to drive him halfway across
     the country...

415
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,641
Is that hard to believe,
I want to save the world?

416
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:46,709
                Because you're
                a good person?

417
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,680
               You don't have
               to tell me why.

418
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,782
           Just don't lie to me.

419
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,635
              Crazy Cheese?

420
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,928
What do you think?

421
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,668
                    Let's go.

422
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,674
               Let's go.

423
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,736
