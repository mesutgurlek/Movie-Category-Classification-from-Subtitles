Six years prior to the advent of<br /> DNA testing

5
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:37,798
Dear Mom,
Have a wonderful Christmas.

6
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,670
Hope wait.

7
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:45,893
Oh that is terrible.
 I can't write that.

8
00:02:45,894 --> 00:02:48,019
That is so bad.

9
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:53,154
We should've bought one of those cards
 where you had something in it.

10
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,612
Can not you suggest anything?
 - How about:

11
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:01,974
Dear Mom, Merry Christmas.
 - Well that.

12
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:03,743
Maybe next year

13
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:08,073
you can visit us,
 so that we don't have to travel across the country to see you.

14
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,531
Be nice.

15
00:03:11,953 --> 00:03:14,229
She likes you.
 - I know.

16
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:18,415
Jesus, this guy is really moving.

17
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,702
I need some inspiration.

18
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:23,102
It's desert.

19
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:27,793
I know.

20
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:30,954
Beth ...
 - It does not write.

21
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:34,185
You might want to sit up. Now, Beth.

22
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,648
You okay?

23
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:05,202
You sure?

24
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,145
We're ok.

25
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:19,073
A fucking maniac.

26
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,800
He certainly had us trapped.

27
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,107
We should stop for the night.

28
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:45,500
Call your mom, tell her we'll be there tomorrow.
 - No.

29
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:51,746
It's Christmas Eve, Cameron.
 I do not want to "wake up one motel room.

30
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:56,946
Who said anything about 'n motel?

31
00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:59,902
We'll pitch the Tent.

32
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,948
That is shorter.
 - Okay.

33
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:11,469
That's actually really good news,
 because we're almost out of gas.

34
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:32,935
Hey this place looks alright.

35
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:37,806
Maybe we should pitch the tent.

36
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,106
It's okay.

37
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,069
I'm gonna ask you master suite.

38
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,761
Good luck.

39
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:05,665
That's a nice car.
 - Maybe that visitor's suite already been booked.

40
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,402
Hello?

41
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:34,800
Jesus Christ.

42
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:37,066
You scared the shit out of me.

43
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,369
Welcome to the Overlander.

44
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,945
Just passing through are you?

45
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:47,010
We are underway to spend Christmas
 with my fiancee's mother.

46
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:48,982
Oh outstanding.

47
00:06:56,933 --> 00:07:00,039
Is that your fiance i think?

48
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,893
That's it.

49
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:07,834
Well chosen.

50
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:11,426
Look at the fucking tits on her.

51
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:13,883
Outstanding.

52
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,286
Loss' r.

53
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:21,391
Lemonade?

54
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:23,257
No i'm good thanks.

55
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:29,334
How much is it?
 - Around $ 105.

56
00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:33,385
The sign on the front
 is $ 35 per person.

57
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:37,225
And what about the little one?

58
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:40,584
What?

59
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,307
You mean the unborn baby?
 - Sure.

60
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,706
You can't be serious?

61
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:56,106
You don't like it,
next hotel is two ounces west.

62
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,667
Honey honey

63
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,235
You hear that?

64
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:38,517
What are you doing?

65
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:45,854
Ow get off.
 There are in there people.

66
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:48,096
I know,

67
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,448
Hi.

68
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:58,900
This is not exactly the Ritz.

69
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,044
They were friendly.

70
00:09:58,003 --> 00:10:00,238
It's okay baby.

71
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:03,703
Just relax.
 - Again the same dream came.

72
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:08,606
The baby away.

73
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:17,627
It's perfectly normal to have
strange dreams during pregnancy.

74
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:20,488
The only thing to remember ...

75
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,673
is that is just a dream.

76
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:26,936
Let's go inside.

77
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:28,964
Can get nice sleep.

78
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:37,890
It's gonna be okay.

79
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,375
How're you feeling?
 - better.

80
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,656
Miscarriage is almost impossible.

81
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:58,844
The doctor said that less than
 3% chance of recurrence.

82
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:00,518
I know.

83
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,174
I would not cope again.

84
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,290
Really.

85
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:10,499
You don't have to.

86
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,278
You're gonna give birth to a
 perfect, healthy baby girl.

87
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:20,997
She is gonna be smart, beautiful.

88
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:24,245
Just like her mom.

89
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,692
Try to get some sleep.

90
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:36,032
We need early in the morning.

91
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:05,157
And you're gonna see the brigade of some
wonderful and very unusal looking...

92
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:05,332
CLOSED

93
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:47,022
Ok so nothing missing?

94
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:49,883
No.
 - Right, You went to the Sky Dragon ...

95
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:51,840
came back and your fiance is gone?

96
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:56,298
The door was unlocked
 but you can't remember know if he himself had closed?

97
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:00,143
I was half sleepy.
 I'm almost positive I locked.

98
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:03,927
Hank,It's marvin.
you in there?

99
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,684
I'm coming.

100
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:10,347
Good evening.

101
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:14,869
This gentleman misplaced his fiancee.
It's what i'm gonna ask you couple of questions?

102
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,779
Have you seen her perhaps?
 Or something unusual?

103
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,258
No, it was real quiet.
 Just this fellow ...

104
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,030
and his fiancee in room 26.
 All the guests have gone.

105
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:33,075
Got a good relationship with your fiance?
 You quarrelled recently?

106
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,516
No, we 've a great relationship.

107
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:40,475
Any history of mental illness,
 amnesia, currently using drugs of any kind?

108
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:44,600
It's standard questions.
 - This is bullshit.

109
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,251
Beth is missing and she is pregnant.
 And I want to find her.

110
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:48,967
Got a picture of her?

111
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:59,431
That's enough. He immediately began
 About Beth when we arrived.

112
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,986
Easy with the accusations.
 - I want you search the motel.

113
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,723
I'm afraid i can't do that.

114
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,218
Nothing's been stolen, no signs
 of a struggle ...

115
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:08,812
I can't even report her missing
 since she's be gone within 48 hours.

116
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:12,703
This is bullshit. He knows something.
 - Do not cry.

117
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:16,238
Will you start to do something
to find my fiance.

118
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:20,105
I can resign at the reception ...
 - Asshole.

119
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,822
Calm down.
 - Tell me!

120
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,594
You're excited a scolding.

121
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:35,155
Outstanding.

122
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:37,263
Thank you.

123
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:45,282
Look at eleven.

124
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:51,094
How does she get in ten
 with Christmas and stuff?

125
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:55,640
Take care of yourself.

126
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,451
They will come sooner or later show up.

127
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:24,972
Help.

128
00:21:13,662 --> 00:21:15,744
Hello?

129
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,966
Hello Is anyone there?

130
00:23:56,753 --> 00:24:00,020
She's still alive.

131
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:02,828
We have to leave.

132
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:05,897
She has lost blood.

133
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:10,945
Only us.
 - I had a feeling anymore.

134
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,680
She's not moving.

135
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:16,204
The Roman numerals.

136
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:21,856
You're in a lot of trouble.

137
00:24:21,857 --> 00:24:23,744
Assault.
 Resisting arrest.

138
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:24,745
Some fellow struck a cab driver
 by Bly County.

139
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:29,150
I have taken hold of him.

140
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:36,345
The bastard was 8 months.
 Six without parole.

141
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:39,615
That's enough for even 's lawsuit.

142
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:43,316
The system works very slowly here.

143
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,422
Not like in the city.

144
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,330
It's allright.

145
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:06,114
I'm a doctor.

146
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:10,181
Veronica, we have to get out of here
While we still can.

147
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:12,834
How do we gonna get past the gate?

148
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:15,322
Maybe we could cut through?

149
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:17,582
With what?
 - I don't know.

150
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,324
We have to try something.

151
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:25,580
We need to rest for.
 - That's enough time later for it.

152
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:31,072
What is her name?

153
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,454
Allison, I think.

154
00:25:36,673 --> 00:25:38,935
She hasn't said a word
 since we found her.

155
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:42,739
How do you know her name when she doesn't?
 - A pendant around her neck.

156
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:50,304
I have heard about places like this.

157
00:25:50,305 --> 00:25:52,975
Why we still alive?

158
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,282
They just wanted our babies,
 they'd be bleeding.

159
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:01,980
What else could it be?

160
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,369
I don't know.

161
00:26:21,354 --> 00:26:23,404
Did you guys hear that?

162
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:28,384
Come sweety.

163
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,538
It comes from there.

164
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:11,310
She was not sewn back.

165
00:28:13,502 --> 00:28:17,978
Yes, the wires are torn.

166
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:20,786
Has she done it herself?

167
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:25,312
No, otherwise her fingers
 filled with blood.

168
00:28:32,454 --> 00:28:36,392
She's alive. Pressure on the wound.
 Take a link.

169
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:38,994
Fast.

170
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,269
If you can survive ...

171
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,825
Please make sure for my baby.

172
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:55,093
He is blue.

173
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,453
We can not just leave her.

174
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:36,849
Put aside.
 - Take it easy.

175
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:38,878
Take it easy.

176
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:48,363
Get out of the car.

177
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:50,906
Get out of the car!

178
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:57,183
Uncuff me.

179
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,668
Make me damn loose.

180
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:07,406
Forward.

181
00:30:11,147 --> 00:30:14,870
Do you realize what kind of crime you commit one?
 - I'm not ready.

182
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:17,892
Put your arms around.

183
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:21,301
Imagine not so much, asshole.

184
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:05,710
She said her baby blue.
 What would that mean?

185
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,845
The baby syndrome is a term for various
 birth defects such as skin grafts to describe.

186
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:16,355
It's in the blood.
 Health problems and stuff.

187
00:31:16,356 --> 00:31:18,855
Or her baby could be cold.

188
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,948
It's damn shame.

189
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,081
We have to leave right now.

190
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:32,280
I do not know who or what her by the way,
 but I do not want to stick around to find that.

191
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,304
Did you hear what she said?

192
00:31:34,305 --> 00:31:38,078
Take care of my baby.
 - She also said: If you survive.

193
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,375
Our children are gone.

194
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:45,068
not coming back.
 - I'm not leaving without my baby.

195
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,308
Not only still a chance
 she might be alive.

196
00:31:48,878 --> 00:31:50,952
That makes two of us.

197
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:54,503
I dont care
 If I have to search every room.

198
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:59,365
What do you think, Allison?

199
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,739
Three votes to one.

200
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:09,585
We are finding our children.
 Come if you want.

201
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,911
Ivy and I'll search the ground floor.

202
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:35,947
Veronica and Allis on top.

203
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:37,979
I'll wait back here.

204
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,772
When Allison takes the lantern,
 I go with her. Better company.

205
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:50,170
All right. Care for her.

206
00:32:53,962 --> 00:32:55,714
You're coming?

207
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:07,581
We go.

208
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,414
What do you do?

209
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:49,833
Receptionist?

210
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:54,943
Topless dancer.

211
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:58,258
Nod if I'm not right.

212
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:35,896
Smile.

213
00:34:45,162 --> 00:34:48,758
So people believe
 this really happened.

214
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,178
Come on.

215
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,347
Is it what?

216
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:56,888
The bleeding has stopped.

217
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,582
Thanks.

218
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:02,905
You must know something about Ivy.

219
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:07,210
She told me she was raped.

220
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:09,572
What?

221
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:14,122
She was tossed
 between a pregnancy or abortion.

222
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,109
I understand t.

223
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:21,762
She was determined relieved
 when she woke up without a baby.

224
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:24,967
Someone else make a decision for her.

225
00:36:57,874 --> 00:37:01,141
We are not the first women
this is happened to.

226
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,617
I found this.

227
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:08,606
What the hell happened there?
 - I heard screaming ...

228
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:12,927
and i found her like here.
 - You supposed to look after her Ivy.

229
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:16,915
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

230
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,266
What are you doing?

231
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:43,762
What is that?

232
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:45,695
No idea.

233
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,012
It's look like someone has tried to get it out.

234
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,006
Maybe Ivy equal
 and we have to leave while you still can.

235
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:58,718
No, don't say that.

236
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:03,030
A woman did this to her.

237
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:10,461
Allison must have taken
 before she died.

238
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:32,609
Wake up.

239
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:38,816
Motherfuckers ...

240
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:40,661
The hell?

241
00:40:42,305 --> 00:40:44,879
Where's Beth?
 - I said it before ...

242
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,885
I don't know.

243
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:50,378
I'm not gonna ask you again.

244
00:40:50,379 --> 00:40:57,958
Sometimes i got a call from this lady who I
 asks whether pregnant women staying in the hotel.

245
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:01,161
Where has she taking?
 - I don't know.

246
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:08,410
The old Abbott,
 on the other side of town.

247
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:11,779
Just drive to the west
 Exit at the Old Wagon Wheel.

248
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:15,273
I swear.

249
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:31,405
Do you think those women
 killed in the locker room?

250
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:36,844
It would not surprise me
 if she has something in her.

251
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:41,755
The Roman numerals.

252
00:41:42,954 --> 00:41:45,308
Why not before I noticed it.

253
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:50,727
Look, there's a sequence.
 This woman is 604.

254
00:41:50,728 --> 00:41:54,404
Allison was 605.
 Ivy is 606.

255
00:41:54,405 --> 00:41:58,097
I 607, You 608.

256
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,792
Are you alright?
 - I'm fine.

257
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:06,440
You look tired.
 - Nothing.

258
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:08,785
Really.

259
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:13,407
What is it?

260
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,456
Bottles of baby food.

261
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:20,643
Draw.

262
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,623
Ready? Now.

263
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,797
Quiet.

264
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:32,880
We do them hurt.

265
00:43:44,114 --> 00:43:46,337
How do I recognize mine?

266
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:50,545
How do I know which one's my baby?

267
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:54,192
They all look the same.

268
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,196
What is this?

269
00:43:58,987 --> 00:44:01,325
They have labels.

270
00:44:02,046 --> 00:44:04,422
They look the same.

271
00:44:06,366 --> 00:44:09,301
This baby was Allison.
 - What?

272
00:44:15,976 --> 00:44:21,048
I'm sure we all
 a different label in us.

273
00:44:23,678 --> 00:44:26,602
The woman said in the locker room
 that her baby was blue, right?

274
00:44:29,014 --> 00:44:32,756
Her baby was not cold
 and was not sad ...

275
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:36,262
but she saw the color of the label
 inside her.

276
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,324
This baby was hers.

277
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:42,320
How she knew the color
 as the label's Sat?

278
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:48,744
And the woman took it from her.
 She knows of the labels.

279
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,649
She knows them that way
 her child can identify with.

280
00:44:54,598 --> 00:44:56,992
So she does not need to tear open.

281
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:05,094
We need to get them out as soon as possible.

282
00:45:09,635 --> 00:45:11,982
It's different.

283
00:45:11,983 --> 00:45:14,043
Now I see it.

284
00:45:19,582 --> 00:45:22,838
I think I can get out tags out.

285
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,527
Where I woke up there was
 a veterinary laboratory.

286
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:32,281
I saw medical tools,
 asthetic ...

287
00:45:32,835 --> 00:45:35,566
I can operate.

288
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:39,425
If we have the tags,
 we can try to get in the cage.

289
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:43,942
Lead the way.

290
00:46:46,996 --> 00:46:50,016
Which way?
 - Straight ahead.

291
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:51,584
Sure?

292
00:46:51,585 --> 00:46:55,246
We do not have time to run incorrectly.
 - I'm sure.

293
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,274
We need to find another way.

294
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:33,201
Come on, get up.

295
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:45,122
Wake up.

296
00:49:53,563 --> 00:49:55,703
You having a nightmare?

297
00:49:57,227 --> 00:50:01,665
It's quite common to have strange
 dreams during times of pregnancy.

298
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,555
You mean the stress.

299
00:50:04,997 --> 00:50:07,760
I have that diagnosis before
 let set.

300
00:50:07,795 --> 00:50:09,385
It is bullshit.

301
00:50:11,723 --> 00:50:13,755
Why you say that?

302
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:20,106
What if I told you that I
had see this place in my dream?

303
00:50:20,653 --> 00:50:23,630
Like I said ...
 - No, before i was here ...

304
00:50:23,631 --> 00:50:26,274
before I knew it existed.

305
00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:32,023
I have dreamed about it all.
 Babies, roman numerals, all of it.

306
00:50:32,024 --> 00:50:33,693
It's Impossible.

307
00:50:33,694 --> 00:50:35,987
I know it is.

308
00:50:36,226 --> 00:50:38,387
But i did.

309
00:50:39,195 --> 00:50:41,889
Why did not you?

310
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:49,509
Three years ago ...

311
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,491
I had a miscarriage.

312
00:50:54,424 --> 00:50:56,705
That's when the dreams come.

313
00:50:58,432 --> 00:51:00,369
I'm sorry.

314
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:05,495
I suppose you
 was struggling.

315
00:51:06,603 --> 00:51:09,821
I'm going to try to climb out.
 Help me up ok.

316
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:12,645
I can't.

317
00:51:12,646 --> 00:51:14,686
I 've tried.

318
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:19,458
I can not put pressure on my leg.
 Dislocated my knee.

319
00:51:40,721 --> 00:51:42,599
Come on.

320
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:55,999
I can't.

321
00:51:57,207 --> 00:52:00,094
Okay? I'll find something.

322
00:54:12,692 --> 00:54:14,740
Fuck!

323
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,740
Who's there?

324
00:54:41,993 --> 00:54:44,011
Veronica?

325
00:54:45,814 --> 00:54:47,886
Who's there?

326
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:09,195
You're in Duncan's house.
Ladies not allowed in Duncan's house.

327
00:57:09,196 --> 00:57:11,531
Mrs. Shepard is gonna be so mad.

328
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:16,116
Mrs.Shepard's gonna be mad at Duncan.

329
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:21,689
Shepard's gonna be..be..be so mad at Duncan.

330
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,909
No allowed of ladies in the house.
No allowed of guests

331
00:57:30,432 --> 00:57:33,879
Mrs.Shepherd's gonna be so mad at Duncan.

332
00:57:34,507 --> 00:57:36,843
No one's gonna be mad.

333
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:46,605
you like candy?

334
00:57:50,954 --> 00:57:54,029
Come on. It's allright.

335
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:59,141
Come on. It's okay.

336
00:58:01,223 --> 00:58:03,732
My name is Beth.

337
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:06,384
My name is Beth.

338
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:18,097
Who is Mrs. Shepard?
 She is the woman in the photograph?

339
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:24,136
It is Duncan's mom,
 but not allowed to call it.

340
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,233
Does she run this place?

341
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,093
Do you work for her?

342
00:58:30,094 --> 00:58:32,431
Duncan cleaned the floor ...

343
00:58:32,432 --> 00:58:36,165
than the wet floor,
 bleeds the floor, then mop the floor.

344
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:39,129
What is this place, Duncan?

345
00:58:40,063 --> 00:58:41,681
Tell me.

346
00:58:42,457 --> 00:58:46,545
DCVIII ... DCV ...

347
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:52,649
DCV ... DCIV.

348
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,552
Do the keys in your belt
open the cage to the babies?

349
00:58:56,553 --> 00:59:00,194
Duncan not allowed to talk about it.
 - Why can't you talk about it?

350
00:59:00,195 --> 00:59:01,786
Duncan Wait!

351
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,272
Wait.

352
00:59:55,084 --> 00:59:58,941
One of the keys can
 The cages with the babies open.

353
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,342
Ivy is dead.

354
01:00:29,395 --> 01:00:31,302
Can you walk?

355
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:34,640
We've to find out.

356
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:56,515
To rest.

357
01:01:06,244 --> 01:01:08,635
I can make you a splint.

358
01:01:11,953 --> 01:01:14,122
I will not be long.

359
01:01:27,348 --> 01:01:29,408
Sorry.

360
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:33,115
How does that feel?
 - The need to rest above the joint

361
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,185
Fuck. Come on.

362
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:56,978
Go on.

363
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,007
Hurry.

364
01:02:14,654 --> 01:02:17,962
Let's go.
 We don't have much time.

365
01:02:57,834 --> 01:02:59,950
Beth I need you in now.

366
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:04,400
Dep hence the blood.

367
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,095
Hurry.
 - It is again torn.

368
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:30,418
Just keep going.

369
01:03:36,128 --> 01:03:37,943
Come on.

370
01:03:51,383 --> 01:03:53,112
I can't see.

371
01:03:54,021 --> 01:03:56,957
Hold on. I'll look for light.

372
01:05:31,237 --> 01:05:33,422
It's alright.

373
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,733
I got you.

374
01:05:38,129 --> 01:05:41,030
You're okay.

375
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:44,317
You're okay.

376
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:52,038
She was yellow.

377
01:06:00,574 --> 01:06:04,222
No ...

378
01:08:07,112 --> 01:08:09,726
That is four.

379
01:08:09,727 --> 01:08:12,107
Only one more.

380
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:21,600
No, please do not.
 - Promise me something and I give you my tag.

381
01:08:21,758 --> 01:08:23,770
I promise.

382
01:08:25,563 --> 01:08:29,024
If my baby is still alive ...

383
01:08:29,025 --> 01:08:33,328
promise me that you'll take her
 with you.

384
01:08:33,329 --> 01:08:36,702
Never let her know what happened here.

385
01:08:37,298 --> 01:08:40,226
Promise me!
 - I promise.

386
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,880
A woman showed me the room
 with the baby.

387
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,029
And she said the only way ...

388
01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:03,397
to find out which baby
was mine, was to kill...

389
01:09:03,398 --> 01:09:05,381
five women.

390
01:09:05,382 --> 01:09:10,035
And collect the tags
she had put inside.

391
01:09:11,243 --> 01:09:14,484
I didn't believe her first ...

392
01:09:16,824 --> 01:09:19,094
She gave me this.

393
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:30,942
I just wanted to know which baby was mine.

394
01:09:30,943 --> 01:09:33,001
So badly.

395
01:09:33,528 --> 01:09:36,480
I didn't know what else to do.

396
01:09:48,598 --> 01:09:51,819
Please be aware my daughter.

397
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:29,177
Red and yellow.

398
01:11:29,178 --> 01:11:32,630
And green.

399
01:12:48,555 --> 01:12:50,433
Who's there?

400
01:12:52,023 --> 01:12:53,833
Who's there?

401
01:14:15,987 --> 01:14:19,658
You will see that everything is in order.

402
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:03,896
She is the strongest I have ever had.
 Can not be stronger.

403
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,332
I was very lucky to find you, Beth.

404
01:15:24,584 --> 01:15:28,390
Sometimes a mother survives
 not a caesarean.

405
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:32,964
My client paid to select a child
 to select from six different mothers.

406
01:15:33,411 --> 01:15:36,959
I had to find the replacement
in the last minute.

407
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:41,536
You're the mother first substitute who ever win.

408
01:15:42,563 --> 01:15:45,880
This is the only facility in the world
 where she is the mother of their adopted baby ...

409
01:15:45,881 --> 01:15:49,056
evaluate before they buy.

410
01:15:54,069 --> 01:15:58,264
You can not get baby
 an unknown whore.

411
01:15:58,265 --> 01:16:02,755
You can pick from an infant
 doctors, lawyers ...

412
01:16:02,756 --> 01:16:04,910
lead athletes.

413
01:16:04,911 --> 01:16:08,629
But buying a baby is not like
 buying an appliance.

414
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,885
You can't return the goods
 if they're faulty.

415
01:16:22,288 --> 01:16:24,242
No, please.

416
01:16:27,515 --> 01:16:30,011
He says that your daughter will have a
 good life with him.

417
01:16:30,316 --> 01:16:34,526
Let may God have mercy on your soul.
 - No, please. I beg you.

418
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:37,231
Please.

419
01:16:43,685 --> 01:16:47,627
Put the gun down, Duncan.
 - Bam!

420
01:16:48,818 --> 01:16:50,944
No, Duncan. Do not.

421
01:16:50,945 --> 01:16:53,662
Do not listen to her.
 I need your help.

422
01:16:53,663 --> 01:16:55,722
This is all just a game.

423
01:16:55,723 --> 01:17:00,560
We've been through this.
 - Duncan no more bleaches the floor.

424
01:17:00,561 --> 01:17:04,280
None of this is real.
 - She's lying, Duncan.

425
01:17:04,465 --> 01:17:06,778
They're hurting me.

426
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:10,692
How could you do that?
 - Bam!

427
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:14,663
You got Duncan's keys.

428
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:17,134
You got it.
 - I want you to shoot the woman Duncan.

429
01:17:17,135 --> 01:17:19,142
No, do not, Duncan.

430
01:17:19,143 --> 01:17:21,786
We are friends.
 - Shoot them.

431
01:17:21,787 --> 01:17:24,500
I gave you the candy. Remember?
 - Shoot her.

432
01:17:25,055 --> 01:17:29,576
Shoot her.
 Do what you're told.

433
01:19:10,282 --> 01:19:12,812
She has your eyes.

434
01:19:14,804 --> 01:19:17,748
Don't you come in closer.

435
01:19:18,151 --> 01:19:21,143
You've matured into a fine young woman.

436
01:19:21,144 --> 01:19:24,592
Your parents must be very proud.
 - Stay Back.

437
01:19:25,856 --> 01:19:27,730
How's your father?

438
01:19:27,731 --> 01:19:30,042
You and Roger must be
very close.

439
01:19:30,686 --> 01:19:33,189
What did you just say?

440
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,698
Roger and Judy seem like
such a happy couple.

441
01:19:36,127 --> 01:19:38,250
How do you know?

442
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:41,962
How do you know their names?
 - I recognized your last name already

443
01:19:41,963 --> 01:19:43,906
Church.

444
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,460
I have reviewed your file.

445
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:51,895
Born 12th of May, 1950.

446
01:19:51,896 --> 01:19:55,278
Biological Mother: Lydia Hayes.
 Adoptive parents:

447
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:57,689
Roger and Judy Church.
 - No.

448
01:19:57,901 --> 01:20:01,405
No, you're lying.
 - Roger couldn't legally adopt children of his own...

449
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,116
because of his criminal record.

450
01:20:03,117 --> 01:20:05,712
So he came to see me to fetch his child.

451
01:20:05,994 --> 01:20:08,376
I can still remember the transaction.

452
01:20:08,631 --> 01:20:10,328
He paid cash.

453
01:20:10,329 --> 01:20:12,650
I don't believe you.

454
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:33,070
You can still remember
your biological mother Lydia?

455
01:20:34,686 --> 01:20:38,566
They really tried not to cry
 when Roger entered her life.

456
01:20:40,164 --> 01:20:43,886
She was a strong woman,
 harsh like yourself.

457
01:20:52,216 --> 01:20:54,484
She wasn't a killer.

458
01:20:54,485 --> 01:20:57,000
Revolutions, bitch.

459
01:21:23,288 --> 01:21:25,182
How does that feel?

460
01:23:58,027 --> 01:24:01,416
In Loving Memory of
 LYDIA HAYES

461
01:24:30,706 --> 01:24:32,500
Excuse me?

462
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:34,868
Hello.
 - The man who just came through here ...

463
01:24:35,346 --> 01:24:37,028
do you know him?

464
01:24:37,732 --> 01:24:42,357
Yes, hard knowing but he came to myself
most of the time.

465
01:24:42,596 --> 01:24:44,984
After what he has been through,
 I don't blame him.

466
01:24:44,985 --> 01:24:47,520
Why, wo what happened to him?

467
01:24:48,072 --> 01:24:51,586
His wife went missing.
 They never found her.

468
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:54,528
She was pregnant at that time.

469
01:24:56,936 --> 01:25:00,425
You alright miss? You look a little pale.

470
01:25:00,426 --> 01:25:04,542
Does he live likely?
 - He lives on the other side of town.

471
01:25:08,034 --> 01:25:11,726
I'm just bad done here.
 You like a lift into town?

472
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,648
No, i think up I'll walk.

473
01:25:16,168 --> 01:25:18,944
Thanks anyway.
 - You take care.
