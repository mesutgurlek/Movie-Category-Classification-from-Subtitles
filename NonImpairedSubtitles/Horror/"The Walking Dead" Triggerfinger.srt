Off my land. I mean it.

3
00:00:05,282 --> 00:00:07,397
- What's wrong with her?
- She might be in shock, where's Hershel?

4
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:09,626
Where's the bar in town?
That's where we'll find him.

5
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:11,735
So I need you to run into
town and bring Rick back.

6
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,249
You want him? Fetch him yourself.

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,741
Son of a bitch... they're alive.

8
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:19,914
Let's take a nice friendly ride to this farm

9
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,059
and get to know each other.

10
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:22,551
That's not gonna happen.

Holy shit.

14
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,108
You all right?

15
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:15,182
Yeah.

16
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:17,381
Hershel?

17
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:39,910
<i>Let's head back.</i>

18
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:09,074
<i>Car. Car.</i>

19
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:10,467
Get down.

20
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:30,403
<i>- Dave? Tony? They said over here?
- Yeah.</i>

21
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:32,443
<i>- I'm telling you, man, I heard shots.
- I saw roamers</i>

22
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,354
<i>- two streets over. Might be more around here.
- It's hot.</i>

23
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:36,333
<i>- We gotta get out of here.
- Dave! Tony!</i>

24
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:38,420
<i>- Shut up, you idiot!
- You wanna attract 'em?</i>

25
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:40,208
Just stick close.
We're gonna find 'em.

26
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:47,366
Dude, he said to stay close.

27
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:49,509
Tony.

28
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:05,161
( Panting

29
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:16,254
Shit!

30
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:20,275
No!

31
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:13,032
They should've been back by now.

32
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,267
Yeah. They just got
holed up somewhere.

33
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:20,706
We'll... we'll head out
first thing in the morning.

34
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:24,087
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,981
- Man.
- Thanks.

36
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,900
Carl, I want you to keep
your head up, okay?

37
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:33,205
Your old man, he's the toughest son of a...

38
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:34,457
No cussing in the house.

39
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:37,023
Sorry.

40
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:40,759
- Lori, dinner.
- She's not in there.

41
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:41,460
Where is she?

42
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:50,543
Carl, when's the last time
you saw your mom?

43
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:53,839
<i>- This afternoon.
- She was worried about Rick,</i>

44
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,289
asked me to look in on Carl.

45
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,159
- She went after them?
- She didn't say that.

46
00:06:57,736 --> 00:07:00,299
Nobody panic.
Gonna be around here somewhere.

47
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,999
- Why won't they leave?
- Would you?

48
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,796
We can't sit here any longer.

49
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,995
Let's head out the back
and make a run to the car.

50
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:47,024
- What happened?
- Roamers, I nailed 'em.

51
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,514
They disappeared
but their car's still there.

52
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,242
I cleared those buildings.
You guys get this one?

53
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:52,177
<i>- No.
- Me neither.</i>

54
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:55,154
<i>We're looking for Dave and
Tony and no one checks the damn bar?</i>

55
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,740
- What?
- Someone pushed it shut.

56
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:03,693
<i>There's someone in there.</i>

57
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:05,859
<i>Yo, is someone in there?</i>

58
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,451
<i>Yo, if someone's in there,
we don't want no trouble.</i>

59
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,704
<i>We're just looking for our friends.</i>

60
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:12,525
<i>- What do we do?
- Bum rush the door?</i>

61
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,425
<i>No, we don't know how
many are there. Just relax.</i>

62
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:16,756
<i>We don't want any trouble.</i>

63
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:18,896
<i>We're just looking for our friends.</i>

64
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,398
<i>If something happened, tell us.</i>

65
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:23,320
<i>This place is crawling with corpses.</i>

66
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:25,908
<i>If you can help us not get
killed, I'd appreciate it.</i>

67
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,378
Dude, you're bugging.
I'm telling you nobody's in there.

68
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,375
<i>Someone guard the door.
If they're in there,</i>

69
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:34,793
<i>they might know where Dave and Tony are.</i>

70
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:45,134
They drew on us!

71
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,480
<i>Dave and Tony in there?</i>

72
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,304
<i>They alive?</i>

73
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,283
<i>- No.
- They killed Dave and Tony.</i>

74
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:05,172
Come on, man, let's go.

75
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,351
No, I'm not leaving, I'm not telling Jane.

76
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:08,598
I'm not gonna go back and tell them

77
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,785
that Dave and Tony got shot
by some assholes in a bar.

78
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,763
Your friends drew on us!

79
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,764
They gave us no choice!

80
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:17,935
I'm sure we've all lost enough people,

81
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,884
done things we wish we didn't have to,

82
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,725
but it's like that now.
You know that!

83
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,581
So let's just chalk
this up to what it was...

84
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,334
Wrong place,

85
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:33,508
<i>wrong...</i>

86
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:38,691
Get outta here! Go!

87
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:10,391
We can't find Lori

88
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,904
<i>- and the others aren't back yet either.
- Yeah.</i>

89
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,615
That dumb bitch must've
gone off looking for 'em.

90
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:18,587
- What?
- Yeah, she asked me to go.

91
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:21,003
I told her I was done being an errand boy.

92
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:23,565
And you didn't say anything?

93
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:42,389
Don't do this.

94
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:44,467
Please.

95
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,078
I've already lost my girl.

96
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:49,979
That wasn't my problem neither.

97
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:58,204
- She's not at the barn.
- I checked the yards.

98
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,901
- Well, where is she?
- She asked Daryl to go into town.

99
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:04,198
Must've gone herself.

100
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:07,313
- Mom.
- Hey.

101
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:09,109
Carl.

102
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,725
- Did you know about this?
- No.

103
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:15,174
Look, just...
Did she take a gun?

104
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:16,482
I don't know.

105
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:19,676
I wouldn't let her go out there alone.

106
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:41,710
Hey!

107
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:44,801
We all know this is not gonna end well!

108
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:49,085
<i>There's nothing in it for any of us!</i>

109
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:53,057
You guys just...
Just back off,

110
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,657
no one else gets hurt!

111
00:12:58,809 --> 00:12:59,388
<i>Shit!</i>

112
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,845
Glenn! Glenn!

113
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:13,628
I... I'm all right.
I'm all right.

114
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,840
Lori!

115
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:12,251
- I'll hold 'em here.
- You cover Glenn.

116
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:15,460
See if you can make it to your car.

117
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,858
Tell him... tell him
to pull up back.

118
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:20,482
We'll run for it, get the hell out of here.

119
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:21,905
You want me to cover Glenn?

120
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,341
You missed all that gun training.

121
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,228
It could've come in handy now.

122
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:28,756
Nah, I can shoot.
I just don't like to.

123
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:40,483
Sorry. Sorry.

124
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,707
Rick wants you to try for the car.

125
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:44,517
Try?

126
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,033
You'll try and succeed.

127
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,126
I'll cover you.

128
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,172
That's a great plan.

129
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,642
- What happened?
- He fired.

130
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,592
He must've hit Glenn.

131
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:47,542
He's behind the dumpster.

132
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,244
Doesn't look like he's moving.

133
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:57,511
You hit?

134
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:08,026
Are you hit?

135
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:11,890
No. No.

136
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,668
It's all right.
The car's right there.

137
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:25,403
- Okay.
- We're almost home.

138
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:28,436
- You good?
- I'm good.

139
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:36,017
Let's go.

140
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:38,950
<i>Get back.</i>

141
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:45,112
Let's get out of here!

142
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:47,067
Roamers all over
the place! Hurry up!

143
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:48,996
<i>- We gotta get out of here!
- What about Sean?</i>

144
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:51,544
- They shot him. We gotta go.
- Roamers are everywhere.

145
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,359
- We're leaving?
- Jump!

146
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:57,095
Hurry up, jump already.

147
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:05,618
<i>- Dude didn't make it.
- Help me! Help... help me!</i>

148
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,662
I've gotta go.
I've gotta go.

149
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:09,346
<i>- I'm sorry!
- No no, don't leave!</i>

150
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:13,567
<i>Help me! No! No!</i>

151
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:16,060
<i>- Help!
- Get Hershel.</i>

152
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:20,366
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

153
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:22,409
<i>- No! No!
- Her... Hershel!</i>

154
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:50,276
Hershel. Hershel.

155
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:57,340
The gunfire must've attracted the walkers.

156
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,960
- Where's Rick?
- He... he ran across.

157
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,157
Well, hell, we can't go without him.

158
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:03,266
Rick!

159
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:07,738
- We have to go now.
- No!

160
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:10,059
- Shh!
- I'm sorry, son. We have to go.

161
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,492
- No no, don't leave me please.
- We have to go.

162
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:14,766
- We can't.
- He was just shooting at us!

163
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,185
- He's a kid.
- Please help me.

164
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,846
This place is crawling with walkers!

165
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,580
- We can't leave him!
- The fence went clean through.

166
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:23,117
There's no way we can get
the leg off in one piece.

167
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,335
Shut up or I will shoot you!

168
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:27,545
That may be the answer.

169
00:18:28,178 --> 00:18:29,541
We're not gonna get that leg off

170
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,204
without tearing the muscle to shreds.

171
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,352
He certainly can't run.
He may bleed out.

172
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,234
Shut up.

173
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:37,491
I'm sorry.
Sh-sh... shut up.

174
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,791
<i>- Shut up.
- Maybe we should put him down.</i>

175
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:42,458
I don't wanna see any more killing,

176
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,499
- but this is cruel.
- Can't we just take the leg off?

177
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,479
- That hatchet still in the car?
- No no, don't... don't...

178
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:52,962
Don't cut my leg off, please.

179
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,399
- Please, not my leg.
- Will this cut through the bone?

180
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:57,071
I'll have to sever the
ligaments below the kneecap,

181
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:59,844
cut above the tibia.
He's going to lose his lower leg.

182
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:02,029
- No, don't. No.
- When we get clear of here,

183
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:05,201
we're gonna have to find some
tinder, cauterize the wound

184
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:07,540
- so he doesn't bleed out.
- All right, no choice. Hurry up.

185
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,193
Oh God, oh God.

186
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:11,899
- No!
- Hand me that stick.

187
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:15,891
- Here.
- No. Ah!

188
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:20,305
Guys, walkers.

189
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:25,251
Hurry up!

190
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:31,102
Shut up!

191
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,018
Oh God.
They're everywhere.

192
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:39,604
Hershel, how we doing over there?

193
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:42,533
I need more hands!
Easy easy.

194
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,438
No, don't don't don't don't
cut my leg off please.

195
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,206
Come on, we gotta go!
I'm almost out of ammo!

196
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:54,903
We don't have much time!
Come on, we've gotta go!

197
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:57,757
Can't hold 'em off!
Hershel, do it now!

198
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:00,237
- Come on, Hershel!
- There is no time!

199
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,599
Hershel, come on!

200
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,188
Please don't leave me!
Please! No!

201
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,259
Please don't leave me!
Please! Please don't leave me!

202
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:23,230
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

203
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:24,931
You're not fine.
I saw the wreck.

204
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,504
Let me look
at you. Oh.

205
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:31,103
What happened?

206
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,161
Looked down at the map and hit a Walker.

207
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,687
Next time stay put, you won't need a map.

208
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:38,221
Come on, I gotta get you back.

209
00:20:38,222 --> 00:20:39,504
No, we gotta find Rick.

210
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,611
He's back.
They're all back.

211
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,175
They're all safe and sound.

212
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,863
- Really?
- Yeah.

213
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:52,689
Oh thank God.

214
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,259
What are you doing?

215
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:30,724
Keeping an eye on you.

216
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:32,628
Ain't you a peach?

217
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:34,745
I'm not gonna let you pull away.

218
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:37,321
You've earned your place.

219
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,511
If you spent half your time minding

220
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:41,325
your daughter's business
instead of sticking your nose

221
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:43,126
in everybody else's, she'd still be alive!

222
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:47,542
Go ahead.

223
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,197
Go ahead and what?

224
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,128
I mean just go!
I don't want you here!

225
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:00,381
You're a real piece of work, lady.

226
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:05,174
What, are you gonna make this about
my daddy or some crap like that?

227
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,437
Pfft! Man,
you know Jack.

228
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:11,506
You're afraid.
You're afraid

229
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,861
'cause you're all alone.
You got no husband,

230
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,065
no daughter.

231
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,837
You don't know what to do with yourself.

232
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:21,312
You ain't my problem!
Sophia wasn't mine!

233
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:24,976
All you had to do was keep an eye on her!

234
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,950
Oh my God, are you all right? What happened?

235
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:02,997
- I was in an accident. I'm fine, I'm fine.
- She was attacked.

236
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:04,643
I really am.
Where's Rick?

237
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:10,674
They're not back?

238
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:15,463
Where are they?

239
00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:18,000
Look, I had to get you back here.

240
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:23,359
<i>- You asshole.
- Lori.</i>

241
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:26,234
- He's my husband.
- Lori, I will go after him. I will find him.

242
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:28,209
Hey! Now look,
first things first...

243
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,973
I gotta...
I gotta look after you.

244
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:31,612
I gotta make sure
the baby's all right, okay?

245
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,403
You're having a baby?

246
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:39,208
Why didn't you tell me?

247
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:55,023
Come on. Let's make sure you're all right.

248
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:56,642
Come on.

249
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:16,444
Thank you.

250
00:24:24,153 --> 00:24:25,883
I am so sorry

251
00:24:26,313 --> 00:24:28,171
that I left without telling you.

252
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:29,992
It's okay.

253
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:31,625
I wasn't scared.

254
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:36,041
When's dad getting back?

255
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:39,962
Let's hope soon.

256
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:44,026
I wanna be there when
you tell him about the baby.

257
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:46,857
Oh, love, he already knows.

258
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:50,991
We were just trying to find
the right time to tell you.

259
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:52,785
Is it a boy or a girl?

260
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:56,511
Well, we won't know that until it's born.

261
00:24:57,515 --> 00:24:59,880
- Will I be able to feel it?
- Not for a while.

262
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:04,841
You must have a lot of questions, huh?

263
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:09,536
We never had the talk.

264
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:14,324
I guess we forgot.

265
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:19,693
Don't look at me.
That's your father's job.

266
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,746
If the baby's a girl,
can we name her Sophia?

267
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:30,266
Hey, dude.

268
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,861
Hey, I'm sorry, bud.
Okay?

269
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:37,024
<i>- I thought you knew.
- Big brother Carl.</i>

270
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:40,556
- Pretty cool, huh?
- I say that's very cool.

271
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:45,923
You... you mind if I talk
to your mom a sec?

272
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:49,174
How about a little later
after she's had some rest?

273
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,936
Lori, I had to get you back here.

274
00:25:51,937 --> 00:25:53,284
You wouldn't have come otherwise.

275
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,766
How about you...

276
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:04,861
how about you just hear me out, please?

277
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:06,405
It's okay.

278
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:10,955
Okay.
Give me a minute.

279
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:14,742
Thanks, bud.

280
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:31,189
Okay, Lori, it was a lie.

281
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,506
It was one little white lie.

282
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:35,310
But I think that...

283
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:37,228
I think you oughta be thinking about

284
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,147
how lucky we are that your baby's safe.

285
00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:41,082
<i>You just can't stop lying, can you?</i>

286
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,215
My husband is back safe and sound.

287
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:44,968
My husband is dead in some hospital.

288
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,013
Oh, when are you gonna...
when are you gonna

289
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:48,595
stop throwing that in my face, huh?

290
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,781
I thought that he was...

291
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:54,274
the point here, Lor,

292
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:57,491
is that you cannot keep
running off like that.

293
00:26:58,264 --> 00:27:01,064
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking we needed Rick here to keep us safe.

294
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:03,201
<i>Rick? I keep you safe.</i>

295
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:04,481
Like you did with Otis?

296
00:27:08,554 --> 00:27:09,683
What happened that night?

297
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,680
You haven't been the same since.

298
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:16,535
You wanna know what happened with Otis?

299
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:20,132
What happened with Otis
happened because I love you.

300
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,107
I love you and I love Carl. That's right.

301
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:26,299
I told Rick.

302
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:36,189
What?

303
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:43,252
You told...
you told him what?

304
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:49,946
Did you tell him that you
thought you were a widow?

305
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,487
That you were grieving and that
the world was coming to an end?

306
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,052
That that you needed comforting?

307
00:27:57,462 --> 00:27:58,435
Did you tell him it was a mistake?

308
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:11,013
You know, Lori, that ain't true.

309
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:15,424
What we had,

310
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:19,113
- it was real.
- It was not.

311
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,527
- It was a long time coming. It was real, Lori.
- It was not.

312
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:23,586
It was you and it was me

313
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:25,272
and Carl, and it was real.

314
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:28,196
It was right.
Don't say it wasn't.

315
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:30,907
- It wasn't.
- Yeah?

316
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:34,667
Just think about what you felt,

317
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:37,524
just for a second.
What you Fe... what you felt.

318
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:40,872
Everything falling apart all around us,

319
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:41,863
but it...

320
00:28:44,797 --> 00:28:46,079
it was a one good thing.

321
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:54,616
And you know it's true.

322
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,252
How is she?

323
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,301
Dehydrated.

324
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:28,947
I'll set up an I.V.

325
00:29:29,923 --> 00:29:31,191
Best I can do without Hershel.

326
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:39,274
<i>Hey.</i>

327
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,013
Can I get you anything?

328
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:52,770
Nah, I just wish my dad was here.

329
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,133
She'll be okay.

330
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,280
You just need to be strong for her.

331
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,489
I was just reminding her about...

332
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,058
- Never mind.
- No no.

333
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,516
I... I'd love to hear.

334
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:13,174
My dad would die if he heard this.

335
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:15,809
My first summer back from college,

336
00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:18,240
I drove home, dumped my stuff off,

337
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:19,823
went straight out to the stable for a ride.

338
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:22,871
<i>My family comes back from church</i>

339
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:26,063
<i>and Beth grabs my things and starts
unpacking my stuff upstairs.</i>

340
00:30:26,236 --> 00:30:28,684
- That's sweet.
- Yeah, until this one here

341
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:30,060
starts rifling through my backpack.

342
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,831
She finds this little plastic container

343
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,672
with these pink and green candies inside.

344
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,730
She didn't even know I was on the pill.

345
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:43,328
She was so freaked out by the
idea of me, and boys and sex,

346
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:45,738
she runs outside and Chucks
them in the duck pond.

347
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:50,125
And I ride up, I see this, I'm screaming.

348
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:53,902
She's crying and Shawn runs outside,

349
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:55,259
thinks one of us is drowning.

350
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:58,843
Soon as he figures out what's going on,

351
00:30:58,844 --> 00:31:00,809
the jerk busts out laughing so loud

352
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:05,809
that my horse rears up and gets
mud all over the three of us.

353
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:11,137
My dad comes out, "what the
heck's goin' on out here?!"

354
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:14,725
And she turns around,

355
00:31:15,562 --> 00:31:18,154
bats her eyelids and says,
"we're just swimming, daddy."

356
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:27,508
In her Sunday dress,
all covered in snot and mud.

357
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,528
Rick and Glenn will get your dad back.

358
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:40,621
Glenn's a good guy.

359
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:46,427
Yeah. He is.

360
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:55,327
Are you sure you wanna risk it?

361
00:31:55,515 --> 00:31:57,026
You might not make it back.

362
00:31:57,493 --> 00:32:00,021
- I'll be fine.
- And with Shane at the helm,

363
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:03,190
I wouldn't be too sure.
He's lost people before.

364
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:06,328
And he's had my back.
What are you insinuating?

365
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:08,373
He doesn't want Rick back,

366
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:09,958
or Hershel.

367
00:32:10,923 --> 00:32:13,046
With them gone,
he's got everything he wants

368
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:14,904
and no one to tell him otherwise.

369
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:17,856
Shane has done more
to keep this group alive

370
00:32:17,857 --> 00:32:20,128
than anybody, including Rick.

371
00:32:20,495 --> 00:32:22,462
You can't possibly believe that.

372
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:24,230
I do.

373
00:32:34,137 --> 00:32:34,775
Guys.

374
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:02,275
Dad!

375
00:33:10,473 --> 00:33:11,166
You're okay.

376
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:17,858
Patricia, prepare the shed for surgery.

377
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:24,476
- Are you hurt?
- No, but what happened to you?

378
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:27,904
- I was in a car accident.
- Accident? How?

379
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:32,102
- I went looking for you.
- Snuck out on her own. Brought her back.

380
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,921
- Are you crazy? You could've...
- Who the hell is that?

381
00:33:37,107 --> 00:33:37,846
That's Randall.

382
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:54,419
<i>We couldn't just leave him behind.</i>

383
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:56,027
He would've bled out,

384
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:58,175
if he lived that long.

385
00:33:58,918 --> 00:34:00,134
It's gotten bad in town.

386
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:03,992
What do we do with him?

387
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:08,126
I repaired his calf muscle as best I can,

388
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:09,997
but he'll probably have nerve damage.

389
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:12,384
<i>Won't be on his feet for at least a week.</i>

390
00:34:12,406 --> 00:34:13,945
When he is, we give him a canteen,

391
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,207
take him out to the main
road, send him on his way.

392
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,263
<i>Isn't that the same as
leaving him for the walkers?</i>

393
00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:20,316
He'll have a fighting chance.

394
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:21,406
<i>Just gonna let him go?</i>

395
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:25,120
- He knows where we are.
- He was blindfolded the whole way here.

396
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:27,640
<i>- He's not a threat.
- Not a threat. How many of them were there?</i>

397
00:34:27,824 --> 00:34:30,728
You killed three of t, zir men,
you took one of them hostage,

398
00:34:30,729 --> 00:34:33,366
- but they just ain't gonna come looking?
- They left him for dead.

399
00:34:33,473 --> 00:34:36,686
<i>- No one is looking.
- We should still post a guard.</i>

400
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:39,867
He's out cold right now, will be for hours.

401
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:42,331
You know what? I'm gonna go get
him some flowers and candy.

402
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:46,892
- Look at this, folks...
- We back in fantasy land.

403
00:34:47,006 --> 00:34:49,834
You know, we haven't even dealt
with what you did at my barn yet.

404
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,692
Let me make this perfectly
clear, once and for all...

405
00:34:53,147 --> 00:34:55,795
This is my farm.
Now I wanted you gone.

406
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,092
Rick talked me out of it, but that
doesn't mean I have to like it.

407
00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:02,226
So do us both a favor...
Keep your mouth shut.

408
00:35:17,652 --> 00:35:19,295
We're not gonna do anything about it today.

409
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,953
<i>Let's just cool off.</i>

410
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:42,205
Can I talk to you?

411
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:53,026
What's going on with you?

412
00:35:56,518 --> 00:35:58,016
Your dad saved my life today.

413
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,449
And Rick saved us both.

414
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,873
And I...

415
00:36:06,088 --> 00:36:07,484
I froze.

416
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,002
Well, you were being shot at.

417
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,920
I know, but...

418
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:15,331
- You don't have anything to prove.
- All I've done,

419
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,783
then this... okay.

420
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:23,926
It's because of what you said.

421
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,368
That I love you?

422
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:28,864
Yeah.

423
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:32,660
A bullet hit the wall behind me

424
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:34,265
and I...
I thought of you...

425
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:36,703
Losing me, hurting.

426
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:39,313
And I couldn't take it, so I hid

427
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:41,274
to stay alive.

428
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:46,589
- Glenn.
- No no no.

429
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,754
No, you don't get it.

430
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:52,564
Rick, your dad...
They were counting on me

431
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:55,366
and I...
I only thought of myself.

432
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,154
Has she eaten?

433
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:31,308
I'll give her a sedative...

434
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,673
Stop her body from working too hard.

435
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:38,392
You were drinking.

436
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:41,167
That was the least of my worries.

437
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:44,287
You left and I didn't know what to do!

438
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,928
- Want me to take watch?
- Yeah.

439
00:38:07,697 --> 00:38:10,932
Relieve T. In a few hours.
I'm gonna take the graveyard.

440
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:12,192
And then what?

441
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:15,011
We just send him on his merry way?

442
00:38:16,997 --> 00:38:18,176
According to Rick and Hershel.

443
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:20,964
If he finds his people and leads them here,

444
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,401
we'll have a war on our hands.

445
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:24,515
You know you're preaching
to the choir, girl.

446
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:27,044
You ever consider a lighter touch?

447
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,653
Abandoning the search for Sophia,

448
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:32,777
taking out the walkers in the
barn, lying to Lori today...

449
00:38:33,014 --> 00:38:34,319
Those were all the right calls.

450
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:36,999
It's your presentation that
leaves something to be desired.

451
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:37,959
Dale send you?

452
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:40,907
I see you pushing everyone away.

453
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:43,389
For what?
They need you.

454
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:46,494
Huh. I'll always be
the odd man out...

455
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,498
- The same as you.
- I've made my peace.

456
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:52,212
Have you?
The way I see it,

457
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:55,933
you and me, we...
We're treated the same way.

458
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:00,021
Everyone's always trying to
take the gun out of your hand.

459
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:02,404
These folks...
They want to play house.

460
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:03,974
They wanna pretend that Rick and Hershel...

461
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,863
They know what they're doing.
Lemme tell you something...

462
00:39:05,864 --> 00:39:06,853
They bound to get us all killed.

463
00:39:06,854 --> 00:39:08,875
- Then we have to stop that.
- They don't listen.

464
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:10,583
They're gonna give this kid a care package.

465
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:12,066
They're gonna send him on his way.
And you right,

466
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:14,387
that's gonna bring on a war
or something worse,

467
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:17,177
and we just gonna... we're gonna
sit here and wait for it.

468
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:19,891
But you and me, we...

469
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,275
We're the only ones who see it coming.

470
00:39:25,585 --> 00:39:27,208
I should've left with you
when I had the chance.

471
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:39,265
Oh. Oh man.

472
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:42,275
Here.

473
00:39:44,238 --> 00:39:45,502
Thank you. Ah.

474
00:39:56,248 --> 00:39:57,012
Need your help.

475
00:39:57,013 --> 00:39:57,953
Come here.

476
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,398
We're like a couple of old people.

477
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:19,523
We need to talk about Shane.

478
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:23,388
What's he done now?

479
00:40:27,153 --> 00:40:28,661
He thinks the baby's his.

480
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:37,100
No matter what, it's yours.

481
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:46,563
He'll accept that.

482
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:49,584
You're gonna have to make him.
He won't listen to me.

483
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:52,473
He's delusional and he's dangerous.

484
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:56,342
When I went looking for
you, he came after me...

485
00:40:57,225 --> 00:40:59,244
- Well, of course he did.
- ...And lied to me

486
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,443
to get me back here,
said you were already back.

487
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,525
You saw what he did at the barn.

488
00:41:06,493 --> 00:41:08,699
He's threatened Dale and Hershel.

489
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,465
He's scaring people and he's scaring me.

490
00:41:14,415 --> 00:41:15,876
And I think he killed Otis.

491
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,982
I think he left him behind and I think...

492
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:24,876
I think he did it not just to save Carl

493
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:28,341
- but because he loves me...
- But you don't know that.

494
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:32,477
And he thinks that we're
supposed to be together

495
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,653
no matter what.

496
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,008
Those gunmen left that kid behind today.

497
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:49,211
I killed two people myself because of you,

498
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:53,339
and Carl and the baby.

499
00:41:53,757 --> 00:41:56,672
It was gonna be me
and not them no matter what.

500
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:05,395
You killed the living
to protect what's yours?

501
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:07,995
That's right.

502
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:10,630
Shane thinks I'm his.

503
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,254
He thinks the baby's his.

504
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:18,856
And he says you can't protect us,

505
00:42:19,784 --> 00:42:21,139
that you're gonna get us killed.

506
00:42:24,228 --> 00:42:27,003
He's dangerous, Rick, and he won't stop.

507
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:39,678
