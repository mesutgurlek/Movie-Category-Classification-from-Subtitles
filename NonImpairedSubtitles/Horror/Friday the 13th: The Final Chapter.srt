1
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,500
I don't want to scare anyone,

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,200
but I'm going to give it
to you straight about Jason.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,600
His body was never recovered
from the lake after he drowned.

4
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,100
The old-timers
say he's still out there.

5
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,900
- Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed.
- It's got a death curse.

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,500
Some folks claim they've even
seen him, right in this area.

7
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,600
who is that?

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,700
Oh, hi! what are you doing
out in this mist?

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,600
The girl who survived that night at
Camp Blood that Friday the 13th...

10
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,800
...she claims she saw him.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,300
The boy... is he dead, too?

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,400
we didn't find any boy.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,700
<i>Then he's still there.</i>

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,300
She disappeared two months later.

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,800
Legend has it that Jason
saw his mother beheaded that night.

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,500
And he took his revenge.

17
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,400
No!

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,400
A revenge he'll continue to seek if
anyone enters his wilderness again.

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,900
Jason was my son.
And today is his birthday.

20
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,800
That's a good boy.

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,100
- Good.
- Good Jason.

22
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,600
Jason's out there.

23
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,500
No!

24
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,400
You can't be alive!

25
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,600
Got another coming in, Larry.
Get your ass there.

26
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
where are they?

27
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,200
where do you need it?

28
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,000
we've got ten in the barn.

29
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,900
what's wrong with 'em?

30
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,500
He's dead. Yeah, they're all dead.
You can pull it up over there.

31
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
All dead. Some emergency.
Put her over there.

32
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
This is the guy that's been leaving
the wet stuff?

33
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,100
This time
he got seven kids and three bikers.

34
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,600
This time they got him.

35
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
Lainie?

36
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,700
Belt him.

37
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,100
what's the matter with you?
He's dead.

38
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,700
<i>OK, boys and girls, let's get going!

39
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,900
God!

40
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,300
<i>Dr. Wilby to OR2,</i>

41
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Here, sign it.

42
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,800
- This your last?
- No, got one more over there.

43
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,700
- Real cute girl.
- was.

44
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,100
She still is. All you gotta do
is go over there...

45
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,300
Nice talk. Real nice talk.
I get the top copy.

46
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,300
Take care, Axel.

47
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,400
- I'm free, doll.
- A bargain at twice the price.

48
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,400
- what's the matter?
- I have a headache, Axel.

49
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,000
- For you, I always have a headache.
- Oh, I can fix that.

50
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,900
Meet me in the cold room.

51
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm closing up for the night.
what do you say? OK?

52
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,400
Axel, I am not going to fake
any more orgasms for you.

53
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,400
You got the curse?

54
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,300
If I do... you're it.

55
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,500
Axel?

56
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,400
Oh, Axel.

57
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,000
Axel?

58
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,600
God! Axel!

59
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,100
I'm so glad you could come.

60
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,300
You are the Super Bowl of self-abuse!
I just came to watch the news.

61
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,900
<i>Another chapter in a story</i>

62
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,500

63

<i>A trail of mangled bodies</i>
<i>has led authorities to conclude...</i>

64
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,100
I really came to watch the news.

65
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,200
<i>We're still awaiting positive</i>
<i>identification of the body.</i>

66
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,400

69
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,700
Yeah!

70
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,700
That's you
they're talking about, pal.

71
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
I don't believe you, Axel.

72
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,300
Then... shut... my... mouth.

73
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,400
Jesus Christmas!

74
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,700
Holy Jesus! Goddamn!

75
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,900
Holy Jesus jumping Christmas shit!

76
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,800
You wanna get that sucker
in the icebox!

77
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,100
I must be nuts! I really...

78
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,700
- Good night.
- where are you going?

79
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,500
I'll tell you where I'm going,
I'm going crazy!

80
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,100
Shit!

81
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,900
Hi, girls. Thanks for waiting.

82
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,800
Oh, no!

83
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,400
Shit!

84
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Get lost, Axel, I'm busy.
I've had enough of you for one night.

85
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,200
Read my lips. Leave me alone!

86
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
No!

87
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,500
- I talked to Dad.
- How is he?

88
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,200
He said he was lonely.
Asked me to come out and see him.

89
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,500
Did he tell you to take a number?

90
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,400
No, but he asked about you.

91
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,600
Did he? Actually, you really should
get out there and see him.

92
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,900
Yeah, I know.

93
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,900
I bet he could stand a visit.

94
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,400
- what do you think?
- I think you're getting horny.

95
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,500
Tommy, turn that down!

96
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,400
Mom, I got 98,000.

97
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,500
How many robots is that?

98
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,800
35.

99
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,600
why don't you kill a few more
up in your room?

100
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,900
I can't.
I need a bypass patch cord.

101
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,400
Maybe you can get one in town.

102
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,100
Trish'll drive you.

103
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,300
Honey, get a haircut.

104
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,000
Ma.

105
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,600
- That's a nice mask.
- Do I have to get a haircut?

106
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,400
You're getting terrific
at making those.

107
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,700
Thanks. I just customized it.

108
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,300
- where's Gordon?
- He went out.

109
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,200
Someone left the front door open.

110
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,900
we're in the country.

111
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,400
what happens if a psycho wanders in?

112
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,500
He'd probably challenge him
to a game of Zaxxon.

113
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,700
- Hear any more about next door?
- It's been rented by some kids.

114
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,600
- Great.
- How many?

115
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,800
- Six.
- It'll be nice to have some company.

116
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,800
Country Boy. Country boy.
Sitting in the grass.

117
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,900
Along came a prarie dog 
and crawled right up his ask me no more questions.

118
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,100
You broke up with BJ Betty?

119
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,600
So to speak. would you lighten up
on her? She's alright.

120
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,800
Yeah, I'll say she's alright.

121
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,400
You should have treated her right.

122
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,100
I mean,
that girl wanted to be treated right.

123
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,900
I did. I treated her right.

124
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,900
I treated her right, that's what's
driving me so crazy.

125
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,900
First, she would take my calls,
but she would have something to do.

126
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,800
Then she wouldn't take my calls.

127
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,700
Can you figure that?
what the fuck happened?

128
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,900
Let me put it in the old computer.

129
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,000
- No, I'm serious about this.
- The computer don't lie.

130
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Now, let's see.

131
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,300
what?

132
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
It says...

133
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,600
It says you're a dead fuck.

134
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,200
what? A dead fuck?

135
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,500
A lousy lay. You know?

136
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,400
- A dead pecker.
- Don't hold back, Doc!

137
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,300
Give it to me straight.

138
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,400
I did not say it. The computer did.

139
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,400
- There is no computer!
- There's no Betty either.

140
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,000
Then, I'm a dead fuck.

141
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,900
Like I said, the computer don't lie.

142
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,000
God, I'm horny!

143
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,400
- where are we now?
- Lost.

144
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,700
we are lost.

145
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,200
Pretty creepy.

146
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,200
Yeah.

147
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,500
Alright, I think I got it.

148
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,800
Go straight ahead two miles
and hang a right.

149
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,000
PAMELA VOORHEES
1930-1979
AT REST

150
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,100
CANADÁ AND LOVE.

151
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,700
- Paul, let's pick her up.
- Sammy, where are we gonna put her?

152
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,100
Honey, you got a sister?

153
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,500
FUCK-YOU

154
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,400
Mom, I thought we were having pizza.

155
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,800
I thought so, too, but we've got
a refrigerator full of leftovers.

156
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,800
You're not smiling. Not in the mood
for my tuna salad?

157
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,300
- well...
- I'm not either.

158
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,300
I'm in the mood for a...

159
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes.

160
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,300
I feel like...

161
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,200
- No!
- A Jarvis hug!

162
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,300
- Somebody's at the door.
- No, you don't.

163
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,800
- No, Mom, I heard that, too.
- I'll go.

164
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,000
Gordon! where have you been?

165
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,500
Have you been sneaking around?
Do you have a girlfriend?

166
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,600
Tommy, close the door.

167
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,000
Listen, Gordon, we'll talk later.

168
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,100
Alright.

169
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,700
- Hey Doug. Hit me with the beer.
- You got it.

170
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,300
- what did I tell you?
- what? You told me you were horny.

171
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,000
No, I've come to realize
a guy can have a good time

172
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,400
without having to have
girls all about.

173
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,700
That's a sin, you dead fuck.

174
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,500
I really don't want you
to call me that any more.

175
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,100
Hi. what a handsome mutt you are.

176
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,900
- His name's Gordon. I'm Trish.
- Hi, Trish.

177
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,600
I don't know how you do it.

178
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,300
I don't know how you don't.

179
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,000
I mean,

180
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,300
you do it with everybody.

181
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,400
I do not!

182
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,700
I do it with Paul.

183
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,800
- Really?
- Come on, Sara!

184
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,200
You know how guys are,
they lie about that all the time.

185
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
They say that about everybody.

186
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,800
They don't say anything about me.

187
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
I mean, I don't have...

188
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,100
- A reputation?
- I didn't say that.

189
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,900
Look, I got my reputation
in the sixth grade.

190
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,200
what does Paul think?

191
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,700
Paul thinks I'm great in bed,
so that's where I keep him.

192
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,900
what are the sleeping arrangements
here, anyway?

193
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,800
we have the bedroom down the hall.

194
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,500
You and Doug can sleep next door.

195
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,800
Really?

196
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,900
Yeah. It's OK, they're bunk beds.
Don't worry about it.

197
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,100
I'm gonna go to bed now, Mom.
Good night.

198
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,900
Don't forget, 6 A.M..

199
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,400
Once around the lake.

200
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
- Good night.
- Sleep well.

201
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,800
You, too.

202
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,900
when we get to town,
I should call Betty.

203
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,700
Ted?

204
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,000
I think when we get to town,
I should call Betty.

205
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Jimbo, calling Betty is definitely
a dead-fuck thing to do.

206
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,300
Look, first rule of love, never get
rejected by the same girl twice.

207
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,600
That's useless.
You wanna make a fool of yourself,

208
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,000
always do it with someone new.

209
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,600
I don't know anybody new.

210
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,600
well, sex is a great way to meet 'em.

211
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,400
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

212
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,800
- Don't worry about it.
- Hi.

213
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,200
Hi.

214
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,700
- You girls live around here?
- How far is it to Crystal Point?

215
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,400
- That's where we're going.
- Yeah. It's a long walk.

216
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,200
- we can take it.
- I'll go back to get the car.

217
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,900
- Sara, you want some company?
- This way?

218
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,600
Thanks.
I'll just meet you guys there.

219
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,300
Alright.

220
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:35,600
- They're cute.
- Two of 'em. Count 'em, one, two.
- Yes, and two of us.

221
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,600
Come on in!

222
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,700
Oh... no.

223
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,500
we have no suits.

224
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,000
Alright!

225
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,800
Alright!

226
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Skinny-dip!

227
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,700
- Gordon, wait up!
- Gordon.

228
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,500
Gordon, wait up! wait a minute!

229
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,200
Gordon

230
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,300
- Jimmie!
- Come on, Jimmie!

231
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,500
- Turn around.
- Can't I just...

232
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,500
- Turn around!
- Trish, come on in!

233
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,600
No, thanks. I think I'm overdressed.

234
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,200
- Hey, Trish!
- Bye-bye.

235
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,000
Party tonight!

236
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,300
Gordon, we're too young for this.

237
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,700
Some pack of patooties, huh?

238
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,800
Tommy!

239
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,100
Oh, no!

240
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,400
what next?

241
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,700
Can you fix it?

242
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,300
- I need a screwdriver.
- Maybe there's one in the trunk.

243
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,800
I need the keys.

244
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,200
Tommy, come on!

245
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,800
Come in, Sara,
let's see what you got.

246
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,700
- No.
- Come on, Sara. Strip and dip.

247
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,700
Sam, I said no.

248
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,800
I'm going to go under
and stay under until you do.

249
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,700
See you later.

250
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,900
Sam?

251
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,900
God, Sam!

252
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,900
You bitch!

253
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,600
- You like that?
- You bitch!

254
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,500
Turn it on, Trish.

255
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
Turn it on!

256
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,600
Hi. Rob Dyer. Sorry about that.

257
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,600
- Hello.
- Hi. what's your problem?

258
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,400
- No problem.
- I mean, with the car.

259
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,700
Oh, the car. It won't start.

260
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,000
well, get in. Give it a crank.

261
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,800
I've tried everything.
It could be the solenoid.

262
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,500
If you had a screwdriver...

263
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,000
Give it a crank.

264
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,200
You need a lift?

265
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,600
I didn't think anyone
lived this deep in the woods.

266
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,000
we do.
what are you hunting for up here?

267
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,500
Bear. Anybody up at the lake today?

268
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,600
You can't be hunting for bear.

269
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,100
How about kids?
Kids, vacationers, people like that?

270
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Yeah. A bunch of kids moved in
yesterday. Right next door to us.

271
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,200
- This is it.
- Thanks for the lift.

272
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,600
Gordon!

273
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,300
would you like to come in
for a minute?

274
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,700
I don't think I can.

275
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:46,300
You gotta come in. I got something
real neat to show you up in my room.

276
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,900
Hi, Mom!

277
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,500
Tommy, who's your friend?

278
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,300
Mom, this is Rob. Rob, my mother.

279
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,600
- Hello, Mrs...
- Jarvis.

280
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,000
Amazing.

281
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,100
I want to show you something.

282
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,500
would you care to dance?

283
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,000
- To this?
- It's good.

284
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,900
- How come you turned that off?
- Relax, Jimbo. You'll love this.

285
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,600
wanna give Teddy Bear a kiss?

286
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,400
Teddy.

287
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,700
I've got to get another drink.

288
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,700
- Excuse me.
- Hi. You like this stuff?

289
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,000
You like slow dancing?

290
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,600
I could learn to.

291
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,100
Kiss me, you fool.

292
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,100
Certainly.

293
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,300
Maybe we could dance to this one.

294
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,000
Let Teddy Bear show you
how it's done.

295
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,700
Stay near the trail around the lake.

296
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,200
Yeah, I will.

297
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,300
There's only three of you here?

298
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,500
My parents have separated.
Middle-aged crazies.

299
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,400
I kind of hope
they get back together.

300
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,800
Yeah, I hope so, too.

301
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,100
- Looks like another rainy one, huh?
- Yeah.

302
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,800
Listen, if it gets too bad out there,

303
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,000
or if you want to take a shower,
whatever, we're always home.

304
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,400
And if we're not,
Tommy usually leaves the door open.

305
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,500
- Good night.
- Take care.

306
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,200
How are you doing with yours?

307
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,700
Nowhere, huh?

308
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,000
Check.

309
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,200
You gotta warm her up.
watch me. Do what I do.

310
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,800
And, Jimbo,
don't be such a dead fuck.

311
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,100
I told you that I didn't like that.
Besides, you've got the hot one.

312
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,700
Check.

313
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,500
- Hiya.
- He thinks that's funny.

314
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,200
He thinks that's a funny thing
he's doing.

315
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,700
OK, ready, Tina? Alright, on three.

316
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,300
One! Two! Three!

317
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,600
And the winner is... Tina!

318
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
Alright!

319
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
what do I win?

320
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
what do you want?

321
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,500
Jimbo, put on another record.

322
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,300
Jimbo.

323
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,400
You don't mind, do you?

324
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,300
Actually, I was thinking about
taking a little swim.

325
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,700
It's getting
a bit close in here for me.

326
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,300
- Sam?
- Sara! Let's dance.

327
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,100
I don't wanna dance.

328
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,600
well, let's mind our own business.

329
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,900
Look, I'll talk to Paul.

330
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,600
Alright?

331
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:33,400
- I want to talk to you a second.
- Man, I am going to kill him!

332
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,000
- I said I wanted to talk to you.
- Not now, dead fuck.

333
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,000
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

334
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,300
Do you believe this guy?

335
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,100
I mean, I had her. She was mine.

336
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,500
You know what I suggest you do,
Teddy?

337
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,200
I think you should run that
through your little computer.

338
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,200
Paul?

339
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,000
I know you're out there, Paulie.

340
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,300
Paul?

341
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,600
OK. Screw you, Paulie.

342
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,000
Come on, Paul.

343
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,400
I know you're out there.

344
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,700
Paul?

345
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,200
Screw you, Paul.

346
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,500
Look, what's the matter?

347
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,800
I can't go through with this.

348
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,300
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

349
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,700
You wanna dance?

350
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,200
Yeah.

351
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,600
I thought you wanted
to be with Ted.

352
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,200
well, I did.

353
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,300
Now I want to be with you.

354
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,400
That makes me feel like a rat.

355
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,800
well, d'you wanna join them?

356
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,600
Jimmie?

357
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,600
why don't we just go upstairs?

358
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,800
Upstairs.

359
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,600
That's Teddy Bear.
want to give Teddy Bear a kiss?

360
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,000
Sam!

361
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,300
Shit!

362
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,000
Shit.

363
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,700
This is a neat room.

364
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,200
This is... your room.

365
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,800
No, actually it's Paul's room.

366
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,300
You're neat.

367
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,400
- Oh, gosh!
- Sorry.

368
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,100
Hey, you guys! Look what I found.

369
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,300
what is that?

370
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,900
God, what a pig!

371
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,700
Tina? we gotta go.

372
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,300
You go.

373
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,000
Tina, I'm gonna leave without you.

374
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,100
Take an umbrella.

375
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,100
You slut!

376
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,100
HELP

377
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,200
I'm going upstairs.

378
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,300
Are you tired?

379
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,100
No.

380
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,300
Do you mind sleeping in
the bottom bunk tonight?

381
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,600
why? You want to sleep on the top?

382
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,500
No.

383
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,000
Give me a few minutes.

384
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,700
OK?

385
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,400
Good night, Teddy Bear.

386
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,500
Good night.

387
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,900
Stop!

388
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,400
Tommy? I'm going to towel off
and then I'm going to strangle you.

389
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,700
Tommy? Trish?

390
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,700
Anybody home?

391
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,500
Gordon?

392
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,000
where's Tommy?

393
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,600
Gordon?

394
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,400
where's Trish?

395
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,800
As a matter of fact,
where the hell are you?

396
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,600
Gordon?

397
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,200
watch it!

398
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,500
Can we slow down a little?
The party's going to go on all night.

399
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,400
I think I'm gonna lose my lollipop.

400
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,400
Mom, we're home.

401
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,400
Mom?

402
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,400
- where is she?
- I don't know.

403
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,100
Mom?

404
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,900
Mom?

405
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,200
- She's not here.
- Maybe she's still jogging.

406
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,600
She's never gone this long.
And in the rain?

407
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,500
I'm going out on the path.

408
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,500
- Me, too.
- Stay here in case she comes back.

409
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,500
- I'll go!
- Stay here and fix the lights.

410
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,100
- what the hell are you doing here?
- Are you trying to kill me?

411
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,400
Tina?

412
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,100
Never mind.

413
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,500
Tell me.

414
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Did I... was...

415
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,600
was I?

416
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,000
was I a dead fuck?

417
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,600
- what?
- A dead fuck.

418
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,300
No.

419
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,300
You know what I think?

420
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,700
You know what I really think?

421
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,100
I think you were incredible.

422
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,700
- I want to do it again.
- Yeah.

423
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,000
Don't you move. I'll be right back.

424
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,500
Check it out.

425
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,900
Run this through your computer,
Teddy Bear.

426
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,300
Hey, congratulations, Jimbo.

427
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,500
where's that bottle of wine?
why don't we celebrate?

428
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,200
I think, maybe, I drank it.

429
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,000
I was great!

430
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,600
I was great.

431
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,400
Love, Teddy Bear!

432
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,900
L-O-V-E!

433
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,600
Hey, Ted, where is?
where is that corkscrew?

434
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,000
That fancy corkscrew
for the wine bottle?

435
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,700
Ted?

436
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,000
Ted! where the hell is the corkscrew?

437
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,000
Jimmie?

438
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,800
My sister Sandra
was a really great kid.

439
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,600
But the man that killed her is dead.

440
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,100
No, he's alive.

441
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,400
Look.

442
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,500
Jason as a child.

443
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,800
Artist's conception of Jason as
described by a would-be victim.

444
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,300
And then, the murders.

445
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,000
But he's dead.

446
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,900
Jason's body
has disappeared from the morgue.

447
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,100
- It was stolen.
- It was not stolen.

448
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:48,900
Two people at the hospital
are missing. This is coincidence?

449
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,400
He's alive.

450
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,200
Oh, my God. Tommy's at the house.

451
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,400
Teddy.

452
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:40,900
Ooh, man.

453
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,700
So, you wanna give
the old teddy bear a kiss?

454
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,800
Jimbo?

455
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,800
Sara, I think I'm in heaven.

456
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,600
I think I'm in love.

457
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,700
what?

458
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,300
I'll meet you in the bottom bunk.

459
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,200
Sara? Change your mind?

460
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,400
Get in here. There's plenty of room.
we can sing a duet.

461
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,600
who is it? Paulie?

462
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,500
Paulie?

463
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,300
Paulie, is that you?

464
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,600
Hey, Paulie? whoops,
dropped my bar of soap, old buddy.

465
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,100
Lucky you ain't in here with me,
old pal.

466
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,700
I came to hear you sing.

467
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,000
So sing.

468
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,500
Sam!

469
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,000
Tommy. Thank God you're OK.

470
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,500
- Tommy.
- what happened?

471
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,400
- Is Mom back?
- No, not yet.

472
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,100
I'm gonna call for help.

473
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,700
Rob, what's going on?

474
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,700
- I'm not getting anything.
- I'll go next door.

475
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,400
- I'm going with you.
- No.

476
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:06,000
- Tommy, stay here and lock the door.
- Hold the fort.

477
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,100
Gordon!

478
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,500
- He's been here.
- what if he still is here?

479
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,800
Take this. Take it!

480
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,400
I'm going downstairs.
Stay with Gordon.

481
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,100
- No.
- Stay here with Gordon!

482
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,000
Gordon.

483
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,100
Rob!

484
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,800
Rob, he's here!

485
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,900
- He's here. He's killed all of them.
- OK, come on.

486
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,700
Shit. Give me a hand.

487
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,500
- Gotta get the knife.
- No!

488
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,700
No!

489
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,600
Oh, God, he's killing me!

490
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,700
Run, Trish!

491
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,200
Trish, run!

492
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,200
Tommy!

493
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,400
- Are the doors locked?
- Yes.

494
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,400
Get me a hammer and nails.

495
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,400
- Is he here?
- Yes.

496
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,900
Tommy, hurry!

497
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,500
Help me!

498
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,300
Help me! Let me go!

499
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,400
Put me down!

500
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,700
Tommy, help me push this.

501
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,400
where is he?

502
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,000
what's he doing?

503
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,800
Listen, Tommy, I'm going to get him
out of the house.

504
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,700
when I do, you run like hell,
you hear?

505
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,500
Run like hell, OK?

506
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,100
Oh, my God!

507
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:43,700
Trish!

508
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,800
Tommy! No!

509
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,800
Trish!

510
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,600
Trish!

511
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,500
Tommy?

512
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:40,100
Tommy, you were supposed to leave!

513
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,300
Tommy, get the hell outta here!

514
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,300
No!

515
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,600
You son of a bitch.

516
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,800
I'll give you something
to remember us by.

517
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,400
Jason!

518
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,300
Jason!

519
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,400
Remember me, Jason?

520
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,300
Don't you remember?

521
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,600
Remember, Jason?

522
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,000
Jason, remember?

523
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,600
Remember?

524
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,400
Tommy.

525
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,700
Die!

526
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,700
Die!

527
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:32,700
Die!

528
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,700
Die!

529
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:41,800
The shoulder will need
some surgery.

530
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,700
But we can wait
till she's a better candidate.

531
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,500
You just get a good rest, young lady.

532
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,400
You haven't answered my question.

533
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,900
Neither one of you
is answering my question.

534
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:58,900
Often during extreme duress, people are
capable of extraordinary behavior.

535
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:03,200
That's what happened when Tommy
violently attacked the killer.

536
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:07,900
It was perfectly normal
for him to act to protect himself.

537
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,700
He's going to be just fine.

538
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:12,400
But right now, what you need is rest.

539
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,700
Can I see my brother now?

540
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,200
Sure, but only for a minute.

541
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,900
I'll send him in.

542
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,400
Tommy.

543
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:12,400
