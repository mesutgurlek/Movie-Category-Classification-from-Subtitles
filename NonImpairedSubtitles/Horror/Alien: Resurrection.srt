170
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:26,160
ELGYN: Little prick.

171
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:31,154
You know, no matter
how many times you see it...

172
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,693
the sight of a woman strapped up
in a chair like that just...

173
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,673
What?

174
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,176
Just bring us in
on a 3-0 descent, would you?

175
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,677
And ride the parallel.

176
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:46,476
- Darlin', it is done.
- Good girl.

177
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:51,185
Hey, don't cut thrust
till about 600 meters...

178
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:53,517
and we'll give 'em
a little scare.

Go.

Put your hands up, please, sir.

188
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,922
What?

189
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:09,260
Could you get your hands up,
please?

190
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,733
[Beeping]

191
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,970
There are no weapons
allowed on board, sir.

192
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,144
My own recipe.

193

Way more dangerous.

194
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:36,021
ELGYN: Nice welcome, Perez.
What the hell is this?

195
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:39,618
Are you afraid the six of us
are gonna hijack your damn ship?

196
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:41,128
Just a minor concern...

197
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:43,153
that one of your asshole
crew members...

198
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:45,894
will get drunk and put
a bullet through the hull.

199
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,164
We happen to be in space, Elgyn.

200
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:50,763
No shit. How you been?

201
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,199
[Beeping]

202
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:01,209
Want to check the chair?

203
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:10,408
Elgyn, these were
very, very hard to come by.

204
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:12,504
So was our cargo.

205
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:16,415
You're not about to plead
poverty on me, are you, General?

206
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,748
No. I'm just saying...

207
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:20,084
very few people
deal in cash nowadays.

208
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:23,057
Just the ones don't like
to keep business records.

209
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:24,683
Yourself, for example.

210
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:25,750
Drink, Elgyn?

211
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,125
Constantly.

212
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:35,035
ELGYN: Now, I'm gonna take
a wild guess here, General...

213
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,097
but I'm thinking whatever
you got going on here...

214
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:43,601
it ain't exactly
approved by Congress.

215
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:49,083
Who's the new filly
you got on board, Elgyn?

216
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:53,110
Call?
Little girl playing pirates.

217
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:55,783
She makes an impression.

218
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:58,622
She is severely fuckable,
ain't she?

219
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,628
Ha ha ha!

220
00:19:00,662 --> 00:19:02,323
Mind you...

221
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:04,559
I think she's just
a tad curious...

222
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,067
about this little
transaction of ours.

223
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,570
I mean,
I can't say as I blame her.

224
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:11,572
It's awfully
cloak-and-dagger stuff.

225
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:14,234
It's a military operation.

226
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:17,370
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:20,279
ELGYN: Correct me if I'm wrong,
but, uh...

228
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:24,115
I was under the impression
that most army medical labs...

229
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:27,178
don't have to operate
outside of regulated space.

230
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:28,655
What do you want, Elgyn?

231
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,750
- Me?
- Yeah.

232
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:33,988
Two days bed and board.

233
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:37,123
Vriess might wanna
snag a part here or there.

234
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:39,190
Whatever. If it's not imposing.

So...

499
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,398
who do I have to fuck
to get off this boat?

500
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:40,607
JOHNER: I can get you off.
Maybe not the boat, but...

501
00:47:41,877 --> 00:47:43,845
CHRISTIE: Let's get out of here.

502
00:47:43,879 --> 00:47:47,076
CALL: Wait a second. She was
the hostfor these monsters.

503
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:49,584
Wren cloned her
because she had one inside her.

504
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:52,109
She's not human.

505
00:47:53,255 --> 00:47:56,656
She was part of his experiment,
and she will turn on us.

506
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:59,286
- I don't give a shit.
- She's too much of a risk.

507
00:47:59,328 --> 00:48:00,795
We have to leave her.

508
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,263
She comes.

509
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:04,528
We can't trust her.

510
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:06,159
I don't trust anyone.

511
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,208
CHRISTIE: lf we're gonna
survive, we all stick together.

512
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:14,402
Agreed?

513
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:28,151
Hillard, we gotta go.

514
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,590
It's not over.
We gotta get to the Betty.

515
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:01,179
Make a nice souvenir.

516
00:49:09,899 --> 00:49:11,867
CALL:
I can't believe you did that.

517
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:13,596
RIPLEY: Did what?

518
00:49:13,636 --> 00:49:16,605
CALL: You killed one of 'em.
It's like killing your own kind.

519
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:18,129
RIPLEY: lt was in my way.

520
00:49:28,918 --> 00:49:29,907
[Electronic beep]

521
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:43,796
Oh, man!

522
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:51,129
Who were you expecting,
Santa Claus?

523
00:49:51,173 --> 00:49:52,470
[Sighs]

524
00:49:52,508 --> 00:49:55,136
Thought you were toast
for certain, man.

525
00:49:55,177 --> 00:49:56,474
VRIESS: Where's Elgyn?

526
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,508
Oh, shit.

527
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:05,418
What if we get to the Betty
and they're all over it?

528
00:50:05,454 --> 00:50:07,649
WREN: All the activity's been
by the barracks.

529
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,658
- Why would they move?
- They won't.

530
00:50:09,692 --> 00:50:12,923
If they send anyone out,
it'll be here...

531
00:50:12,962 --> 00:50:16,329
where the meat is.

532
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:20,529
If we wanna make decent time,
I say we ditch the cripple.

533
00:50:22,471 --> 00:50:25,235
- No offense, man.
- None taken.

534
00:50:25,274 --> 00:50:27,504
Nobody is left behind.

535
00:50:27,543 --> 00:50:29,477
Not even you, Johner.

536
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,708
What's the quickest way out?

537
00:50:32,748 --> 00:50:35,945
After the cooling tower,
there's a freight elevator.

538
00:50:35,985 --> 00:50:37,680
It runs from the top...

539
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,449
down to engineering
level one deck.

540
00:50:39,488 --> 00:50:40,921
Take us straight to the dock.

541
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:42,150
Sounds reasonable.

542
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:43,681
Let's do it.

543
00:50:44,994 --> 00:50:46,154
We're moving.

544
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:48,963
What?

545
00:50:48,998 --> 00:50:51,364
RIPLEY: The ship is moving.
I can feel it.

546
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,392
The ship has stealthrun.
There's no way you can tell.

547
00:50:55,904 --> 00:50:57,929
She's right.

548
00:50:57,973 --> 00:50:59,804
Ship's been go since the attack.

549
00:50:59,842 --> 00:51:02,902
WREN: That's a standard
emergency procedure.

550
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:04,913
DISTEPHANO: That's right.
Any serious problem...

551
00:51:04,947 --> 00:51:07,415
and the ship autopilots
back to home base.

552
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:09,747
You were planning on
telling us this?

553
00:51:09,785 --> 00:51:11,582
Nobody asked.

554
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,953
HILLARD: What's home base?

555
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:18,392
Earth.

556
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:20,827
CHRISTIE: Oh, great.

557
00:51:20,863 --> 00:51:22,262
Bastard.

558
00:51:22,297 --> 00:51:25,824
JOHNER: Earth? I'd rather
stay here with the things, man.

559
00:51:25,868 --> 00:51:28,132
How long until we get to Earth?

560
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,933
Three hours almost.

561
00:51:29,972 --> 00:51:32,133
We got to blow the ship.

562
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:34,972
Call, you're not
blowing this ship.

563
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,342
Not while we're on it, OK?

564
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:41,372
We get out of this ship,
you do as you please, all right?

565
00:51:42,985 --> 00:51:46,580
Earth, man. What a shithole.

566
00:51:54,196 --> 00:51:55,493
RIPLEY: lt's clear.

567
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:03,431
Hey, Ripley.

568
00:52:08,444 --> 00:52:11,607
I heard you, like,
ran into these things before.

569
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:14,076
That's right.

570
00:52:14,116 --> 00:52:15,583
Wow, man.

571
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:19,280
So, like, what did you do?

572
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:23,823
I died.

573
00:52:50,953 --> 00:52:52,443
DISTEPHANO: Not that way!

574
00:52:58,254 --> 00:52:59,448
CHRISTIE: Ripley.

575
00:53:06,896 --> 00:53:08,386
Ripley, come on.

576
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,460
Ripley, we got no time
for sightseeing here.

577
00:53:18,608 --> 00:53:19,905
WREN: Ripley, don't.

578
00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:41,017
[Gasps]

00:54:45,394 --> 00:54:46,588

me.

584
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:39,013
Kill... me.

585
00:57:20,382 --> 00:57:22,009
CALL: Don't do it, Ripley.

586
00:57:30,192 --> 00:57:31,853
RIPLEY: Don't do what?

587
00:57:44,507 --> 00:57:46,873
What's the big deal, man?

588
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:49,036
Fucking waste of ammo.

589
00:57:49,078 --> 00:57:50,409
Let's go.

590
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:55,639
Must be a chick thing.

591
00:59:04,745 --> 00:59:05,939
Am I dreaming...

592
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,881
or is this not the shit
we brought with us?

593
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:11,441
CHRISTIE: Yeah.
It's the same shit.

594
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:14,477
It stinks in here, man.
Let's keep moving.

595
00:59:42,183 --> 00:59:45,050
Aah!

596
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:46,986
Get away from me!

597
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:50,784
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

598
00:59:50,825 --> 00:59:52,087
Get away from me!

599
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:53,093
CHRISTIE: Drop the rod, man.

600
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:54,424
- Get away from me!
- Do it!

601
00:59:54,462 --> 00:59:55,952
Get away from me.

602
00:59:58,733 --> 01:00:00,633
Get away from me.

603
01:00:01,635 --> 01:00:03,296
Who are you people?

604
01:00:04,372 --> 01:00:06,363
What's happening here?

605
01:00:06,407 --> 01:00:07,874
CHRISTIE: Calm down.
What's happening here...

606
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:10,502
is we're getting the fuck
off this ghost ship, OK?

607
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,571
Ship? What ship?

01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,081
Where am I?

609
01:00:17,118 --> 01:00:21,179
I was in cryo, right?
On my way to Xarem.

610
01:00:21,222 --> 01:00:23,816
Work crew
for the nickel refinery, right?

611
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:27,817
I wake up.
I... I know I don't understand.

612
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:33,530
I woke up.
I... I saw horrible things.

613
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:38,027
Look, you're coming with us.
It's too dangerous for you here.

614
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:46,145
[Sniffs]

615
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:50,709
Leave him.

616

CALL: Fuck you.
We're not leaving him here.

617
01:00:53,621 --> 01:00:56,784
He's got one inside of him.

618
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:58,519
I can smell it.

619
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:03,293
PURVIS: Inside me?

620
01:01:04,632 --> 01:01:06,190
Inside me?

621
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:08,428
What's inside me?

622
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:11,097
I don't want one of those things
birthing anywhere near my ass.

623
01:01:11,138 --> 01:01:12,469
It's a bad risk.

624
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:15,100
What's inside me?

625
01:01:15,142 --> 01:01:17,042
We can't just leave him here.

626
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:19,011
CHRISTIE: I thought
you wanted to stop them.

627
01:01:19,046 --> 01:01:21,844
- What's inside me?
- Can't you stop it?

628
01:01:21,882 --> 01:01:23,349
CHRISTIE: Got no time for that.

629
01:01:23,384 --> 01:01:25,352
WREN: Not here.
The lab is damaged.

630
01:01:25,386 --> 01:01:28,321
CHRISTIE: I could do him.
Back of the head.

631
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,323
Painless.
It might be the best way.

632
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:31,790
What's inside me?

633
01:01:31,826 --> 01:01:34,761
- Got to be another way.
- What if we freeze him?

634
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:36,695
What's in-fucking-side me?!

635
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:50,677
There's a monster
in your chest.

636
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:54,238
These guys hijacked your ship...

637
01:01:54,281 --> 01:01:58,684
and they sold your cryotube
to this human...

638
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,485
and he put an alien
inside of you.

639
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:05,390
It's a really nasty one.

640
01:02:05,426 --> 01:02:07,189
And in a few hours...

641
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:09,856
it's gonna burst its way
through your rib cage...

642
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:11,888
and you're gonna die.

643
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:19,597
Any questions?

644
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,170
Who are you?

645
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:32,383
I'm the monster's mother.

646
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,158
CALL: Look, he comes with us.

647
01:02:38,192 --> 01:02:41,423
We freeze him on the Betty.
The doctor can remove it later.

648
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:56,699
JOHNER: lt's a mess down there.
Is this the only way?

649
01:02:56,744 --> 01:02:59,235
CHRISTIE:
Vriess, we gotta lose the chair.

650
01:03:01,715 --> 01:03:02,704
I know.

651
01:03:03,717 --> 01:03:05,685
Kawlang maneuver, all right?

652
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:08,347
Yeah. Just like old times.

653
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:09,583
Yeah.

654
01:03:13,727 --> 01:03:15,695
VRIESS:
Must be the cooling tanks.

655
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:18,857
Somebody must've opened
the valves.

656
01:03:18,899 --> 01:03:22,062
CHRISTIE: The nasties couldn't
have done this, could they?

657
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,205
WREN: We're at the bottom
of the ship.

658
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:38,218
We have to go
through the kitchen...

659
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:39,776
maybe 90 feet...

Come on, baby.

Aah!

996
01:35:04,113 --> 01:35:06,980
This thing is gonna fall apart.

997
01:35:07,016 --> 01:35:09,610
Pressure's unstable!

998
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:17,551
Go help Call turn on
the auxiliary pump!

Hey!

1008

I'm not the mechanic here,
lronsides!

1009
01:36:13,049 --> 01:36:14,983
I mostly just hurt people.

Hey, Ripley!

1016
01:36:35,638 --> 01:36:38,300
Johner, where are you,
you son of a bitch?

1017
01:36:38,341 --> 01:36:39,968
Get on it, bastard!

1018
01:36:40,009 --> 01:36:41,374
What am I supposed to do?

1019
01:36:41,411 --> 01:36:43,535
Grab the sticks!

- Whew!
- Whew!

1038
01:41:35,994 --> 01:41:37,621
Well, you did it.

1039
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:40,521
You saved the Earth.

1040
01:41:41,433 --> 01:41:43,094
You sound disappointed.

1041
01:41:47,038 --> 01:41:48,596
It's beautiful.

Yeah.

I don't know.

1046
