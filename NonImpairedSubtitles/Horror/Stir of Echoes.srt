1
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,950
OK.

2
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:38,289
Jackson came over to play.

3
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,751
Superheroes!

4
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,049
I was Black Power Ranger.

5
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,475
He was Batman.

6
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,727
Jake, are you OK in there, buddy?

7
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,896
I'm OK.

8
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,692
Can I ask you a question?

9
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,070
OK! Time to hit the sack.

10
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:13,991
- An important question.
- There we go, big guy. Come on.

11
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:21,040
- Can I wear bugs?
- Bug pyjamas... are all the way downstairs.

12
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,209
But fire trucks are here.

13
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,960
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

14
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,629
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

15
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,632
- Bugs.
- OK, bugs.

16
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,135
I'll be right back.

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,983
Does it hurt to be dead?

18
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,827
- Animal.
- What did I do now?

19
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,912
- Can I tell him?
- If you wanna die.

20
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,581
- Well, your beer-addled sperm still work.
- Lisa!

21
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:05,543
- You impregnated my sister again.
- Bitch!

22
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,212
- I thought you wanted me to?
- I said "Don't"!

23
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,465
The kid could have been born
before he'd notice.

24
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:16,804
- You're not pregnant.
- I feel "Congratulations" is more appropriate.

25
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,682
- You told her before you told me.
- She's a witch!

26
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,685
She took one look at me and guessed.

27
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,354
Say something!

28
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,439
Bummer.

29
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,775
Something else!

30
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,657
So... she's six weeks pregnant.
That means the baby's due in April, May,...

31
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,994
...June. Gemini. That's cool.
Einstein was a Gemini.

32
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:44,248
- So's that Scottish gal from Garbage.
- Will you go help Jake with his pyjamas?

33
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,042
- If she's late...
- Lisa, I swear to God,...

34
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:51,088
...start with the Dionne Warwick stuff,
I'll throw you out the fuckin' window.

35
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:55,050
- So please help him with the pyjamas.
- Love you, too, Tom!

36
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,971
Hey, this is great. I mean it.

37
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,641
It's about time we had another kid.
I was gonna bring it up myself.

38
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,810
- Really?
- Absolutely!

39
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:08,731
- This time, you gotta take some time off.
- Please! We can't afford that!

40
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:13,360
- We can. I'm gonna hit the overtime again.
- I don't want you to work those hours again.

41
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:17,198
You come home in a trance.
You're completely useless to me.

42
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,575
I'm gonna be fine, OK?

43
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:23,621
I'm just gonna tell Teddy
to get somebody else for the thing.

44
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,624
- Oh, God! Oh, Tom!
- What?

45
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,960
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
No wonder you're pissed off.

46
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:34,423
I'm not pissed off. I just...
No, I'm... I'm not. I'm not.

47
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:39,512
I'm a grown man. I shouldn't be screwing
around with some shitty band anyway.

48
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:44,016
Hey, look, I-I... I gotta go change.
You know, put on something cool.

49
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,731
I love you.

50
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,734
I'm... I'm a happy guy.

51
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,076
You know, I'm not gonna be a lineman
forever, I promise you that.

52
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,621
Whaddaya mean?

53
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,833
I clip... clip wire all day.
A monkey could do it.

54
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,419
Yeah, but they're gonna
move you into the office soon.

55
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:18,050
No, I meant, when we first got together, I said
a lotta stuff about what I was gonna be,...

56
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:23,430
...and I just wanted you to know that, uh...
I wasn't giving you some kinda line,...

57
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,183
...that I meant it.

58
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:32,314
I didn't marry you because I thought
you were gonna be famous.

59
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,694
I just liked the way your ass looked in jeans.

60
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:43,409
I never wanted to be famous. I just, uh...
I didn't expect to be... so...

61
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,369
What?

62
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,705
I don't know.

63
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,999
Ordinary.

64
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,199
Shhh.

65
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,832
Hang on! Hang on!

66
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,552
You know, I hope it's a girl.

67
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:48,140
I'm kinda sick of all these balls
around the house. Except for yours, babe.

68
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:51,769
What are the odds on an educated single man
being at this thing?

69
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,938
And I don't mean a GED!

70
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,651
- Does it matter if he's on the boner pill?
- I wouldn't look a gift-boner in the mouth.

71
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,362
Nice - that's very nice, Lisa!

72
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:06,909
- Hey! How you been?
- Hey, Tom, Tom, Tommy! How ya doin'?

73
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,036
Oh, you would not believe the day I had.

74
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,330
- Take this. I'll get another.
- Thanks.

75
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,375
- Harry.
- Tom. Taking care of the place for me?

76
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:18,087
We're drilling holes all over your floors!
I hope you don't mind.

77
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,881
Tom, you know my squaw Sheila.
Bobby, Vanessa.

78
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:25,386
- Thanks for having me.
- Drink up! Take your medicine.

79
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,555
Tom, how do you like the neighbourhood?

80
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:31,350
I grew up in Bridgeport,
so it's not like it's a foreign country.

81
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,271
You're goddamn right.
This is the best neighbourhood in Chicago.

82
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:40,568
We all look out for each other. That's
saying a lot as we approach the year 2000.

83
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,779
- Are you running for mayor?
- Hey, did any of you guys...

84
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:47,199
- ...see them crank dealers...
- What is Lenny doing here?

85
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,451
Bobby, did you tell him you had a party?

86
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:55,124
- Vanessa made me. We invited everybody.
- To actually invite this jack- off...!

87
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,293
Oh, yeah, laugh it up!

88
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:01,046
When you wake up dead with your throat cut,
don't come crying to me!

89
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,925
Not attracted to.

90
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,345
Not drunk enough for.

91
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,222
Frightened by!

92
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,196
Argh!

93
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:28,449
Don't touch me. I'm fine.

94
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:53,516
Haven't you heard about people being
operated on when they're under hypnosis?

95
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,684
Yeah, but I don't believe in any of that.

96
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:59,438
People who say they were hypnotised
were just playing along.

97
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,856
- Certo.
- Really?

98
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,195
Then how could they have a scalpel stuck
into their throat without even bleeding?

99
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,489
- Bullshit!
- You never saw that happen!

100
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,950
- That's bullshit!
- Learn another word!

101
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,285
Yeah, what about "narrow-minded"?

102
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:18,249
I saw a guy in my class get a two-inch needle
stuck into his arm by my instructor...

103
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,919
- ...when he was under hypnosis.
- Horseshit! That better, honey?

104
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,630
I saw a picture of it the next day.
It left a mark.

105
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,425
What I don't understand is
how a person that's been to college...

106
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,845
...can believe all that superstitious crap.

107
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,222
- It isn't superstitious!
- Come on!

108
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,725
- I'm practically a licensed hypnotherapist.
- "Practically"?

109
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,271
Isn't that like saying
"I don't have a licence"? Ow! My arm!

110
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:45,776
This may come as a surprise to you, but just
because you lived here for your whole life...

111
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,572
...doesn't mean that there isn't
a whole larger world out there,...

112
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:54,535
...doorways you haven't even opened, things
you wouldn't have any understanding of.

113
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,831
Doorways... OK, OK. All right, Kreskin,
prove it - hypnotise somebody.

114
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,292
- Yeah! Do me.
- No.

115
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,461
- Why not?
- For one, you're hostile.

116
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,046
I'm not hostile!
Do I seem hostile to anybody?

117
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,050
- Uh... yeah.
- Thanks for having us. It was a great party.

118
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:14,972
Nah, nah, this is just getting good.
Come on, Lisa. Hypnotise me. Come on!

119
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,349
- No. You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk!

120
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:21,020
You're not supposed to mesmerise
somebody who's been drinking!

121
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,315
Mesmerise! No! Stop!

122
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,151
Oh, please! I'm begging you.
Educate the savages.

123
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,237
It won't work with
that kind of uncooperative attitude.

124
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,657
I swear to you, I'll follow
every instruction to the letter.

125
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,826
It still won't work.

126
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,578
Come on.

127
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,581
What's the worst that can happen?

128
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,419
- Somebody turn out the lights.
- Oh, yeah!

129
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,963
Whoo!

130
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:54,345
All right, just relax. Put your arm down.
Just rest it comfortably. Just lean back.

131
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,056
Just be very comfortable and relaxed.

132
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,267
Trust me. OK?

133
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:05,189
- Close your eyes.
- Certainly, Lisa.

134
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,403
Now... just listen for a moment.

135
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,949
Listen to the sounds of the room around you.

136
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:19,245
I don't know why, but I'm scared.

137
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:23,916
Now I want you to pretend
you're in a theatre.

138
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,710
A movie theatre,

139
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:31,590
You're the only one there.

140
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,928
It's one of those great old movie palaces.

141
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:41,517
When you look around,
it's a huge, empty theatre.

142
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,773
You notice that the walls of the theatre
are painted in black.

143
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:54,155
The seats... are covered in black.

144
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,324
And in the whole pitch-black theatre,...

145
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:02,621
...there's only one thing you can see,
and that's the white screen.

146
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:07,793
You'll notice there are letters on the screen...
tall, thick, black letters.

147
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:13,466
But they're out of focus, so you drift closer
to them in your chair, trying to read them.

148
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:17,803
You're very comfortable now.
It's your favourite chair.

149
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,057
You're drifting closer and closer,
staring at the letters.

150
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,394
Very relaxed now. Your legs are relaxed.

151
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,813
Your arms are limp and heavy.

152
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,983
You're almost close enough
to read the letters now.

153
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,444
They start to come into focus.

154
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,238
The letters spell "sleep".

155
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,992
Sleep.

156
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,082
No!

157
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,835
- What the hell was that?

158
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:57,635
- What? What? What?
- Are you OK? You had to be faking it.

159
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,721
That was the weirdest goddamn thing
I've seen in my life!

160
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:04,892
Congratulations, Tom!
You're one of the lucky eight percent!

161
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:08,771
- You still have tears on your cheeks.
- What the hell did she do to me?

162
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:12,107
- Christ, I'm thirsty.
- Whaddaya mean? What eight percent?

163
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:17,029
There's only eight percent of the population
that's, like, highly hypnotisable.

164
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,365
Almost anybody can go under a little,...

165
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:23,536
...but not way under -
not freaky under, like he did.

166
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:26,705
- How's your hand?
- Whaddaya mean?

167
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:32,044
I stuck a safety pin in your hand and asked
you to bleed on one side, but not the other.

168
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:35,589
- Which I can't believe you did!
- You were very cooperative.

169
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,883
It was a side of you I hadn't seen before.

170
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,094
- That happened?
- You said it didn't hurt.

171
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:43,681
To hell with the pin!
I wanna know more about your Joey Luca.

172
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,933
Yeah, right!

173
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,310
- Who?
- Joey Luca is the kid who...

174
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,272
...used to pound the shit out of you
when you were 12.

175
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,400
You told us all about it. You were crying.
It was hysterical!

176
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,612
- Shut up.
- It was very moving, Tom.

177
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:01,574
Joey Luca! Jesus Christ,
I haven't thought about him...

178
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,413
Hey.

179
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,458
Can we go home? I... I feel kinda strange.

180
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,919
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

181
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,701
Close your eyes.

182
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,884
Uh!

183
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,679
What's the matter?

184
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,222
Don't stop.

185
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:33,809
- Don't stop.
- OK.

186
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:55,414
Ugh! Jesus Christ! Oh, my God!

187
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:58,584
- What?
- I-I... I'm seeing things.

188
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,753
What do you mean?

189
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:04,340
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
I-I can't right now.

190
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:08,344
- Then you were faking it extremely well.
- Ohh...

191
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,264
Wait. Stop, stop, stop! It's too weird.

192
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:16,644
Baby, that wasn't weird.
I could show you weird.

193
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,857
I felt like I was being attacked.

194
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,110
Thanks!

195
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:28,948
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't...

196
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,659
I-I... I'll be right back.

197
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:54,807
What the fuck...?!

198
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,645
Ah... Agh... Agh!

199
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:03,816
Arghhh...

200
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,610
Argh!

201
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:19,266
Agh! Agh!

202
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:58,097
- Hey, Jake.
- You're awake now, Daddy.

203
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,268
Are you OK?

204
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,854
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

205
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:08,816
I just don't feel so good right now.

206
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,164
Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.

207
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:38,637
- What was it, then? An hallucination?
- Yeah, a bunch of 'em.

208
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:43,893
It's like all these thoughts just kept coming.
You believe this? I got seven calls.

209
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:47,271
Well, if it never happened before,
it had to be the hypnosis.

210
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,232
I had this headache and I was thirsty as hell.

211
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:54,111
Jake! I know you're not watching
that monster tape again!

212
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,280
Who was the woman?

213
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:01,660
I don't know. Maybe somebody I was just
remembering. She didn't look familiar.

214
00:20:01,744 --> 00:20:04,371
- Did you fuck her?
- You gotta be kidding.

215
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:07,500
No. I mean, was she someone
you used to go out with?

216
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,961
You're jealous of my hallucination?
Hmm, you are pregnant!

217
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:15,174
- You should call Lisa.
- No, she's the one that fucked up my brain.

218
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:18,344
- Then she has to unfuck it.
- Ooh! Agh! Fuck! Fuck!

219
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,513
Don't swear so much!

220
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:24,099
Hang on, hang on!
Let me get my bearings here.

221
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:29,313
I have... I have absolutely no caffeine
in my system, you know.

222
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,817
OK. You're asking me if I gave you a post...

223
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,944
...posthypnotic suggestion.

224
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:39,031
Did you leave anything else behind
when you were inside my brain?

225
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,492
- Nothing!
- Tell the truth, Lisa.

226
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:45,579
Tom! Please, this is insulting.
You know, I have done this before.

227
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,291
OK, good. I-I was... I was just making sure.

228
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,544
It was just a harmless one anyway.

229
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,755
- What?
- Did it actually work?

230
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,842
- What did you say?
- I don't wanna tell you. You're grouchy.

231
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,177
Lisa, I swear to God...!

232
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:04,974
Well, you know I've always said I think
you need to be a little more open-minded?

233
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:07,852
- Yeah...
- So I just said that.

234
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:12,022
"After you wake up, your mind will be
completely open, like an open door,...

235
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:14,775
...open to receive everything around you."

236
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:18,863
- What's that supposed to do?
- Fuck if I know! I never said it before.

237
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,824
- Why? Did something happen?
- Jesus Christ!

238
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:26,203
Relax. OK? I opened a door, that's all.
You know, therapists do it all the time.

239
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:30,624
It releases repressed memories,
whatever you got back there.

240
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:35,921
- For you, it was probably old Mannixreruns.
- I gotta get back to work.

241
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,968
OK. Alrighty, then!

242
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,765
No! No more calls for Lisa!

243
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,686
Hey, Lise, it's me.

244
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,982
Call me when you wake up. Is there any way
you could baby-sit for us on Friday?

245
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,902
I did! I told him!

246
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,281
What's your name?

247
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,074
OK.

248
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:06,410
...but then I gotta hear about it for a month.

249
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:09,663
I called everyone who could possibly do it
and no one's free.

250
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:12,583
- Call Vanessa.
- Huh?

251
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,669
I said, call Vanessa and ask her about Debbie.

252
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:18,589
Anyway, call me back. Bye.

253
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,509
Debbie? That's the girl
who baby- sits for them?

254
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:22,718
Yep.

255
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:26,138
Oh, great idea. Pray she's free.

256
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:29,308
- How'd you know about Debbie?
- Samantha told me.

257
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:33,354
Hey, Vanessa.
Are you guys going out Friday night?

258
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,609
Hi. I'm Debbie.

259
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:43,364
Kozak...?

260
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:48,494
Tom Witzky.

261
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:53,874
- Hi, Debbie. I'm Maggie.
- Hi.

262
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:57,837
Thanks for coming. Jake's asleep already
and he hardly ever wakes up.

263
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,841
A band could play in his room
and he wouldn't hear it!

264
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:06,637
His room's upstairs, kitchen's back there.
Just help yourself if you want anything.

265
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,348
Here, have a seat.
This is the baby monitor.

266
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:13,185
It's on B in his room,
so you should hear everything.

267
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:15,396
- You wanna watch a movie?
- I got a book.

268
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,315
It shouldn't be later than midnight,
if that's OK.

269
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:21,485
- Perfect.
- Great. I'll just grab my coat.

270
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,946
Hel-lo!

271
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,073
Ready?

272
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:27,950
- Yeah. Just about.
- OK.

273
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:31,787
Hey. Uh... where'd you find that girl Debbie?

274
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:36,792
Vanessa gave me her number.
Everybody uses her. It's cool.

275
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:40,838
- Another headache?
- Too much caffeine.

276
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:44,175
Oh. OK, let's go.

277
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:47,219
Bye.

278
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:56,353
I think that Damon kid
is doing a great job and everything,...

279
00:23:56,437 --> 00:24:00,399
...and yeah, the kid's got a decent arm,
but high-school football is about...

280
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:05,070
...power, it's about running the goddamn
football - it always has been.

281
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,490
What did you play in high school?

282
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:11,452
- Piano, mostly.
- Oh, Jesus! Sorry. Here, you want some?

283
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:16,040
Anyway, Adam...
and I admit that I am biased,...

284
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:19,960
...but my kid is having a helluva season
and it's like nobody even notices.

285
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:22,713
If they gave him the ball,
he could break a thousand yards!

286
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:25,508
And that's in an eight-game season.
Jesus Christ!

287
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:28,803
Why don't you just lick 'em
when they walk by?

288
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:40,439
Frank says the average guy carries around
a hard- on two hours out of every day.

289
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:45,236
- Three for him.
- See, now I got a picture of that!

290
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,740
One of these days, she's gonna find
one of my .38s and pop a cap in my ass!

291
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:54,161
He'll stick it in a bowl of soup
if it's still warm.

292
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:05,965
Go! Go!

293
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:23,065
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

294
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:30,823
Over a thousand yards,
we're talking college scholarship!

295
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:34,618
Hey, come on...
The kid can write his own ticket.

296
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:39,039
And that's good for everybody. It's good
for the whole goddamn neighbourhood.

297
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:41,917
He's gonna go a helluva lot further
than lever did.

298
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:47,006
Look at the quality of tail he gets. He passed
me in that department when he was 14.

299
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:50,134
Come on! While we're young, huh?

300
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:20,706
You scared me!

301
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,002
She's downstairs, I think.

302
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:32,176
I don't know.
I haven't seen her yet.

303
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,394
Jake?

304
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,400
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong.

305
00:26:48,484 --> 00:26:49,735
What?

306
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:01,122
I have a secret to tell you.

307
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,084
Promise, promise, promise?

308
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:17,555
Samantha says it's always dark where she is.

309
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:21,225
Who did you say?

310
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,144
Samantha.

311
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:30,025
You... you talked to Samantha?

312
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:31,610
Yeah!

313
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:33,529
When?

314
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:35,698
All the time.

315
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:41,036
- Where?
- Here. In my house.

316
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,830
That's not true.

317
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:45,958
Go.

318
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,084
Go!

319
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,548
- It isn't true.
- I don't tell lies!

320
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,884
Samantha was here? Here, in your house?

321
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,386
- You're hurting my arm!
- Was she here?!

322
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,056
- Let go of me!
- Come on, you're coming with me. Let's go.

323
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:04,518
She's taking him away.

324
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:16,781
Put me down! Put... me... down!

325
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:23,037
Tom!

326
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,674
Jake!

327
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,219
Jake!

328
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:41,806
Jake!

329
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,808
- What the hell...?
- She took him.

330
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,601
- What?!
- The fucking baby-sitter.

331
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,311
Oh, my God!

332
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:49,897
He's... He's not in there.

333
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,609
- Where are you going?
- I don't know!

334
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:28,561
He's in there.

335
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:54,336
- Jake!
- Daddy!

336
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,506
- That's him!
- Wait! Where do you think you're going?!

337
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,593
Take it easy! Stop! Stop!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

338
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:03,679
- Gimme my kid.
- Tell me where she is! No!

339
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:06,474
You tell me where she is!
You tell me where she is!

340
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:09,768
- Keep your hands off her!
- Hey! Hey, hey! Everybody shut up!

341
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:13,355
- Are you OK?
- That girl kidnapped our son.

342
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,733
- Is that your child?
- Ask about Samantha.

343
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:19,028
I'm asking about the boy,
who doesn't look like he's yours!

344
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,196
I can explain this.

345
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,615
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her.

346
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:24,784
- Is that boy your child?
- No.

347
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,369
She was baby-sitting for us. We never...

348
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:30,664
What you've done is a felony.
You can go to jail for this!

349
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:33,834
- Where were you taking him?
- I wasn't taking him anywhere!

350
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:36,962
- Then why did ya bring him here?
- I wanna press charges.

351
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:39,632
She came here because of me.
I'm her mother.

352
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:43,928
- Her mother?
- When are you gonna ask about Samantha?

353
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,806
- Who?
- My oldest daughter. She ran away.

354
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:50,267
No, she was kidnapped,
and the little boy said he saw her!

355
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:53,938
We haven't heard from her in a long time.
We filed a police report.

356
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,441
- Nobody returns our phone calls.
- Jake said he talked to her.

357
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:00,611
He said Samantha is in their house.
Is that her?!

358
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:03,531
- Stay away from him.
- Look at the picture.

359
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,491
- Let go of me!
- Look at the picture.

360
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:09,745
- This is ridiculous.
- Will you look at the picture, please?

361
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:17,628
- I have never seen her before in my life.
- What about you?

362
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:22,007
No. I'm sorry. I've never seen her.

363
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:25,928
- No... No. No, they're lying!
- You wanna file charges?

364
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,346
- Yes!
- No.

365
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:31,517
- What?
- Come on, let's just, uh... forget about it.

366
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:34,019
Let's go home.

367
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:37,231
Are you nuts? What about
the next people she baby-sits for?

368
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:39,567
It was her. Samantha.

369
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,405
That girl in the picture,
she's the same girl I saw on our couch.

370
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:48,993
See, why... Why did you ask that girl Debbie
to baby-sit for us? Why her?

371
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:53,622
I couldn't find anybody else.
I was on the phone and Jake said...

372
00:31:56,834 --> 00:32:02,006
Jake? Do you remember the other day
when we were talking in the kitchen?

373
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:09,180
I was looking for a baby-sitter, remember?
You said Samantha told you about Debbie.

374
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:11,432
Do you remember that?

375
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:16,103
Mommy's asking you a question, bud.

376
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:21,233
Is Samantha someone
who talks to you sometimes, Jake?

377
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:28,365
- Can you remember...
- Don't ask the boy any more questions.

378
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,576
Talk to me.

379
00:32:32,787 --> 00:32:35,915
- What did you say?
- Huh?

380
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,752
Jake. W-what did you say just now?

381
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:43,255
- Nothing.
- Let me hear that voice again.

382
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:46,759
- Come on. Say it again. Use that voice again.
- Tom!

383
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:49,595
Come... Come on, Jake. Come on.
Use the voice again.

384
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:52,640
- Tom!
- Make the voice again, Jake. You can do it.

385
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:54,517
- Tom, don't!
- How do you...

386
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,144
- Tom, please!
- It's all right! It's all right!

387
00:32:57,228 --> 00:33:00,231
- OK!
- What are you doing? Hey! Hey!

388
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:02,525
I'm talking to him!

389
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:06,695
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- What do you think?

390
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:10,491
Well, I... I'm just trying
to have a conversation with my kid.

391
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:13,702
A perfectly normal conversation
for a five-year-old!

392
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:15,913
- Don't be afraid of it.
- Why the hell not?

393
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:19,208
I don't know. That's what he told me.

394
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,836
This is where it happened.
This is where I saw her.

395
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,465
- You're different. You feel different.
- I leaned back and there she was. She's 18.

396
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:29,343
- Longish hair. Is that what you saw?
- I wish you...

397
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,971
- Maggie, please!
- God!

398
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:36,559
Or... or maybe you don't see her, huh?
You just hear her? Is that what it is?

399
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:39,895
- Tom, stop it!
- I need to find a way to make her come back.

400
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:43,440
- Maybe if I hang out here long enough,...
- I'm talking to you!

401
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:47,278
...maybe she'll come back. Maybe
you could talk to her. Help me out here.

402
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:51,907
- Hey, come on! Hey! What's the problem?
- Knock it off!

403
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:58,747
I don't wanna talk about this
because it scares Mommy.

404
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:53,719
- Turn it up, man.
- What?

405
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:56,096
Turn it up. Up!

406
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:22,039
Tom is looking especially together today.

407
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:25,334
He grunted a very pleasant greeting
at me, actually.

408
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:29,630
He's becoming sort of monosyllabic.
Nothing wrong with that guy.

409
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:32,842
Nothing a little lithium couldn't cure!

410
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:39,598
- I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.
- No...

411
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,310
Are you OK?

412
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:46,021
Over there! In the door!

413
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:49,775
If you live on the base,
your room and board's covered.

414
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:54,989
- You still gotta get up early.
- I'll retire, make a coupla down payments.

415
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,992
When I take off the uniform,
I'm a landlord already.

416
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:00,828
Five years later, I got three houses.

417
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:03,205
- Hey. Hey, Har.
- How're ya doin'?

418
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:06,500
Whaddaya know
about that girl Samantha Kozak?

419
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:09,545
Samantha Kozak. Why do I know that name?

420
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:13,757
Brownish hair, 16 or 17 years old.
Used to live around here.

421
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:16,552
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember her, I think.
- Let's go.

422
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:19,638
Hey, Kurt! Come here for a second.

423
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:22,224
Like he ever tells me anything, right?

424
00:36:22,308 --> 00:36:25,019
Get over here!

425
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:28,522
Say, you know that Kozak girl?

426
00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:31,609
- Uh... Debbie.
- No, no, no, the other one. Samantha.

427
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:35,362
Oh, you mean the retard.
Yeah, she ran away.

428
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:38,407
Yeah, that's right. I remember that.
So, what about her?

429
00:36:38,741 --> 00:36:42,244
Oh, I... I just been thinking about her a lot.

430
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:45,998
Why?

431
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,585
Her sister baby-sat for us.

432
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,090
Oh.

433
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:58,302
This is the first time
he's been out in a week.

434
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:01,096
He hasn't gone to work.
He sleeps 12 hours a night.

435
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,644
He's used up all his sick days. If he doesn't
show up on Monday, they'll dock him. I...

436
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,940
I can't get him more than six feet
from the couch.

437
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:14,819
- Why?
- That's where she appeared to him.

438
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,071
Ah.

439
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:19,573
I'm not shocked that there's another woman.

440
00:37:19,657 --> 00:37:23,452
Of course, the fact that she's dead
gives one pause.

441
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,623
We are talking about a ghost here,
aren't we, Maggie?

442
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:31,836
She took off, uh... last March.
With a black guy, I think.

443
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:34,922
Hey, Harry. Did she ever live in our house?

444
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:39,301
No, no, no. I just... I just bought that one.
You're the first tenants.

445
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,848
Tom and Jake, it's like they have
this private club or something.

446
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:48,602
They sit in the living room and whisper,
and, as soon as I walk in, they both shut up.

447
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:53,607
You know what you need to do? Find a
young priest with smouldering good looks...

448
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:56,152
...who can guide you through this.

449
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,571
I'm kidding, but I'm not.

450
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:03,868
Look, I give Tom a lotta shit, but the truth is,
you guys are the best couple on earth.

451
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:08,247
This is on you now, Maggie. Get some help.
Find out why this is happening.

452
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,541
There is a reason.

453
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:15,296
You won't be the first woman who's
had to hold an insane family together.

454
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,840
Tom's not crazy.

455
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:22,011
Oh, yes he is. But at least
he's getting interesting.

456
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:24,180
Sports flash! Sports flash!

457
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,515
211 yards rushing on Friday night.

458
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,102
That's a total of 894 yards,
with two games to go.

459
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:32,813
The kid needs 106 yards. That's 53 a game.

460
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:36,400
He could walk through the next two games
and still break a thousand!

461
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:39,487
- Frank, what about you? Do you know her?
- Who?

462
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,740
Tom was asking about that Kozak girl
from over by Baldwin.

463
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:46,368
- You remember: the one who ran away?
- The retard.

464
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:48,704
Shut up, Lenny. Don't use that word.

465
00:38:48,788 --> 00:38:51,373
- He's just kinda slow.
- What? Retard?!

466
00:38:51,457 --> 00:38:53,918
Goddammit, Lenny,
shut your fuckin' pie hole!

467
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,253
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Heads up!

468
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,968
- What are you doing?!
- Hey, hey, hey!

469
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:09,391
Somebody's always gotta ruin it.
They can't ever just be nice.

470
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,452
Frank. What are you doing here?

471
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:14,707
They're gonna kill you, Tommy.

472
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,378
You and Maggie both.

473
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:37,021
Why would you
say something like that, Frank?

474
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:40,024
This is a decent neighbourhood.

475
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,988
Hey, are you OK?

476
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:49,033
Where's Sheila? Is she at home?

477
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:55,456
Listen, I'm gonna go see if Sheila's at home.

478
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,416
OK?

479
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:03,798
In the house! Come on, both of you!

480
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:22,066
Come in!

481
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,611
Hi. Is your mom at home cos your dad's...

482
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,739
Hey... you wanna see what I've got?

483
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:33,702
Sure.

484
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:38,207
That's great. Is that one of your dad's?

485
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:41,252
Not today. Come here.

486
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:44,088
Oh, why don't you just
put the gun away, Adam?

487
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:48,008
- Come on, man. Come here.
- Those things make me kinda nervous.

488
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:52,221
- Then this will make you really nervous.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't do that!

489
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:53,556
Don't!

490
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:55,599
Argh!

491
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:21,584
Please don't be under there.

492
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,173
Oh, boy.

493
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:55,242
Frank?

494
00:42:55,326 --> 00:42:58,078
In the house! Come on, both of you!

495
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:29,819
Adam!

496
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:32,196
Adam! Open the door!

497
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:35,449
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

498
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,549
Help!

499
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,928
Help!

500
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:58,556
Am I awake... or asleep?

501
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,724
Help!

502
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,442
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, my baby!

503
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:12,403
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Let me... Let me go!

504
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:17,450
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Is he alive? Is he alive?

505
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:22,079
Oh, my God, Adam!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

506
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:27,960
Adam! Adam!

507
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:36,385
I'm gonna take him for a walk or something.

508
00:44:37,428 --> 00:44:41,015
- Come on, sweetie pie. Let's get your jacket.
- Where are we going?

509
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:51,859
Ha-ha!

510
00:44:57,323 --> 00:45:01,660
- Well! Hello, there!
- Well, hello... there.

511
00:45:04,497 --> 00:45:06,582
Listen! Music!

512
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:08,834
It's beautiful!

513
00:45:11,754 --> 00:45:13,923
Hey! Jake, wait up!

514
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:05,474
I don't think we're supposed to be here,
sweetie. Come on, let's go. This way.

515
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:16,110
Whoa! This place is cool!

516
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:40,342
Come on, honey. Let's go get some lunch.

517
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:50,978
Mom! What's this thing?

518
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:54,899
- I don't know. Let me take a look.
- It looks like some kinda stone.

519
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:58,110
- Either that, or it's a medal.
- Yeah, I think it is.

520
00:46:58,194 --> 00:47:01,322
- "Served in the..."
- Look. A flag.

521
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:07,745
- Everything OK?
- It's fine. Just fine.

522
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:12,041
- We're not supposed to be here?
- Hm?

523
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:16,003
- Oh, no. It's fine. Really.
- Oh.

524
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,715
OK. See you later.

525
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:22,343
The boy's got the eyes on him, doesn't he?

526
00:47:25,054 --> 00:47:27,264
X-ray.

527
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:33,687
Not you, though.

528
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:36,649
Possibly Daddy?

529
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,027
They're not the only ones.

530
00:47:40,111 --> 00:47:44,281
Tell Daddy to come by and see me
a little later tonight.

531
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:47,618
He might learn a few things.

532
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:57,628
Bye, Jake.

533
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:02,716
Bye, Neil.

534
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,183
His name is Neil.

535
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:45,885
Try that, Daddy.

536
00:48:52,308 --> 00:48:54,393
Why do I know that song?

537
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:56,687
I'll be home right after the movie.

538
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:59,398
I know it. I know it!

539
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:01,859
I said, I won't be late.

540
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:09,033
OK.

541
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:11,744
Bye, Mom. Bye, Maggie.

542
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:54,703
Oh, hello.

543
00:49:54,787 --> 00:49:57,957
I don't know if I'm in the right place.
I'm looking for Neil.

544
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,334
Excuse me? I...

545
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:02,628
I'm sorry...

546
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:20,771
Shit!

547
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:23,983
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

548
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:42,960
I wanna see Neil.

549
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:48,174
Wait here.

550
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,844
I don't know her.

551
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:58,434
What are you doing?
I said the boy's father. I said tell him to come.

552
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:03,522
He'd never do it. He'd kill me if he knew I was
talking to you about this. He's so paranoid.

553
00:51:03,606 --> 00:51:06,859
What's the story, man?
Close the fucking door!

554
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:10,821
- So are they. I can't let you in.
- Who are they?

555
00:51:10,905 --> 00:51:14,492
Look, man, this ain't no freak show in here!
Close the damn door!

556
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:16,994
Look, you just gotta get outta here.

557
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:19,330
My husband is losing his mind.

558
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,749
I don't know why, but I think you do.

559
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:26,587
You can tell me what you know, but you can't
tell me to go away because I'm not moving.

560
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:35,638
- How long has he had it?
- Just a few days.

561
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:38,682
- What happened? A car wreck?
- No.

562
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:40,976
- A child die?
- No!

563
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,854
- Did he kill someone?
- He was hypnotised.

564
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:47,483
- Is that what started it?
- It comes and it goes.

565
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:52,196
Some people have it for five seconds.
Some, their whole lives.

566
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,990
He's a receiver now. Everything's coming in.

567
00:51:55,074 --> 00:51:59,620
He can't stop it. He can't slow it down.
He can't even figure it out.

568
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:04,625
It's like he's in a tunnel with a flashlight,
but the light only comes on once in a while.

569
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:08,129
He gets a glimpse of something,
but not enough to know what it is.

570
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:10,297
Just enough to know it's there.

571
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:12,925
- Jake, too.
- Your son?

572
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:15,219
Much better flashlight.

573
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:20,391
- Does he know what it wants yet?
- What who wants?

574
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:24,270
He saw a ghost, didn't he?
What did it ask him to do?

575
00:52:24,353 --> 00:52:27,982
- She didn't ask anything.
- Maybe he wasn't listening.

576
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:31,318
She's asked for something,
and now she's waiting,...

577
00:52:31,402 --> 00:52:35,322
...getting more and more pissed off
that he's not doing it.

578
00:52:35,406 --> 00:52:38,951
If he doesn't do her thing,
she'll never go away.

579
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:45,708
Agh!

580
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:48,836
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

581
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:51,172
Agh!

582
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:07,188
Agh!

583
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:18,949
Hey!

584
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:22,745
- Absolutely not!
- Oh, please, please, please!

585
00:53:22,828 --> 00:53:28,667
- Five more minutes. Five more minutes.
- No, zero minutes. Oh, this is cool.

586
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:32,129
- "The Mummy" gives you nightmares.
- No fair!

587
00:53:32,213 --> 00:53:35,466
I know. I'm gonna take a bath.
Are you OK for ten minutes?

588
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,968
Whatever!

589
00:53:58,364 --> 00:54:00,449
How do I know this song?

590
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:04,662
I know I know this song. I know it. I know it.

591
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:20,803
Agh! Freezing!

592
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:24,223
Round up your weapons, folks!

593
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:27,893
Charge!

594
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:37,945
I don't wanna talk right now.

595
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:41,157
Hey!

596
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:48,122
~ Rabbit, rabbit,
rabbit, rabbit, rabbit

597
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:50,583
~ Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit

598
00:54:53,627 --> 00:54:55,713
No, no...

599
00:55:03,721 --> 00:55:08,559
Tom? I think the pilot blew out
on the water heater again.

600
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:11,312
Can you go light it for me?

601
00:55:12,563 --> 00:55:14,857
Hello?!

602
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:19,195
Or I could go light it.

603
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:49,975
Thanks, Colonel.

604
00:55:52,394 --> 00:55:55,106
I said no!

605
00:56:10,538 --> 00:56:12,623
Ah, bummer!

606
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,963
Agh!

607
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:21,966
Hey! That is the most amazing...

608
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:04,884
Oh!

609
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:26,489
Agh!

610
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:27,615
Ow!

611
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,495
Arghh!

612
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:21,752
Tom?

613
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:24,713
Tom! Breathe!

614
00:58:24,797 --> 00:58:25,840
Ohhh!

615
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:28,968
- Ugh!
- What happened?

616
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:30,553
- She's there.
- What?

617
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:32,721
She's there.

618
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,146
What?

619
00:58:40,563 --> 00:58:43,357
Oh, my God!

620
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:59,206
I... I want you to hypnotise me again.
All this shit - I want it out, I want it gone.

621
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:03,627
- I want it all to stop. Right now!
- Come right in. I want you to meet Clarita.

622
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:05,546
Oh. Hi. Sorry.

623
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,882
Sorry, I...

624
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:10,551
Look, do you think that you could...?

625
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,053
- Could she...?
- Yeah...

626
00:59:13,137 --> 00:59:19,393
Clarita, perdóname. Mi cuñado está
un poco loco. ¿Nos dejas solas, por favor?

627
00:59:19,477 --> 00:59:22,271
- ¿Ahora?
- Sí. Sí.

628
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:26,817
¡Fantástico! En medio de la noche
me tengo que parar en medio de la calle...

629
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:30,905
- ...en este barrio de mierda a buscar un taxi.
- I know. I...

630
00:59:31,906 --> 00:59:34,158
- Well, gracias.
- De nada.

631
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:38,829
OK, you gotta, uh... slow down. OK?

632
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:43,209
You gotta be a little patient with me here
cos I got a confession to make.

633
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:47,838
Y'see, we... we just smoked this great big
fatty a few minutes before you walked in,...

634
00:59:47,922 --> 00:59:52,384
- ...so this is blowing my mind a bit extra.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

635
00:59:52,468 --> 00:59:58,390
- Yeah?
- Whatever... door you opened in my brain,...

636
00:59:58,474 --> 01:00:00,643
...I want you to shut it.

637
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:02,686
- Now!
- OK.

638
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,980
I'll do it. OK. I can do that.

639
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,025
Close your eyes.

640
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:13,864
OK. Just like last time,
I want you to just focus and concentrate.

641
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:21,122
Listen to the sounds of the room,
listen to the sounds of your breathing.

642
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:25,000
Look at the back of your eyelids.
Do you see anything there?

643
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:28,629
- Could you just get to it, please?
- All right. All right.

644
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:32,800
I want you to pretend
you're back in the movie theatre.

645
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:35,010
It's very dark,...

646
01:00:35,094 --> 01:00:39,723
...and in the whole pitch-black theatre, the
only thing you can see is the white screen.

647
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:44,311
As you focus on the screen,
you begin to drift closer to it in your chair.

648
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:48,941
You'll notice that there are letters
on the screen - tall, thick, black letters.

649
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:52,319
But they're out of focus,
so you begin to drift closer to them.

650
01:00:52,403 --> 01:00:55,990
- Someone's here.
- No, it's empty.

651
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:58,826
But there's someone else in here.

652
01:00:58,909 --> 01:01:02,413
- No, you're alone in the theatre, Tom.
- No. No, I'm not.

653
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:07,209
- Your feet and your ankles are relaxed.
- No. Hard to breathe.

654
01:01:07,293 --> 01:01:11,630
Your hands are limp and heavy.
Your... your arms...

655
01:01:11,714 --> 01:01:15,134
- No air! No air!
- Tom, I want you to look at the screen.

656
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:16,886
Look at the screen.

657
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,804
Hey.

658
01:01:20,473 --> 01:01:23,851
You can read the letters now.
You're right up next to them.

659
01:01:24,477 --> 01:01:26,812
Tom! Look at the screen!

660
01:01:28,314 --> 01:01:30,399
No!

661
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:35,488
Wow! What... what happened? Are you OK?

662
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:39,074
You need to sit down. What was happening
there was very next level.

663
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:42,203
You should have seen your face.
D'you want a beer?

664
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:44,830
Are you feeling better? What happened?

665
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:48,793
I'm supposed to dig.

666
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:02,139
Hi!

667
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:10,064
Hello?!

668
01:02:13,067 --> 01:02:15,611
Anybody home?

669
01:02:18,489 --> 01:02:21,617
Wow! Look what I'm not cleaning up.

670
01:02:34,797 --> 01:02:36,882
Interesting!

671
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:56,944
OK!

672
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:07,955
Hi, honey. What you doin'?

673
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:11,167
Dad said I'm supposed to dig.

674
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,335
Oh.

675
01:03:16,589 --> 01:03:19,091
Nice!

676
01:03:21,427 --> 01:03:23,512
Tom.

677
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:27,850
- Tom!
- Oh!

678
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:31,270
- You scared me.
- I scared you?

679
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:36,192
- What are you doing?
- I'm supposed to dig.

680
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:38,986
- Whaddaya mean?
- I'm supposed to dig.

681
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:41,155
Who says?

682
01:03:44,116 --> 01:03:47,036
I see. And what's Jake doing?

683
01:03:49,997 --> 01:03:52,750
Jake... is helping.

684
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:59,131
- Why are you doing this?
- The water softens up the dirt.

685
01:03:59,215 --> 01:04:02,134
No. I mean...

686
01:04:02,218 --> 01:04:05,221
Could you just stop for a second?

687
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:11,060
- Tom! Can you turn around and look at me?
- What... exactly don't you understand?

688
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:13,312
I'm supposed to dig.

689
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:16,732
- Why are you digging?
- I'm searching.

690
01:04:16,816 --> 01:04:19,902
- What are you searching for?
- The question is not what.

691
01:04:19,985 --> 01:04:23,489
We both know very well what,
even though we don't wanna admit it.

692
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:30,329
The question, Maggie, which you can
plainly see I am very busy trying to answer...

693
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:33,124
The question is where.

694
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:37,002
Don't worry, he's OK.

695
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:41,382
- It's not over there.
- We're calling the police.

696
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:45,094
And tell them what, exactly? Huh?

697
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:49,890
Practise it! Run it by me once.
I wanna see how it sounds out loud.

698
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,895
Anything else?

699
01:04:57,731 --> 01:05:00,025
Tom, why don't you come inside with me?

700
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:02,903
I wanna talk to you.
You're not yourself right now.

701
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:05,906
This is just fucking typical!

702
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,325
Now, what do you want me to do,
Maggie, huh?

703
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:12,997
You want me to go inside and just, uh...
sit down on the couch in front of the TV...

704
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:19,003
...and drink beer until I fall asleep, and maybe
repeat the whole thing again tomorrow?

705
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:21,505
- Be quiet!
- And the day after and the day after?

706
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:24,425
- Oh, just stop!
- Until... until...

707
01:05:24,508 --> 01:05:27,553
Until I... I grab my chest and die?

708
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:32,057
I mean, this... this is the most important thing
that's ever happened to me.

709
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:36,353
I mean, this is...
this is the most... important thing...

710
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:40,566
...that I have ever done in my whole life,
in my whole stupid life!

711
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:42,735
And you want me to just stop?!

712
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,947
No! No, I won't stop!

713
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:49,450
I won't stop! I won't stop!

714
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:54,330
Eight years, I've known you.

715
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:58,417
Not once have you talked to me like this.
Not once.

716
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:02,379
And if you do it again, I swear to God...

717
01:06:03,422 --> 01:06:09,220
And you know what? When you talk about
how ordinary you are and your stupid life,...

718
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:14,225
...you're saying "Our stupid life,"
which I don't think is particularly stupid.

719
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:18,145
So how the fuck
am I supposed to feel about that?

720
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:15,369
Are you gonna drink that?

721
01:07:27,715 --> 01:07:29,425
I'm sorry.

722
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,096
OK, I'm not sorry.

723
01:07:40,978 --> 01:07:43,606
- Who's that from?
- My brother Steve.

724
01:07:43,689 --> 01:07:47,526
- My grandma's going back in the hospital.
- No, she...

725
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:50,029
What?

726
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:53,991
What?

727
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:57,077
Nothing.

728
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:09,256
What is it?

729
01:08:16,972 --> 01:08:18,516
Hello?

730
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:22,812
Oh, Steve. I'm sorry, we've been so busy.
I was just about...

731
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:24,980
What?

732
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:31,570
She did?

733
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:34,532
How am I doing, Dad?

734
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:37,576
You're doing great, kid. You're doing great.

735
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:45,709
I'm so sorry, baby.

736
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:50,673
You knew.

737
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:52,842
You knew, didn't you?

738
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:55,469
When is the funeral?

739
01:08:55,553 --> 01:08:59,682
Sunday. We should leave as soon as we can.

740
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:01,851
Oh.

741
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:04,437
You... you want me to go with you?

742
01:09:06,063 --> 01:09:08,774
I just thought,
with your family and everything...

743
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:12,820
Do I want you to go with me...
to my grandmother's funeral?

744
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:16,031
She practically raised me!
Of course I want you to come.

745
01:09:16,115 --> 01:09:20,578
It's just, I'm kinda
in the middle of something here.

746
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:32,024
$800 a month! Can't get any fucking water!

747
01:10:32,108 --> 01:10:34,193
Fuck!

748
01:12:04,325 --> 01:12:06,285
Tools.

749
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:42,530
Damn!

750
01:12:42,613 --> 01:12:44,698
Piece of shit!

751
01:13:23,112 --> 01:13:26,240
Haa-ha-ha-ha!

752
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:27,950
Yaaaaa!

753
01:13:39,003 --> 01:13:41,088
It's a rented house!

754
01:13:57,521 --> 01:13:59,356
- Hello?
- It's me.

755
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,568
- Oh, hey. Hey, baby, how're ya doin'?
- I'm OK.

756
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:06,781
- How's your family?
- Drunk, fighting with each other.

757
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:11,368
Listen, Maggie, I'm so sorry. I mean, I...
I should be there with ya. I'm an asshole.

758
01:14:11,452 --> 01:14:14,205
Yeah, well, you have your good points.

759
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:18,167
- How do you feel?
- Oh, fine. Fine. You know...

760
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:22,129
Much... much... much better.
Everything's fine here. Really good.

761
01:14:22,213 --> 01:14:25,424
No, uh...

762
01:14:26,217 --> 01:14:30,596
- No more digging?
- No. Uh-uh. Back to normal.

763
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:35,601
I'm sorry, too. I wish I hadn't stormed out.
I shouldn't have left you alone.

764
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,853
I deserved it.

765
01:14:37,937 --> 01:14:41,774
Why don't you come up here with us?
You could make it in an hour.

766
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:44,944
- Oh, no, I can't really do that.
- Why not?

767
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:48,114
I'm not supposed to use the truck
for personal trips.

768
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:54,286
I'll pick you up. I'll leave right away.

769
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:53,869
Oh, no, no, baby. Don't do that. That's crazy.

770
01:14:53,953 --> 01:14:55,871
I gotta go.

771
01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:58,958
- I'll just pull up front and honk. Bye.
- No, no, no! No!

772
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:40,749
OK, bub, you ready to go?

773
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,961
I'm scared to go home.
I wanna stay at Uncle Steve's house.

774
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:48,632
- Why are you scared?
- Because of the feathers.

775
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:51,218
What feathers?

776
01:15:51,302 --> 01:15:54,013
I don't know. I just saw feathers.

777
01:15:55,806 --> 01:15:58,309
It's OK. I'll watch him.

778
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:00,811
OK. You be good.

779
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:03,189
Mom! Wait!

780
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:06,942
You forgot this.

781
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:28,959
Hi!

782
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:31,712
Hi.

783
01:18:31,796 --> 01:18:34,340
Come here a sec.

784
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:38,636
- What?
- Come closer. I can't hear you.

785
01:18:40,638 --> 01:18:44,683
- Are you talking to me?
- I wanna show you something.

786
01:18:44,767 --> 01:18:46,852
You wanna show me something?

787
01:18:46,936 --> 01:18:50,064
Well, yeah. I don't see anybody else around.

788
01:18:51,107 --> 01:18:54,110
- What is it?
- It's a surprise.

789
01:18:54,193 --> 01:18:58,656
It's really great. Come on!
You won't believe it.

790
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:00,991
Come on! It's freezing!

791
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:09,125
Hey! Happy St Patrick's Day!

792
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:12,044
- What's the surprise?
- Don't you have it?

793
01:19:12,128 --> 01:19:15,089
- Oh, yeah. The surprise, huh?
- The surprise.

794
01:19:15,172 --> 01:19:17,716
- You need another drink.
- No, I got the spins.

795
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,885
Drink, motherfucker, drink!

796
01:19:19,969 --> 01:19:24,056
- I don't think there is a surprise.
- Oh, yeah, there is. Yeah, there is.

797
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,851
The surprise is we decided
we wanna be your friends.

798
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:28,686
- You do?
- Yeah.

799
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:33,357
- Why do you wanna be my friends now?
- Are you kidding? Look at yourself.

800
01:19:35,401 --> 01:19:37,987
Uh-uh, look.

801
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:40,823
You can take your coat off, you know.

802
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:44,285
- You want a drink?
- I'm not supposed to.

803
01:19:44,368 --> 01:19:48,456
Don't you do anything
you're not supposed to? Huh?

804
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:50,833
I do.

805
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:54,211
Yeah.

806
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:56,797
Momma, you are hot!

807
01:19:56,881 --> 01:20:00,176
Come on, let's be friends, huh?

808
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:02,553
Well,...

809
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:05,389
...you can kiss me if you want to.

810
01:20:05,473 --> 01:20:07,975
Yeah... Yeah.

811
01:20:16,484 --> 01:20:19,987
- Not... not like that, OK?
- OK. OK. OK...

812
01:20:25,034 --> 01:20:27,328
Agh! Ouch!

813
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:34,376
- I wanna go home.
- Not now, no, no. Come on...

814
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,545
- I'll be your friend.
- I want to, but...

815
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:40,466
Just be nice to me, huh? Be a good girl.
You are a good girl, aren't you?

816
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:43,511
- I have to go home.
- How about a helmet wash?

817
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:46,388
I have to go home. I have to go home!

818
01:20:56,148 --> 01:20:58,567
No! Stop!

819
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:03,155
Shut up! Shut up!

820
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:05,324
Shut... Argh! God!

821
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:08,536
Shut up! Argh!

822
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:12,998
Make her stop, man!
Make her stop screaming!

823
01:21:13,082 --> 01:21:14,500
Shut her up, man!

824
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:21,132
Use your jacket or something!
Put it over her face!

825
01:21:22,341 --> 01:21:23,801
Shut up!

826
01:21:33,144 --> 01:21:38,816
<i>I could not foresee
this thing happening to me</i>

827
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:49,702
Oh, my God!

828
01:21:50,744 --> 01:21:52,830
What the fuck did you do that for?

829
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:54,999
- Is she dead?
- No shit, she's dead!

830
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:57,585
Oh, my God!

831
01:21:57,668 --> 01:22:00,921
- Look at her tongue, man.
- I am not here.

832
01:22:01,005 --> 01:22:03,466
I've never seen nobody dead before.

833
01:22:03,549 --> 01:22:06,177
- I can't be here.
- It's fucking gross.

834
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,804
This isn't happening.

835
01:22:08,888 --> 01:22:13,142
Fucking plastic over her face!
Good thinking, Adam!

836
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:17,021
Well, what do we do now?

837
01:22:52,348 --> 01:22:54,892
How's he doin'?

838
01:22:54,975 --> 01:22:58,604
He might make it. He might not.

839
01:22:59,647 --> 01:23:03,651
Sheila's over at the hospital.
I'm gonna head over.

840
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:06,070
Frank... I'm sorry.

841
01:23:07,113 --> 01:23:12,743
I'm sorry because...
I think I know why Adam shot himself.

842
01:23:13,327 --> 01:23:16,747
And... I gotta call the police about it.

843
01:23:17,873 --> 01:23:20,543
And I don't want you to hear it from them.

844
01:23:20,626 --> 01:23:23,963
And I don't want Sheila
to read about it in the paper.

845
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:28,426
I-I... I think you have a right to know
before anybody else.

846
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:30,761
What are you talking about, Tom?

847
01:23:33,597 --> 01:23:36,100
Come with me.

848
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:38,894
Wait here for a second.

849
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:49,113
It better be important.

850
01:24:00,499 --> 01:24:03,127
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

851
01:24:06,172 --> 01:24:08,424
How the hell did you find this?

852
01:24:09,008 --> 01:24:11,469
Does it matter?

853
01:24:12,511 --> 01:24:15,139
Well, you don't know if it was Kurt and Adam.

854
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:18,017
Yeah, I do.

855
01:24:19,435 --> 01:24:21,979
But you don't have anything to...

856
01:24:23,022 --> 01:24:28,611
Tom, you're talking like a goddamn lunatic!
That's what people are gonna say.

857
01:24:28,694 --> 01:24:31,614
I-it's just a body. It doesn't prove anything.

858
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:33,949
She's...

859
01:24:34,033 --> 01:24:37,244
She's got somebody's hair in her hand.

860
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:41,415
They're gonna be able to tell whose it is.

861
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:47,546
Hey, Frank.

862
01:24:50,132 --> 01:24:52,968
We... we gotta call the cops.

863
01:24:55,221 --> 01:24:58,599
What were we supposed to do?

864
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,727
It was an accident.

865
01:25:03,771 --> 01:25:07,358
The kids come to us, she's already dead.

866
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:13,239
The damage is done. There's nothing
anybody can do to bring her back.

867
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:19,578
But these kids got...
everything ahead of them.

868
01:25:20,871 --> 01:25:23,749
So what were we supposed to do, Tom?

869
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:28,170
Send our sons to jail for the rest of their lives
because of her?

870
01:25:29,213 --> 01:25:31,674
Who are you planning to shoot with that?

871
01:25:33,217 --> 01:25:37,221
- Get the hell outta here, Tom.
- Hey, Frank... come on upstairs.

872
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:39,348
We... we could talk about this.

873
01:25:39,432 --> 01:25:42,810
I've been living with this for... six months.

874
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:49,024
Six fucking months!

875
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:56,157
Do you think anything you have to say is
gonna make one bit of difference to me?!

876
01:25:57,241 --> 01:26:00,411
- Get the hell outta here!
- I-I'm not leaving until...

877
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:01,662
Get out!

878
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:05,040
Get out!

879
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:19,805
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

880
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:24,894
- Well, it's really pouring, huh?
- Yeah, looks like it.

881
01:26:25,436 --> 01:26:28,689
You got a minute?

882
01:26:28,773 --> 01:26:31,358
No, I'm... I'm... kinda busy right now.

883
01:26:31,442 --> 01:26:33,444
It's important.

884
01:26:38,574 --> 01:26:42,286
I-I don't really
have time to talk right now, Harry.

885
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:45,080
Ah, Jesus! This rain, huh?!

886
01:26:45,956 --> 01:26:50,169
Harry, like I said, you know,
I'm really kind of busy right now.

887
01:26:50,252 --> 01:26:53,589
Kurt, I know you weren't raised in a barn.
Close that door.

888
01:26:53,672 --> 01:26:56,342
Maybe I could call you later or something?

889
01:26:59,637 --> 01:27:02,264
Tom, we got ourselves
a serious problem here.

890
01:27:02,348 --> 01:27:05,476
Whaddaya mean?

891
01:27:05,559 --> 01:27:08,270
What the hell you think
you're doing to my house?

892
01:27:08,771 --> 01:27:11,941
I heard all this pounding going on.
I thought I'd check it out.

893
01:27:12,024 --> 01:27:14,652
I didn't think you'd be wrecking the place!

894
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:17,738
What's the matter with you?

895
01:27:17,822 --> 01:27:21,492
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take care of that.

896
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:25,162
I-I was trying to fix your water main,
you know - it was leaking,...

897
01:27:25,246 --> 01:27:28,415
...and I couldn't get to it
from underneath the house.

898
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:34,630
I-I mean... I-I couldn't
get under the house to get to it.

899
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:38,342
Is that right?

900
01:27:39,427 --> 01:27:42,179
Damn. A lotta water damage?

901
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:45,558
Some.

902
01:27:45,641 --> 01:27:47,935
Can I look around?

903
01:27:49,437 --> 01:27:53,399
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure. Help yourself.

904
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:57,403
Maybe you'd better show me where it's at.

905
01:28:00,114 --> 01:28:04,076
Well, you guys'll be able to see.
I-I gotta take off right now.

906
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:09,457
I'm almost afraid to look.

907
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,292
- Drink it.
- Right.

908
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:13,794
Hurry up.

909
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:18,257
The water main doesn't run under the house.

910
01:28:21,385 --> 01:28:23,596
Well, I know that now.

911
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:28,559
Shit, Tom.

912
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:36,984
Argh!

913
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:41,572
Get him on the rug.

914
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:49,622
- Don't look at him. Roll him over.
- Yeah.

915
01:28:49,705 --> 01:28:52,416
Let's go! All right,...

916
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,794
...get outta the way.

917
01:30:35,352 --> 01:30:37,438
Tom?

918
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:44,487
Are you here?

919
01:30:51,243 --> 01:30:53,329
Shit!

920
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:56,457
Argh!

921
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:02,171
Out of the way, Kurt!

922
01:31:04,006 --> 01:31:05,007
Arghh!

923
01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:30,741
They were gonna kill you, Tommy.
You and Maggie both.

924
01:31:36,831 --> 01:31:40,376
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

925
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:55,307
Cold-blooded murder.

926
01:31:56,767 --> 01:31:59,728
I can't let something like that happen.

927
01:32:00,771 --> 01:32:03,149
Not here.

928
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:07,278
This was a decent neighbourhood.

929
01:32:19,457 --> 01:32:23,419
If I ever feel the light again

930
01:32:24,253 --> 01:32:27,339
Shining down on me

931
01:32:28,799 --> 01:32:31,761
I don't have to tell you

932
01:32:32,636 --> 01:32:35,765
How welcome it would be

933
01:32:36,849 --> 01:32:39,393
I felt the light before

934
01:32:39,477 --> 01:32:42,855
But I let it slip away

935
01:32:44,315 --> 01:32:51,864
And I just keep on believing
that it'll come back some day

936
01:32:52,364 --> 01:32:54,825
It's not the spotlight

937
01:32:56,702 --> 01:32:59,246
It's not the candlelight

938
01:33:01,165 --> 01:33:03,501
It's not the streetlights

939
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:07,254
Just some old street of dreams

940
01:33:10,007 --> 01:33:12,718
It ain't the moonlight

941
01:33:13,886 --> 01:33:16,931
Not even the sunlight

942
01:33:19,183 --> 01:33:27,691
But I've seen it shining in your eyes
and you know what I mean

943
01:34:03,018 --> 01:34:05,104
Jake...

944
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:08,315
Jake...

945
01:34:12,403 --> 01:34:14,363
Jake...

946
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:17,700
La-da-da, da-da-da

947
01:34:20,661 --> 01:34:22,746
<i>Hello, hello</i>

948
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,965
<i>Hello, hello, hello</i>

949
01:34:36,135 --> 01:34:38,763
<i>Are you out there?</i>

950
01:34:39,513 --> 01:34:41,390
<i>Oh</i>

951
01:34:41,474 --> 01:34:43,559
<i>Oh-oh</i>

952
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:54,445
<i>La-da-da, da-da-da</i>

953
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:57,448
<i>La-da-da, da-da-da</i>

954
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:59,617
<i>Oh</i>

955
01:35:02,787 --> 01:35:05,331
<i>MOD, are you out there?</i>

956
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:08,793
<i>I can't see your face but you left a trace</i>

957
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:12,797
<i>On a data back-road that I almost erased</i>

958
01:35:14,173 --> 01:35:18,052
<i>Not even God takes this long to get back</i>

959
01:35:19,095 --> 01:35:21,180
<i>So get back</i>

960
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:25,810
<i>Cos I hit a fork in the road,
I lost my way home</i>

961
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:30,397
<i>Cut off from the main line
like a disconnected modem</i>

962
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:34,235
<i>Hello?</i>

963
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:38,572
<i>Tap in the code, I'll reach you below</i>

964
01:35:39,532 --> 01:35:43,327
<i>No one should brave
that underworld alone</i>

965
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:45,496
<i>Hello, hello, hello</i>

966
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:50,960
<i>How do I reach you?</i>

967
01:35:51,836 --> 01:35:53,712
<i>Oh</i>

968
01:35:53,796 --> 01:35:55,881
<i>Oh-oh</i>

969
01:36:04,849 --> 01:36:06,934
<i>La-da-da, da-da-da</i>

970
01:36:07,351 --> 01:36:09,728
<i>La-da-da, da-da-da</i>

971
01:36:09,812 --> 01:36:11,897
<i>Oh</i>

972
01:36:12,523 --> 01:36:14,942
<i>Oh</i>

973
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:17,319
<i>La-da-da, da-da-da</i>

974
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:20,114
<i>La-da-da, da-da-da</i>

975
01:36:20,197 --> 01:36:22,283
<i>Oh</i>

976
01:36:22,825 --> 01:36:24,910
<i>Oh</i>

977
01:36:24,994 --> 01:36:27,288
<i>Word has it on the wire</i>

978
01:36:27,371 --> 01:36:29,748
<i>That you don't know who you are</i>

979
01:36:29,832 --> 01:36:34,920
<i>Well, if you could jack into my brain,
you'd know exactly what you mean here</i>

980
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:39,383
<i>Mothers are trails on stars in the night</i>

981
01:36:40,843 --> 01:36:44,346
<i>Fathers are black holes
that suck up the light</i>

982
01:36:45,973 --> 01:36:48,476
<i>That's the memory I filed on the fringe</i>

983
01:36:48,559 --> 01:36:52,021
<i>Along with the memory
of the pain you lived in</i>

984
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:55,649
<i>Hello</i>

985
01:36:56,275 --> 01:37:00,279
<i>I don't have the password,
but the path is chain-linked</i>

986
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,242
<i>So if you got the time, set the tone to sync</i>

987
01:37:05,326 --> 01:37:06,577
<i>Tap in the code</i>

988
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:08,746
<i>Hello, hello</i>

989
01:37:11,207 --> 01:37:13,751
<i>Are you out there?</i>

990
01:37:14,543 --> 01:37:16,378
<i>Oh</i>

991
01:37:16,462 --> 01:37:18,547
<i>Oh-oh</i>

992
01:37:27,431 --> 01:37:29,517
<i>La-da-da, da-da-da</i>

993

<i>La-da-da, da-da-da</i>

994
01:37:32,561 --> 01:37:34,647
<i>Oh</i>
