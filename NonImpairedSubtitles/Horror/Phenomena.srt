1
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,109
Wait!

2
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,358
Stop!

3
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,590
Please wait!

4
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,034
Stop!

5
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,393
Is anyone home?

6
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,194
Is there anyone home?

7
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,429
Can I come in?

8
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,473
Please, I am a foreigner.

9
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,114
And I'm lost.

10
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,356
I know someone's there.

11
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,309
Hello?

12
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,432
Please, I need help.

13
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,358
This is completely new for me, professor.

14
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,516
I simply can't imagine
how a expert on insects...

15
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,989
...could be so helpful for the police.

16
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,511
Would you please explain that
more detailled.

17
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,438
Of course. You can't see the
connections on first sight.

18
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,428
When I decided to specialize
in animal cadavers, ...

19
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,317
...I did not have the least idea of that.

20
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,634
John, do I really have to listen to that again?

21
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,872
Oh yes, just as you had to
on the first murder case.

22
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,235
You came to me because
you did not know how to go on.

23
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,477
We solved the case together.

24
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,919
When a dead body is exposed to nature
it will be eaten by insects sooner or later.

25
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,510
You naughty girl

26
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,197
Where did you find that?

27
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,754
You could hurt yourself.

28
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,071
It is sharp.

29
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,391
It is not a toy.

30
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,432
Outside?

31
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,872
And who, may I ask, put it out there?

32
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,837
Don't you ever play with this again.

33
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,714
I forgot to introduce you... this is Inga.

34
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,314
She's my nurse.

35
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,228
If I pick out something with
my laser she'll bring it to me.

36
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,236
She's also my friend, too.

37
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,470
Aren't you?

38
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,152
But she is a very good nurse.

39
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,318
Cadaver-eating insects are
divided into eight groups.

40
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,274
These eight groups of insects come
to the corpse one after the other.

41
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,797
And this only in certain
moments and at a precise time.

42
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,838
Never sooner and never later.

43
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,154
We call them the eight squadrons of death.

44
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,836
First, the common fly comes to the
rotting corpse and lays its eggs.

45
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,831
This is the beginnig of the cycle.

46
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,476
Each group of insects stays for exactly fifteen days.

47
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,359
So, you have to multiply fifteen by eight.

48
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,709
The number of groups.
This equals four months.

49
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,072
Correct. In this case the cycle seems to be complete.

50
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,710
Yet, it is already in the second generation.

51
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,119
From this we may conclude that
this head is rotting for eight months.

52
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,869
By calculating and determining the number,
the look and the kind of the insects, ...

53
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,315
...you can find out the exact date of death.

54
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,714
or of the murder.

55
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,793
So our victim was decapitated
some 8 month ago.

56
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,439
And 15 days.

57
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,790
You must not forget, that the body was on
the bottom of the lake for fifteen days.

58
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,916
Before the gases which result from
decomposition brought it to the surface.

59
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,797
Where the first flies were already waiting.

60
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,632
Exactly eight and a half months.

61
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,994
Perhaps less. It was extraordinary warm then.

62
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,714
However, I may assume that the person was
decapitated between the 7th and the 10th.

63
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,395
Is that correct?

64
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,914
Let's think about it.

65
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,757
The first girl disappeard on September 9.

66
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,155
A sixteen-year-old tourist from Denmark.

67
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,471
The body was never found.

68
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,870
Same as with the others.

69
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,913
It is not nice.

70
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,194
Like Greta.

71
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,269
Poor Greta.

72
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,152
She is also on the list.

73
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,234
She is missing but we have
no proof that she is dead.

74
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,392
After finding this what's the use
of hiding from the facts.

75
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,072
There is a killer.

76
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,234
A vicious killer.

77
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,833
We'll get him.

78
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,877
Someone has to catch this monster.

79
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,510
Good night, professor.

80
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,991
Do you know this part of the country?

81
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,156
No, this is my first trip to europe.

82
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,598
People call it the swiss transylvania.

83
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
Why?
- I don't know. They just do.

84
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,914
So, you are the Corvino girl!

85
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,754
You father is terribly...
- Yes, he is.

86
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,911
I admire him very much.

87
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,599
I thought he might have come with you.

88
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,234
No, he is workin on the Philippins.

89
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,078
He'll be there for almost a year.

90
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,760
He can't even be reached by telephone.

91
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,517
Well in any case.
He has placed you in good hands.

92
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,237
You know I'm sure you are
going to like our school.

93
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,630
To begin with, we all speak english.

94
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,156
And the our academic program
is based on the american one.

95
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,873
Ah... a bee...

96
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,679
Be carefull it may sting you.

97
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,315
No!

98
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,354
Leave it alone!

99
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,879
Don't kill her.

100
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,918
It won't hurt me.
Insects never hurt me. I love them.

101
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,558
You... you love them?

102
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,353
Yes, I love all insects.

103
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,957
If you mean...

104
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:14,158
Now Jennifer has arrived.

105
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,358
And the first night will come.

106
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,070
A night she'll never forget.

107
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,433
Take her baggage.

108
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,914
It is beautiful, isn't it?

109
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,434
The estate was once Richard Wagner's.

110
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,597
The school is occupied in the main building.

111
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,870
The others are closed because they are not safe.

112
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,790
Never go in there.

113
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,638
Come on.

114
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,075
I'm starved.
You got anythin to eat?

115
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,076
No, sorry.

116
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,869
I haven't eaten for two days now.

117
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,875
What is that?

118
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,437
Baby food.

119
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,679
My parents left it when they
visited me with my little brother.

120
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,948
He's seven months old.

121
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,795
I bet he is the only male who has
ever seen the inside of this place.

122
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,155
Vegetables, how nice. I'm vegetarian.
Do you have a spoon?

123
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,957
No.

124
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,309
How is it?

125
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,755
Like cat food.

126
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,111
By the way, I'm Sophie. I'm French.
- Jenniffer.

127
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,635
Did you see the director already?

128
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,632
If you talk of the devil...

129
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,079
You are the new girl.
You were expected this afternoon.

130
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,313
The flight was delayed.

131
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,875
The school has its rules.
I'm sorry, but I must confiscate this.

132
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,596
Hey wait. You don't know who that is.
That's Paul Corvino.

133
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,873
Sophie that is enough. Get into bed!
And if I catch you smoking again, you'll be sorry.

134
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,312
And you young lady... to bed.

135
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,108
And switch off the light.

136
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,068
That bitch stealing Paul Corvino.

137
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,712
It is all right.
I have a bunch of them in the bag.

138
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,469
So tomorrow we put them
all up all over the room.

139
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,390
I've seen all his movies
I saw his last one three times.

140
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,508
Luck for you. He must have made
me zip through it at least 15 times.

141
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,393
He said he trust in my opinon.

142
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,790
You mean you know him?

143
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,319
Yes, of course I do.

144
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,993
Have you been to bed with him?

145
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,394
Paul Corvino is my father.
- Oh, sorry.

146
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,396
It's all right.

147
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,917
I do know everything about you!
- Do you?

148
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,118
Your mother lived in India and owned a hotel.
She was married again.

149
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,036
Not like your father.

150
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,673
You were only 7 when they split up.

151
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,630
No, 8.

152
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,319
You were 7!

153
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,710
How do you know that?

154
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,070
I read Fangoria. - Oh!

155
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:55,230
It was christmas. I was checking the
presents when the phone rings.

156
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,358
Ma answered.

157
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,399
She said she will come soon.

158
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,554
It was her lover.

159
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,832
Then she went...

160
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,350
...and did never came back.

161
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,434
I always remember it.
Dad got 12 presents.

162
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,952
He said he got the 13. From mother to hurt him.

163
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,191
You didn't read that in Fangoria?

164
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,276
You know I am really glad you are here.

165
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,192
I always had to sleep alone.

166
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,390
It can be very scary.

167
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,913
Thank's for coming.

168
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,116
I am the one who should thank you.

169
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,714
Don't let me forget that.
I owe you a meal.

170
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,351
You know... there is a murder around here!

171
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,429
A maniac who kidnaps girls all ages and kills them.

172
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,151
Could we change the subject?

173
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,357
I need my sleep.
I'm really tired from the trip.

174
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,595
You're right.
Sometimes I can't sleep all night thinking about it.

175
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,709
What do you think about before you fall asleep?

176
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,109
My father.

177
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,837
If I thought about your father
I'd never get any sleep.

178
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,752
Can I still watch some TV?
I have headphones as well

179
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,188
No problem, good night, Sophie.

180
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,309
Sleep well, Jenniffer.

181
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,239
Are you hurt?

182
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,079
What you are doing on the street at night?

183
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,115
Can't you answer?

184
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,199
Why are you dressed like that?

185
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,108
Look at her eyes, she used drugs!

186
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,673
Can you see anything?

187
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,598
What are we doing now?

188
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,597
Lets run away.

189
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,709
Where are you coming from?

190
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,717
O.k., I'm coming with you.

191
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,915
Is this the first time you've been sleepwalking?

192
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,559
No.

193
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,550
Do you know what happened?

194
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,838
I can't remember anything.

195
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,313
My savior.

196
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,198
Are you american?

197
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,953
I am studying at the academy.

198
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,155
Where are you from?

199
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,633
I am from Scotland.
I came here as student and stayed to teach.

200
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,311
Then I had this accident.

201
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,597
I haven't moved since.

202
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,034
What do you teach?

203
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,034
Enthomology.
Study insects.

204
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,270
Really?

205
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,112
Do insects interest you?

206
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,994
Yeah. A lot!
I love them.

207
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,910
You mean that?

208
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,790
Absolutely! Why?

209
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,792
You remind me of another girl.
Greta.

210
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,157
Used to come here somtimes and help out.
Mostly secretarial work. And then...

211
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,430
Then?

212
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,598
She was supposed to come here one night.
She never arrived.

213
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,835
The killer got her?

214
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,473
How do you know about that?

215
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,952
I thought so.

216
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,633
You must be frozen, child.
She left a coat here.

217
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,708
It's upstairs.
Here, she'll show you were it is.

218
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:22,352
You are wonderful, Inge.

219
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,756
Stop it, it hurts.

220
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,599
Hold that.

221
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,311
That beats.

222
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,478
They never miss.

223
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,628
This special is supposed to be practically blind.

224
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,910
Be careful, you are in range.

225
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,309
Won't do anythink to me.

226
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,350
In this coat you look like Greta.
She also liked the insects.

227
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,508
But they didn't like her as they like you.

228
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,309
Can you hear the chirping?

229
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,231
This means something special.

230
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,757
It is a mating call.
You are exciting him.

231
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,750
Smell it!

232
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,911
Really?
- Yes, smell.

233
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,719
Sort of sweet.

234
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,110
This substance is secreted by a gland.

235
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,117
It is supposed to attract the female.

236
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,315
You are exciting him and
he is doing his best to excite you.

237
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,959
I don't think so. We only just met.

238
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,554
It isn't the mating season.
I don't understand.

239
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,470
I've never seen anything like that before.

240
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,075
Oh, thanks for everything.

241
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,756
Come by any time.

242
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,155
Night.

243
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,517
To make an old man happy...

244
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,837
...take the cablecar.
It is only a five minutes ride from town.

245
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,914
I don't know. Maybe.

246
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,917
And mind how you go. Without sleepwalking.

247
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,030
If it happens to you again, you must say:
I am sleepwalking, I must wake up.

248
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,798
I am sleepwalking, I must wake up.

249
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,798
I am sleepwalking, I must wake up.

250
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,478
I don't need that. I haven't had an attack for years.

251
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,753
The journey was probably to exhausting.

252
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,391
Or it was caused by the change of air.

253
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,113
Maybe the wind.

254
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,156
That is the foehn, a very strange wind.

255
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,676
It is typical for this area here.

256
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,356
It comes from the south over the Alps.

257
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,318
Such a sudden blast of warm air
causes snow avalanches.

258
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,398
Makes the flowers grow,
the larvae of the insects develop faster.

259
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,919
And many complain about headaches.

260
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,590
When it blows, they say
it drives some people to madness.

261
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,155
This is a rather strange part of the country here.

262
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,593
This Swiss Transylvania.

263
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,917
Would someone please tell me
what this examination is all about?

264
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,913
What you did last night is highly irregular.

265
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,032
No student ever left the
boarding school at night before.

266
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,910
How many times do I have to tell you that
I did not leave school on purpose.

267
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,679
I walked in my sleep.
This can happen.

268
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,071
But this is not normal.
And it is our duty to find the reason for that.

269
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,595
But don't you understand?
You will find out nothing.

270
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,679
I've been examined by specialists before.
It is not an illness.

271
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,072
Not yet, but it could become more serious.

272
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,878
And you can't remember anything?

273
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,873
Sleepwalking is far more serious
than talking in the sleep, ...

274
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,308
...or ransacking the fridge.

275
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,916
It could even lead to a new personality trying to emerge.

276
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,075
Sometimes it is the first step on the path to schizophrenia.

277
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,151
So you think I'm crasy?

278
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,711
O.k., forget your EEG.

279
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,469
Calm down, calm down.

280
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,630
O.k., start it.
I will show you who is crazy.

281
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,109
What is going on?

282
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,914
That is strange.

283
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,710
Do you suffer from epilepsy or
do you take something like... drugs?

284
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:39,916
I am not schizophrenic, epileptic or stoned.

285
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,031
Hello, Shapero Evans?

286
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,993
Hi, I'd like to speak to Moris please?

287
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,999
Jennifer Corvino.
Right, Paul Corvino's daughter.

288
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,119
He is out of town?

289
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,755
Three days?

290
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,519
Holidays?

291
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,315
Which holidays?

292
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,711
Look who is there.

293
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,035
Our zombie.

294
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,595
Have you heard, she walks in her sleep.

295
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,110
Walks in the sleep. If you ask me, she has got a problem.

296
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,275
For me, she is ill.

297
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,032
So thats Paul Corvino's daughter.

298
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,118
That doesn't give her the right
to be such a show-off.

299
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,950
Here she comes.

300
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,388
Lets go.

301
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,596
Yes, I don't want to be close to her.

302
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,553
What's wrong?
- Damn Moris.

303
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,029
Who is he? Your boyfriend?

304
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,635
He's my fathers agent and atourney.

305
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,440
I want him to get me out of this shitty school.

306
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,518
Why do you want to leave?

307
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,758
Your little brother isn't the
only male to disgrace this place.

308
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,598
First you forgot the doctor.

309
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,270
He's not a man.
He's got more hands than the entire basketball team.

310
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,995
Second you forgot the killer.
- The killer?

311
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,717
What is the poet trying to say with these words?

312
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,155
Well, who is going to answer?

313
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,909
You, Elisabeth.

314
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,071
Me?
- Yes you.

315
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,397
I think the poet took the words
right out of a Bee Gees song.

316
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,948
That's very funny.

317
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,435
The poet in question is Abraham Kouli.

318
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,558
What if the killer saw me?

319
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,029
I am really scared.
- I would be too.

320
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,076
Can you imagine if I walk in my sleep
again tonight I walk right into him.

321
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,315
Please promise you keep an eye on me tonight.
And lock the door.

322
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,792
And when you hear me get up do anything to wake me.

323
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,154
Promise?
Please say yes.

324
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,471
Sophie? You tell us!

325
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,392
Me?
- Yes, stand up.

326
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,428
The poet with it's eracular style...

327
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,676
The poet with it's ericular style...

328
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,830
Eracular style!
- Ähm... , eracular style.

329
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,709
...tells of the danger we face, should we forget...
...the sense and the meaning of the past...

330
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,590
...tells of the danger we face, should we forget
the sense and the meaning of the past...

331
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,070
And do you believe that danger exists?

332
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,754
Screw the past.

333
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,274
Screw the past.

334
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,672
Well done, Sophie.

335
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:59,679
And what about ancient greece? Shakespear?
Richard Wagner?

336
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,148
And Michael Jackson.

337
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,395
Like it?
- Nice! Were it comes from?

338
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,116
I put in on by mistake.
Guess who it belongs to?

339
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,992
Paul Corvino's daughter.
- The actor?

340
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,155
Her name is Jennifer and she is my roommate.

341
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,279
How is she?

342
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,280
He is fantastic. All those muscles.

343
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,676
Not him! Her?

344
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,357
Oh, she is pretty.
She wears her hair like mine.

345
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,558
You know, I have to watch her at night.
Because she walks in her sleep.

346
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,239
Walks in her sleep?

347
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,996
Yeah!
She gets up and she walks, like this.

348
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,274
Come back.

349
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,913
I have to go.

350
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,350
It takes long to come home.

351
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,397
Oh, come on, stay a while longer.

352
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,670
I really have to go now.

353
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,229
You shit.
- What did you say?

354
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,153
I said: Fuck you!

355
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:52,439
Sleepwalking... I must... I must wake up.

356
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,518
The police came this morning. My pale the head-mistress
told them not to believe anything I say, ...

357
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,636
...because she thinks I'm crazy.

358
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,477
Maybe you think I'm crazy too, dad.

359
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,478
I mean there was really nothing I could do.

360
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,240
I was so scared that I couldn't say anything
about what I saw or why I screamed.

361
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,199
Do you think the glove belongs to the killer?

362
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,508
Yeah! I'm sure of it!
- But why are there maggots?

363
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,990
It is the larvae.
I am going to examine it.

364
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,997
We know more after that if we are lucky.

365
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,791
Maybe I can answer your questions also.

366
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,358
You're the professor; I trust you.
You should examine me, too.

367
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,399
Jenniffer.
- Yes?

368
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,710
Don't forget your book.

369
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,911
Have you any idea, why they behave like that?

370
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,435
They have never done this before.

371
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,232
I guess they sense the mood I'm in.

372
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,716
I'm often in a bad mood.
Upset about something.

373
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,950
But they don't carry on like this.

374
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,279
In ancient Greece the butterfly symbolized the soul.

375
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,993
The so-called psyche.

376
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,675
That's why we speak of a butterfly-psyche.

377
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,674
Is there an association between
the insects and the human soul?

378
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,791
I think the key to this mystery
can only be found in the supernatural.

379
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,635
And if you are a very sensitive
person you feel something of that.

380
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,430
Right?

381
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,029
Yes.

382
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,909
How about the glove.

383
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,554
A insect, a firefly showed me the way.

384
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,914
The police was there.

385
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,231
They asked me lots of questions.

386
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,117
But I didn't tell them about the glove.

387
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,950
I don't want them to think I'm crazy.

388
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,639
You can tell me, I'm not the police.

389
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,789
What happened?

390
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:10,189
I was alone in the dark.

391
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,672
And I was afraid.

392
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,910
A firefly came.

393
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,197
It was like it heard me.

394
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,715
And it answerd my call.

395
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,996
You calmed them down, just by telling that.

396
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,278
That's ridiculous.
- No.

397
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,634
That's the greatest discovery I've made.

398
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,398
Through you my expectations were confirmed.

399
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,198
Now I have the facts my
colleages considered absurd.

400
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,635
The paranormal powers that
are unusual in human beeings...

401
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,959
...are perfectly natural in insects.

402
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:11,269
Some species communicate with each other
over far distances like telepathy.

403
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,195
I could give you many samples.

404
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,356
I wrote a book about it.

405
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,509
You should read it.

406
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,077
It's perfectly normal for insects
to be slightly telepathic.

407
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,990
It's normal for insects.

408
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,153
But am I normal?

409
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,516
Jennifer!

410
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,748
Why me?

411
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,190
Fräulein Corvino can not be left alone.

412
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,511
I want someone in here with her.

413
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,393
I want to know everything she says and does.

414
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,712
I'm scared of her.
She arrived and Sophie disappeared.

415
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,150
Plus she's crazy.
Listen to this:

416
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,235
Dear dad...
Ah, here it is.

417
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,518
Do you remember what the doctor said about...

418
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,240
...sleepwalking manifested
with split personality?

419
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,836
It's true.
My second personality is there.

420
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,833
Do you know how?
I communicate with insects.

421
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:44,031
I mean I have discovered,
I have power over them.

422
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,795
I'm not kidding.
I even have a witness.

423
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,754
The famous enthemologist
John Mc Gregor who lives near here.

424
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,949
We've become friends.

425
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,115
See, she is crazy.

426
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,358
This-is mine!

427
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,789
Hey Jennifer listen!
- What?

428
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,354
I'm a spider!
Look I'm a spider

429
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,597
Stop it.

430
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,869
I'm a killer-snake.

431
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,149
I'm a fly.

432
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,351
No!
Stop it!

433
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:44,394
We worship you...
We worship you...

434
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,989
I love you.

435
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,868
I love you all.

436
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,833
I love all of you.
