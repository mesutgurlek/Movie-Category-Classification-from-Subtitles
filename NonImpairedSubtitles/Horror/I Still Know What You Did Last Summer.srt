1
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:53,583
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.

2
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,823
lt's been a year
since my last confession.

3
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:05,817
l never told anyone this. Not my
mom, the police, not my friends.

4
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:12,861
Except for the ones who were there,
and they're not around anymore.

5
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:18,703
- You see, l ...
- Yes?

6
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:25,384
l killed a man.

7
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:29,378
But it was an accident.

8
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:34,383
A terrible accident, and l've tried
to get past it, but l can't.

9
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:40,493
- Go on.
- l have these ... dreams.

10
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:44,736
Really horrible dreams.

11
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:48,494
This man is always there with me.

12
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:55,457
He was a killer. He murdered Barry
and Helen, but l got away with it.

13
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:05,104
l guess l just need to deal with it,
you know?

14
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:08,864
Face the fear and the guilt.

15
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:11,975
Finally say his name.

16
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:16,577
Ben Willis.

17
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:22,734
- Ben Willis.
- l know.

18
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:30,505
You know? How could you ..?

19
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:35,613
l know what you did last summer.

20
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:45,576
Nice to see you find political
science so stimulating, Miss James.

21
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:53,424
Sorry.

22
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:06,337
- Julie, wait. Are you okay?
- l'm fine.

23
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:11,016
- You sure? You don't seem fine.
- l had another dream, Will.

24
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:17,294
- The one in the shower?
- ln a church. God, it was so real.

25
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,616
l thought the dreams were over.

26
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:23,538
- lt'll get better.
- lt can't get worse.

27
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:29,098
l've freaked out in class before.
l can't study, l can't sleep.

28
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:31,699
l'm this close to failing school.

29
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:34,174
Happy Fourth of July!

30
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:41,695
- lt was one year ago.
- lt's the anniversary.

31
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:46,177
- You've just got to take it easy.
- l'm really trying.

32
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:48,779
Sometimes l wonder why l came here.

33
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:52,824
- To get out of Southport?
- Right. Now l remember.

34
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,977
Are you going away for the Fourth?

35
00:04:56,145 --> 00:05:00,661
l'll be studying for the finals.
The joys of summer school.

36
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:05,376
Are you okay? Sure?
You're definitely okay?

37
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:08,617
Yes, l'm definitely okay.

38
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:12,221
Thanks for the talk, Will.
You're good to me.

39
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:15,297
- l am?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:19,817
- Okay, l'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

41
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:30,977
- Julie.
- Ray? God, what are you doing here?

42
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,296
l got in early. Who was that guy?

43
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:38,822
That's Will. He's a friend.
You'd like him. We're just friends.

44
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:43,695
All guys trying to pick up a girl
try the "good friend" thing first.

45
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:47,175
Ready to go? You know the drill.

46
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:52,544
The Croaker Queen Pageant.
Small-town fun, but nice.

47
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:55,344
- Ray, l can't.
- Can't what?

48
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:04,095
l feel like l haven't healed enough
to go back. So please understand.

49
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:06,978
- l understand.
- lt's not you.

50
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:12,100
lt's all me. ln my head.
l want to go back.

51
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:17,140
l want to be fine, to be with you.
l want it all to be like it was.

52
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:22,379
lt just isn't. Why don't you stay up
here? Fireworks over the river ...

53
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:28,017
l have to work, Julie. My boat's in
Southport, remember? But it's cool.

54
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:34,533
You need your space from Croakerland
and probably from me too.

55
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:40,022
- Ray ...
- Just forget it.

56
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:50,342
l'm scared, that's all.

57
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:30,016
Shit.

58
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:07,416
What the hell are you doing
in my closet?

59
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:11,624
l thought you left.
l just wanted to borrow your skirt.

60
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:16,381
- Jesus, that was heart attack time!
- Can l have the knife now?

61
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:21,175
- Come out with me tonight.
- l just tried to stab you.

62
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:26,260
- l hardly feel like dancing.
- What's the matter?

63
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,657
- l think l hurt Ray's feelings.
- Listen to me.

64
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:34,141
Ray is a great guy.
Nothing against old Ray, -

65
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:37,695
- but he's so ... Ray.

66
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:42,501
He lives in Southport.
Will lives right down the street.

67
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:46,214
- But there's nothing between us.
- Yet. Nothing yet.

68
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:52,335
l'm working at the club. And you,
Dancing Queen, are coming with me.

69
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:57,295
- No, l'm not ...
- Yes, you are. What did I say?

70
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:11,138
You know what l want to do to you,
right?

71
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:15,304
- No.
- ls there a place we can be alone?

72
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,855
- l don't think so. lt's crowded.
- Come on.

73
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:24,736
- l just want to talk for a minute.
- lf it only takes a minute, no way.

74
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:29,183
l'll talk real, real slow.

75
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:34,339
Not at work. Do me a favour.
Ask Julie to dance.

76
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:42,340
You know, Jules, you're the most
beautiful woman in the bar tonight.

77
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:45,895
Ty, you're an unstoppable
force of nature.

78
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:51,458
You better recognise.
That's how my species survives.

79
00:11:51,665 --> 00:11:56,341
- So, what's up? Wanna dance?
- Say yes. No means yes.

80
00:11:56,505 --> 00:12:01,056
Ty, have you seen my people dance?
We do the mouth thing. Snap fingers.

81
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:05,264
You can always
just stand there and watch me.

82
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,656
l have an idea.
Why don't we all go dance?

83
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:10,463
Let's go.

84
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:23,416
Oh, what do you know?
Will Benson, looking fine.

85
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:28,579
- Did you tell him l'd be here?
- l told him you wouldn't be here.

86
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:34,183
- And he came anyway. What's up?
- This wasn't my idea.

87
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:37,098
- This wasn't ...
- You'll be fine. Do your thing.

88
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:42,020
- Be good, Julie.
- You want to get a drink?

89
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:08,177
Hey ... Did you see something
back there?

90
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:14,978
l'm really sorry, but l've got
to go home right now. l'm sorry.

91
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:56,265
Morning.

92
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:01,143
- l love when they do that.
- That could break the machine.

93
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:06,017
- That's Ty.
- My number's unlisted.

94
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:11,054
Relax. We've been dating for three
months and he is not a stalker.

95
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:17,259
This is Mark in the Morning
from Magic 96. 7 radio station.

96
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:23,295
lt's Mark in the Morning! Put on
the speakerphone. Oh, my God. Hi.

97
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:29,495
- Hi, Mark. l'm Karla Wilson.
- WeII, what are you doing at home?

98
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:35,217
- l'm actually in school ...
- Want to win our magic getaway?

99
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:41,060
I hope you remember your geography.
What is the capitaI of BraziI?

100
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:47,784
- Okay. The capital of Brazil ...
- One question, one great getaway.

101
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:53,178
KarIa, we need an answer.
No Iooking it up. Five seconds.

102
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:59,295
- Four, three, two ...
- Rio de Janeiro!

103
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,622
- Oh, no. Did you say Rio?
- No.

104
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:07,942
- Yes ..? Yes!
- You won the 96. 7 quickie getaway!

105
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:12,024
A trip for four to Tower Bay IsIand
in the fabuIous Bahamas!

106
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:15,461
- l can't hear.
- We'II caII back with the detaiIs.

107
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,059
- What's your favourite station?
- 96.7!

108
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:21,137
That's what I thought.

109
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:27,653
Okay, who am l gonna take? Tyrell,
my parents, cousins ... Okay, Julie.

110
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:33,263
Mark said four tickets. So you
have to think of someone to bring.

111
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:42,657
Ray? Phone.

112
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:53,897
- Hi.
- I'm reaIIy gIad you caIIed.

113
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:58,980
l'm sorry. l shouldn't have left
so fast. l just ...

114
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,745
It's okay. Ray, Iisten ...

115
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:07,377
Karla won a trip to the Bahamas,
to this island called Tower Bay.

116
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:11,379
- She wants us to go with her.
- The Bahamas?

117
00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:19,099
It's a great chance for us to hang
out in the sun, drink, swim ...

118
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:23,577
... and, well, you know.

119
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:26,976
- This weekend?
- Yeah.

120
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:33,021
- You wouldn't go away with me.
- lt's not you. lt's Southport.

121
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:37,940
- And, God, it's the Bahamas. Free.
- You have to seII his ass on it?

122
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:47,016
- l really want us to be together.
- We're in the middle of a big run.

123
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:52,498
lt's been crazy. We go back out
later. l don't think l can make it.

124
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:57,264
Will you try? For me, please?

125
00:17:57,425 --> 00:18:00,815
Yeah, l'll try, but ... Listen.

126
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:06,935
If I don't make it up, go ahead.
Have a reaIIy great time.

127
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:10,654
Ray, for me, try, please.

128
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:14,380
- l really miss you.
- l miss you, too.

129
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:17,298
Okay.

130
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:20,298
Bye.

131
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:29,820
Dude, we haven't caught dick for
days. She asked you to the Bahamas.

132
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,864
Fuck it, man. You've got to go.
l'll ride up with you.

133
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:37,853
- Yeah. Stupid ...
- Yeah, stupid.

134
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:41,740
What were you thinking, man?

135
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:46,057
l'll show you
what l've been thinking.

136
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:54,697
Whoa, Ray. Damn. Thanks, but l'll
need some time to think about it.

137
00:18:54,865 --> 00:19:00,622
- Nice fit, huh?
- l'll call and tell her l'm coming.

138
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:03,982
No, surprise her. She'll be psyched.

139
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:08,855
Yeah. All right, clean up.

140
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:15,060
Will you please forget about Ray?
That boy has got fish on the brains.

141
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:18,535
- Yeah, but ...
- But nothing. Where are we going?

142
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:22,937
- The Bahamas.
- Where are we going ..?

143
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:25,300
The Bahamas!

144
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:37,973
- Try the harmony.
- You try it. l'll lead.

145
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:44,175
- You, lead? You suck.
- Fuck you. l sound just like him.

146
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:51,500
- You don't sound anything like him.
- Are you deaf?

147
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:56,944
l'm quitting this band, man.
l'm going solo.

148
00:19:57,105 --> 00:20:00,495
Oh, shit.

149
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:09,015
- Let's just go on and find a phone.
- No.

150
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:13,383
Come on. The guy looks dead, man.

151
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:16,053
Maybe not.

152
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,462
What are you doing, man?

153
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:36,422
This is fucked up, man.

154
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:57,745
Shit.

155
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:14,662
Shit.

156
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,496
Dave!

157
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:35,658
No!

158
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:14,934
Girl, it's getting down to the wire.

159
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:19,178
He's not coming.
l just thought ...

160
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:25,861
- You left him four messages. Four.
- He said he'd try.

161
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:29,734
Try is like maybe, Julie.
Try is bullshit.

162
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:33,454
- He does work hard.
- My ass ...

163
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:39,461
He's breaking your heart because he
can. l hate to say l told you so.

164
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:42,737
Then don't.

165
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:46,263
Oh, my God.

166
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:50,213
What's happening, lovers?
Are we gonna get tropical?

167
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:57,541
Let me talk to you for a minute ...
What's up, Jules?

168
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:02,142
Julie, l'm really sorry about Will.
But he's my friend, too.

169
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:04,421
My ticket shouldn't go to waste.

170
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:09,858
Where there's a Will, there's a way.
Let's start having fun!

171
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:13,222
ls there a problem?

172
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:17,697
No, there's no problem,
because we're going to the Bahamas.

173
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:23,462
- You're goddamn right.
- Right. We're going to the Bahamas!

174
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:37,661
- l'm in the exit row. Wrong row.
- Are you okay?

175
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:41,534
Yeah, l'm fine.

176
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:45,863
Think of happy memories
from your childhood.

177
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:52,373
And if l don't have any? l can't
relax going 500 miles an hour.

178
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:57,141
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
Planes go down for no reason at all.

179
00:23:57,305 --> 00:24:02,982
- Getting hit by lightning is ...
- Yeah, and planes hit other planes.

180
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:08,014
You're gonna get hit
if you don't quit bitching.

181
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,983
Some folks just can't fly.

182
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:19,138
- l'm the king of the world!
- l'm the king of the world!

183
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:23,736
- Just breathe, Tyrell.
- Get away from me.

184
00:24:23,905 --> 00:24:26,817
lt's not a macho thing. lt's about
equilibrium in your inner ear.

185
00:24:26,985 --> 00:24:33,060
You just have to get used to it.
Some folks just can't sail.

186
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:39,698
And it's the only way on or off the
island, except for the coast guard.

187
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:44,302
- lt looks pretty remote.
- Tourists want sun, sea, solitude.

188
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:49,095
- How much longer?
- A few minutes. Hang in there.

189
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:51,540
Let it out. Just watch the boat.

190
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:20,573
lf there's anything l can do to make
your stay better, please just ask.

191
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:26,455
l'm Darick. l'll be at your service
for the duration of your stay.

192
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:32,257
Old man, l have to work fast.
The season's almost over.

193
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:36,856
With this weather you're already
out of time. Old man, my ass.

194
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:56,224
- Beautiful.
- Look at this.

195
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:04,584
We are here.
We have arrived in paradise!

196
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:15,139
You've got to be shitting me ...
Look at this cat.

197
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:20,055
- Yo, what's up, my brother?
- l think we found your brother.

198
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:23,979
- Your brother.
- You know what l was saying ...

199
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:26,500
Are you looking for some bud?

200
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:30,021
l got some bat guano.
l got the cream jeans.

201
00:26:30,185 --> 00:26:33,063
Anything you need, Titus got.

202
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:39,300
- No, but thank you very much.
- What about the sweet young ladies?

203
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:43,344
- Anything l can do?
- Take a bath.

204
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:46,144
Damn, that's cold, woman. All right.

205
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:50,617
lf you need some weed,
l'll get with you later.

206
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:55,382
- What's up? Looking for the disco?
- Beat it.

207
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:19,265
Hello?

208
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:27,058
- Where is everyone?
- Good question.

209
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:32,262
Excuse me ... Excuse me.

210
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:38,744
l'll scare somebody up. Hello?

211
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:42,136
Yo ..? Shit!

212
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:54,697
- What can l do for you?
- Checking in. Karla Wilson.

213
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:59,939
Oh, yes. Well, let's roll out
the red carpet.

214
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,942
Our contest winners are here.

215
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:06,383
- Last name first. First name last.
- Nice dog you got there, man.

216
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:11,744
- Not really. He eats guys like you.
- You got a problem with something?

217
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:17,457
- l don't have problems, pal.
- This is such a beautiful hotel.

218
00:28:19,185 --> 00:28:23,622
Built in the 1 930's
for one of the Rockefeller clan.

219
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:25,656
There's a lot of history here.
Judy Garland spent the night here.

220
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:29,374
- President Nixon ...
- Okay. We get it. lt's old.

221
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:34,858
lt'll outlive you, l'm sure.
Put that down, please.

222
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:38,335
Sorry.

223
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:45,861
"Wilson" ... comma. "Karla."

224
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:51,744
Oh ... You're in 201 and 202.

225
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:57,218
- ls that a bad thing?
- No, not at all. Not at all.

226
00:28:57,385 --> 00:29:01,742
- Those are our honeymoon suites.
- Your what?

227
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:06,023
l take it
you kids haven't exchanged vows.

228
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:11,305
- We haven't exchanged anything.
- Julie, come on. That'll be fine.

229
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:18,377
Our off-season staff of five
will tend to your every need.

230
00:29:18,545 --> 00:29:23,460
- Did you say off-season?
- lt's the Fourth of July weekend.

231
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:27,374
Storm season begins today
like clockwork.

232
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:30,343
lt's our version of winter.

233
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:37,534
That's 201 and 202. Scrabble
and Parcheesi in the lounge.

234
00:29:37,745 --> 00:29:40,862
Enjoy.

235
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:46,657
Ain't nothing free in this world.
l wanted you to have a great trip.

236
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:51,017
We will. Don't worry about that.
We got the island to ourselves.

237
00:29:51,185 --> 00:29:56,339
- And it's been blue skies all day.
- Guys, this is us. 202.

238
00:29:56,505 --> 00:30:00,896
- The bags.
- 201 and 202.

239
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,977
- Don't use these much.
- Why?

240
00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:08,775
No reason. They're fancy rooms
for kids your age.

241
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:13,382
- We won a competition.
- And what did you have to do?

242
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:17,055
- Guess the capital of Brazil.
- Rio, baby.

243
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:23,374
Good for you, girl. And where
would you like l put your bags?

244
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:28,858
- You can put our stuff back here.
- You promised.

245
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:34,224
- l also promised Tyrell.
- What's up? You're killing me.

246
00:30:34,385 --> 00:30:39,015
l can sleep on the couch so they can
practice that reaI honeymoon.

247
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:43,736
l've been doing this since before
you were a gleam in your dad's eye.

248
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:49,423
- You sure it's cool with you?
- Sure. As long as you don't snore.

249
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:54,056
lf l get out of hand,
you can toss something at me.

250
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,379
- He looks pretty beat up.
- Yeah. But he seems certain.

251
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:11,064
His friend was killed by a Ben
Willis, who had a hook on his hand -

252
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:14,615
- and was driving a BMW.

253
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:19,295
Look, there's no body.
No other vehicle involved.

254
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:26,337
He feel asleep at the wheel, crashed
his truck and fell into a ditch.

255
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:32,780
- He suffered severe head trauma.
- lt'll all come back to him.

256
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:38,455
Doctor, number three just flatlined.

257
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:44,414
Get me some help.
l've got a flatline, room three.

258
00:31:56,825 --> 00:32:00,261
Let's get a couple of drinks.

259
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:03,542
Oh, shit.

260
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:06,697
- This bar is ...
- Empty?

261
00:32:06,865 --> 00:32:11,859
- You boys lost?
- Wow, a human being.

262
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:16,416
- Tell me this isn't the bar scene.
- You want a drink?

263
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:21,415
- We didn't dress up for nothing.
- You're dressed up?

264
00:32:21,585 --> 00:32:27,615
All right, Will, we got a Planter's
Punch, a Singapore Sling ...

265
00:32:27,785 --> 00:32:31,778
How about a Mai-motherfucking-Tai?
Yeah ...

266
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:36,900
How about some lD ..?
l'm kidding.

267
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:42,344
- This place isn't quiet, it's dead.
- Well, it's ...

268
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:46,015
- The last day of the season.
- Why are you still here?

269
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:52,259
That's none
of your goddamn business.

270
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:57,061
- l think l smell man trouble.
- Not anymore.

271
00:32:57,265 --> 00:33:01,702
- Did he dump you?
- No. l shot him.

272
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:09,463
Now, what you boys want
is a Dark and Stormy.

273
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:14,699
A little rum, ginger beer, Tabasco.
lt's good. Trust me.

274
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:18,824
Am l bad? He's kind of cute, right?

275
00:33:18,985 --> 00:33:24,139
- And he has a crush on you. But?
- But l miss Ray.

276
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:28,423
- l really do. l tried to call him.
- Ray made up his own mind.

277
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:34,660
So you're free. For 48 hours, your
smile is a frown turned upside down.

278
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:39,420
- Here comes my baby.
- You like the outfit?

279
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:44,261
No, l love it. Cool bar, right?

280
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:47,701
They all look the same, once you've
worked in one. Right, sister?

281
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:52,939
- You look beautiful.
- l'm Julie. This is Karla.

282
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:57,064
Nancy. Well, welcome to
Tower Bay's most happening hot spot.

283
00:33:57,225 --> 00:34:00,695
Our room is the happening hot spot.

284
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:05,985
- Four Dark and Stormies.
- All right. To a great weekend.

285
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:08,818
Screw the weather.

286
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:14,581
What do you do around here for fun?

287
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:21,617
Make fun of tourists.
Or let them make fun of themselves.

288
00:34:21,785 --> 00:34:25,539
- Karaoke. Perfect.
- That's what l'm talking about.

289
00:34:25,745 --> 00:34:30,500
- Don't even think about it.
- Don't listen to the party-poopers.

290
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:34,055
This is for someone who needs it.

291
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:36,898
- So one single with extra cheese.
- No.

292
00:34:37,105 --> 00:34:40,256
- Yes, Julie.
- No ... No!

293
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:46,062
- What did l say?
- Come on, Julie. Come on ...

294
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:49,985
Julie in the house!

295
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:56,061
Ladies and gentlemen, a round
of applause for my very best friend.

296
00:34:56,225 --> 00:35:01,697
- Julie James!
- Julie in the house. Julie ...

297
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:08,693
- All right ... Thank you, Karla.
- You're welcome.

298
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:19,861
Are you happy?

299
00:35:29,305 --> 00:35:31,978
Hi, Will ...

300
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:45,736
Everyone's a goddamn singer.

301
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:52,737
l don't know the lyrics. Hold on.

302
00:35:57,945 --> 00:36:05,659
lt's him. He did something
to the screen. l swear to God.

303
00:36:05,825 --> 00:36:09,056
- Julie, what's wrong?
- l swear to God, it said ...

304
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:16,861
- Julie, what are you talking about?
- Nothing.

305
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:20,734
Where are you going? Julie?
Shit ...

306
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:19,459
- Oh, my God. Will, l'm so sorry.
- lt's my fault.

307
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:24,455
- l shouldn't have. l didn't think.
- This is so sweet. l'm sorry.

308
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:29,460
- l scared you. l crossed the line.
- You scared me, but l'm on edge.

309
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:33,174
- Sorry.
- Don't apologise. l'm the one ...

310
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:36,894
l understand.

311
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:40,063
l'm just gonna take a walk.

312
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:43,934
Are you sure?

313
00:37:51,465 --> 00:37:56,937
l just really like you a lot.
l want you to have a great time.

314
00:37:57,105 --> 00:38:00,381
l want you to be happy.

315
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:14,813
l'll just grab a few things here.

316
00:38:17,185 --> 00:38:20,495
God, l'm sorry.

317
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:27,417
Sorry.

318
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:38,943
- Bounce, baby.
- You know what?

319
00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:43,621
l've decided
to change my major to finance.

320
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:47,903
And l'm going to Wall Street.
You know why?

321
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:52,536
Because it's the only way l can
afford a big-ass bed like this.

322
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:56,823
Show me some love
on this big-ass bed.

323
00:38:56,985 --> 00:39:01,376
- Oh, a Jacuzzi.
- Come on, let's stay right here.

324
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:08,980
l spent $1 00 on a bathing suit. You
can pull it off, but l'm wearing it.

325
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:12,137
You didn't mention that earlier,
sexy thing.

326
00:40:10,545 --> 00:40:14,584
- You scared the shit out of me!
- You're living your life in fear.

327
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:20,775
lt's time for manhood. There's
a kick-ass party on the mainland.

328
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:25,655
l'm saying we take the boat
and get jiggy with it.

329
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:31,502
l have to tie the boat. There's a
storm coming. Then l'm going to bed.

330
00:40:31,665 --> 00:40:34,975
- And that's it?
- That's all l got for today.

331
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:39,781
- Take the bake elsewhere.
- All right ... Bullshit.

332
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:44,422
You need to take a chill pill.

333
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:48,942
- Have a good time, bro.
- l will, buddy.

334
00:40:57,225 --> 00:41:00,103
Titus!

335
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:04,540
Oh, damn it.

336
00:41:04,705 --> 00:41:08,539
Very funny, asshole.

337
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:14,341
Hey, give me a hand, would you?

338
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:45,697
- Long distance.
- l need an international operator.

339
00:42:15,505 --> 00:42:18,338
Come on!

340
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:38,898
Housekeeping.

341
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:55,022
Housekeeping.

342
00:43:48,305 --> 00:43:53,174
- What, what, what?
- Have you seen my hair tie?

343
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:58,214
l'm sorry, baby. l just
don't want to get my hair wet.

344
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:03,175
l finally got you in this Jacuzzi.
Let's not talk about hair care.

345
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:07,941
- Don't get feisty.
- lt's too late for all that.

346
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:13,378
We're miles away from anybody.
So nobody can hear you scream.

347
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:19,455
l used to be a lifeguard. And please
don't make me blow my whistle.

348
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:25,894
l'd just hate
for you to blow ... your whistle.

349
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:34,100
No water sports after midnight.
Hotel policy.

350
00:44:34,265 --> 00:44:39,578
- What's the policy on burning herb?
- You can't try it till you buy it.

351
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:47,936
What's up? lt's all good.
Believe me, it is all good.

352
00:44:49,465 --> 00:44:52,502
Crazy freak.

353
00:44:56,225 --> 00:44:58,864
Now, where was l?

354
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:09,374
- Hey, guys. lsn't this beautiful?
- Damn.

355
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:13,544
1 0 people on this island,
and they all end up in this Jacuzzi.

356
00:45:13,705 --> 00:45:17,584
- How's the water?
- Crowded.

357
00:45:17,745 --> 00:45:22,819
- How's Julie doing?
- She's up in her room alone.

358
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:27,422
- Any advise?
- Find another Jacuzzi.

359
00:45:27,585 --> 00:45:33,057
You can't give up so easy.
You've got to hang in there.

360
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:36,177
lt's great, isn't it?

361
00:45:36,345 --> 00:45:40,497
l can't win. l can't ...

362
00:45:52,265 --> 00:45:54,904
Will?

363
00:47:09,265 --> 00:47:12,894
Where the hell's my toothbrush?

364
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:26,497
- Hey, l know, l know ...
- Will!

365
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:29,617
Will! lt's happening again.

366
00:48:31,305 --> 00:48:34,183
What happened?

367
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:42,016
l do not find this at all funny.

368
00:48:42,225 --> 00:48:44,739
There was a body. l swear it.

369
00:48:44,905 --> 00:48:49,535
- Maybe you were dreaming.
- l wasn't.

370
00:48:49,705 --> 00:48:53,664
l knew you were gonna be trouble
the moment l laid eyes on you.

371
00:48:53,825 --> 00:48:58,501
- Listen to me. He's here.
- What's going on?

372
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:03,295
Julie says she saw a dead guy in
the closet. All we see is bathrobes.

373
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:09,182
You think this is funny? l'm not
going crazy. He was in there.

374
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:13,224
Oh, yeah? Then where is he now?
Where's the dead guy?

375
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:19,898
- What did you actually see?
- The dockhand hanging by his neck.

376
00:49:20,065 --> 00:49:27,574
Look, tomorrow we'll talk to Darick
and put this whole thing to rest.

377
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:32,739
So let's slow down on the Dark
and Stormies and get some sleep.

378
00:49:32,945 --> 00:49:37,336
- l want off this island.
- That's not possible.

379
00:49:37,505 --> 00:49:41,578
The last ferry left hours ago,
and we have a storm coming.

380
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:48,014
- l'll call the mainland for a boat.
- The phones just went down.

381
00:49:51,785 --> 00:49:54,504
lt's dead.

382
00:49:54,665 --> 00:49:59,944
Listen up. The next couple of days
will be rough, but we'll make it.

383
00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:03,296
- What about a radio?
- Emergencies only.

384
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:08,414
You city kids wouldn't know
a hurricane if it blew up your ass.

385
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:17,940
This is not a drill. All we can do
is batten down and ride it out.

386
00:50:18,105 --> 00:50:22,895
And if it gets really bad,
we have a storm shelter. Goodnight.

387
00:50:48,785 --> 00:50:53,654
Pain of the past, fear
of the future, blood of the young.

388
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:59,661
Pain of the past, fear
of the future, blood of the young.

389
00:50:59,825 --> 00:51:04,182
Pain of the past,
fear of the future ...

390
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:07,178
... blood of the young.

391
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:26,981
Yeah, that's my babies.
You all growed up real good.

392
00:51:39,025 --> 00:51:45,863
Where are you hiding?
Come to Papa, come to Papa ...

393
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:50,018
Yeah, that's it.

394
00:51:50,225 --> 00:51:52,659
Got to find that damn lighter ...

395
00:52:03,585 --> 00:52:07,180
Can l help you?

396
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:10,976
Goddamn it!

397
00:52:14,225 --> 00:52:16,819
Oh, God ...

398
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:23,140
What are you doing? No.
Seriously, don't do that.

399
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:30,178
Oh, God ... Jesus, no!

400
00:52:30,345 --> 00:52:32,620
lt's all good!

401
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:59,185
Can l help you?

402
00:53:08,345 --> 00:53:11,143
- That's a full carat.
- How much?

403
00:53:11,305 --> 00:53:15,264
- She's got some flaws in her.
- How much?

404
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:20,260
l don't have much of a market
for this kind of thing.

405
00:53:20,465 --> 00:53:24,504
- 200. Maybe 250.
- Make it 300.

406
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:29,503
And throw in that, too.

407
00:53:32,145 --> 00:53:37,014
Which one you talking about? You're
crazy. That's worth 300 by itself.

408
00:53:37,185 --> 00:53:42,498
- Then there's the waiting period.
- Keep the ring and give me the gun.

409
00:53:54,505 --> 00:53:58,100
- You sure you want to go this way?
- ls it loaded?

410
00:53:58,265 --> 00:54:00,733
- No.
- Load it.

411
00:54:13,225 --> 00:54:15,659
Get the hell off of me.

412
00:54:17,745 --> 00:54:23,456
Baby, this is bullshit. This ain't
the romantic weekend l had in mind.

413
00:54:23,665 --> 00:54:27,055
Hey, Jules, get any sleep?

414
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:30,183
- Some.
- Look at that.

415
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:36,136
Another beautiful day in paradise
with Julie as our tour director.

416
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:41,584
- Do you see any fresh kill?
- Shut up, Ty.

417
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:45,818
- How about a Freddie or Jason?
- Leave her alone, man.

418
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:52,015
lt's bad enough getting rained out
without having to hold her hand.

419
00:54:52,185 --> 00:54:57,862
- Don't be an asshole about it.
- lt's okay. He doesn't believe me.

420
00:54:58,025 --> 00:55:04,134
- lt's his right. Maybe l am crazy.
- Nobody thinks you're crazy.

421
00:55:04,305 --> 00:55:07,456
- l do.
- Why don't you go do something?

422
00:55:07,665 --> 00:55:11,783
l don't want to do nothing with him.
l want to do something with you.

423
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:19,015
Let's go to the gym and work off
some stress. You're not crazy.

424
00:55:24,585 --> 00:55:30,694
Look, we need to find stoner boy
and get pool sticks or something ...

425
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:34,744
The greenhouse effect
has caused the Gulf Stream to shift.

426
00:55:34,905 --> 00:55:42,175
Experts expect a dramatic increase
of hurricanes, coastal flooding ...

427
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:45,855
lt wouldn't take much
to wipe us off this island.

428
00:55:46,025 --> 00:55:48,619
Shut up, okay? Shut up.

429
00:55:48,785 --> 00:55:51,902
God!

430
00:55:53,465 --> 00:55:56,104
Come on!

431
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:02,023
This is a nice gym.

432
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:09,215
Nice move.

433
00:56:09,385 --> 00:56:13,537
l'm gonna give your fisherman some
of this and see how he likes it.

434
00:56:39,185 --> 00:56:42,621
Oh, poor baby.

435
00:56:42,785 --> 00:56:45,743
You know what? l got a better idea.

436
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:48,942
You're not leaving this island
till you get a tan.

437
00:56:52,585 --> 00:56:57,340
- Wow. Cancer in a box.
- No, this is the safe sun.

438
00:56:57,505 --> 00:57:00,577
lt's better than
a day on the beach, girl.

439
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:07,378
With a little photosynthesis
you'll feel like a new ...

440
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:10,981
- House plant?
- Exactly. Bye.

441
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:53,901
- Sure this is the way to the pool?
- There's his cart.

442
00:57:54,065 --> 00:57:57,535
The fucking idiot
left it in the rain.

443
00:58:31,385 --> 00:58:36,698
Dryer. "Gee, Karla,
that'll break the machine."

444
00:58:36,865 --> 00:58:40,904
Damn. How many pairs are in there?

445
00:58:53,785 --> 00:58:56,583
Hey, pool boy!

446
00:58:57,425 --> 00:59:00,144
Yo, Bob Marley!

447
00:59:00,305 --> 00:59:03,138
You in there or what?

448
00:59:35,065 --> 00:59:37,784
Karla?

449
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:44,103
Karla?

450
01:00:10,225 --> 01:00:12,819
Come on!

451
01:00:25,345 --> 01:00:27,461
Tyrell!

452
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:31,144
You guys, help me!

453
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:39,295
Use this. Just smash it.

454
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:46,501
Come on.

455
01:00:46,705 --> 01:00:51,984
l told you l'm not crazy. He's here.
We've got to call for help.

456
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:56,024
Man, this classifies
as a fucking emergency!

457
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:08,184
Hey, Brooks. Where the fuck you at?
We want off this fucking island.

458
01:01:08,345 --> 01:01:12,657
- Oh, shit.
- We've got to get the fuck out.

459
01:01:19,945 --> 01:01:22,664
Julie!

460
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:35,856
- Where are the boats?
- They were cut loose.

461
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:41,702
- Julie, what the fuck is going on?
- He's gonna kill us one by one.

462
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:45,858
- Who?
- Ben Willis.

463
01:01:46,025 --> 01:01:51,497
- Willis is dead. You killed him.
- They never found the body.

464
01:01:51,665 --> 01:01:58,104
We lied. We hit him with our car
and threw his body in the water.

465
01:01:58,265 --> 01:02:02,383
Only he didn't die. Last Fourth
of July he killed Barry and Helen.

466
01:02:02,545 --> 01:02:05,981
l thought Ray and l killed him,
but we didn't.

467
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:10,024
- He's back to finish it off!
- We're in the middle of nowhere.

468
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:14,662
There's dead bodies piling up
and there's only one guy missing.

469
01:02:14,825 --> 01:02:19,421
- The porter. What's his name?
- Estes. The fucker knows something.

470
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:24,101
We can sit here like assholes
or go find him first.

471
01:02:24,265 --> 01:02:28,178
- lt's not him.
- We have to do something.

472
01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:32,584
l'm with him.

473
01:02:33,505 --> 01:02:36,338
Come on.

474
01:02:36,505 --> 01:02:40,896
How can you not tell me the whole
story? l'm your best friend!

475
01:02:41,065 --> 01:02:46,583
- l didn't want to involve anybody.
- Well, it's too late for that now.

476
01:02:47,745 --> 01:02:51,294
Come on, let's go!

477
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,265
Hey, Estes. You sick bastard,
are you in here?

478
01:03:45,265 --> 01:03:49,781
Hey, Estes. You sick bastard,
are you in here?

479
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:54,897
You hear me? Sick mother ...

480
01:03:56,305 --> 01:04:00,901
- He's not here, man.
- There's some crazy shit in here.

481
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:12,858
No doubt.
This is our fucking killer.

482
01:04:13,025 --> 01:04:16,415
This is our fucking guy.

483
01:04:39,665 --> 01:04:41,940
You guys.

484
01:04:49,305 --> 01:04:51,865
Shit.

485
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:56,063
Fuck.

486
01:05:01,185 --> 01:05:04,461
- Anyone missing a hair tie?
- Shit. That's mine.

487
01:05:07,225 --> 01:05:10,376
What about a toothbrush?

488
01:05:17,465 --> 01:05:20,662
Voodoo.

489
01:05:20,825 --> 01:05:26,457
We need flashlights, guns, whatever
we need to get off this island.

490
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:32,222
- What if he's down there?
- Let's just get the fuck out.

491
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:38,415
- You wait here.
- lt's safer up here.

492
01:05:38,585 --> 01:05:42,339
l'll just be a second.

493
01:05:59,785 --> 01:06:02,982
Julie, where are you going?

494
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:13,454
What the hell was that?

495
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:18,016
Shit. Julie?

496
01:06:48,585 --> 01:06:53,705
- Brazilia.
- Julie, watch out!

497
01:06:55,585 --> 01:07:00,136
That's the capital of Brazil.
Not Rio.

498
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:07,463
No, guys! Leave him alone!

499
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:11,738
- This is the killer.
- We've seen the voodoo stuff.

500
01:07:11,905 --> 01:07:17,343
l found the bodies this morning.
l tried the radio, it was destroyed.

501
01:07:17,505 --> 01:07:22,101
- Leave him alone. l believe him.
- l haven't hurt anyone.

502
01:07:22,265 --> 01:07:26,304
l stole those things to protect you.

503
01:07:26,465 --> 01:07:32,415
He could have killed me, but didn't.
We didn't answer the question right.

504
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:37,062
This whole thing was a set-up.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil.

505
01:07:37,265 --> 01:07:39,540
Sorry. We lose.

506
01:07:39,705 --> 01:07:43,380
- So where's this Ben Willis guy?
- l don't know.

507
01:07:43,545 --> 01:07:49,541
You never know. How do we know
you didn't set this whole thing up?

508
01:07:49,745 --> 01:07:54,739
- How do we know you didn't?
- l know who you're talking about.

509
01:07:56,425 --> 01:08:03,536
He used to work here. l've seen
him by the orchard. l'll show you.

510
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:09,177
- He could be setting us up.
- l'm not staying here.

511
01:08:09,345 --> 01:08:13,816
We're better off in the open. Maybe
we can kill this asshole for good.

512
01:08:15,985 --> 01:08:18,499
Show us.

513
01:08:35,385 --> 01:08:38,536
What the hell ..?

514
01:08:39,705 --> 01:08:43,493
- l need to get to Tower Bay lsland.
- We're closed.

515
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:46,259
l need to get to that island now.

516
01:08:46,425 --> 01:08:52,341
Let me ask you, did you happen
to see what it's like outside?

517
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:58,740
l'm not looking for a weather
report. So which boat is yours?

518
01:08:58,905 --> 01:09:02,181
He worked here for many years.

519
01:09:02,345 --> 01:09:05,735
Raised a family. Pretty wife.

520
01:09:05,905 --> 01:09:08,897
Two little ones. A boy and a girl.

521
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:12,023
One day the wife went missing.

522
01:09:12,185 --> 01:09:17,213
The maid found blood
all over the honeymoon suite. 201 .

523
01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:21,862
Eventually they found the body.
Pieces of it, at least.

524
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:24,977
People say she was cheating on him.

525
01:09:25,145 --> 01:09:29,502
People say he would beat her.
People say a lot of things.

526
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:34,659
He disappeared. Children, too.

527
01:09:34,825 --> 01:09:39,979
- Now he's back.
- Julie, be careful.

528
01:09:40,145 --> 01:09:43,501
l've got to see.

529
01:10:08,585 --> 01:10:13,534
- What's today's date?
- July fourth.

530
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:26,183
l'm not gonna die on this island.
Do you hear me? l'm right here.

531
01:10:26,345 --> 01:10:30,975
- But my grave stays empty!
- This is crazy.

532
01:10:31,145 --> 01:10:36,265
- No phones, no boats, no way out.
- Yeah? Then we fight.

533
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:40,140
- Where did Estes go?
- Why? He can't help us anyway.

534
01:10:40,305 --> 01:10:46,335
- Only he can. l'll find him.
- Are you gonna leave us here?

535
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:52,336
- lt's okay. He can't have gone far.
- Meet us back at the hotel, okay?

536
01:10:52,505 --> 01:10:56,896
Okay? Come on, let's go.

537
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:27,061
What l need is a gun, not a knife.
But fuck it.

538
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:32,063
What are you gonna do with those?
Butter him?

539
01:11:32,225 --> 01:11:36,138
Clean vegetables? Take this.

540
01:11:37,745 --> 01:11:40,976
- You ready?
- Yeah.

541
01:11:43,665 --> 01:11:47,419
Shit ... Hey, are you okay?

542
01:11:47,585 --> 01:11:50,463
We're gonna get this fucker, right?

543
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:56,461
- Right? Let's head to the pantry.
- Why? ls that a good place to hide?

544
01:11:56,625 --> 01:12:00,061
l don't know.
l'm just fucking hungry.

545
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:07,143
Estes, where did you go?
You said you were gonna help us.

546
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:14,301
You should have told us
you had a boat.

547
01:12:14,465 --> 01:12:18,617
- We're not going anywhere.
- What?

548
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:33,176
- Baby, don't go in here.
- lt's only food. Don't worry, baby.

549
01:12:39,345 --> 01:12:44,578
Stop trying to act
like you ain't hungry.

550
01:13:12,105 --> 01:13:15,256
lt's just a stupid rat.

551
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:18,497
No, Nancy!

552
01:13:35,025 --> 01:13:40,099
Come in. Come in!
Come on ...

553
01:13:41,305 --> 01:13:45,378
The Arcadian requests emergency
assistance for Tower Bay lsland.

554
01:13:45,585 --> 01:13:50,056
l repeat, this is the Arcadian
requesting emergency assistance.

555
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:03,584
So that's where
the flashlights were.

556
01:14:03,745 --> 01:14:08,341
- Sorry, but it could have been you.
- Or you, you crazy bitch.

557
01:14:08,505 --> 01:14:13,021
- You broke into my hiding place.
- Sorry, l missed the sign.

558
01:14:13,185 --> 01:14:18,020
This place didn't have a murder rate
till you people showed up.

559
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:27,145
- l never saw a dead body before.
- Get used to it.

560
01:14:27,345 --> 01:14:30,655
- Who's doing this?
- Here we go.

561
01:14:30,865 --> 01:14:36,144
Don't get her started. lt's a long,
fucked-up story you won't believe.

562
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:42,938
This is the worst vacation in my
life. l'm tired, hungry and horny.

563
01:14:43,105 --> 01:14:47,781
And personally, l haven't seen
one goddamn psycho killer.

564
01:15:00,425 --> 01:15:05,374
Come on! l know where we can hide.
Come on!

565
01:15:23,345 --> 01:15:26,303
Karla, come on!

566
01:15:41,385 --> 01:15:44,582
Karla!

567
01:15:47,705 --> 01:15:50,538
Shit ... lt won't lock!

568
01:15:54,065 --> 01:15:57,421
Follow me. Stay on the beams.

569
01:16:07,345 --> 01:16:09,905
Jesus Christ, that's my bedroom.

570
01:16:19,345 --> 01:16:22,382
Come on, give me your hand.
Come on!

571
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:26,379
Come on ... Come on!

572
01:16:29,225 --> 01:16:32,581
You sick freak!

573
01:16:32,785 --> 01:16:35,504
Come on!

574
01:16:40,985 --> 01:16:44,261
Karla!

575
01:16:49,665 --> 01:16:52,020
Karla!

576
01:16:52,185 --> 01:16:55,416
Shit, shit ...

577
01:17:06,865 --> 01:17:11,302
- We've got to do something.
- She'll never make it. Come on.

578
01:17:11,505 --> 01:17:13,860
Get off me!

579
01:17:14,025 --> 01:17:16,300
Oh, shit.

580
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:23,302
Oh, shit.

581
01:18:50,945 --> 01:18:54,301
Damn, it's locked.

582
01:18:55,345 --> 01:19:01,022
- Are you okay?
- l'll live. lt's locked.

583
01:19:01,185 --> 01:19:04,780
- We've got to open the door.
- We'll get you out. l promise.

584
01:19:10,425 --> 01:19:13,701
Karla!

585
01:19:17,665 --> 01:19:20,896
Shit ... Come on, Nancy.

586
01:19:30,705 --> 01:19:33,583
Come on, open the door.

587
01:19:34,945 --> 01:19:40,258
- l can't find it.
- Get out of the way.

588
01:19:41,585 --> 01:19:45,180
Get out of the way!

589
01:19:50,825 --> 01:19:54,022
Karla, come on!

590
01:20:06,225 --> 01:20:11,094
- Where are we going?
- The storm shelter!

591
01:20:20,265 --> 01:20:25,020
Don't worry. l know there's
emergency power here somewhere.

592
01:20:26,225 --> 01:20:30,184
- Hey, Julie?
- Just grab hold of my hand.

593
01:20:30,385 --> 01:20:34,936
- Just grab hold of my hand.
- l am holding your hand.

594
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:39,936
No, you're not.

595
01:20:57,425 --> 01:21:00,303
- Are you okay?
- lt's Will!

596
01:21:00,465 --> 01:21:04,981
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.

597
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:15,301
Everything is gonna be okay.
Just get inside. Estes attacked me.

598
01:21:15,505 --> 01:21:20,579
- You think he's a part of this?
- l don't know. Let's get inside.

599
01:21:20,785 --> 01:21:26,815
- l don't think we should go inside.
- The slicker guy was on the beach.

600
01:21:36,145 --> 01:21:39,217
Jesus, you're bleeding to death.
We need a first-aid kit.

601
01:21:39,385 --> 01:21:44,095
- l think there's one in the lobby.
- All right, just sit there.

602
01:21:44,305 --> 01:21:51,177
- Don't worry. He's gone. Just go.
- Look, l'll go with you. Come on.

603
01:21:52,945 --> 01:21:55,334
Listen, Will. You're gonna be okay.

604
01:21:55,505 --> 01:21:59,020
Jesus, there's blood everywhere.

605
01:22:01,705 --> 01:22:03,855
l can't find a wound.

606
01:22:04,025 --> 01:22:08,177
That's because it's not my blood.

607
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:12,495
What?

608
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:17,304
lt's not my blood, Julie.

609
01:22:32,105 --> 01:22:36,144
What's your favourite radio station?

610
01:22:40,545 --> 01:22:45,539
What's your favourite radio station?
96.7.

611
01:22:45,705 --> 01:22:49,698
lt's time for you to contemplate
the ultimate getaway.

612
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:06,940
Here, take that. Come on ...

613
01:23:11,065 --> 01:23:13,863
Estes ...

614
01:23:14,585 --> 01:23:17,099
Fuck.

615
01:23:19,985 --> 01:23:21,896
Get off me!

616
01:23:22,065 --> 01:23:24,863
Get up ...

617
01:23:26,025 --> 01:23:29,620
God, no!

618
01:23:51,665 --> 01:23:55,294
We finally get to spend
some quality time together.

619
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:59,174
- Why are you doing this to me?
- lt's always about you.

620
01:23:59,345 --> 01:24:04,783
"l have bad dreams. l can't sleep.
l have trouble with my boyfriend."

621
01:24:04,945 --> 01:24:11,259
You never take responsibility for
anything you do. Not even murder.

622
01:24:15,265 --> 01:24:19,781
What did you do that for?
You're a bitch.

623
01:24:22,425 --> 01:24:27,135
- That's gonna leave a mark.
- Tell me why.

624
01:24:27,305 --> 01:24:31,298
Come on, think. You'll get it.
Will Benson.

625
01:24:33,585 --> 01:24:36,736
Ben's son.

626
01:24:38,105 --> 01:24:40,494
Hi, Dad.

627
01:24:50,545 --> 01:24:56,939
Hush, now. No more screaming.
No more running. lt's time to die.

628
01:24:57,105 --> 01:25:01,144
Let her go ... Let her go.

629
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:04,297
You've got to be shitting me!

630
01:25:04,465 --> 01:25:10,256
- What will you do? Call us names?
- Let her go now!

631
01:25:10,425 --> 01:25:14,543
Think about it, boy.
You're no killer. That's my job.

632
01:25:17,665 --> 01:25:21,544
You don't have it in you.

633
01:25:52,505 --> 01:25:58,819
Sure did miss you down here, Ray.
Too bad. We could have been friends.

634
01:25:58,985 --> 01:26:04,184
Really, man.
l would have shared her with you.

635
01:26:08,945 --> 01:26:12,335
Come on, Ray. Stay with me.
You see that?

636
01:26:12,505 --> 01:26:17,135
l want you to think about all
the things we're gonna do to her.

637
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:23,422
- You want him, Dad?
- Stand him up.

638
01:26:58,545 --> 01:27:02,299
Just ... fucking ... die!

639
01:28:02,425 --> 01:28:05,781
This is the Coast Guard.
Remain where you are.

640
01:28:05,945 --> 01:28:10,018
The rescue team
wiII be with you shortIy.

641
01:28:10,705 --> 01:28:12,935
Julie ...

642
01:28:17,105 --> 01:28:21,701
Karla ... God, l thought
l would never see you again.

643
01:28:21,865 --> 01:28:25,983
Girl, you don't have to worry
about me. l'm made of steel.

644
01:28:29,985 --> 01:28:34,501
- Good old Ray.
- Hey, Karla.

645
01:28:38,185 --> 01:28:42,463
lf anyone asks, let's not tell them
it rained the whole time.

646
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:47,779
- lt'll be our little secret.
- Yeah.

647
01:29:29,225 --> 01:29:34,618
l almost fell asleep on the couch.
You didn't tell me how late it was.

648
01:29:36,505 --> 01:29:39,497
- Were you checking the locks again?
- You know me too well.

649
01:29:41,265 --> 01:29:45,224
Don't you dare go to sleep, girl.

650
01:30:33,585 --> 01:30:36,782
