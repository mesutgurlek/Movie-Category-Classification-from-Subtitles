1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,780
We will now begin the 57th
expedition beyond the walls!

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,720
Onward!

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,429
The Survey Corps left to find a route to
Zhiganshina, but encountered a Female Titan,

4
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:21,667
a transformed human like Eren.

5
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,770
That's no Aberrant.

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,898
It's a human in the body of a Titan!

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,530
As soldiers died, one after the next,

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,545
they headed into a
forest of giant trees,

9
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:49,338
none of them knowing why.

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,930
If Squad Levi doesn't
defeat it, who will?

11
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,560
Choose.

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,810
Believe in yourself.

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,890
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.

14
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,940
I'll go forward!

15
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,150
Fire!

16
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,280
Oh, right...

17
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,720
I wanted to ask you something.

18
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,250
Is it okay if we cut off
your hands and legs?

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,850
They'll grow back, right?

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,050
I'm talking about <i>your</i>
limbs, not the Titan's.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,350
We need you alive, after all...

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,490
The enemy was willing
to sacrifice everything.

23
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,490
I didn't expect the enemy to destroy
itself along with the evidence

24
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,430
by making Titans devour itself.

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,600
Retreat, men!

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,060
Back into formation!

27
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,130
Return to Karanes!

28
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,880
Erwin...

29
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Why did you order Levi to resupply?

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,970
There's no time to waste.

31
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,170
The Female Titan was eaten.

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,870
But did you see the
person inside get eaten?

33
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,010
I didn't.

34
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,040
You can't mean...

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,810
Yes...

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,650
If your original hypothesis was correct,

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,670
and they can still move to a degree
after regaining human form...

38
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,910
And if they'd equipped
Maneuver Gear in advance...

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,710
The one within the Female Titan
is wearing our uniform right now.

40
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,420
Captain Levi?

41
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,950
No, it's not!

42
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,630
Who are you?!

43
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,840
Gunther!

44
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,600
The enemy is now camouflaged
as one of our men.

Crushing Blow
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (5)

47
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:52,861
When the Colossal Titan vanished,

48
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,090
whoever was inside had been
wearing Maneuver Gear,

49
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,670
so that they could escape in the steam.

50
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,050
Don't you think the same
possibility applies here?

51
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,800
But at the time...

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,010
Based on what we saw when Eren
emerged from the Titan,

53
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,600
we concluded it would be impossible.

54
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,390
His equipment was destroyed,
and his uniform was gone.

55
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,350
Above all, Eren was so weak,
he couldn't even stand unassisted.

56
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,640
The Female Titan was able to
attract other Titans with its cry.

57
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,700
We failed to predict this,
and the operation failed.

58
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,200
If Titan abilities vary
depending on skill,

59
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,110
it was a mistake to use Eren, a total
novice, as the basis for our assumptions.

60
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,860
If we are to outwit our enemy,
we'll need to think outside the box.

61
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,260
If we're withdrawing, does that
mean the mission succeeded?

62
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,370
If so, then we may already know who
was inside the Female Titan.

63
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,100
I'd like to see who it is...

64
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,960
But why was the Commander so sure

65
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,480
that the enemy would come after
Eren if he left the walls?

66
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,530
I think it's because, for some reason,

67
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,140
they suddenly stopped their advance
in the midst of the last assault.

68
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,200
Even though they managed
to break through Trost's gate,

69
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,870
they didn't even try for the inner gate.

70
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,040
And when Eren sealed
the gate, they let him.

71
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,690
It could mean that they now
have bigger concerns...

72
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,680
Bigger concerns?

73
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,720
Something more important to
them than breaching the walls.

74
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,470
Something unexpected that happened.

75
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,560
Eren's transformation into a Titan?!

76
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,270
I think it's the only answer.

77
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,030
Then... That means...

78
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,190
Wait... So...

79
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,360
Someone who was there,
who saw Eren transform,

80
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,740
is the Titan.

81
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,830
Gunther!

82
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,950
Eren, don't stop!

83
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,210
Onward!

84
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,210
But Gunther...

85
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,500
Who's there?

86
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,550
Protect Eren!

87
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,380
Damn it, what do we do?

88
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,340
Eldo, where should we go?

89
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,300
There isn't time to reach the horses!

90
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,260
Head for HQ, as fast as you can!

91
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,610
Is it from the Female Titan?
Or is there more than one?

92
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,400
Damn you...

93
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,480
How dare you?!

94
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,320
Come at me!

95
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,860
I'll defeat you, even if it kills me!

96
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,570
The Female Titan?

97
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,450
Impossible... Why?

98
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,870
Didn't we catch it?!

99
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,460
If the enemy has some way
to retain its strength,

100
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,180
it may be able to transform once more.

101
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,890
I knew it...

102
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,890
It's coming!

103
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,020
The Female Titan!

104
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,320
Damn you...

105
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
How dare you!

106
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,740
This time, I will defeat it!

107
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,530
No!

108
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,660
The three of us will
kill the Female Titan.

109
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,790
You will continue to head
straight for HQ at top speed!

110
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,590
Here's what I have gleaned
from this battle...

111
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,900
If we only focus on
making the best moves,

112
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,550
we will never get the
better of our opponent.

113
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,840
When necessary, we must be
willing to take big risks,

114
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,720
and be prepared to lose everything.

115
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,480
I'll fight, too!

116
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,230
No!

117
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,310
This is the best move...

118
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,480
Your power is too risky!

119
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,020
What? Do you doubt us?

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,840
Do you, Eren?

121
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,570
Do you find it that hard to trust us?

122
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,870
Unless we change how we fight,

123
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,020
humanity cannot win!

124
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,140
I believe my squad will be victorious.

125
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,880
Good luck!

126
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,410
We took its sight.

127
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,080
For at least a minute,
it'll be in total darkness!

128
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,330
Kill it during this time!

129
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,670
Screw capturing it...

130
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,460
Kill it now!

131
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,750
Die here without honor!

132
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,500
Make that bitch of a Titan pay!

133
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,430
We won't let your eyes regenerate!

134
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,070
We'll shear off so much muscle
around your shoulders,

135
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,650
you won't be able to keep your arms up!

136
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Shear it off...

137
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,500
Make its arms...

138
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,660
fall!

139
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,830
They're down!

140
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,500
Now the neck!

141
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,220
Shear off the muscles
that support its neck!

142
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,880
And we can strike its weak point!

143
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,180
They're so strong.

144
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,390
The Female Titan is
totally on the defensive.

145
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,060
How can they launch co-op attacks like that
without even speaking to each other?

146
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,680
I bet it's only possible because
they believe in one another.

147
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,720
They've overcome many
hardships that way.

148
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,570
That's why they're so strong,
even right after losing Gunther.

149
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll go forward...

150
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,190
If I go forward and believe in them,
without turning back, then...

151
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,900
I'm sure that's the right answer.

152
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,970
I finally understand!

153
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,340
I don't know...

154
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,690
I never have.

155
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,100
I can believe in my own abilities

156
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,270
or the choices of companions I trust.

157
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,230
But no one ever knows
how it will turn out.

158
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,360
Strike the neck, now!

159
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,460
Eldo!

160
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,710
H-How?

161
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,670
It can't possibly see!

162
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,840
It hasn't even been thirty seconds...

163
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,890
Only one eye?

164
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,840
It prioritized one eye
to accelerate the healing...

165
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,180
Is that even possible?

166
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,930
Petra!

167
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,390
We need to regroup!

168
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,230
Petra, now!

169
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,950
Hey...

170
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,530
Die!

171
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,750
How?

172
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,750
My blade can't pierce it...

173
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,520
I...

174
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,770
I will...

175
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
I'll kill it!

176
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,010
Eren?

177
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,090
Wait, what? Mikasa?

178
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,420
That voice... Don't tell me...

179
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,883
I made the wrong choice...

180
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,490
I wanted to believe in my companions...

181
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,710
Because of that, everyone died!

182
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,960
If I had believed in myself
from the start and fought...

183
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,800
If I'd only killed it at the beginning!

184
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,320
Back then,

185
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,390
if I'd turned into a Titan...

186
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,530
No...

187
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,910
If I'd fought

188
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,950
even before that...

189
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
Captain Levi was there, too.

190
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,830
We would have won.

191
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,590
Maybe we could've captured it.

192
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,710
You aren't wrong.

193
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,930
lf you want to, do it.

194
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,380
I...

195
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,600
I made a choice.

196
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,070
And it killed everyone.

197
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,230
It's my fault they died.

198
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,820
But despite all that...

199
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,120
It's still your fault!

200
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,340
I'll tear you apart...

201
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,380
Once my hand heals,

202
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,640
I'll rip you apart...
Tear you to shreds...

203
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,180
Rip you into tiny pieces...

204
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,390
And eat you!

205
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,220
Eren!

206
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,430
W-Wait... Eren...

207
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,810
Don't go...

208
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,770
Give...

209
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,600
Give...

210
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,560
Give Eren back!

211
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,420
Give him back!

212
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,730
Give him back!

213
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,060
Why won't my blade penetrate?

214
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,710
I know that

215
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,060
he's alive...

216
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,860
I know that Eren's alive!

217
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,030
No matter where she goes, I'll kill her,

218
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,450
rip her apart,

219
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,790
and get you out of that filth.

220
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm sorry, Eren...

221
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,380
Just wait a little longer...

222
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,840
Wait!

223
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,760
Wh-What are you...

224
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,570
Fall back for now.

225
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,210
Maintain this distance.

226
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,420
It may be tired.

227
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,680
It does not appear to
be going very fast.

228
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,950
He seems to have been bit
right out of the neck.

229
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,950
Is Eren dead?

230
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,590
"Eren is alive."

231
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,340
"Give Eren back."

232
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,540
The Female Titan took Eren from
Mikasa before her very eyes.

233
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,820
Mikasa joins forces with humanity's
strongest fighter, Levi,

234
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,910
to challenge the Female Titan to battle.

235
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:13,910

57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (6)
