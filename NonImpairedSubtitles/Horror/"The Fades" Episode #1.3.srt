1
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:05,759
I'm gonna quite like this bit.
Previously at.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,210
The Fades are walking the earth,
they can't touch, they're angry,

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,739
They're eating flesh to fight back,
flesh allows them to touch.

4
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:15,078
I know, so far, so Pac-Man.

5
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:18,068
Then there's guys with superpowers,
called the Angelics.

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,825
They're thinking they need to stop
these dead people.

7
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,296
Particularly Neil and his friend, Helen,

8
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:28,216
who is a dead sort of Fade-like ghost
too, but she's on our side.

9
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:31,656
Anyway, Paul, my best friend,
has found that he's an Angelic.

10
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:35,616
He has violent dreams and is surprisingly
powerful for one so small-shouldered.

11
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:40,166
Paul has been getting it on with a girl,
which is extraordinary in and of itself.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,296
But you probably have to know
him to understand that.

13
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:44,896
Now, who's nicked my Twilight box set?

14
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:18,166
controle en sync: minouhse
www. bierdopje. com

15
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:20,386
One, two, three...

16
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:24,286
You lose.

17
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,905
That's my last sock.

18
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,586
One, two, three...

19
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:47,066
Are we still playing?

20
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:50,746
You need to say,
'One, two, three,' then.

21
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,466
I was getting round to that.

22
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:58,376
Don't stare.
It's rude.

23
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:01,145
And, you know...
perverted.

24
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:08,266
One, two, three...

25
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:13,452
You're really good at this.
- Put some practice in.

26
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:23,900
No more scissors, paper, stone, OK?

27
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:27,936
No more paper, scissors, stone.

28
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:29,845
You can just...

29
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:32,466
tell me what you want me to take off next.

30
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:38,066
Or...
I can guess.

31
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:41,080
Do you want me to guess?

32
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:45,866
You should probably...
guess.

33
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,526
OK, then.

34
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,585
It's worse than I thought.

35
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:30,426
Where's my phone?

36
00:03:31,506 --> 00:03:33,066
Calling him again?

37
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:37,777
He's not been answering.

38
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:41,136
Paul promised me,
if I stopped following him,

39
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:42,816
he'd stay in touch.

40
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,185
Kids get busy.
- Yeah, well, this kid shouldn't.

41
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:51,666
This kid's important.
- So you keep saying.

42
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:55,786
We could take that to a hospital, you know.

43
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,086
I've never needed to go to a hospital before.
- You've always had me before.

44
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:07,866
In a few days' time, I'm going to
ascend, Neil, and I want you...

45
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:11,425
I need you to be ready for what's ahead.

46
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:14,166
I'm ready.
- You've got to be strong.

47
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,945
I know.
- You can't do it alone.

48
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:22,346
So, call them. The other Angelics.
- I will call 'em.

49
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,085
I don't want to,

50
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:29,066
but I will.

51
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:33,225
Besides...

52
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:36,186
I think they'd be fascinated
to meet the kid.

53
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,145
I know I am.

54
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:47,776
Sorry.
- Why?

55
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,416
No, er, not sorry.
Thanks.

56
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:53,145
You're not spectacularly late.

57
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:55,270
Sorry was the wrong word.

58
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:59,065
I can't stay. I just...
I wanted to say thanks.

59
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,805
Thanks for what?

60
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,056
For...

61
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:05,976
No, this was much easier in my head.

62
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:08,377
I'm cured. I wanted to say thanks
for curing me.

63
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:12,545
OK, that's interesting.
Cured of what?

64
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:15,936
Whatever. Does it matter?

65
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:18,536
I'm done. I'm too busy for this.

66
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:21,506
I've got two lives to lead,
so I'm thanking you for your time.

67
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:25,086
OK, I understand now.

68
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,466
You're cured.

69
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:32,136
Call it what you want. I'm...

70
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:34,656
I don't need you any more.

71
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:36,586
Right, course you don't.

72
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,456
I need to go cos I've got someone to meet.

73
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,066
Yeah. Good luck, Paul.

74
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,805
Good luck?

75
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:50,986
Yes. Good luck.

76
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:08,866
You're late.

77
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:12,576
I know.
- What kept you?

78
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:16,105
Therapy.
I was with my therapist.

79
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,385
My ex-therapist.

80
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:22,146
Anything to be frightened of?

81
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:27,986
I grow wings when I ejaculate.

82
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:32,826
You know, that's quite a good line for you.

83
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:56,856
Have you seen what they're saying?
- Yes, sir.

84
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,376
Yeah, I'm looking at it now, sir.
- Post?

85
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:03,045
They're blaming us for this, you know?
- Yeah, I don't think we're culpable.

86
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,816
No, we can only investigate when...

87
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,713
Since when have you been
interested in post?

88
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,395
Mum's not answering my calls.

89
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:13,056
Get the statement.
You need to stamp on these questions now.

90
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:14,457
Nothing else? Is this everything?

91
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:17,176
If you let me speak, sir...
- Get out there, in the public eye.

92
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:19,455
Stop pottering about...
- Yeah, if you let me sp...

93
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:20,855
Questions have started to be asked...

94
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:22,786
Any investigation in the way
I've handled this case will...

95
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:29,506
No, I do fully understand...

96
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,505
Hi, it's Paul. Leave a message.

97
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,536
Hi, it's me.

98
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:43,356
Er, jus-s-s-st...

99
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:47,145
Nothing important.
It'd be good to see you, Paul.

100
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:00,780
Right, just...

101
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:03,771
Detective Chief Inspector.

102
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:07,376
Now you're following me to my house?
- If you'll just listen...

103
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:09,257
Don't come to my house.
- Just listen.

104
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:10,745
Never come to my house.

105
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:14,625
You have to look into Neil Valentine.
Look at this photo.

106
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,616
He was sleeping with my wife,
I was sure of that,

107
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,943
but I didn't know
how long he'd known her for.

108
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:21,785
Listen.

109
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:24,656
This mental hospital,
it's key to the whole thing.

110
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:26,255
He probably had something to do
with the boys too.

111
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,797
I've seen him with one of my students,
and the missing vicar, Helen,

112
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:32,546
she was my wife's best friend
so he knew her as well, so...

113
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:36,206
Listen to me.

114
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:42,906
Desperate men do desperate things,
so I'll forgive you this one.

115
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,606
You need to take your hands off me.
Right now.

116
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:52,846
Thank you.

117
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:05,217
You're his son?

118
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,946
Never was good at making
parents' evening, my dad.

119
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,966
He needs to listen to me.

120
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:15,306
Join the club.
He needs to listen to me too.

121
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,106
If you're never going to answer
your phone, then you can,

122
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,426
Just answer your phone, will you?

123
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:29,426
I thought you hated this place.

124
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,525
I know this place.
Nowhere's safe any more.

125
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:37,336
Better to be a place that you know.

126
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:40,306
We'll search it properly.
Make it ours.

127
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:49,853
I should be a dead man, Helen.
They were all over me.

128
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,306
Like flies around shit.

129
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:58,226
So we don't know what he is,
we don't know where he is,

130
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:02,945
we don't know what his plans are.
- Apart from killing our people.

131
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,216
Helen...

132
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,826
there's someone here.

133
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:10,185
You reconsidered?
You're here to help?

134
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,765
So, it's Mark again?

135
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:19,296
He used to be your friend.
- He still is my friend.

136
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:21,936
I used to be someone you cared about.

137
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:24,576
You still are someone I care about.

138
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:27,656
Just tell him that I'm here
and that I love him.

139
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:29,856
That's not too much to ask.

140
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,786
How do you think that's going to
make his life better in any way?

141
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,866
Never did understand love, did you?

142
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:43,186
It's interesting
she can still make you do that.

143
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:48,899
Do what?
- You're right, Neil.

144
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:51,266
She's wrong.

145
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,965
Twilight.

146
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,945
Twiglet?

147
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:02,345
Twilight is my favourite film.

148
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:05,524
Of all the films in the world
and you pick Twiglets?

149
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:08,216
Which one?
You can't say all of them.

150
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:09,865
Would you separate Star Wars?

151
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,817
Look, there's things in
them I like, admire even.

152
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:17,576
But as Mac says, there's a huge flaw.
The Cullens shouldn't be going to school.

153
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:20,736
I mean, A,
the film goes out of its way to show

154
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:23,656
that Edward has graduated from
dozens of high schools, you know,

155
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:26,656
caps on the wall, so it's not like
he needs to be there for academic reasons,

156
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:30,016
and...
- I have only actually watched these films once.

157
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,346
I just said them because...

158
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:40,536
And B, they clearly cast an actor
who needs to shave twice a day,

159
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,433
so it's not like they'd struggle to
lie to the authorities.

160
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:46,390
And C, which is
it's the most important one, is

161
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:48,906
Jasper's...

162
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:54,176
You know, when you kiss me, I
completely lose my thought... brain.

163
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,726
'Thought brain?

164
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:58,696
A brain you have thoughts in?

165
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:00,256
The thing is, Paul,

166
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:03,256
I don't really care about films.

167
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:06,536
You don't care about films?

168
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:10,636
Any films?

169
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,226
It's fair enough.

170
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,466
You and Jay?

171
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:32,576
Jay and you.
You're pathetic.

172
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:36,616
My brother?
My sad, twisted,

173
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,456
lonely brother?

174
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:41,096
My fucking twin?
You might was well be kissing me.

175
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,946
Only not kissing me.
Kissing the worst part of me.

176
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:50,576
Kissing my arse.
My ugly arse of a brother.

177
00:13:57,743 --> 00:14:00,586
What's up with her?
Shit, dude. Your hand's glowing.

178
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:05,056
You're a freak. An actual freak.

179
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:07,696
I don't...
I didn't...

180
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:09,591
Make it stop.

181
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,886
I don't know how...

182
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:15,346
You really don't understand.

183
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,416
Anna.

184
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:18,976
Go away.
- I'm not going away.

185
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:20,496
What was that?

186
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:23,256
Dunno.
- Why aren't you going after Jay anyway?

187
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:24,936
I wanted to talk to you first.

188
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:28,936
Well, why don't you just go see her?
Go, fuck off and see her.

189
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,486
Who's her?

190
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:32,936
She's no-one.
- What's going on?

191
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:35,976
Paul is having sex with my best
friend and then when I found them...

192
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,096
and shouted at him,
he did a magic spell on me.

193
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:40,336
You're having sex with Tracy?
- The other one.

194
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:43,296
I'm quite impressed with Jay.

195
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,976
Mum, that's not the point.
He's got superpowers.

196
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:48,136
No, I...

197
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:50,056
That was a misunderstanding.

198
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,256
So you are admitting the sex bit?
- No.

199
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,456
I dunno. No...

200
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:57,936
God, look, you don't understand, OK?

201
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,376
Don't understand.

202
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:03,146
Do you want me to chase after you?

203
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:12,936
Then I'm going to cut off your dad's dick,
pour dog chunks on it,

204
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:15,826
and feed it to the wolves.
Your dick.

205
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:17,926
Your dick.

206
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:20,706
You're in fucking trouble now, boy.

207
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,056
Your dad let me up.

208
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,776
He seems pretty consumed with stuff.
- Is he OK?

209
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:34,176
One minute.

210
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:39,656
Stand down, noble...

211
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:41,206
Boomtang.

212
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:50,536
I could have been naked.

213
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:52,543
I've seen you naked.

214
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:56,296
I could have been masturbating.
- I've seen you masturbate.

215
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:57,846
What? When?

216
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,626
The school trip to Calais?

217
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:06,656
You were awake?

218
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:08,656
Look, I need your help.

219
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:10,096
Do you?
- Yeah, well...

220
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,536
I sort of accidentally showed my sister,

221
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:16,908
my sort of girlfriend
and my sister's sort of...

222
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:18,806
boyfriend some of...

223
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:23,096
like, what I can do.
The less-than-normal stuff.

224
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:25,106
Now they think I'm a freak.

225
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:29,921
Just, I need someone, you,
to just make it all OK again,

226
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:31,766
because...

227
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,616
Please.

228
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:36,016
I'm really sorry, I can't.

229
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:39,256
What?
Why can't you?

230
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:41,576
Paul, I'm tired, OK?

231
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,696
You're tired?

232
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,855
Your best friend needs your help,
and you're tired?

233
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:48,255
Tired who, tired how?
- I'm tired because I spent all day...

234
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:50,617
wondering whether someone was going
to shout surprise at me,

235
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:52,306
and no-one fucking did.

236
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,576
That's why.

237
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,176
And it's made me tired.

238
00:18:00,276 --> 00:18:04,146
Shout surprise... What?
No, come on, you're not even making sense.

239
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:06,966
You're right.

240
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,376
I'm just going back
to my computer game, OK?

241
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:13,066
It goes all funny if you leave
it on pause for too long.

242
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:18,586
But I don't...

243
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,246
get it.

244
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,486
Contact neutralised.
- Fine.

245
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:56,986
What?

246
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:01,186
Are you going to try and hurt me again?

247
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:05,466
Because if you are, just get on with it,
I've had a really shit day.

248
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:21,586
I don't have favourites.
- Yeah, but you're worried about him.

249
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:24,616
What did he do to you?

250
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:26,856
He zipped my mouth shut.

251
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,136
And he's sleeping with Jay?

252
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,696
Yes. Behind my back.

253
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:34,856
I don't know what's going on
with this town

254
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:37,656
and I don't know what's going on
with my son, either.

255
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:42,136
It'd just be nice if you could
worry about me too.

256
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:46,306
I do worry about you.

257
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:54,656
I'm going to bed, Mum.
- You been out celebrating with Mac?

258
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:57,416
Celebrating what?
Look, I'm tired.

259
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:59,736
Don't you think we should talk?

260
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:03,376
I'm really busy at the moment, Mum, OK?

261
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,626
Yeah. I know.

262
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:18,126
Celebrating what?

263
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:55,136
It took three cans of shaving foam.

264
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:57,736
The newsagent thought I was going
for a whole body shave.

265
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:01,936
He advised me against it.
Apparently, pubic stubble rash is a killer.

266
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:03,396
Good to know.

267
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,816
What's a surprise
if you're sort of expecting it?

268
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,856
The truly surprising birthday
is one that takes place a day late.

269
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:11,786
So true.

270
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,466
I'm still learning how to...

271
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,496
balance who I am with what I...

272
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:21,046
I know.

273
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:26,296
And you're probably still trying to
balance who I am with what I...

274
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:27,656
I am.

275
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:29,456
And I've always been a bit self-centred.

276
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,006
You have.

277
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:35,066
And I'm sorry.

278
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:38,226
Did I mention that I'm sorry?

279
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:45,240
How long were you waiting out here
before I opened the curtains?

280
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:47,966
It was a while.

281
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:00,456
After three?
- Always.

282
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:02,266
One, two...

283
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:11,736
It's not the magic number.
- Far more likely to be seven.

284
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:13,896
Way more pagan connotations.

285
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:16,696
Also, a much more
satisfying number to say.

286
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,456
Seven.
- Seven.

287
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:30,016
Zap. You see that? Did ya?

288
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:34,706
Did you see that?
Mama say knock you out.

289
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:11,966
So...

290
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,856
This is inevitable.

291
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:28,006
What was that?

292
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:32,696
I need to go to see Neil.

293
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:35,630
Was that a fit?

294
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,536
I had a cousin who was an epileptic.
Well, he thought he was...

295
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:39,536
turned out he was just overtired, so...

296
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:43,536
I'm sorry.
Happy birth-yester-day.

297
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:48,594
I need to go, alone.
- Of course you do. I'll be waiting.

298
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:09,924
Hold still.

299
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:12,176
Right, who are you?
And what are you doing here?

300
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:15,096
What? No, who are you?
- Let's try again, eh?

301
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:19,646
Who are you, and what are you doing?
- I'm here to see Neil.

302
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:22,506
You're Paul, aren't you?

303
00:24:25,586 --> 00:24:27,076
This is him?

304
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:29,306
We heard all about you.

305
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:34,016
Thank you for coming so quickly.

306
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:37,776
I... You're here because...
- You look like shit, Neil.

307
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,016
I'll get to that.
- Start with that.

308
00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:41,918
Who attacked you?
- Can I just...?

309
00:24:42,018 --> 00:24:45,936
Neil, the only way to sort out our
fears is to tell us what's going on.

310
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:49,216
Just to make clear
I didn't want you here,

311
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:51,936
so fuck you if you think
I'm not doing this my way.

312
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:55,896
There's a problem.
The Fades can touch.

313
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:58,364
And they're attacking us.

314
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,856
They seem to be able to do this
because they're eating human flesh,

315
00:25:01,956 --> 00:25:03,976
and we have no idea how to stop them.
- Well,

316
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:07,696
that didn't make my fears go away.
Anyone else's fears go away?

317
00:25:07,796 --> 00:25:10,896
Sorry, but there you are.
- So we're in danger?

318
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:12,576
But we're not without hope.
- Why?

319
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:15,176
Because we've got a little kid
who can save the world, eh?

320
00:25:15,276 --> 00:25:17,361
A boy who I wouldn't even trust
with a spud gun.

321
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:20,216
He has powers
we don't even understand yet.

322
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:22,896
Eric thinks he's special.

323
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:24,816
Neil thinks he's special.

324
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,416
Can I?

325
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:28,776
As we're talking about me, shall I?

326
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:37,322
Oh, Jesus, Neil.
You've been walking around with that?

327
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:40,256
For fuck's sake,
how many dead Angelics do we need?

328
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:45,166
Let me look at him.

329
00:25:47,627 --> 00:25:49,306
I can help him. Let me look at him.

330
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:55,126
You can help, can you?

331
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,016
Trust me.
- Trust you?

332
00:25:59,116 --> 00:26:03,583
I told you to be careful, didn't I?
Then you let Alice and Phil jump you.

333
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:06,775
That's nothing.
The Fade girl follows me everywhere.

334
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,577
She could probably jump me at any time.

335
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:12,696
Natalie? You stay away from her.
Look at me. You stay away from her.

336
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:14,896
Paul, you're not ready.

337
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,337
This probably won't hurt.

338
00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:23,536
Before you do this...

339
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:25,526
Do you know what you're doing?

340
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:30,146
Not even close.
Feels right.

341
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:57,566
Just let it happen.

342
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,066
Tickle, don't they?

343
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:22,696
How do I look?
- Your eye...

344
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:25,466
He's done things I never could.

345
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:40,256
There was a reason
I came to see you today.

346
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,306
Well, I hope it's because
I called you, several times.

347
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:47,386
I had another vision.

348
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:50,576
Same as before,
except there was a man in it.

349
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,186
He smiled at me,
and then it cut out.

350
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:57,906
Is?

351
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:03,466
Am I seeing the end of the world, Neil?

352
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,826
Who was the man?
Did you recognise him?

353
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:16,496
I want you to move in here, with us.

354
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:19,336
Just until this is over.
- No. I can't.

355
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,976
Can't.
I've got people to see.

356
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:28,296
What you just did in there,
to help me, was extraordinary.

357
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:29,816
Extraordinary.

358
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,616
But the fact you can do that,
that makes you valuable.

359
00:28:32,716 --> 00:28:35,096
OK, fine. Don't move in here.

360
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:37,256
But there is someone out there
that scares me.

361
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:39,896
So you just promise me this.
Promise me...

362
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:43,176
you won't ignore the kill me signs
we've all got on our backs.

363
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:45,576
I need my own life, Neil.

364
00:28:45,676 --> 00:28:48,626
Again, you're not listening to a word I say.

365
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,856
We need to capture one of them.

366
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:07,256
What, with our ghost rope?

367
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:09,896
If they can touch you,
you can touch them.

368
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:13,696
We have a code, remember?
- Which they broke first.

369
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:15,136
It's time for us to act.

370
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:17,776
Phil is right.
We need to spread out,

371
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:19,936
find smaller, weaker Fades.

372
00:29:20,036 --> 00:29:22,096
We do this now,
before they get too strong.

373
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:24,006
And then what do we do, eh?

374
00:29:24,106 --> 00:29:28,317
Once we find this smaller, weaker Fade?

375
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,266
We find out its limits.

376
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:48,546
Neil.
- Hello, Mark.

377
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:52,016
I've been...
I've been looking...

378
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:54,696
How did you know
I've been looking for you?

379
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:56,296
I didn't.

380
00:29:56,396 --> 00:30:00,776
I'm not here for small talk.
I'm here as a translator.

381
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:03,066
A translator?
- Are you going to invite me in?

382
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,235
What were you doing with my wife
in a mental hospital?

383
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:22,776
I was rescuing her.
I'll go through to the lounge, yeah?

384
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:25,146
I didn't think you'd ever come.

385
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:29,466
I almost died this afternoon.

386
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:34,456
It reminded me I had things to put right.

387
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:38,306
You're going to put us right, are you?
- I'm going to try.

388
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,496
Who are you talking to?

389
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:43,266
Sarah's dead.

390
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,146
You don't know that.

391
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,296
I do.

392
00:30:49,396 --> 00:30:50,866
I'm sorry.

393
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:55,016
She's also a spirit

394
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:58,936
who has decided that the best use
of her time is to follow you around.

395
00:31:01,746 --> 00:31:03,616
She's what?

396
00:31:03,716 --> 00:31:07,346
This I'm also sorry about,
because I think she's wrong.

397
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,576
But it's what she wants,

398
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:13,736
so I want to do the decent thing by her.

399
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:18,176
That's why I'm here as a translator,
because...

400
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,516
I can talk to ghosts.

401
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,016
You were having an affair with her.

402
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:25,915
I just told you you're being
haunted by the ghost

403
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:27,326
of your wife, and you...

404
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:29,976
Neil, I need to have
a serious conversation with you.

405
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:33,496
You were having an affair...
- Tell him something I wouldn't know.

406
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,746
I've got a feather tattooed on my arse.

407
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:41,416
She's got a feather on her bum.

408
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:43,737
Something you'd also know
if you'd slept with her.

409
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:46,616
He called me Squidge for three
months after we first got together...

410
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:49,376
and then dropped it because he
decided that he hated pet names.

411
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:52,096
You used to call her Squidge,

412
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:56,016
and then you dropped it
because you didn't like pet names.

413
00:31:56,571 --> 00:31:59,573
I don't want this bit.
I'm calling the police.

414
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:02,516
Four days ago, I watched him
sleep with a woman called Vicky

415
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:03,976
Mark. Mark, please.
- And it broke my heart.

416
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:06,656
Four days ago, she, Sarah's ghost,
saw you

417
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:08,226
sleeping with a woman called Vicky

418
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:11,576
and it broke her heart.

419
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,466
There's no way I could know that.

420
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:19,226
Fuck off.

421
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,016
We were Angelics.

422
00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:28,666
I still am one.

423
00:32:30,686 --> 00:32:34,706
We're a different breed of people.
We were sworn to secrecy, Mark.

424
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:38,736
You two were my best friends,

425
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:42,186
so I'm here tonight
to try to make it right for yous.

426
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:46,946
I don't understand...

427
00:32:48,186 --> 00:32:49,416
She's dead?

428
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:53,546
She's here now, Mark.

429
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:56,576
She doesn't want to leave you.

430
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:57,996
She's...

431
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:02,226
Let's all keep calm, and we'll
ask her some questions, yeah?

432
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:03,737
She's...

433
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:13,306
Am I looking at her?
- Yeah. Just about. She's...

434
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:19,026
I'm going to repeat
what Sarah says word for word.

435
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:22,026
What do you want to ask her, Mark?

436
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:58,736
I want to tell you
about something wonderful.

437
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:02,736
I want to tell you about Gaia.
- What's Gaia?

438
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:05,776
Call yourself a geek?
What's Gaia?

439
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:08,176
You're a disgrace to your community.

440
00:34:08,276 --> 00:34:10,896
Did Neil Gaiman write it?

441
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:14,256
Look, do you want me
to help fix it with Jay, or what?

442
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,835
Right.
In 2012,

443
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:21,686
we're sending the satellite Gaia
into the galaxy

444
00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:24,386
to take pictures of the stars.

445
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,936
What's this?
- Cough medicine.

446
00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:36,850
Its billion-pixel camera

447
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,339
will give scientists a 3D map of the sky.

448
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,177
Cough medicine?
- Takes the edge off.

449
00:34:42,277 --> 00:34:46,727
It'll tell us about the Milky Way,
how it works, how it started,

450
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:52,046
but the exciting thing is the things
we're not expecting to see.

451
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:56,256
Asteroids,
planets beyond our solar system,

452
00:34:56,356 --> 00:34:59,696
tepid stars that never fired into life.

453
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:03,666
Extraordinary things we don't understand.

454
00:35:11,355 --> 00:35:15,016
Now call her.
But I can't.

455
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,256
Yeah, you can.

456
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,296
It's ringing.

457
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:36,001
I am not a morning person.
- Look out the window.

458
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,016
The point is

459
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:47,936
Gaia is extraordinary.

460
00:35:48,576 --> 00:35:51,776
It's going to show us amazing
things we can't even contemplate.

461
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:55,136
It's also really, really ordinary.

462
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:59,897
That's a look.
- Because you know what's best about Gaia?

463
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:03,056
Because do you want to
know the best thing about Gaia?

464
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:05,256
Chelmsford and Stevenage.

465
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:08,776
Where it was made.
Chelmsford and Stevenage.

466
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:11,016
A bunch of geeky men,
sitting in a shit town

467
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:15,216
built something that would transform
the way we look at the skies.

468
00:36:15,316 --> 00:36:19,096
The things that scare you about me

469
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:21,046
Imagine...

470
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:24,655
Imagine I'm Stevenage.

471
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,273
Some things have changed about me,
but fundamentally I'm...

472
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:31,058
I'm just ordinary.

473
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,386
I'm Stevenage.

474
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,396
Smooth as.

475
00:36:37,993 --> 00:36:40,426
So, you're Superman, right?

476
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,696
I can't hear you.
- Yes, you can. I can hear you.

477
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:50,246
Well, you must have supersonic
hearing, then. I can't hear a word.

478
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:54,946
You're quite the loser, you know
that? Hang on a minute.

479
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:05,936
I think this is the time
when I do the alpha thing and say

480
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:07,816
you look great as you are.

481
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,976
No quite about it, you're a loser.

482
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:12,226
Yeah. A loser. I know.

483
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:15,576
Now everyone knows about us.

484
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:17,906
I mean, effectively,
I am your boyfriend.

485
00:37:20,284 --> 00:37:22,656
So, can I tell people? Is that OK?

486
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:27,506
Not just a loser.
A total loser.

487
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:42,146
A loser that needs to go.
- What?

488
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:46,146
I need to go.

489
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:49,096
I'm sorry.

490
00:37:49,196 --> 00:37:50,897
Have you got to save the world,
or something?

491
00:37:50,997 --> 00:37:53,616
I was actually joking
about the Superman thing.

492
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:55,166
I'll be back.

493
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:00,496
You'd better be.

494
00:38:01,848 --> 00:38:03,406
Where are you going?

495
00:38:13,946 --> 00:38:16,136
What are you doing here?
- Nice work.

496
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:17,495
We can take it from here.
- Yeah.

497
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,057
Get yourself back to your girlfriend.

498
00:38:19,157 --> 00:38:22,746
There's your smaller, weaker Fade, right?

499
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:34,886
How are you feeling?

500
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,246
I can't get used to it.

501
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,086
Can't get used to what?

502
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:47,776
The fact I feel like I've had
a rock of boiling lava

503
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:49,546
removed from my gut.

504
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,266
I feel lighter.

505
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:56,016
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

506
00:38:57,356 --> 00:38:59,776
You know, people misunderstand

507
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:02,106
why Adam and Eve were thrown
out of Eden.

508
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:06,426
They say it was knowledge that cost them.

509
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:10,066
The fruit of knowledge.
That's a misreading.

510
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:13,266
It wasn't knowledge that cost them.

511
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:15,997
It was doubt.

512
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,935
They doubted what they were told

513
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:21,246
and so they couldn't see
the beauty around them.

514
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,966
And they weren't thrown out.

515
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:30,215
Eden was still there,
they were still in Eden,

516
00:39:30,716 --> 00:39:34,296
only its beauty was lost to them.

517
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:37,226
Their own beauty was lost to them.

518
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,932
I can see the beauty,
so I'm lucky, aren't I?

519
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:47,696
No, you're not lucky.

520
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:50,264
Can you see the beauty, Neil?

521
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,536
Sarah thinks all of this is pointless.

522
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:56,816
That fate is coming.
No point in fighting.

523
00:39:57,116 --> 00:39:59,361
You just find someone you love
and you stick to them.

524
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:02,658
Sarah's weak.

525
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:04,656
She always has been.

526
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:06,696
So you never doubt that we'll win?

527
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:11,246
It's not the absence of doubt.
It's the conquering of it.

528
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:16,056
So, do you doubt me?

529
00:40:19,026 --> 00:40:22,066
You do?
- I don't doubt your stamina, Neil.

530
00:40:23,346 --> 00:40:25,346
I do doubt your strength.

531
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:27,856
Guys.

532
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:31,346
Some good news.
The kid has caught us one of them.

533
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:38,136
She can scream.

534
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,335
Her voice had rotted.
She shouldn't be able to do that.

535
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:42,255
So, they're acquiring everything?
- Looks that way.

536
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:43,817
And what are we going to do with her?

537
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:47,066
We're going to find out where he is.

538
00:40:48,706 --> 00:40:50,466
And we're going to show no mercy.

539
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:54,056
Tie her up.

540
00:41:07,826 --> 00:41:11,256
Fraser reports she's dead.
- We got cause?

541
00:41:11,356 --> 00:41:13,906
Yeah. Teeth.

542
00:41:14,946 --> 00:41:17,896
To the neck.
- Teeth?

543
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:20,466
Yeah. Human teeth.

544
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:27,536
We've got a suspect?
- No, nothing on anyone so far.

545
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:32,086
People are having their necks ripped out

546
00:41:32,853 --> 00:41:34,626
with human teeth?

547
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:42,746
Kids with human teeth?

548
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,226
Well, that's going to make people, jumpy.

549
00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:57,126
Yeah, I know.
- And people are already jumpy.

550
00:41:58,104 --> 00:42:00,786
Including my superiors, by the way.

551
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:04,806
Look, I get it.

552
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:08,016
You're a good copper

553
00:42:08,116 --> 00:42:11,946
promoted way above his station
by some affirmative-action bollocks.

554
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:16,016
That's not true.
- I didn't want you to have this job,

555
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:20,376
not because I'm a racist, but because
I didn't think you were up to it.

556
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:25,315
I know you didn't.
- But you got it. You won.

557
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:30,816
And now you're a leader.
You lead a team.

558
00:42:31,814 --> 00:42:35,766
And this team is in shit up to its eyeballs.

559
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:40,496
Its eyeballs are drowning in shit.

560
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:45,136
So sort it out.
Take some action.

561
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:49,249
Find a suspect, build a case.
Do something.

562
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:13,576
That was a look I wasn't expecting.

563
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:14,976
What look?

564
00:43:15,076 --> 00:43:18,536
I've seen boys look pleased,
I've seen boys look disappointed.

565
00:43:18,636 --> 00:43:21,336
I've never seen a boy look quite so scared.

566
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:24,376
No, no, I'm not scared.
I was just, I was thinking.

567
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:28,896
Thinking what?
And you're not allowed to say films

568
00:43:28,996 --> 00:43:31,736
or what's-her-face from Mork And Mindy.

569
00:43:31,836 --> 00:43:33,286
Pam Dawber.

570
00:43:34,826 --> 00:43:38,906
I was thinking about you.
I think you look nice.

571
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:49,906
You've got nice feet.

572
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:52,776
And nice legs.

573
00:43:52,876 --> 00:43:56,496
And you've got nice...
a nice...

574
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:58,066
bra and nice feet.

575
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:01,616
Did I already say feet?

576
00:44:09,956 --> 00:44:12,266
It's OK to be scared.

577
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:19,256
I'm not scared. I just...

578
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,506
This wasn't exactly how...

579
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:26,616
how I expected this to go.

580
00:44:26,716 --> 00:44:28,466
And what did you expect?

581
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,226
Have you ever played
paper-scissors-stone?

582
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,536
Seriously, I don't...
I think maybe we should just do a bit

583
00:44:49,636 --> 00:44:51,306
a bit more kissing first.

584
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:57,866
This isn't 1955.
Kids don't wait any more.

585
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:11,616
You don't have to marry me,
or anything.

586
00:45:11,716 --> 00:45:15,136
It's just, this feels right now,
which is...

587
00:45:15,236 --> 00:45:18,056
I don't know whether it does feel right.

588
00:45:18,156 --> 00:45:21,416
I mean, I've seen a lot of things
today which...

589
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:26,266
Just forget about all that,
think about me.

590
00:45:36,729 --> 00:45:40,056
Yeah, but if we are doing this,
then a quick warning.

591
00:45:40,156 --> 00:45:44,606
If at any point in this process
I grow wings, don't be alarmed.

592
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:47,106
I'll try not to be.

593
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:52,061
Like that.

594
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:58,024
Don't push too hard.
- OK. Sorry.

595
00:45:59,116 --> 00:46:01,386
That hurts.
- Oh, OK.

596
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:05,256
That doesn't.

597
00:46:22,626 --> 00:46:24,386
I don't know whether to...

598
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:29,306
I don't know what to do.
- You don't do anything.

599
00:46:32,946 --> 00:46:34,546
It's just so hard, this

600
00:46:35,946 --> 00:46:39,136
knowing that you're there
but knowing that you're not there.

601
00:46:39,236 --> 00:46:43,096
I just wish I could touch you.

602
00:46:43,196 --> 00:46:44,536
I know.

603
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:47,066
But you know that.

604
00:46:50,232 --> 00:46:53,656
You left me.
We broke up. It was shit.

605
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:55,706
What...

606
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,829
What changed?
Are you stuck because of me?

607
00:46:58,929 --> 00:47:00,706
Are we in a fucking film?

608
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:03,326
Are you...

609
00:47:04,346 --> 00:47:06,374
Do you still

610
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:09,222
love me?

611
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,186
I wish you could answer that question
without having to ask Neil.

612
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:25,546
Coming.

613
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:29,656
Mark Etches.

614
00:47:29,756 --> 00:47:31,736
I have a warrant to search these premises.

615
00:47:32,136 --> 00:47:34,626
What?
- What's this about?

616
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:45,775
My name is DCI Armstrong.
- I know who you fucking are.

617
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:48,217
I have to formally identify myself...
- Why are you here?

618
00:47:48,864 --> 00:47:50,690
What do you think I've done?

619
00:47:51,306 --> 00:47:53,417
I'm arresting you
on suspicion of your connection

620
00:47:53,517 --> 00:47:56,576
to the disappearance of Sarah Etches.
- My wife?

621
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,786
You think I have anything
to do with Sarah's death?

622
00:48:00,906 --> 00:48:02,296
And Helen Marshall,

623
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,616
and the murders of Sam Griegson
and Fred Taylor.

624
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:06,756
Murder?

625
00:48:06,856 --> 00:48:08,478
You don't have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...

626
00:48:08,906 --> 00:48:10,496
How can you think...

627
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:13,416
What possible evidence do you have?

628
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,416
You have connections with all the victims.

629
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:17,616
You assaulted Sam Griegson
a few days ago...

630
00:48:17,716 --> 00:48:21,706
Yeah, we sorted that out.
- Desperate men do desperate things.

631
00:48:36,106 --> 00:48:37,606
So...

632
00:48:39,786 --> 00:48:41,286
So?

633
00:48:47,906 --> 00:48:49,936
Well, go on, then, spit it out.

634
00:48:50,036 --> 00:48:51,906
How was it?

635
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:54,606
You know...

636
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,026
Nice, actually.
- What's it feel like?

637
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:05,016
It's hotter than expected.
- That's probably a good sign.

638
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:09,416
Though it was quite difficult to fit.

639
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:12,792
That's probably a good sign, too.

640
00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:24,856
I never gave you your present, did I?
For your birthday.

641
00:49:24,956 --> 00:49:27,736
You didn't need to.
- Yeah, I did.

642
00:49:27,836 --> 00:49:29,336
You totally did.

643
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:34,736
It's a key.

644
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:38,576
Am I supposed to break it off
and then give half to you

645
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,456
and wear my bit round my neck?

646
00:49:40,556 --> 00:49:43,536
Are we in love?
Because I'm flattered, but...

647
00:49:43,636 --> 00:49:45,086
It's to my house.

648
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:52,154
Any time things at home
with your mum, with your dad,

649
00:49:52,862 --> 00:49:58,000
3am, whenever,
you just come to my place,

650
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,216
sleep on the sofa, sleep in my room,
whatever you like.

651
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:04,146
You're always welcome
because you're family.

652
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,203
I've cleared it with Mum.

653
00:50:12,184 --> 00:50:13,456
You do know, don't you,

654
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:16,327
that whatever happens with Jay, you'll
always be more important to me, right?

655
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:22,970
You do know I'm going to use this key
to steal your sister's knickers, right?

656
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:26,096
Did you just flick ice cream at me?

657
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:31,256
Don't throw your bloody ice cream at me.

658
00:50:31,356 --> 00:50:33,936
I'm going to comb through
your photo albums and find

659
00:50:34,036 --> 00:50:35,815
pictures of your sister in a bikini.
- No, I'm not listening to you.

660
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:37,457
I'm not listening.
- And your mum breast-feeding.

661
00:50:37,557 --> 00:50:40,016
Then I'm going to snoop
for dildodatic devices.

662
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,586
This is going to be fine.

663
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:14,026
This is going to be fine.

664
00:51:42,748 --> 00:51:44,246
It's happening, Neil.

665
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:48,466
Is it?

666
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,506
You see?
I was right not to have doubted.

667
00:51:58,986 --> 00:52:02,046
No, I'm not ready.
- Keep the boy safe.

668
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:06,896
It's beautiful, Neil.

669
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:09,026
I'm not ready. You can't go.

670
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:14,256
You're right, I'm not strong enough.
I'm not strong...
