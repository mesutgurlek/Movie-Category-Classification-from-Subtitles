1
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:51,695
You cannot defeat me.

2
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,172
Do not go to Silent Hill.

3
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:31,150
Honey, it's okay.

4
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:33,095
I'm here...

5
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:35,423
Yes?

6
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:42,816
- I was burning...
- Hey come on, kiddo, it was just a dream.

7
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,841
Just like this morning...

8
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:49,920
- This feels different...
- Hey look...

9
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:53,781
Once we've unpacked and give this
place a lick of paint...

10
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:56,696
This will be our home.

11
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:00,734
- The dreams will fade.
- They're calling me.

12
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:06,028
Do not listen.

13
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:08,113
Do not listen.
Do you hear?

14
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:11,789
I want you to promise me that whatever happens,
you'll never go there...

15
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:13,120
Okay.

16
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:47,699
Rough night?

17
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,230
Yeah.

18
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,969
Daddy, I don't want to do this again.

19
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:57,228
I know, honey.

20
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,669
Spoons...

21
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:08,049
"Heather."
Why Heather?

22
00:05:08,084 --> 00:05:11,399
It was my grandmother's name.
You can change it if you don't like it.

23
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:13,543
No, no.

24
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,434
Heather is fine.

25
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:21,044
I was Sharon, then Mary, then Cathy.
Now Heather.

26
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,609
And you were Christopher
and now you're Harry.

27
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,401
Names don't matter.

28
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,557
I'm still me.

29
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,468
Happy birthday!

30
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:45,591
Dad, thank you! But you're, you're early.

31
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:47,768
Just a little.

32
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:50,997
Can't believe that today I have
a soon-to-be 18 year-old daughter.

33
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,734
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

34
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:03,742
I love it.

35
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:05,456
- Really?
- Yes

36
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:10,343
It is the one I saw you're looking at in the mall.

37
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:14,315
Yes, yes. Thank you.
I love it.

38
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,598
You're welcome, honey.

39
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:20,134
You're getting all that gray there, dad.

40
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:22,925
Hmmm, your fault.

41
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:29,766
- You know, yours are showing.
- Yeah, I know. I'll fix it.

42
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:34,860
I think this place will be good for us, you know?
What do you think?

43
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,671
Yes

44
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:42,183
Hey, come on. What's say we unpacked,
give the new place a lick of paint...

45
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:44,125
- I think...
- Don't, Dad.

46
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:47,934
What?

47
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:53,369
It's just what you said
in my dream. Just, don't.

48
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:57,227
I got to go.

49
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:59,911
Do not want to be late on the first day of school.

50
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:02,786
Hey, remember the rules.

51
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:04,861
- New town, new school.
- Yes

52
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,453
I've done this before.

53
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:10,006
I know you have, I'm just...

54
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:14,860
- You know I worry.
- Don't worry.

55
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:17,991
I'm careful.
I'll be fine.

56
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,921
I love you.

57
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,833
I love you too, honey.

58
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:16,703
Hey, Rose.
I wish you were still here.

59
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,397
It's been so hard since you
brought Sharon back to me.

60
00:08:20,894 --> 00:08:23,410
Christopher, my love,

61
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,505
Rose

62
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:31,097
I tried to find you

63
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:33,294
I searched for so long

64
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:37,455
My love, I don't have a lot of time

65
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,303
I'm trapped here. There's nothing you can do for me,

66
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:41,451
protect her.

67
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:44,925
- She's the one that matters now.
- Why can't you come back?

68
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:50,720
I found a Seal. Part of it is missing.

69
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:53,297
Only one of us could come through.

70
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,255
I made a choice.

71
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,572
- Where is our daughter?
- They'll come looking for her.

72
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:03,373
They'll come looking because they need her.

73
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:06,160
Never let them take her.

74
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:09,803
No matter what happens, no matter
what you have to do, swear to me.

75
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:12,595
Swear to me you will never let them take her.

76
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,944
- I swear.
- I brought her back to you.

77
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,588
She is yours to care for now.

78
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,487
Don't go.

79
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,218
Goodbye, my love.

80
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:27,456
Rose!

81
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:32,920
Daddy!

82
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,883
Sharon?

83
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:38,050
Oh, my God, Sharon!

84
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,768
- You are here.
- Daddy!

85
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,177
It's Okay.

86
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:49,309
You are safe now.

87
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:52,490
What happened?
I don't remember anything.

88
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,481
It's okay. It's okay.

89
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:56,886
You....

90
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:59,272
You were in an accident.

91
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,413
Where's Mommy?

92
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:06,741
- Mommy saved you.
- Where's Mommy?

93
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,232
She's gone, honey.

94
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:05,614
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

95
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:08,856
- Sorry, what?
- Are you okay?

96
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:12,918
Yes, I'm fine.

97
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:15,610
It's just that you don't wanna
be messing with the vagrants, miss.

98
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,710
I just wanted to see
if he needed some help.

99
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,972
Some people are beyond our help.

100
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,395
Have we met?

101
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:29,759
- No, no, I don't think so.
- No ?

102
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:32,170
I'm sure we have.

103
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:35,111
- What is your name?
- I have to catch my bus.

104
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:44,179
Welcome back, everyone. I hope you
had a good Christmas vacation.

105
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:48,154
I would like to welcome some new
students who will be joining us this semester.

106
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:51,746
Heather Mason.
Could you say hello to the class, Heather?

107
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:54,615
Hi. I'm Heather.

108
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,396
I'm new.
I just moved to town, so...

109
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:01,884
Come on, Heather, share a
little bit of yourself.

110
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,848
Everyone has a story.
Tell us yours.

111
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,781
What is this, third grade?

112
00:12:09,477 --> 00:12:11,476
What do you wanna know?

113
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:14,640
Do you get all of your clothes from goodwill?

114
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,858
Okay, you know what?

115
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:22,892
Let me make this sincere for you.

116
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:26,749
This is the fifth school
I've been to since I was 11.

117
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:28,666
Me and my dad, we move around.

118
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,818
So I do this, a lot.

119
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:34,814
So don't bother trying
to remember my name

120
00:12:34,815 --> 00:12:37,347
because I'm sure as hell
not gonna remember yours.

121
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,600
Do not talk to me.
We won't be friends.

122
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:45,864
I won't I.M you or,
Facebook you or Tweet you,

123
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,049
read your blog.

124
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,107
And whatever you're thinking of
saying or doing, don't bother, because

125
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:55,700
I've seen it before, and I'm just guessing here, but...

126
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:59,178
I don't think there are too
many original thinkers in this room.

127
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,991
And by the time any of you have found
out anything about me that's worth knowing...

128
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,682
I have moved on.

129
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:11,044
- How's that?
- Very impressive.

130
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,229
Now the next addition to our class,
... Vincent Cooper.

131
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:18,233
Are you kidding me?
I can't follow that.

132
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:40,834
Shit!

133
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:53,205
Burn the witch!

134
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,315
- Burn the witch!
- No.

135
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,274
- Burn the witch!
- No.

136
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,713
- Please leave me alone.
- Burn the Witch!

137
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:02,569
Please!

138
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:03,698
Leave me alone...

139
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:11,098
Are you alright. .?

140
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,372
- What?
- Are you okay?

141
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,379
What are you doing out of class?

142
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:25,597
You know what?
I'm lost.

143
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,862
I can't find Math.
Any ideas?

144
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:30,882
No, no.

145
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:33,935
I - I'm lost too.

146
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:39,319
Hey look, you wanna get a coffee?

147
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:42,424
- No, we have class.
- I mean, later.

148
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:46,120
- No.
- Why not?

149
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,827
We're both new.
We don't know anyone else.

150
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:52,636
That speech I gave in class,
I gave it for a reason.

151
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,890
I really do not want
to know anyone here.

152
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,538
Hey, honey.
How was your day?

153
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,328
I think there's someone following me.
What do I do?

154
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,162
Okay. Uhh..

155
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:43,839
Don't come back here. Not yet.
I'll meet you somewhere.

156
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:47,548
Central Square Mall.

157
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,223
- You need to make sure.
- Okay, I'll meet you at Happy Burger place.

158
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:56,460
I'll be there as soon as I can.

159
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:58,559
Do you think someone knows?

160
00:16:58,594 --> 00:17:00,901
No.

161
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,571
No one knows.
I'll see you soon.

162
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,057
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too.

163
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:38,270
Happy birthday, Heather!

164
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,501
Make a wish!

165
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:47,369
"Happy birthday, HEATHER"

166
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:04,322
"Happy birthday, HEATHER"

167
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:06,783
"Happy birthday, ALESSA"

168
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Sharon.

169
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,739
Sharon !

170
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:41,015
Please, sir...

171
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,129
Sharon, wait!

172
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,465
Daddy, Daddy...

173
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,339
Dad, I...

174
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:17,856
Sharon, wait.

175
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:23,334
Sharon!

176
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:28,352
Keep away from me!

177
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:32,444
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

178
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,800
Nothing is okay.

179
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,514
Who are you?

180
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:39,472
My name is Douglas Cartland, I'm a
private investigator.

181
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:41,282
What do you want from me?

182
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:44,736
I'm paid to find people.
Someone wanted you found, Sharon.

183
00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:47,433
- That's not my name!
- You're Sharon Da Silva.

184
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:51,009
Or at least you think you are.
Tracked you down after you left Portland.

185
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:53,342
You and Harry got away
from the police, but I found you.

186
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:55,955
What my dad did there...
That was self-defense.

187
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,557
I don't care who Harry killed.

188
00:19:57,592 --> 00:20:00,610
- I'm trying to help.
- Get back! Why?

189
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,372
Because I didn't know who I
was working for then, but I do now.

190
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:07,445
They call themselves the Order of Valtiel.

191
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,316
And they want you.

192
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:10,787
You're lying.

193
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:12,782
You do not understand.

194
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:16,291
They know where you are.

195
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:19,014
I told them where you are.

196
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,809
They're coming.
You gotta get away.

197
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,577
Don't worry, I will.

198
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:25,142
Keep away from me!

199
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:27,256
Everything your dad ever told you was a lie.

200
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,572
Fuck you!
He told me the truth.

201
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:31,093
You know why you don't remember
anything from your childhood?

202
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:34,852
I was in a car crash. My mother died.
I lost my memory.

203
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:37,360
No! There was never any accident.

204
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:40,357
You were trapped in a place called Silent Hill.

205
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:43,208
But your mother saved you.
She got you out.

206
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,167
But they want you back.
Ask your dad.

207
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:47,790
He knows that...

208
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:03,400
Tell me who I am.

209
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:04,447
No!

210
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:10,282
Please tell me.

211
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:12,539
No!

212
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:34,369
It's gone. It's gone.

213
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:38,515
I'll help you, come on.

214
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:23,146
"Garbage"

215
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:13,339
You two, move back now.

216
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:17,249
Hey, Miss, you can't be back here.

217
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:19,344
Come on, back behind the tape, please.

218
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:23,752
Hey come on, folks, I need you back,
everybody get back.

219
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,315
Whoa, whoa, one second.

220
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,445
There's a wallet in his pocket.

221
00:23:31,822 --> 00:23:34,147
Sir, please stand back.

222
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:36,106
Douglas Cartland.

223
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:38,306
Some P.I. from out of town.

224
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:41,465
- What do you got there?
- The boys found this jacket down there.

225
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,374
- There's blood on it.
- Go hand it over to forensics,

226
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:45,952
just find out whose blood it is.

227
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:49,058
Heather Mason, Sharon Da Silva.

228
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:51,168
- This girl?
- Maybe this is her.

229
00:23:51,203 --> 00:23:54,650
Well let's find her and ask her.
See what we got on this Cartland,

230
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:55,806
pull the security tapes,

231
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:57,213
I want to see what happened
here tonight.

232
00:23:57,248 --> 00:23:58,189
Hey.

233
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:01,858
They found a guy dead in there,
did you see it?

234
00:24:02,813 --> 00:24:04,328
Yeah, uhh...

235
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:10,065
What's wrong?

236
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:14,547
- I can't tell you.
- It's okay. You can tell me.

237
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:18,324
No, I can't, because, I have no idea
what's going on in my head now.

238
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:22,877
Harry's voice on phone:
It's me. Leave a message.

239
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:26,881
Dad, dad, call me when you get this, please.

240
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:31,677
Look, you're cold.

241
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:33,185
Where's your coat?

242
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,725
Come here.

243
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:38,720
Thanks.

244
00:24:42,527 --> 00:24:44,022
What's the matter?

245
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:48,014
Do you see them?

246
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:53,603
- Yeah, who, the runner?
- No.

247
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:03,404
Never mind. It's just another thing that
prove that I'm going crazy.

248
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:09,305
So, where's home?

249
00:25:10,082 --> 00:25:11,622
A couple of blocks away.

250
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:14,652
No, I mean before.
Where did you come from?

251
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:19,373
Nowhere, really.
I travel a lot with my dad.

252
00:25:25,202 --> 00:25:29,868
Do you think there is a
difference between dreams and reality?

253
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,960
(Chuckles)
What happened to the small-talk?

254
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:36,509
No "what's your favourite band",
"do you Facebook", nothing like that?...

255
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:39,343
Fuck Facebook. Do you?

256
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:41,089
I never think about it.

257
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:45,720
- Everybody thinks about it.
- Not me.

258
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:48,490
Look, my life is complicated enough.

259
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:54,223
You should talk to my grandfather.
That's all he ever thinks about.

260
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:56,153
It drove him crazy.

261
00:25:56,188 --> 00:26:00,224
- It's driving me crazy.
- No, no, I mean he's insane.

262
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,344
Bat-shit nuts.

263
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:05,817
Back in my sweet, little hometown,

264
00:26:05,852 --> 00:26:08,837
Old man Leonard drools in a padded cell.

265
00:26:08,872 --> 00:26:11,748
He will tell you there are
no such things as dreams,

266
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:14,733
just endless realities all
piled on top of each other.

267
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:18,955
Some people see monsters,
Other people just see... people.

268
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,190
- And they locked him up for that?
- My mother had him committed.

269
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:28,469
- Jesus.
- Yeah, she's kind of intimidating, my mother.

270
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:34,103
No difference between fantasy and reality.

271
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:49,302
- I don't think I like my reality.
- You think anyone does?

272
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:55,016
At least I'm, who I think I am.
And you...

273
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,987
Yeah, pretty real...

274
00:26:58,022 --> 00:27:00,667
... and just, pretty.

275
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:06,495
Oh, a lousy pick up line.

276
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,061
Does it often work?

277
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:09,747
I never tried it before.

278
00:27:09,782 --> 00:27:11,251
How did it go down?

279
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:13,616
It was a crime against pick-up lines.

280
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:17,424
You're kind of funny, Heather.

281
00:27:17,459 --> 00:27:20,657
You're pretty fucked up,
but I don't know, I ...

282
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:22,871
I think you're goofy fun inside.

283
00:27:24,157 --> 00:27:29,794
Goofy fun...
That would be nice for a change.

284
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:34,108
Anyway, this is my street.

285
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:38,991
- Thanks for walking me back.
- I'd like to do it again sometime.

286
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,825
Vincent, you're nice, but...

287
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,949
- I don't think you wanna know me.
- I do.

288
00:27:43,984 --> 00:27:46,106
No, you don't.

289
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,681
I'm gonna call you later.

290
00:27:52,716 --> 00:27:54,866
I didn't give you my number.

291
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:56,749
See you around!

292
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,042
Dad?

293
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:06,372
Dad!

294
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:12,855
"COME TO SILENT HILL"

295
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:20,612
Dad!

296
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,778
Dad!

297
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:32,258
Dad...

298
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:36,671
Dad!

299
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:38,319
Dad!

300
00:28:53,004 --> 00:28:56,889
Heather, it's Vincent.
I heard you yell. Is everything alright?

301
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:02,164
I need your help.

302
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,622
Look,

303
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,466
Is that blood?

304
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:16,984
- Did you call the police?
- I can't.

305
00:29:17,018 --> 00:29:18,631
- Why not? They can help.
- I just can't!

306
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,564
- Okay?
- Okay.

307
00:29:24,144 --> 00:29:26,698
Well, do you know where this Silent Hill is?

308
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:28,760
No, it's ..

309
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:33,737
It's something that I dreamt about. My dad, he...
He warned me never to go there.

310
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,162
But I know that symbol.

311
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:39,900
This is it.

312
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:43,406
He kept it all in here.

313
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:48,190
"SHARON"

314
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,971
- Is this your mom?
- My adoptive mom, Rose.

315
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:55,372
You were adopted?

316
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:57,651
Yeah, I never knew my real parents.

317
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:09,681
- Did you write all of these?
- Yeah...

318
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:17,338
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

319
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:22,555
Looks like there's another
side that fits in here.

320
00:30:28,363 --> 00:30:30,977
A gun?
Why do you need a gun?

321
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:35,610
- Miss Mason, it's the police.
- I thought you said you didn't call.

322
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:37,414
- I didn't.
- Then why are they here?

323
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:40,683
- What is going on, Heather?
- I have to go.

324
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:42,502
If they catch me,
I'll never find my dad.

325
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:44,032
Catch you?
Why would they catch you?

326
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:47,359
- What have you done?
- Nothing! I haven't done anything, I swear.

327
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,683
- Help me.
- What do you want me to do?

328
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:52,642
- Can you drive?
- What?

329
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:54,421
I can't drive. Can you?

330
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:02,399
Santini, come here.

331
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:08,008
You want a probable cause?

332
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:09,684
This is it.

333
00:31:12,216 --> 00:31:14,183
What the hell happened here?

334
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:20,455
That look like a gang tag to you?

335
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,785
I don't think so.
But I've never seen anything like it.

336
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,182
Call Crime Scene, get them down here.

337
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,779
- What about the girl?
- She's a murder suspect.

338
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:56,921
"My dearest Sharon,

339
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,558
If you are reading this then
something has happened to me.

340
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:02,677
You're on your own now.

341
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,397
Don't try to find me.

342
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:07,195
And whatever you do,
don't go to Silent Hill.

343
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,392
I promised your mother I'd
keep you safe, but I failed.

344
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:13,772
I know you think we're
running from the police,

345
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:16,416
because of the man I killed
in Portland two years ago.

346
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,173
(You can't protect her forever!)

347
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:23,521
Dad!

348
00:32:23,556 --> 00:32:26,424
But the truth is...
He wasn't just a random thief.

349
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:28,226
(Get your things, we're leaving.)

350
00:32:28,261 --> 00:32:30,424
He was sent to take you back to Silent Hill.

351
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:33,943
He was a member of the Order.
These people want you, they need you.

352
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:37,962
I don't know why, but they will do everything
in their power just to draw you back.

353
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,740
You must resist it.

354
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:41,725
I tried to keep you safe.

355
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,044
And I never meant to lie to you,
but I had to.

356
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:48,640
You'll find the truth in my notebooks.
As much as I could find out.

357
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,119
I hope that when you
read what I learned,

358
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,378
you can finally begin to
understand who you really are.

359
00:32:55,031 --> 00:32:57,324
Please forgive me for not
telling you the truth.

360
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,128
But I did it to protect you.

361
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:01,687
I love you, Sharon."

362
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,466
Are you okay?

363
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,075
Do you wanna stop?

364
00:33:09,124 --> 00:33:10,555
No.

365
00:33:18,017 --> 00:33:19,873
What does it say?

366
00:33:19,908 --> 00:33:21,886
So much.

367
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:24,745
I know his writing, but this is crazy.

368
00:33:27,164 --> 00:33:30,237
It says:
"Silent Hill was originally a prison colony,

369
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:32,787
built on ground taken from the native Indians.

370
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:36,346
They called it
'The Place of the Silent Spirits'".

371
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,562
Never build on the ancient Indian burial grounds.

372
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:41,483
I thought everyone knew that.

373
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:49,061
It says here:
"Religious zealots called the Order of Valtiel,

374
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:52,354
secretly ran the town for the last 100 years.

375
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:57,365
They were waiting for a child to be born
to be a vessel for their god.

376
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,435
Who would then be resurrected and make the world anew."

377
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,767
It sounds like one of those crazy doomsday cults.

378
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:06,119
Yeah. Sounds like it.

379
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:12,041
There is a newspaper article.

380
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:16,322
"Fire in the coal mines got out of control"

381
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:21,122
"The whole place is still burning, deep underground.
Everyone had to leave."

382
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:27,306
My dad doesn't believe that, though.

383
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:28,584
No?

384
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,953
He says the town was cursed by
the power of a demon child.

385
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:36,872
Her name was Alessa. This Order
tried to cleanse her with fire.

386
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:40,066
But they failed. And
Alessa's revenge

387
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:44,219
was to summon a world of darkness,
filled with terrifying creatures.

388
00:34:44,254 --> 00:34:48,840
This one, it says, is her "guardian and executioner".

389
00:35:17,385 --> 00:35:19,024
We should stop.

390
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,380
- No, I want to keep going.
- I'm tired.

391
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:24,541
I need rest, you need rest.

392
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:58,831
Do you think they'll find us?

393
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,760
Someone will, eventually.

394
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:04,391
- You think we're far?
- No.

395
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,335
No, I think we're very close.

396
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,436
And I don't think you should go...

397
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:12,645
- What?
- I think your dad is right.

398
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,106
I don't think you should
go to Silent Hill.

399
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:15,106
I need to find him.

400
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:17,419
You read his notebooks. He wants you to run.

401
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:20,087
- Vincent...
- No, listen to me. The Order, they want you.

402
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:24,160
I think that's why they took Harry.

403
00:36:24,196 --> 00:36:27,064
- To make you come back.
- I don't have a choice.

404
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,357
- Don't you understand that?
- I understand.

405
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,694
I just...

406
00:36:36,914 --> 00:36:39,531
I just don't want anything to happen to you.

407
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:23,448
You didn't sleep?

408
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:28,518
No.

409
00:37:28,553 --> 00:37:31,174
We can't go any further.

410
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:37,076
We already talked about this.
I have to.

411
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:41,326
- Why can't you just trust me?
- It's for my dad. You don't understand.

412
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,891
- I do.
- No, you don't.

413
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:44,613
How could you?

414
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:48,017
Because I am a child of the Order.

415
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,292
What?

416
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:53,797
I was born and raised in Silent Hill.

417
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:57,502
I was chosen to come into this world,
to make sure you return.

418
00:37:57,537 --> 00:37:59,520
No.

419
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:01,651
No, that's not possible.

420
00:38:01,686 --> 00:38:04,918
The Order are trapped in
Silent Hill. The notebook says so.

421
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:08,277
It is possible for a few to escape
just for a while,

422
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:13,992
but it requires,
it requires sacrifice, and
suffering.

423
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,268
You have been chosen for this!

424
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:23,148
- How could you do this to me?
- My whole life all I've been taught,

425
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:26,993
All that any of us have taught is that
Alessa is the great evil of the world.

426
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:29,464
She trapped us, she brings the darkness.

427
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:32,171
And you... you are part of that evil.

428
00:38:32,967 --> 00:38:35,034
But I, I know that's not true.

429
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:40,745
After seeing you, after spending this time
with you, I know you're not evil, I ...

430
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,903
If you are part of Alessa...

431
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:45,996
... you're the innocent part.

432
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:48,906
- Every step of the way, you lied.
- I had to.

433
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:52,275
They were watching, protecting their
spirits into the world. You saw them.

434
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,637
You took my dad.

435
00:38:53,638 --> 00:38:56,449
Please believe me, I had nothing to do with that,

436
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,038
- I'm sorry.
- Why take him, why not just take me?

437
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:01,335
Because you have to return of your own free will.

438
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:03,065
Taking him, they knew you'd follow.

439
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:05,445
Why do I matter so much?

440
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:08,057
Because the Order can't be
free until Alessa is gone.

441
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:12,402
Her power keeps them trapped, and she can't
be destroyed until she's whole again.

442
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:15,468
- You will make that happen.
- What about my dad?

443
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:18,461
- Is he still alive?
- Yes, but not for long.

444
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:22,171
My mother, Claudia, won't keep him
alive after she has what she wants.

445
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:24,651
- Where is he?
- In the sanctuary beneath the town.

446
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:26,509
- Wait, Heather, stop...
- No!

447
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:29,368
You need this.

448
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:33,320
You have to find the other half. It's the only
way you'll be able to save your dad.

449
00:39:34,514 --> 00:39:36,321
My grandfather has it.

450
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,856
The one in the asylum?

451
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:42,570
Yes, Leonard Wolf.

452
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:47,117
- It's dangerous. Let me help you.
- No! Get off of me!

453
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:49,300
- Listen!
- No...

454
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:52,543
- What is happening?
- The Darkness is coming.

455
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:56,790
Heather...

456
00:39:57,225 --> 00:39:58,615
What's going on?

457
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,405
Stop! Make it stop!

458
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,047
- You did this.
- No.

459
00:40:20,082 --> 00:40:22,109
It's not me.

460
00:40:22,144 --> 00:40:23,539
How could it be me?

461
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,901
Because you are part of Alessa.

462
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:38,557
You're so close, you allowed
the darkness to break through.

463
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,573
Vincent, what is going on?

464
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,877
I don't know.

465
00:40:47,097 --> 00:40:48,400
Vincent!

466
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,561
WELCOME TO SILENT HILL

467
00:44:07,547 --> 00:44:09,219
Burn the Witch!

468
00:44:11,403 --> 00:44:14,437
You should not be here.

469
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:22,144
They will use you.

470
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:25,108
We will all suffer now.

471
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:27,794
I know who you are.

472
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:31,225
You're her mother.

473
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,484
Alessa's mother.

474
00:44:34,994 --> 00:44:37,621
How could you let them burn her?

475
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:40,554
No, I loved her.

476
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:43,229
It's alright, sweetheart.

477
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:47,433
It's okay. It's alright

478
00:44:47,468 --> 00:44:49,654
I was deceived.

479
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,313
I never wanted this for her.

480
00:44:55,348 --> 00:44:57,414
Alessa: Where are you taking me?

481
00:44:57,449 --> 00:44:59,548
Mommy! Mommy!

482
00:45:04,053 --> 00:45:06,821
Alessa was special.

483
00:45:06,856 --> 00:45:10,861
She was the only one who could
survive the fire, that's why she was chosen.

484
00:45:10,896 --> 00:45:13,208
No, no!

485
00:45:17,546 --> 00:45:20,139
But it only led to our damnation.

486
00:45:20,174 --> 00:45:22,717
You all got what you deserved.

487
00:45:23,498 --> 00:45:27,714
Yes, and I became the mother of the demon.

488
00:45:28,943 --> 00:45:31,625
But you are her daughter.

489
00:45:33,302 --> 00:45:35,052
What are you talking about?

490
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:40,010
Alessa didn't die in the fire,
but she suffered so much.

491
00:45:41,897 --> 00:45:45,199
For pain was only matched by the rage.

492
00:45:45,234 --> 00:45:48,749
And with that rage, her powers grew...

493
00:45:48,784 --> 00:45:51,161
... beyond all comprehension.

494
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:57,069
Alessa knew there was a part of her,
that could still be free from pain.

495
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:03,188
So she took that last,
innocent part of her soul

496
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:08,523
and placed it into a
new born, orphan child.

497
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,026
You.

498
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:18,174
You were secretly taken from here,

499
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:21,466
to be raised by loving, but unaware parents.

500
00:46:26,855 --> 00:46:30,336
You're the only part of Alessa
that feels love.

501
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:35,279
You have the balance of hate.
You should never have come back.

502
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:38,636
Because now you have given the order
what they could never have...

503
00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:43,431
A way to destroy Alessa.
And you.

504
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:45,727
Where is my father?

505
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:49,272
There is nothing you can do to
save him without damning yourself.

506
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,753
I don't care.
Just tell me what you know.

507
00:46:57,717 --> 00:46:59,982
I know the darkness is coming.

508
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:06,121
It's safer to be inside.

509
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,441
Run.

510
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,444
Run!

511
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:22,268
No!

512
00:50:11,154 --> 00:50:12,898
What?

513
00:50:12,933 --> 00:50:15,033
Help me.

514
00:50:25,643 --> 00:50:26,842
No!

515
00:50:28,731 --> 00:50:30,403
Run.

516
00:50:41,716 --> 00:50:43,637
I'm here, I'll help you!

517
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,322
- What happened?
- Run, she's coming.

518
00:50:47,357 --> 00:50:49,175
What's coming?

519
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:05,723
Come on! Run!

520
00:51:38,877 --> 00:51:42,178
- Where did you come from?
- I took a wrong turn...

521
00:51:42,214 --> 00:51:44,134
Got lost in the fog...

522
00:51:54,257 --> 00:51:55,765
Go! Come on!

523
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:01,813
No!

524
00:52:02,717 --> 00:52:04,467
This way.

525
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,401
Run!

526
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:29,355
Go!

527
00:52:41,983 --> 00:52:44,164
My own son...

528
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,171
Mother, please...

529
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:48,304
... betrayed us.

530
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,318
She is not evil.

531
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:56,791
Your mind is corrupted by her darkness.

532
00:52:58,081 --> 00:53:01,728
You were young to be given this task...

533
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:04,633
I understand.

534
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:07,835
You created Alessa.

535
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:10,968
The darkness is your evil reflected back at us.

536
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,072
- She is innocent.
- She is innocent?

537
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:18,665
- You are insane, just as your grandfather is insane.
- Kill him! Burn him!

538
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:19,666
Make him suffer!

539
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:21,662
- Let the God judge him!
- No!

540
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:29,535
You succeeded.

541
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:34,237
Even in your madness,
you guided her back to us.

542
00:53:42,235 --> 00:53:47,484
- And a broken mind can be mended.
- No.

543
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:48,893
Mother, please don't.

544
00:53:48,928 --> 00:53:50,451
Take him to the asylum.

545
00:53:50,451 --> 00:53:51,653
- No.
- Cure him.

546
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:52,752
No!

547
00:54:13,322 --> 00:54:15,910
"Brookhaven Asylum"

548
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:17,998
Leonard.

549
00:55:06,612 --> 00:55:09,100
Do you think someone knows?

550
00:55:09,136 --> 00:55:10,860
No.

551
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:12,958
No one knows.

552
00:55:12,993 --> 00:55:14,643
Okay.

553
00:55:14,677 --> 00:55:17,213
I love you too.

554
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:14,590
Leonard Wolf.

555
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,668
Okay.

556
00:56:21,238 --> 00:56:23,595
S-12.

557
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,801
S-12.

558
00:59:13,432 --> 00:59:14,524
Leonard.

559
00:59:16,621 --> 00:59:18,908
Hello, child.

560
00:59:22,279 --> 00:59:26,165
Please come, come closer,
so, so I could touch you.

561
00:59:27,137 --> 00:59:29,190
I don't think so.

562
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:31,706
- Did Claudia send you?
- Claudia?

563
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:35,231
- Yeah.
- No. She put you here.

564
00:59:35,266 --> 00:59:38,952
My own daughter says that I'm
corrupted by the darkness.

565
00:59:38,953 --> 00:59:41,554
She says that I'm a monster.

566
00:59:42,834 --> 00:59:45,301
She's far worse than I am.

567
00:59:45,336 --> 00:59:49,546
She is also corrupted by the same darkness.

568
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:53,479
- I am looking for my father.
- Is he lost?

569
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,776
He's in Silent Hill.

570
00:59:56,585 --> 01:00:00,004
There are many Silent Hills.
Are you sure it's this one?

571
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:01,375
Vincent said you know how to...

572
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:03,909
Vincent, that little traitor...

573
01:00:03,944 --> 01:00:07,232
My own flesh and blood turned against me!

574
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:09,875
Listen. Ahh.

575
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:13,464
You may be able to hear
the cries of his torment.

576
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:15,988
He's here?

577
01:00:15,989 --> 01:00:19,653
Where else would you go to mend your mind?

578
01:00:19,654 --> 01:00:21,965
Like yours is?

579
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,112
Why ..

580
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:28,050
I'm just...  an ongoing project.

581
01:00:29,638 --> 01:00:32,598
I have half of this.

582
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:35,526
- Will it help me?
- Listen...

583
01:00:35,562 --> 01:00:38,633
I'm blind, child.

584
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:42,421
I cannot see what you have there.

585
01:00:42,456 --> 01:00:47,270
Place it in my hand
and I will try to help you.

586
01:00:47,305 --> 01:00:49,638
Don't be afraid.

587
01:00:50,003 --> 01:00:51,611
Come on.

588
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,441
- You know what it is.
- I was the Master of the Order.

589
01:01:05,356 --> 01:01:08,643
How could I not know
the Seal of Metatron?

590
01:01:08,678 --> 01:01:13,939
It was stolen from me and used
by her to escape with the child.

591
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:18,095
Without it we cannot summon the god.

592
01:01:18,129 --> 01:01:21,042
It is a key. What does it unlock?

593
01:01:23,135 --> 01:01:26,522
The true nature of things.

594
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,846
I need to find the other half.

595
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:36,318
But you've already found it.
The other half is in me!

596
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:38,708
What are you doing?
No!

597
01:01:39,176 --> 01:01:40,550
Stop!

598
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:44,610
Stop!

599
01:01:55,801 --> 01:01:59,218
Now...  I see the truth of you.

600
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:03,410
You're a demon!
You must be destroyed!

601
01:02:03,445 --> 01:02:04,939
Not today.

602
01:03:31,555 --> 01:03:34,079
Two halves coming together.

603
01:03:34,113 --> 01:03:36,162
It's complete.

604
01:04:05,144 --> 01:04:06,156
Alessa?

605
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:10,055
Can you feel me?

606
01:04:12,507 --> 01:04:15,485
You know I'm here, don't you?

607
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,514
You know I've got the Seal of Metatron.

608
01:04:50,316 --> 01:04:53,281
Somebody help me.

609
01:06:10,236 --> 01:06:11,725
No.

610
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:16,955
Get back! Get back!

611
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:21,182
And you!

612
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,832
Get back!

613
01:07:24,867 --> 01:07:26,356
- Look out!
- Get back!

614
01:07:35,824 --> 01:07:37,623
Do it! Do it!

615
01:08:47,372 --> 01:08:49,460
How can I find my dad?

616
01:08:49,496 --> 01:08:52,207
- Heather, help me.
- Tell me where he is.

617
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:58,169
In the sanctuary, beneath
the amusement park.

618
01:08:58,204 --> 01:09:00,315
I can help you.

619
01:09:05,737 --> 01:09:07,072
Fine.

620
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:17,580
Hurry!

621
01:09:17,615 --> 01:09:19,092
I am hurrying!

622
01:09:20,148 --> 01:09:21,230
Oh, shit.

623
01:09:33,809 --> 01:09:35,042
Stop!

624
01:09:35,077 --> 01:09:37,280
- Heather, stop.
- We need a knife.

625
01:10:14,689 --> 01:10:17,031
How can you live like this?

626
01:10:17,066 --> 01:10:20,317
This darkness, those creatures?

627
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,849
That's all I've ever known.

628
01:10:24,802 --> 01:10:26,754
My reality.

629
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,549
Darkness should have faded by now.

630
01:10:31,584 --> 01:10:34,983
- Why hasn't it?
- You're so close to Alessa,

631
01:10:35,019 --> 01:10:37,882
two halves coming together again,
it's changing the world.

632
01:10:39,007 --> 01:10:40,770
What's gonna happen?

633
01:10:40,805 --> 01:10:42,872
That's up to you.

634
01:10:46,104 --> 01:10:48,581
Lakeside Amusement Park is over there.

635
01:10:48,972 --> 01:10:51,768
And the entrance to the sanctuary.

636
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,379
Do you think you can save him?

637
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:05,590
I have to try. My dad gave up
his life to protect me.

638
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:09,418
- I think he'd want you to leave.
- You don't know that.

639
01:11:11,743 --> 01:11:14,972
If he loved you, he wouldn't
want you to be in any danger.

640
01:11:16,477 --> 01:11:21,995
And if you love someone, you know
that you will never give up.

641
01:12:11,012 --> 01:12:12,507
No, wait!

642
01:12:13,224 --> 01:12:14,696
Get down.

643
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:18,137
- Look.
- Are they soldiers?

644
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:20,055
Not really.

645
01:12:20,091 --> 01:12:24,268
We call them "the Brethren".
The most devout servants of the Order.

646
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:28,575
See the masks? They won't breathe
the air of the darkness.

647
01:12:28,608 --> 01:12:30,405
They think it corrupts them.

648
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:38,138
I hope you find him.

649
01:12:38,173 --> 01:12:41,561
I hope live free and happy,
It's more than I ever did.

650
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,755
What are you talking about?

651
01:12:48,983 --> 01:12:50,468
Vincent, no!

652
01:14:29,447 --> 01:14:33,121
- Alessa?
- Daughter.

653
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:36,704
Sister.

654
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:39,161
- Self.
- No.

655
01:14:39,196 --> 01:14:42,677
I gave you life so you
could live my dream.

656
01:14:42,713 --> 01:14:46,037
You're the part of me that
can be free of this pain.

657
01:14:46,072 --> 01:14:48,248
Live, and feel love.

658
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:49,804
Do you feel nothing?

659
01:14:49,839 --> 01:14:51,945
Nothing but hate.

660
01:14:56,811 --> 01:14:59,161
They say you are a demon.

661
01:14:59,196 --> 01:15:02,674
- They are right.
- You created this nightmare.

662
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:06,757
Everyone has a different
nightmare in Silent Hill.

663
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:09,424
- I am theirs.
- I have to save my father.

664
01:15:09,459 --> 01:15:12,617
He's not my father, or yours.

665
01:15:13,005 --> 01:15:16,197
And sacrifices, have to be made.

666
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:17,275
Go to hell!

667
01:15:17,688 --> 01:15:21,678
Don't you see?
We're already here.

668
01:15:25,409 --> 01:15:28,852
And you're not welcome!

669
01:15:31,934 --> 01:15:36,506
Do you think, I won't destroy you?

670
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:38,841
I don't care.

671
01:15:38,876 --> 01:15:41,676
I am you.

672
01:15:45,747 --> 01:15:49,790
Time to take back what I gave you!

673
01:15:57,772 --> 01:15:59,886
Stop!

674
01:16:02,168 --> 01:16:06,796
We are one, Heather.

675
01:18:00,063 --> 01:18:01,373
Dad!

676
01:18:02,814 --> 01:18:03,963
Sharon!

677
01:18:05,669 --> 01:18:07,038
Sharon.

678
01:18:13,037 --> 01:18:14,403
You don't hurt her!

679
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:24,556
What do you want from me?

680
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:26,427
Look around you.

681
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:28,411
This was our sanctuary.

682
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:33,175
A last, safe place from the darkness.

683
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:37,636
And now, even here, has fallen to her evil.

684
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:42,322
But praise the god,
that you are here, finally.

685
01:18:42,357 --> 01:18:46,990
- You have delivered us.
- I have done nothing for you.

686
01:18:47,025 --> 01:18:49,447
You have done everything.

687
01:18:49,483 --> 01:18:52,805
Defeated Alyssa.
Re-joined the seal.

688
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:55,779
You are the savior.

689
01:19:05,302 --> 01:19:07,992
If I've done so much,

690
01:19:08,027 --> 01:19:10,639
Then let my father go.

691
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:17,230
He cannot go. His blood
will feed the newborn god ..

692
01:19:19,369 --> 01:19:22,240
Just as your body will be its incubator.

693
01:19:22,276 --> 01:19:24,388
Why?

694
01:19:25,535 --> 01:19:28,370
- Why me?
- It is your destiny.

695
01:19:29,028 --> 01:19:32,545
You have been chosen many
years ago to be the vessel.

696
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:36,384
The god can only be born through your flesh.

697
01:19:37,034 --> 01:19:40,588
And then we will be free from this prison

698
01:19:40,683 --> 01:19:43,288
to cleanse the world of its sins.

699
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:53,653
And all we need... is your body.

700
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:55,959
No!

701
01:19:55,995 --> 01:19:57,874
You leave her alone!

702
01:20:00,598 --> 01:20:05,345
You have the Seal of Metatron.
With it, I can summon the god.

703
01:20:05,382 --> 01:20:06,825
Give it to me.

704
01:20:16,951 --> 01:20:21,128
Take it, I want to see
the truth of what you are.

705
01:21:14,247 --> 01:21:15,858
- Dad!
- Sharon.

706
01:22:52,864 --> 01:22:54,858
The ash...

707
01:22:54,894 --> 01:22:57,217
It's stopped!

708
01:22:58,454 --> 01:23:01,843
- Was it you?
- No, it's not me.

709
01:23:01,878 --> 01:23:05,790
I think things are gonna be
different around here from now on..

710
01:23:05,824 --> 01:23:09,902
The Order's power is broken.
Alessa's nightmare is over.

711
01:23:09,937 --> 01:23:12,609
- She's gone.
- Another one will come.

712
01:23:14,597 --> 01:23:17,357
This is the place of lost souls.

713
01:23:21,503 --> 01:23:23,285
What's wrong?

714
01:23:23,929 --> 01:23:27,024
- I can't leave.
- Why?

715
01:23:29,712 --> 01:23:33,161
- I have to stay here.
- But dad, we're free.

716
01:23:33,197 --> 01:23:34,794
We're safe.

717
01:23:34,828 --> 01:23:37,655
- For the first time.
- I'm gonna find your mother.

718
01:23:37,689 --> 01:23:41,071
You saved my life.
And I can never repay you.

719
01:23:41,107 --> 01:23:43,689
But Rose is still trapped here somewhere .

720
01:23:44,174 --> 01:23:46,739
- I'm gonna find her.
- Let me help you find her.

721
01:23:46,774 --> 01:23:51,408
No. I promised her, once you
were safe, I'll come back.

722
01:23:51,444 --> 01:23:55,510
This is my task.
You've done what you had to do.

723
01:23:56,388 --> 01:24:02,253
Now, I want you to be free, finally.

724
01:24:02,289 --> 01:24:05,069
Do you understand why I have to do this?

725
01:24:11,727 --> 01:24:14,780
You're everything I could've ever wished for.

726
01:24:20,917 --> 01:24:25,067
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too, Dad.

727
01:24:32,598 --> 01:24:36,324
Vincent, look after my little girl,
do you hear?

728
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:38,979
I don't think she needs me for that.

729
01:25:15,562 --> 01:25:17,435
Come on.

730
01:25:18,172 --> 01:25:20,449
Yeah.

731
01:25:51,391 --> 01:25:52,751
Come on in.

732
01:25:52,785 --> 01:25:54,554
Watch your step.

733
01:25:56,562 --> 01:25:58,369
- Thanks.
- No problem.

734
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:02,736
You're lucky I came by.
I haven't been this way in a long time.

735
01:26:03,969 --> 01:26:06,255
- Travis Grady.
- Vincent.

736
01:26:07,473 --> 01:26:09,801
- Sharon.
- Nice to meet you.

737
01:26:09,835 --> 01:26:12,110
So where're you two lovebirds headed?

738
01:26:13,124 --> 01:26:16,191
Just take us as far away
from here as you can.

739
01:26:16,753 --> 01:26:19,027
- Amen to that!
- Got it.
