<i>automatically drop from
the compartment above your seat....</i>

154
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,600
Look, it means the hair is not good.

155
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,400
And did I not tell you
I want blue eyes?

156
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,000
Doubt beyond all doubts.
Just turn them out.

157
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,890
Look! I get--
I gotta go.

158
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay, we're taking off.

159
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,000
ON THE PA:
<i>Stay where you are. Enjoy your flight.</i>

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Excuse me, Sir.

161
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,200
Please put that in overhead
compartment. Here I'll get it.

162
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,300
No, just--
I'll do it.

163
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,750
Okay.

164
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,400
It's okay.
It will be set up there.

165
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,160
So I'm backpacking to Asia.

166
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,100
- It's going to be awesome.
I'm a kid someway from Bali-- - Excuse me.

167
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,480
- All electronic devices have to be--
- No problem.

168
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,200
Off.

169
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,250
It's total early myth, by the way.

170
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,880
I guarantee I'll leave this staying on.
This plane is not going to crash.

171
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,560
So why did they say it then?

172
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,250
That's the man trying to keep us
down controlling our thoughts.

173
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,700
Here.

174
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,970
Yeah?

175
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,900
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,160
GROUND CONTROLLER: <i>Vista Pacific 7500.
You are clear for take off on runway 2-8-1.</i>

177
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,360
Engage thrust mode.

178
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,100
CO-PILOT:
Eight knots.

179
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,760
<i>A pretty....</i>

180
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,300
<i>It's a beautiful lookout.
Look at that.</i>

181
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,100
<i>On the air look alike.</i>

182
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,490
<i>She lived in a castle.
Look, it's here. Do you see?</i>

183
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,850
The captain's turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.

184
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,800
<i>So feel free to move
about the cabin.</i>

185
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,000
<i>However, we do recommend
when seated you put...</i>

186
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,800
<i>your seat bell secured right back,
in case of unexpected turbulence.</i>

187
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,850
See?

188
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,100
All have been myth.

189
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,450
Hey, why do I feel
you turned it off?

190
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,450
But I didn't.

191
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,280
That's the phone stash?

192
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,400
I sell 100 bucks each.
For one of these, you need one?

193
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,400
Oh, no. I don't need a
stolen cellphone, no.

194
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,570
Hey. Times are tough, sister.

195
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,560
Look around! There's a
global financial crisis.

196
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,200
Who screwed the pooch, man?
Things help our gen, why?

197
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,200
Got to make a living somehow.
Surfing ain't free!

198
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm sure there is.
It's water.

199
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,100
In cash, girl friend. In cash.

200
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,640
LIZ: This is my dress.
I acutally designed it myself.

201
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,800
LIZ: Oh, honey. There is your dad.
Rick's dad... Oop! He's great.

202
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,950
When he get drunk, he's a little
touchy to real reasonings.

203
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,550
You know, nobody tells you
about all the questions.

204
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,500
Like, should you bring your hair up?
Should you pull your hair down?

205
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,800
My God, I didn't realize--

206
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
You got so many.

207
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,280
Look at our rings.

208
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,650
I showed you mine, it might be
a little bigger. But those are pretty.

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,680
Have you seen 16-I?

210
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,040
Oh, yeah. He still eats wafer,
pretzels supply!

211
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,200
Hey, Jacky. Can you get me two
bottles of champagne? - Okay.

212
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,650
What about... row eleven,
miserable married couple?

213
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,150
They haven't said a word
in the entire flight.

214
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,840
They hated each other's gut.

215
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,640
You think she may have compassion,
or you think it's a bad choice?

216
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Uh, he grates my ass twice already,

217
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,150
so I think wrong choice counts.

218
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,200
And then we have
a bridezilla on 16-F.

219
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,880
She won't quit with the wedding photos.

220
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,800
But she didn't take 18 months and a half on the date.

221
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,500
It's hard planning a wedding
when you find one.

222
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,100
Exactly!
30,000 feet above the reality.

223
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,760
- You, I meant, though.
- I thought you loved this job.

224
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,970
You love this job, but...
life is messy when you grow up.

225
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
Yeah.

226
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,360
So what's the deal?

227
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,000
You think he really
leave his wife?

228
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,600
Three days alone in Tokyo.

229
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,700
It's gonna work out.

230
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,200
You see?

231
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,000
Right, we have chicken, fish, and
you know, we have a live band.

232
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,700
- Oh! Can you? Seat in?
- I get to go.

233
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,160
- She must need the restroom.
- Yeah.

234
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
She's lovely.

235
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,480
You want to make sure the
one next to us. Yeah, sure.

236
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,240
Okay.

237
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,050
Excuse me. Would you like to see
our wedding photos?

238
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,360
You know, it's such an amazing day.

239
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,880
(Loud music through headphones)
What? I, uh... Sorry. Can't hear you.

240
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,040
- Okay.
- Would you like something to drink?

241
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,700
Fill me a glass of milk, please.

242
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,520
I know she didn't issue
very cold dark. (Clears throat)

243
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,960
You're okay?

244
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
(Glass shatters)

245
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,480
(laughs)
That's really cool.

246
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,300
CAPTAIN ON THE PA: <i>Sorry about that, folks.
We hit some unstable air.</i>

247
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,200
<i>But it looks safe with you right now.</i>

248
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,650
(Whisper) It's okay right now.

249
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,960
- And you?
- Yeah.

250
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,720
(Gasps short of breath)

251
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,500
- Here we go.
- Tell me, are you okay?

252
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,160
- Thanks.
- That's okay.

253
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,240
(Gasps)

254
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,240
- You okay?
- No, I can't just breathe.

255
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,840
- Help. We need help here.
- Yes. What is it?

256
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,680
He-- He just said
he couldn't breath.

257
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,330
Sir? Are you okay?

258
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,840
(Man gasps)

259
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,760
Suzy. Come here.

260
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,480
- I'm going to get the first aid kit.
- Okay. Go ahead.

261
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,800
SUZY: Sir, take a deep breath.

262
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,150
Is there a doctor or medical professional
in our plane?

263
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,000
<i>Please identify yourself to the crew
if you hear me.</i>

264
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,000
<i>Please identify yourself
if you hear me. Thank you.</i>

265
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,800
(Man groans loudly)

266
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Breathe. It's okay.

267
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,300
No... I can't breathe.

268
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,320
- Don't you take a deep breath?
- Please! - Oh, God.

269
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,500
All right, breathe!

270
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,400
MAN: What's going on?
What's going on? Is he sick?

271
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,000
- Is he sick? What's going on?
RICK: I think I can help you.

272
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,800
He's having trouble breathing.

273
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,000
- He just can't breath.
- I just leaving. Thank you.

274
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,600
- Now, nitroglycerin.
- Yeah, yeah.

275
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,360
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

276
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,700
BRAD: Now his heart is a little worse.
Take his pulse.

277
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,200
- Are you a doctor?
BRAD: I am paramedic.

278
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,600
- You know how to take blood pressure?
RICK: All right, yeah.

279
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,880
I'm right with you, sir.

280
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,400
Here.

281
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,680
Look at me! Hey. Look at me!
Look at me! Look at me!

282
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,960
Squeeze my hand for "Yes".
Okay?

283
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,800
Do you have chest pain?
Are you epileptic?

284
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,450
- Diabetics? Asthma?
PATIENT: Asthma.

285
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,400
- Pulse is 90.
- Take a breath. Deep breath.

286
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,400
Okay. Everything's fine.

287
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,000
No.

288
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,250
No other time, I say.

289
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,600
I don't want to die in a plane.

290
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,920
(Crying out loud)

291
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,570
Breathe in! Breathe in!
Breathe in!

292
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,960
Oh, no! Look!

293
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,650
Grasp him! What happens?

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,520
Hey, sir.

295
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,350
- He's not breathing.
- So?

296
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,370
We take him to the galley.
Three, two, one, go.

297
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,280
All right. I help passenger.

298
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,700
Down. Right.

299
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
- You got an AED?
- Yeah. - Yes.

300
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,400
I'll do compressions,
You do mouth. Come here.

301
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,800
MAN: OKay.

302
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,850
AED: <i>Analyzing heart rhythm.</i>
BRAD: Clear.

303
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,450
<i>- Analyzing picked CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).</i>
- Please!

304
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,520
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

305
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,750
And breathe.

306
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,320
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, breathe.

307
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,000
Stay clear!

308
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,880
LAURA: Come on.

309
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Sorry.

310
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,800
- Sorry, he's gone.
- No.

311
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,250
No.

312
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,500
BRAD: He's gone.

313
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,680
- He just died.
- What?

314
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,400
San Francisco Radio. Confirm
the name of the deceased passenger.

315
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,370
Lance Morrell.
Travelling alone. Seat 17C.

316
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,440
Do not chance to resuscitation.

317
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,920
Where it seems landing is
unnecessary and dangerous.

318
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,440
<i>Understand Vista Pacific 7500.
What is your intention?</i>

319
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,410
Continue the flight plan in the file.

320
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,150
<i>Roger that.
Vista Pacific 7500 have it.</i>

321
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,700
<i>We have a medical team
waiting for you at Haneda.</i>

322
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,600
Understand.

323
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,100
How many passengers
saw our effort?

324
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,500
Uh, 11 to 18 in economy,

325
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't know about the rest,
the curtain's real close.

326
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,760
Okay. That's good.

327
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,920
So if anyone asks, you say
a passenger is ill.

328
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,600
Where he go, like south address,
like south Tokyo.

329
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,600
You don't want to cause the panic.

330
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
What do we do with the body?

331
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,900
We can relocate everyone
comfortably downstairs in the economy.

332
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,920
And still provide you with
upper class room with amenities.

333
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,800
And as compensation, each passenger
will receive two vouchers...

334
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,500
for upper pass round trip
travel everywhere in the world.

335
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,880
- What happened?
- I don't know.

336
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,080
The guy just passed last night.

337
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,920
(Murmurs of passengers)

338
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,760
Yes, I under--
I understand, uh,

339
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,160
I'm afraid there's no choice.

340
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,550
In events like this
the pilot in command has...

341
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,040
the legal authority
to enforce decisions.

342
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,700
No need no worry, okay?

343
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,480
- Mm-hm.
- Take your bag.

344
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,920
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

345
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,700
Okay, now, any help here?

346
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,000
- I'm on this.
- That's okay.

347
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,040
Ground speed: 898 km/h

348
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,640
In-Flight time: 2 hr 28 minutes
Time to Destination: 8 hr 20 minutes

349
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,040
(speaker beeps)

350
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,160
So let me get this straight:
We're going on our honeymoon.

351
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,080
And you're kissing your part to a man
with blood all over his mouth.

352
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,890
He was dying.

353
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,520
For whatever you die from
his mouth is all over your lips.

354
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,840
Herpes, HIV-1!
Your table's ready.

355
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,840
Hey, Liz.

356
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,690
Now the party for two.

357
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,200
Hey, on this--
Excuse me?

358
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,040
- Down there and check it out.
- (On lips) Okay.

359
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,050
(Giggles)

360
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,890
How long his body
starts decomposing?

361
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,360
I have no idea.

362
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,000
I smell him already.

363
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,840
We're trapped with the dead body
for the next 6 hours.

364
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
- Come in?
MAN 1: Okay.

365
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,700
- Come in?
MAN 2: Okay.

366
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,120
I'm sorry about that.

367
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,360
Don't you act like
you're not at all freak out,

368
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,720
the creepy scorpion girl!

369
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
Death is a part of life.

370
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,400
It's part of your life, maybe,
but not part of mine.

371
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,400
There will be one day.

372
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I knew it.

373
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,880
He's already cold!

374
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,400
Pretty good bitch.

375
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,900
Take it well.

376
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,900
Long time!

377
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Look!

378
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,760
Look!

379
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,880
(Hand squeaks on the glass)

380
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,900
Where do we go?

381
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,500
Halfway this way.

382
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,500
You got it?

383
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,850
Yes.

384
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,520
- Thank you. - All right.
- Keep watching.

385
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,700
- Okay!
- I'm great!

386
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Suzy.

387
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,000
We have to buckle him in.

388
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,240
What? Stupid seat bell!

389
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,320
Okay. Lets go.
Lets get out of here.

390
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,880
Hey. You gave help to
the dead guy, right?

391
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,440
- What happened to him?
- (Sighs) I don't know.

392
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,920
Could it get contagious?

393
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,200
Might be.

394
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,450
Hey.

395
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,040
You know, um,
how you were saying before?

396
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,120
You know,
"death is a part of life."

397
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,000
I agree with you.

398
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,600
Yeah.

399
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,480
Yeah.

400
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,560
When the guy died, probably thought
he had all the time in the world.

401
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,900
He sat on the plane,

402
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,000
had no idea he was on
an end today.

403
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,600
And maybe he want
to write a book.

404
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,000
Maybe he want to have kids.

405
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,640
Sorry. Too late.

406
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,040
But you remember that
one day, you and I,

407
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,080
all of us,
we'll all be dead.

408
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,920
You don't want waste one second of
whatever time you have left.

409
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,100
Yes. I wish I can live like that.

410
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,600
- Oh, why can't you?!
- No.

411
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,720
Peope get all tied up in what
they think they should do.

412
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,120
'Cause you die, you die.

413
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,280
Nobody's gonna give you a gold star
in heaven to go in a business school.

414
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,090
And marry a house wife.

415
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,160
I'm now with the business school.

416
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,500
Good.

417
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,760
All I guessed.

418
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,600
- Obviously!
- Yes. (Laughs)

419
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
(clears throat)
Excuse me!

420
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,570
Hey, honey. I'm just, uh,
showing her our wedding photos,

421
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,000
and (Thickit Fidda?!),
how we could organize them keep doing by--

422
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,040
Yeah, forget the photos.
Okay.

423
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,450
People a kind of start dropping in the aisle,
they're peering our kind of stuff.

424
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,800
It's my honeymoon.

425
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,090
"Pregnancy test"

426
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,250
(sighs)

427
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,480
Hi, can I get you some coffee?

428
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,720
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

429
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,440
Here we go.

430
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,960
(Sighs)

431
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,440
Please don't smile.
Please don't smile.

432
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
(Cries out)

433
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,480
(sizzle)

434
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,680
(plastic bottle crack)

435
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,480
Everybody, put your seat back on!

436
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,360
Let me go!

437
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,850
(Glass shatters)

438
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,160
(screams)

439
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,930
(passengers scream)

440
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,520
(motors are noisier)

441
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,090
(passengers scream)

442
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,600
- Oh God!
- No!

443
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,900
Oh, No!

444
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,160
"CABIN PRESSURE"
"Oxygen Deployed..."

445

(alarm beeps)

446
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,160
Tom, put your mask on!
Come on!

447
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,100
(Screams)
MAN: Come on!

448
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,000
Come on, Tom, breath!
Tom, put it on!

449
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
- Brad.
- Grasp one.

450
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,300
Here. Put it on for me.

451
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,300
Take mine.

452
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,600
Please!

453
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,520
(Gasps)

454
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,680
- No!
- No!

455
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,000
(Screams)

456
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Richard.

457
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,480
Put on!

458
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,800
All right.

459
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,800
Hang on.

460
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Pia.

461
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,000
Pia.

462
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,690
"Emergency Oxygen"

463
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,600
Pia.

464
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,100
Breathe.

465
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,000
Breathe.

466
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,000
- Aah!
- Breath!

467
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,650
(Both can breathe normally)

468
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,240
I remove my mask.

469
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,050
- You okay?
- Yeah.

470
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,960
ON THE PA:
<i>This is Captain speaking.</i>

471
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,000
<i>This is convenient cabin pressure...</i>

472
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,350
<i>on board.
Computer indicates...</i>

473
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,770
that the seal was damaged
from the previous turbulence.

474
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,600
We isolate the issue
and we fly a lower altitude.

475
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,640
<i>Cabin pressure is restored to normal.</i>

476
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,690
<i>You may remove your oxygen masks
and breathe freely.</i>

477
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,650
<i>Any passengers in distress,
please now find Flightcom.</i>

478
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,600
LAURA: <i>Everyone in the seat.
Keep belt fastened.</i>

479
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,200
Sir, are you okay?
Is that really okay?

480
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh, my God.

481
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,450
Come on. Come on.

482
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,880
Good. It's me.

483
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,360
Just breathe. Breathe.
Breathe, please.

484
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,200
Come on.

485
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,800
Honey, please.

486
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,300
Honey....

487
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,350
Okay, that's it. Slow down.

488
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,880
Slow down.
It's okay. It's okay.

489
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,770
Okay. Good to you.

490
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,720
You're okay. You're okay.

491
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,680
You're saved.

492
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,680
- Are you doing okay?
- Um, no.

493
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,760
I had told you
you shouldn't have come on this trip.

494
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,490
(Pia cackles)

495
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,600
I thought we were going down.

496
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah.

497
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,680
You know, I shouldn't go,
'cause my finger nail were blue.

498
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,440
Oxygen deprivation.

499
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Can you clean that up?

500
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,500
- Hey, Suzy. We should do a sweep.
- Okay.

501
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,200
Yes.

502
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,480
- Any trash?
- Thank you.

503
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,920
(Child laughs)

504
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,520
We could've tried it again.

505
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,880
I couldn't.
Not a third time.

506
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,480
What if it had happened again?

507
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,600
I was younger, all I want to do
is be a mom.

508
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,000
I have talked about
the job and career.

509
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,550
You wanted to be happy while your
friends think you're cool and ambitious.

510
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,800
But...

511
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,200
in my heart, my real dream,

512
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,200
I just wanted a home with you
and our children when they laughs.

513
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,760
Yeah, so do I.

514
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,560
I was just...

515
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,200
helpless.

516
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,810
The first time, I--

517
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,120
Just what?

518
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,600
- I'm going to stretch my legs
- Sure.

519
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,100
(Liz) Thank you. You look good.

520
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,000
(Distant, high pitch screams)

521
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,090
What's... it?

522
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,680
You okay?

523
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,960
Dead guy is freaking me out.

524
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,450
Hardly.

525
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,650
Pull out.

526
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,200
All right.

527
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,200
Thanks for your watch.

528
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,330
(Clears throat)

529
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,850
So.

530
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,700
Do I have...

531
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,300
my brand new Rolex?

532
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,600
A little gift I compressed from my--
my new friend... over here.

533
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,680
He got my genius choose, and...

534
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,900
he doesn't talk very much either.

535
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,300
But really, I'm just
dying with you, ma'am.

536
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,700
So,

537
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,500
choose...

538
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,960
this....

539
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,080
(inhales sharply)

540
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,100
Aah!

541
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,400
Tokyo Radio. This is Vista Pacific
Flight 7500 Heavy. Do you copy?

542
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,760
(Noise)

543
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:21,480
Tokyo Radio. This is Vista Pacific
Flight 7500 Heavy. You got me?

544
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,690
You can see....
as you reach.... (louder noise)

545
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,960
(on the TV in the airplane)

546
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,880
(Audio and video signal distorted)

547
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,720
JACINTA: <i>Death is a part of life.</i>

548
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,000
(In distorted voice)
<i>Now I feel long end today.</i>

549
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,480
(Distorted, weird laughter)

550
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,360
(distorted voice continues)

551
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,150
- You okay?
- Yeah.

552
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,000
Yeah. Yeah. Fine.

553
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,440
Have you had one died
on a flight before?

554
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,880
No. First time.

555
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,720
- It's so sad.
- Yes, it's crazy.

556
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,800
SUZY: Do you know that guy in row 13
who is all the time playing the video game?

557
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,450
Yeah.

558
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,760
13F. He hasn't been
in seat awhile.

559
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,160
What? Um....

560
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,480
- 13 F?
- Yeah.

561
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,400
Excuse me.

562
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,300
Do you know where the passenger
who's sitting there is? Are you with him?

563
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,120
Um, Yeah. He went upstairs.

564
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,840
Upstair?

565
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,960
Come on.

566
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,800
Hello?

567
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,360
Sir, you need to go back
to your seat.

568
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,720
LAURA: The body's gone.

569
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,120
We have to go.

570
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,650
(Loud bang)

571
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,600
Remember that trip
we took to Cabo?

572
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,080
When we, uh, had a
huge fight in the hotel room,

573
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,600
and didn't speak for what?
Four days?

574
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,600
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, I remember.

575
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,770
Why do you bring me up
the worst time we ever had?

576
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,730
Because I keep thinking about our times we wasted.

577
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,720
The weather was great,
the hotel was beautiful.

578
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,900
I just realized that disaster.

579
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,300
Yeah.

580
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I don't want to waste anymore time.

581
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,650
What do you mean
"the body has gone"?

582
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,950
I think the skid moved it
as spike.

583
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
CAPTAIN: <i>Closed!
We'd better find him open grounded.</i>

584
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,300
Look, it got to be on board.
Just do a sweep go row by row.

585
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,520
- We're gonna do a sweep, row by row, okay?
- Okay.

586
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,850
- Yes.
- Hey, Pete, um,

587
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,840
can I just ask you something?
Did you happen to see a-- a jet flying near us?

588
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,300
Um, an F-16?

589
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,520
CAPTAIN:
<i>An F-16? No.</i>

590
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,960
LAURA: <i>I'll investigate and call back.
Thank you, Captain.</i>

591
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,300
Everything's fine.
It's fine.

592
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,120
Please. Please. Please.

593
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,240
Oh, thank God.

594
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,240
(Screams)

595
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
Aah!

596
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,200
My God!
Aah!

597
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,000
Aah!

598
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,250
Aah!

599
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,880
Aah!
Aah!

600
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,000
Aah-aah-a!

601
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,640
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry. Just a second.

602
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

603
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,010
Excuse me. Can I, uh--

604
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,440
Good night.
Here you go.

605
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,800
Hey. Do know what the stewardess
has just said?

606
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,040
Dead body is missing.

607
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,690
- What?
- How could it be missing?

608
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,320
I don't know.
The passenger's missing, too.

609
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,240
I saw he go upstairs,
never came back, and--

610
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,800
Okay. You see it's going to sound weird,
but I saw something on my monitor.

611
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,290
- It's kind of a look like the dead guy.
- Come on!

612
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,400
Holly scrap!
I saw him, too.

613
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,000
Why didn't you tell me, then?

614
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,800
It's not time to talk about
that communication shit.

615
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,640
- There's a dead body I think folks could see.
- Yeah, I know.

616
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,080
Hey, guys. We need to find out
who the hell the dead guy is.

617
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,240
'Cause whatever going on,
just got to him.

618
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah.

619
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,900
Hey, check his carry on.

620
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,120
I don't understand.
He's gone.

621
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,680
You know what I always wonder?

622
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,000
What do people think about
just before they die?

623
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,560
You know who
I'm just thinking about?

624
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,600
My first boyfriend,
Sean Osborne.

625
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,900
He kissed me, then,
and my knees literally go weak.

626
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,280
I had to...
hold on him or fell on floor.

627
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,960
Always hope I find out at Nick.

628
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,040
Time runs quick out there.

629
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,040
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

630
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,600
Yeah.

631
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,700
So--

632
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,880
- So, you got the body?
- No.

633
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,570
Peter. I know you're not
leaving your wife.

634
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,200
- What?
- It-- It's okay. You know?

635
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,040
Your kids together.

636
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,400
I wish it were different.

637
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,560
So timing.

638
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,480
Laptop.

639
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,520
An ID?

640
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,080
Here we go.

641
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:19,130
That guy's named Lance Morrell.
From Corona, California.

642
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,040
Oh, it's hair?

643
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,330
The names on it, Tracy,

644
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,000
Anne,

645
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,600
Katy.

646
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,720
- Oh my God. Dare Hair victems.
- We don't know that.

647
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,850
Look, this product is known in
the State of California to cause cancer.

648
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,600
- Physically, this thing to kill her.
- With cancer?

649
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,800
Or it's more like a weapon?

650
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,480
Uh, my mom always had
my dad's state of cancer.

651
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,500
- Laptop's locked.
- Oh.

652
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,000
You try his birthday.

653
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,600
41572.
No?

654
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,120
- Uh--
LIZ: What's it supposed?

655
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,400
- A the weird street.
- Mm-hm.

656
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,600
JACINTA:
There is still another guy's sack.

657
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,800
Fuck.

658
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,700
Have eyes!

659
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,520
I try keep them together.

660
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,300
BRAD: It seems like a purge, though.

661
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,240
Checked, persist.

662
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,160
LAURA:
What are you doing?

663
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,320
RICK: It's not what you think.
This is, uh, Lance Morrell's stuff.

664
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,800
The passenger who died.

665
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,280
You have no right to be going to
someone else properties.

666
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,800
Yeah, when something happened
in this plane, it all started when he died.

667
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,400
BRAD: Look, we know the body is missing,
and the passenger.

668
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,700
- And you saw something, too?
- I didn't see anything.

669
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,350
Through the window,
I've heard you.

670
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,200
We need to get into his
checked luggage.

671
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,410
His checked luggage is
in the cargo hold.

672
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,800
Yeah, and might be something in there
will tell us what's going on.

673
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,960
- You get in there.
- Enough!

674
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,250
- Now go back to your seats.
- Yes, Ma'am. - Okay.

675
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,800
(Exciting music)

676
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,700
Probably I come with you?

677
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,200
Nop. And I'll hatch.

678
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,480
(Cover creaks)

679
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,400
(doll Squeak)

680
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,240
BRAD: What is that?

681
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,500
RICK: It said this is a shinigami.
- The death doll.

682
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,720
RICK: Face Web would deliver
to a client in Tokyo.

683
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,490
Looks cool.

684
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:48,360
In Japanese mythology,
shinigami is the death's spirit.

685
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,960
When you rip
from your life too quickly,

686
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,480
you have to let go over whatever
is holding your spirit.

687
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,800
So you can move on.

688
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,400
Once you've done that,

689
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,400
the real shinigami will take your soul...

690
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,100
to the afterlife.

691
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,720
Why would someone bring
that on a plane?

692
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,770
I don't know,
but I can tell you one thing:

693
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,010
Lance guy's holding on,
he's not let him go.

694
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,440
(Doll still squeaks and buzzes)

695
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,320
(metallic screech)

696
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,760
(something pops)

697
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,400
(distorted voices)

698
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,650
(dog bark, Laura screams)

699
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,500
Aah! Aah! Aah!

700
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,500
Ah, ah, aah!

701
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,760
(Luggage of Lance Morrell)

702
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,440
(Laura screams)

703
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,600
I'm sorry, Meg.

704
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,800
(Distorted over radio)
<i>This guy... no sky watch...</i>

705
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,240
(distorted voice continues)
<i>Morrel's weird....</i>

706
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:01,000
Radio Tokyo. Come in.
This is Vista Pacific Flight 7500 Heavy.

707
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,500
(Distorted and interrupted radio)

708
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,600
(distorted voice continues)

709
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,440
CAPTAIN:
No! No!

710
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,600
(Suzy screams)

711
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,800
Did you hear that?

712
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,680
I don't want that on the plane.

713
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,410
What should we do then?
Throw it up the window?

714
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,000
(Ghostly voices)

715
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,240
(Suzy screams)

716
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,600
BRAD:
Hey, are you okay?

717
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,400
Hey!

718
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,500
Aah!

719
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,900
What the fuck with that?

720
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,760
I can take on.
All right, take on video tape.

721
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,760
Come with us.

722
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,600
RICK: Liz.

723
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,840
(Alarm buzzes)

724
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,360
(Jacinta's voice distorted on speaker)
<i>Death is a part of life.</i>

725
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,720
<i>No way do you saw
an end today.</i>

726
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:49,350
<i>You don't want to waste a second
of whatever time you have left.</i>

727
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,320
<i>And you remember...
what day,</i>

728
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,900
<i>you and I, all of us...</i>

729
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,400
<i>all be dead.</i>

730
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,920
She's not here.

731
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,000
Watch out!

732
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,080
RICK: Oh God!
I don't understand.

733
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,760
(Brad moans)

734
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,800
RICK: What?

735
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,600
What?

736
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,250
Hey, hey. Come on. Come on.
Look at me. Look at me.

737
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,600
Look at me.
What was that there?

738
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,920
What was that there?

739
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,480
(Brad gasps)

740
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,600
JACINTA: <i>When you rip from
your life too quickly,</i>

741
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,700
<i>You have to let go, forever.</i>

742
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,600
<i>It's keeping you here.</i>

743
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,600
<i>It flies you move on.</i>

744
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,360
(Cries out)

745
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,900
<i>Good evening.
The Vista Pacific Flight 7500...</i>

746
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,800
<i>from Los Angeles to Tokyo,</i>

747
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,650
<i>By what we heard from
Traffic Controller,</i>

748
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,400
<i>they were encountering rough turbulence unexpected.</i>

749
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:12,880
<i>And soon after that, all communication
with the plane ceased.</i>

750
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,170
<i>What due to the turbulence
in that exclusion, a cabin seal.</i>

751
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,850
<i>And that seal gave way
in a short time later...</i>

752
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:24,200
<i>creating a rapid decompression
of air within the plane.</i>

753
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,100
<i>At this point in time,
we believe the oxygen masks malfunction.</i>

754
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,500
<i>And in a de-pressurized environment,</i>

755
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,200
<i>the lack of oxygen
could be failed.</i>

756
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,400
Watch out.

757
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,880
And now breathe. Come on. Breathe.

758
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,400
ON THE TV:
<i>Our communication attemp from that point on...</i>

759
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,400
<i>is not successful.</i>

LAURA: <i>Do you happened to see a jet,
a F-16?</i>

761

ON THE TV: <i>At time we could have
to take a closer look at that plane.</i>

<i>But no sign of life does exist.</i>

<i>survive to those on board?</i>

765
