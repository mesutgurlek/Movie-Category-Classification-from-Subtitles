1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,684
2016 - The world as we knew it is no more. Within 4 years,
the temperature of the atmosphere increased by 10 degrees Celsius.

2
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:39,684
Water and food is depleted.
Social structures have vanished.

3
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,684
Alex.

4
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:17,684
Alex, please!

5
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:26,684
You must go. They are coming!

6
00:01:26,684 --> 00:01:28,184
No.

7
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:38,684
That's not gonna work. Leave me!

8
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:43,684
Hurry! Go now.
This is a trap.

9
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:48,684
Run. Run!

10
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:36,684
Bright

11
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,732
That's not funny.

12
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,657
It's not working at all.

13
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,656
That'll do, right?

14
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,414
Last gas canister.

15
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,430
Could you close that for me?

16
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,187
Find me the next exit.

17
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,691
Do you think it's still working?

18
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:44,418
(Nena's 99 red balloons)

19
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,644
That's enough for another 80 kilometers.

20
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,030
What if it's not better up there?

21
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,908
What if there's nothing there?

22
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,324
At least we will have tried it.

23
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,243
Come on!

24
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,204
There you go.

25
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,457
I've seen a bird.

26
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,205
- Really?
- Yeah.

27
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,916
Quite a big one.

28
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,341
- It flew in the same direction we're heading.
- That's a good sign.

29
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,098
Birds know where to find water.

30
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,345
Isn't that too dangerous?

31
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,474
No, there's nobody here.

32
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,570
I'm having a look around.

33
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,670
What do you like about him?

34
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,341
We are helping each other.
Without him, we wouldn't be here.

35
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,052
Without his car we wouldn't be here.

36
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,814
Damn, that's not holding.
Give me the kit.

37
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,730
Go inside and try to find something for the window.

38
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,990
I'll check the tanks.

39
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,822
Put your jacket on.

40
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:29,822
Sun activity increasing - scientists are clueless.
Sun storms reach record high.

41
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,737
Someone slept here.

42
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,793
Leonie.

43
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,646
Leonie?

44
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,490
You can't just run away.

45
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,078
What are you doing there?

46
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,876
Toilets, water pipes and heat pipes.
There's always something in there.

47
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,246
Mom showed me.

48
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,790
Wait outside where Philip can see you.

49
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,502
I'll have a look around the back, alright?

50
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,306
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

51
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,726
Leo, you won't believe that....

52
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,638
Look what I've found...

53
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,106
Phillip!

54
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,192
Shit!

55
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,829
- Where did he go?
- I couldn't see.

56
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,409
- What has he taken?
- Let's get out of here.

57
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,911
He took the rations for a week.

58
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,791
- Why wasn't the car locked anyway?
- Well, you had the keys.

59
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,342
Can't you use your heads, too?

60
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,925
Leonie!

61
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,267
Leo?

62
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,869
- Where's the other guy?
- Please let her go.

63
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,872
There's three of you.
Where's the third one?

64
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,790
Outside somewhere.

65
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,501
Put that down.

66
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,515
I said, put that down!

67
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,059
Call him.

68
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,562
Phillip!

69
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,647
Louder.

70
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,363
Phillip!

71
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,192
Louder!

72
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,620
Phillip!!

73
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,618
- I have--
- What?

74
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,907
- I've got--
- What?

75
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,000
...gas.

76
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,518
- What are you looking for?
- My watch.

77
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,072
5 liters.

78
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,205
I'll get at least 20 for this.

79
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,624
In the cites, maybe.

80
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,972
You are not the only ones passing through.

81
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,313
Okay, 15.

82
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,645
10, and one of those peach cans.

83
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,208
Quickly, the cups.

84
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,146
- How far you want to go?
- Into the mountains.

85
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,608
- And why?
- That's where the water is.

86
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,694
They even printed it on the bottles.

87
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,949
I wouldn't do that.

88
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,206
That's diesel, isn't it?

89
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,299
Judging from the sound,
the won't do much more than 50 kilometers.

90
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,085
How can you tell?

91
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,012
More gas.

92
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,521
It's the V-belt.

93
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,401
These parts are not built for this heat.
This one's about to snap.

94
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,193
And what now?

95
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,708
Maybe you can find a replacement
in one of those cars.

96
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,879
How much gas have you got?

97
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,595
How many canned peaches have you got?

98
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,760
I've got a better idea.

99
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,641
You'll find us a spare belt and keep the engine in shape.

100
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,102
In return, we'll take you with us
and give you something to eat.

101
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,985
A second man would be good anyway.

102
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,135
Marie will take care of your wound.

103
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,297
First aid kit is under the driver's seat.

104
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:09,244
(Nena's 99 red balloons)

105
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,877
How did that happen?

106
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,590
I was knocked out and woke up in the burning sun.

107
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,345
How long have you been out there?

108
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,428
I don't know. 2, 3 hours maybe.

109
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,425
You got lucky.

110
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,765
I mean, that you came around in time.

111
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,106
We all got lucky, aren't we.

112
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,600
There.

113
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,440
You lost that.

114
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,840
What's your name anyway?

115
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,711
Tom.

116
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,301
Phillip.

117
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,062
Thanks.

118
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,778
Watch out!

119
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,430
Have you got a tow rope?

120
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,316
We all push and the girl drives.

121
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,565
That should work, right?

122
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,578
Push the clutch.

123
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,834
A little more gas.
Release the clutch slowly.

124
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,127
Good.

125
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,425
Is she driving or what?

126
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,554
Now put it in gear.

127
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,190
What do you need that for anyway?

128
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,560
It belonged to my mother.

129
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,779
She wasn't so lucky.

130
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,748
- Did that hurt?
- Yeah, sure it hurt.

131
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,522
Don't drive away.

132
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,162
More gas!

133
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,251
More!

134
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,476
Stop the engine!

135
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,689
Leonie, stop the engine!

136
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,150
Stop the engine!

137
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,399
From now on you'll be on the back seat again.

138
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,267
I bet there is still some fuel in the tank.

139
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,020
Maybe they had something to eat, too.

140
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,885
- Asshole.
- Too long.

141
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,255
Swearword with five letters.

142
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,974
- Phillip?
- Too long, too.

143
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,396
Marie? Is that working?

144
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,564
- Yeah, I can hear you.
- I need to pee.

145
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,605
After dusk, okay.

146
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,260
Frenchmen.

147
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,264
Nobody could have survived that.

148
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,353
Probably they took their provisions
and continued on foot.

149
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,521
Or someone was here already.

150
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,145
We should take care of the fuel tank.

151
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,362
Marie?

152
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,621
- Yeah?
- Get an empty canister down here.

153
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,506
- Can't one of you come up here?
- That would take forever, up and down again.

154
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,507
We need to get moving as quickly as possible.

155
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,176
- I don't want to leave Leonie alone.
- Then let her bring the canister.

156
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,678
You need to get her under control already.

157
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,437
- Marie? You got that?
- Yeah.

158
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,478
I'm going.

159
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,036
Hey.

160
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,052
He is not important, right?

161
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,758
All we need to do is stick together.

162
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,394
Can't we just leave together?

163
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,896
Now. Just the two of us.

164
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,691
You've got the key.

165
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,686
Marie?

166
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,409
- Marie, you there?
- I'm on my way.

167
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,663
See? He's got you under control.

168
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,294
Stay in the care and don't move.

169
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,635
- Got it?
- You are not Mom, alright?

170
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,634
Mom is gone.
All you have left is I.

171
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,680
And lock the doors.

172
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,054
As soon as we're safe, we'll get rid of him.

173
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,393
Marie.

174
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,479
Here.

175
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,826
From Paris.

176
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,505
Phillip.

177
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,430
You don't need to worry.

178
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,717
I got my period.

179
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,774
Leonie?

180
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,906
There's someone here!

181
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,703
Where's Leonie?

182
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,573
- Where's Phillip?
- We have to go.

183
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,961
Come.

184
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,082
What happened?

185
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,091
Tom.

186
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,937
Talk to me.

187
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,860
When we arrived, they just drove away with Leonie.

188
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,987
That was a trap.

189
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,941
I should never have left her alone.

190
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,080
We'll look for her, okay?

191
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,457
Phillip.

192
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,341
Where's Leonie?

193
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,723
I don't know.

194
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,014
Maybe they just wanted the car and they let her go.

195
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,433
"Just" the car?

196
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,690
It contains everything we have. Everything.

197
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,609
Leonie...Leonie?

198
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,579
Leonie, tell me where you are.

199
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,243
Leonie.

200
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,043
Leonie.

201
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,638
Nothing. Just white noise.

202
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,641
But I saw smoke about 3 kilometers from here in this direction.

203
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:11,013
- Someone is having a fire.
- What if they just as bad as the others?

204
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,688
Does your friend have a better idea?

205
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,250
Leave me!

206
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,346
- We must do something.
- Hold on.

207
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,907
One of them is fleeing.

208
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,328
Quickly, take cover!

209
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,164
I don't believe it. After him!

210
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,587
Go! That way!

211
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,377
- I've seen enough.
- No.

212
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,217
We get her out of there.

213
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,888
- We only have one chance.
- What? They'll be back soon.

214
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,761
We'll get the car, too.

215
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,936
Give me your water bottle and the canister.

216
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,362
We need them empty, now. Drink!

217
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,443
- I'm done with this shit.
- I'm gonna make a Molotov cocktail.

218
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,327
We don't have much time.

219
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:36,075
Do as I tell you or I'll drench you
in your fucking gas and light you up!

220
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,167
Quick, drink up!

221
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,799
You go to the car.

222
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,093
At the steering wheel, there are a few wires hanging out.

223
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,683
You need to connect the right ones.

224
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,099
- It's easier than it sounds.
- I'll do it.

225
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,900
When this thing goes off,
everybody will run there.

226
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,312
Focus on the wires.
Check them all, one by one.

227
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,406
The engine will start eventually.

228
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,409
They will be diverted.

229
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:15,492
We get the girl and jump into the car.

230
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,620
Can you do it?

231
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,973
Now.

232
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,805
Fire! Everybody come here!

233
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,981
Come on.

234
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,604
Fuck.

235
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,253
Go! Go!

236
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,752
- Where's Leonie?
- Just go!

237
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,128
Where are they?

238
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,967
- They are escaping!
- Go!

239
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,404
Don't stop!

240
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,632
Hit it!

241
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,058
Fuck!

242
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,493
- What about Leonie?
- We didn't stand a chance.

243
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,995
Shit.

244
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,131
What happened?

245
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,844
What happened? The plan didn't work at all.

246
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,968
- This idiotic idea with the Molotov--
- You didn't even try.

247
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:09,264
How was I supposed to cut through
an iron chain with a pocket knife?

248
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,813
They were chained to the wall!
Should I have ripped off her foot?

249
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,812
Don't you get it?
There's nothing we con do for them now.

250
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,730
We need to move on.

251
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:22,243
That's our only chance,
otherwise we'll both die here!

252
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,869
Which ones go together?

253
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,659
What are you doing?

254
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,040
Tell me about V-belts...

255
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,123
Come on!

256
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,127
Marie?

257
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,221
Marie, I'm sorry.

258
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,316
Let's stay together.

259
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,734
Then help me find her.

260
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,926
- What's the range of these walkie-talkies?
- I don't know.

261
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:00,016
- Probably not more than 3 kilometers.
- She must be close by.

262
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,103
- Did she say anything?
- I couldn't understand anything.

263
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,817
Let me see.

264
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,508
You must go without me.

265
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,481
I'll be alright.

266
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,234
You don't want to push me around
in broad daylight on this thing, do you?

267
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,193
Go on.

268
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,162
I won't harm you.

269
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,903
I thought you were dead.

270
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,907
I am looking for my little sister.

271
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,750
We have been ambushed,
and they took her with them.

272
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,294
It was a group, and they had several prisoners.

273
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:02,588
They come down once in a few weeks,
catch some people and disappear again.

274
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,554
I only heard about this.

275
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,599
- I've never seen it happening.
- I did.

276
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:16,819
You can't go now,
not in broad daylight and without water.

277
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:20,314
- Can you give me some water?
- I don't have any more left.

278
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,277
But we are living not far from here.

279
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:29,244
We have water. You can rest there.

280
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,783
I must find my sister.

281
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,006
I have a son, he can help you.

282
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,928
Wait here.

283
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,166
All the farmers had to slaughter their livestock.

284
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,376
There hasn't been a harvest in 3 years.

285
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,426
Only a few of us survived.

286
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,548
I only have one son left.

287
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,097
All I have left is my sister.

288
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:45,441
- This is what's left of our fields.
- But you have water.

289
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,037
There are some caves where it's dripping down the walls.

290
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:53,950
It is hard to collect, but it's enough drinking water for us.

291
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,500
Some people say that above the tree line it's raining again.

292
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,792
I don't believe it.
I don't think there is anything left up there.

293
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,301
We won't leave our farm.

294
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,485
Flori!

295
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,030
Inside you go!

296
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,045
The Bruckners joined our family.

297
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:48,383
Sometimes it's not easy, but we can only survive together.

298
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,298
Everybody has their duties.

299
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,218
Flori, you should sleep during the day,

300
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,016
and not play outside in the sun.

301
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,357
We've got a visitor.

302
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,993
That's Granny Bruckner. Praise God,
she's not fully aware of what's going on.

303
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,134
You can rest here.

304
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:39,855
I'll wake you up before dusk.

305
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,148
Then I talked to everybody.

306
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,858
Here.

307
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,952
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

308
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:57,994
I had to leave someone behind.
He is hurt.

309
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,661
He is waiting in something like a railroad tunnel.

310
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,793
Ah, that must be the Berchen tunnel.

311
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,468
- That's not far from here.
- He can't walk.

312
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,304
I'll send my son, he will help him.

313
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,058
- Thank you.
- That's okay.

314
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,017
We need our men in these hard times.

315
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,562
Now try to sleep a little.

316
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,528
What's your name?

317
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,989
Marie.

318
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,778
Nice...I am Elisabeth.

319
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:08,002
Delta 3: enemy is down.

320
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:03,058
Get the little one from the cellar, quick!

321
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,882
Where's my sister?

322
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,597
Leonie! Leonie!

323
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,976
Calm down, please.

324
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,686
What are you doing here?

325
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,823
We don't have any livestock left.

326
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,113
We have to survive.

327
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,497
What else can we do?

328
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,123
Please don't hurt her.

329
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:19,171
Nobody will harm you two, on the contrary.

330
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,509
You are pretty and healthy.

331
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,348
You are just the right age.

332
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:29,185
My son needs a wife, otherwise the farm cannot be maintained.

333
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,223
In a few years, your little sister is ready, too,

334
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,562
...for my Flori.

335
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,728
Think about your little sister.

336
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:44,243
She needs a real family again.

337
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,994
I want to see her.

338
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,157
I like that,

339
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,376
how you take care of your sister.

340
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,993
Leonie!

341
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,349
What happened?

342
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:53,428
That's nothing serious.
It just needs to be cleaned and bandaged.

343
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,604
I'll send my son to do that.

344
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:58,061
And when that's done, we'll have something to eat.

345
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,982
You're hungry, aren't you?

346
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,157
You'll look beautiful wearing this.

347
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,697
Marie...

348
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,157
Hit him.

349
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,209
You'll like him, he is my youngest son.

350
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,940
Why didn't you hit him?

351
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,526
I was scared.

352
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,824
I'm sorry.

353
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,377
Did you see Phillip?

354
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,172
How about Tom?

355
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:10,513
He's down in the stables.

356
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,720
How many others are there?

357
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,263
I don't know.

358
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,263
Alright, Leonie.

359
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,602
We need to get out of here.

360
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,659
The curtains.

361
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,635
Give it to me!

362
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,174
Look inside the wardrobe.

363
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,560
- It's locked.
- Get the backpack.

364
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,995
You go first.

365
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,174
Lie down over there and don't move.

366
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:53,108
- My mother said that your sister--
- Shush...she's sleeping.

367
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:12,340
My mother said that you are a godsend.

368
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,546
Yeah?

369
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,679
Because she...

370
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,476
...had found you...

371
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,603
...in a church.

372
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,307
Close the door.

373
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,065
- Is he dead?
- What?

374
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,992
Come on.

375
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,201
Turn off the light.

376
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:26,053
Don't look down. Look at me.

377
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,827
Are you okay?

378
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,251
- Yeah.
- Not so loud.

379
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:54,672
Go, run into the woods and hide.

380
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,463
Now go!

381
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,123
Marie?

382
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,292
The others will come down soon.

383
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,540
He's helping her with the bandages.

384
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,839
You look pretty.

385
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,894
It fits you.

386
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,072
It used to be mine once.

387
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,581
Come on, I'll introduce you to your new family.

388
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,723
Everybody, this is Marie.

389
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:23,317
We need another chair for the little girl.
What is taking so long?

390
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,317
Micha!

391
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,953
We're eating!

392
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,293
Come.

393
01:06:56,637 --> 01:07:00,517
Dear Lord who gave us everything,
we praise Thee for your gifts.

394
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:04,688
Earth has brought us this,
Sun let it grow.

395
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:09,242
Dear Sun, dear Earth,
We'll never forget you. Amen.

396
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,574
Micha's still missing.

397
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,907
Bruckner, I decide when we start eating.

398
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,632
Flori.

399
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,847
- I'll get Micha.
- No, don't get up.

400
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:16,975
No!

401
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:50,694
Marie!

402
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:40,031
Micha!

403
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,268
Marie.

404
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:02,561
Go!

405
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,197
Let's go!

406
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,316
At the barn.

407
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,652
They are at the barn.

408
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:48,361
Quickly!

409
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:57,120
Quickly, everybody come here.

410
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,414
Now, quickly!

411
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:27,400
Over there!

412
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:35,992
Over there!

413
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,950
Go! Run!

414
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:15,356
- Hey!
- Marie!

415
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,438
Marie!

416
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:22,484
Get lost!

417
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,747
Go away!

418
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:33,753
Leave me alone!

419
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,457
You are like all the other after all.

420
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:42,504
They all come crawling, begging for water.

421
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,802
Help!

422
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:52,268
I thought you were something special.

423
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:59,606
But the sun will burn you.

424
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:05,531
Your mother gave you the name Marie.

425
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,870
- Leave me!
- What a pity.

426
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,418
You are worthless.

427
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:19,921
But your sister is young, very young.

428
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,962
She will have a better life with Micha--

429
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,168
Mom...Mom!

430
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,879
No! Mom!

431
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:02,672
Mom.

432
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,338
My boy.

433
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:15,188
