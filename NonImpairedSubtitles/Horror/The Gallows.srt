- You know it.</font>

133
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,684
<font color="#ffff00">- Time for a vacation, huh.
- You can guess that too.</font>

134
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:20,720
<font color="#ffff00">"The Gallows"</font>

135
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:23,996
<font color="#ffff00">And here's the 1993 cast.</font>

136
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:26,495
<font color="#ffff00">Just as geeky as now.</font>

137
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,040
<font color="#ffff00">And there he is.</font>

138
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:32,206
<font color="#ffff00">Charlie Grimille.</font>

139
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:36,105
<font color="#ffff00">Unbelievable morbid that they still
have a picture of him up here.</font>

140
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,415
<font color="#ffff00">Don't forget your costumes.</font>

141
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,286
<font color="#ffff00">Chris.
Turn off the cellphone, please.</font>

142
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:44,908
<font color="#ffff00">- In the drama room as well as
the theater, that's the rule.
- You got it.</font>

143
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:46,754
<font color="#ffff00">And the MorF
will be suspended.</font>

144
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,580
<font color="#ffff00">No cellphone, okay?</font>

145
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:49,942
<font color="#ffff00">No cellphones.</font>

146
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,472
<font color="#ffff00">Alright. Now, listen up.
Eyes forward, everyone.</font>

147
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:55,739
<font color="#ffff00">Tomorrow night is the show,
it's been a long process.</font>

148
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:58,315
<font color="#ffff00">- Not always easy. Right, Pfeifer?
- Mm-Mmm.</font>

149
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,371
<font color="#ffff00">Especially not with the school board
but we got through that.</font>

150
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:05,491
<font color="#ffff00">But...
I think we're going to do okay.</font>

151
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:08,008
<font color="#ffff00">- Pfeifer, you had a couple of words
   you want to say. Go ahead.
- Yes.</font>

152
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,487
<font color="#ffff00">Of course she has
something to say.</font>

153
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:10,874
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you, guys.</font>

154
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:13,539
<font color="#ffff00">First of, I would like you guys
to take a peek at the programs.</font>

155
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:16,597
<font color="#ffff00">They are done, and they are
identical to the 1993 ones.</font>

156
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,028
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh my god. Thank god.
- So. Thank you, Britney.</font>

157
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:23,768
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you guys so much for
helping me make this so possible.</font>

158
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:27,499
<font color="#ffff00">We've worked so hard,
we had such a great time.</font>

159
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:31,844
<font color="#ffff00">I feel so proud to be
a part of The Gallows.</font>

160
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,041
<font color="#ffff00">I just can't wait
to see it finally finish.</font>

161
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,397
<font color="#ffff00">Me neither.</font>

162
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:36,924
<font color="#ffff00">C'est fini.
(It's finished.)</font>

163
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,136
<font color="#ffff00">- So. Thank you, guys.
- Thank you, Pfeifer.</font>

164
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:43,158
<font color="#ffff00">Our assistant director,
Pfeifer Ross, everyone.</font>

165
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:44,692
<font color="#ffff00">And what do we say?</font>

166
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:47,428
<font color="#ffff00">- Break a leg.
- Break a leg, Reese.</font>

167
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:49,503
<font color="#ffff00"> Thank you, you guys.
Let's go.</font>

168
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,083
<font color="#ffff00">Backstage.</font>

169
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:53,779
<font color="#ffff00">- Jules, Mr. BHS.
- What's up, my man.</font>

170
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,343
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa.
Look at this.</font>

171
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:57,317
<font color="#ffff00">- What are you doing here?
- My 2 favorite characters.</font>

172
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:59,385
<font color="#ffff00">Peasant number 5,
hangman.</font>

173
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,646
<font color="#ffff00">Do you guys even have lines?</font>

174
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,666
<font color="#ffff00">- I think I clap or something.
- There you go.</font>

175
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:05,687
<font color="#ffff00">If coach could see you guys now,
you'll be kicked out in a second.</font>

176
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:09,319
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah. Get that camera out of my face.
- It's a mandatory class.</font>

177
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:12,238
<font color="#ffff00">- They really know this stuff.
- It's like Halloween down here.</font>

178
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:14,174
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah, most definitely.
- Let's party this.</font>

179
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,493
<font color="#ffff00">Oh.
What do we have here?</font>

180
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:19,726
<font color="#ffff00">- What is this thing?
- That's the old hangman costume.</font>

181
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:21,580
<font color="#ffff00">- Looks pretty dumb.
-  Somebody told us not to touch it.</font>

182
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:24,311
<font color="#ffff00">Did a little drama nerd
tell you not to touch it?</font>

183
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:25,919
<font color="#ffff00">I think he told me too.</font>

184
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:29,479
<font color="#ffff00">But then I didn't listen to him
because I'm such a bad ass.</font>

185
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:31,345
<font color="#ffff00">- Dan and Mark, can I see
you guys on the set.
- Oh, damn it.</font>

186
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,523
<font color="#ffff00">- Ryan.
- Yeah.</font>

187
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,170
<font color="#ffff00">- What are you doing?
- Nothing.</font>

188
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:37,676
<font color="#ffff00">- I know you don't take
any of this seriously, okay.
- I don't.</font>

189
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,699
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry.
No, I will.</font>

190
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,952
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay. It's important to a lot of people.
- Right.</font>

191
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:44,728
<font color="#ffff00">- So. Show a little respect
in the theater, okay?
- Alright.</font>

192
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:45,926
<font color="#ffff00">- Got it?
- Yeah.</font>

193
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,583
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

194
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,156
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, right.</font>

195
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:52,556
<font color="#ffff00">Look at him
in those khakis.</font>

196
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:54,728
<font color="#ffff00">What a joke.</font>

197
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,192
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm fine.
- What are you doing?</font>

198
00:09:57,224 --> 00:10:00,647
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know. Just trying
to get through this thing.</font>

199
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:02,950
<font color="#ffff00">- What are you doing?
- What.</font>

200
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,164
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I'm Charlie.
I'm dead.</font>

201
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:09,929
<font color="#ffff00">Oh.</font>

202
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,366
<font color="#ffff00">Oh. I got a trick for you guys.
Watch.</font>

203
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:15,252
<font color="#ffff00">Watch this.</font>

204
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,953
<font color="#ffff00">Ready?</font>

205
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:23,231
<font color="#ffff00">How creepy is that.</font>

206
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,432
<font color="#ffff00">God.</font>

207
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:34,525
<font color="#ffff00">Yo yo yo. Dude.
Smile for the camera, man.</font>

208
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:36,097
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, come on.</font>

209
00:10:36,122 --> 00:10:38,928
<font color="#ffff00">Look. I'm sorry about hitting
you with the footfall.</font>

210
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,199
<font color="#ffff00">You were wide open.</font>

211
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,888
<font color="#ffff00">- Come on. Can I at least
help you with this stuff.
- No!</font>

212
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:46,413
<font color="#ffff00">And don't touch the fly ropes.
They're dangerous.</font>

213
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,841
<font color="#ffff00">Wow.
Okay, stage boy.</font>

214
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,330
<font color="#ffff00">August is not who
he seems he is , Mary.</font>

215
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:54,872
<font color="#ffff00">- To the audience, John.
- Can't you see?</font>

216
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,194
<font color="#ffff00">He is pretending to be a noble,
that he may win your love.</font>

217
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:00,486
<font color="#ffff00">He should himself in.
He must be hang.</font>

218
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:03,578
<font color="#ffff00">August will not turn himself in.
He loves me.</font>

219
00:11:03,603 --> 00:11:05,774
<font color="#ffff00">But, so. The hangman
will take Mary in his place.</font>

220
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,436
<font color="#ffff00">His sentence is death.</font>

221
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:08,345
<font color="#ffff00">Nerd there.</font>

222
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,048
<font color="#ffff00">What
shall I do?</font>

223
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,898
<font color="#ffff00">- What shall I do, father?
- Reese, come on.</font>

224
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:20,878
<font color="#ffff00">- Now, Reese.
- What shall I do, father?</font>

225
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:22,652
<font color="#ffff00">- Reese.
- There he is.</font>

226
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:24,475
<font color="#ffff00">- Good timing, Reese.
- Don't come out with the book.</font>

227
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:27,299
<font color="#ffff00">What shall I.
what shall I do...</font>

228
00:11:27,324 --> 00:11:29,621
<font color="#ffff00">- and then you come in.
- Okay.</font>

229
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:33,014
<font color="#ffff00">The parents of the nerds.
There they are.</font>

230
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,296
<font color="#ffff00">And look at these guys.</font>

231
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:38,251
<font color="#ffff00">Contain your excitement, gentlemen.</font>

232
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,038
<font color="#ffff00">I don't even know if
this lady is a parent.</font>

233
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:45,357
<font color="#ffff00">She's here literally everyday.
Sitting in the same spot.</font>

234
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:48,298
<font color="#ffff00">- Wait. You're in the old show?
- The original show.</font>

235
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:50,268
<font color="#ffff00">- Like, the original.
- I was there.</font>

236
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,707
<font color="#ffff00">What was that like?</font>

237
00:11:51,732 --> 00:11:54,844
<font color="#ffff00">I-I don't know if you would ever
recover from something like this.</font>

238
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:56,526
<font color="#ffff00">It was</font>

239
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:57,883
<font color="#ffff00">horrifying.</font>

240
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:00,361
<font color="#ffff00">The students were upset.
The teachers were upset.</font>

241
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,441
<font color="#ffff00">- Charlie had a girlfriend.
- He had a girlfriend?</font>

242
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:04,935
<font color="#ffff00">Oh. I didn't really know her.
But...</font>

243
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,538
<font color="#ffff00">She was devastated.</font>

244
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:09,149
<font color="#ffff00">I've been here when my kids have
been here, and things had happened.</font>

245
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:12,102
<font color="#ffff00">Lights would go on when there is
no one in the lighting booth.</font>

246
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:14,615
<font color="#ffff00">Doors have been opened
and shut and locked.</font>

247
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,376
<font color="#ffff00">All kinds of stories around here.
Mm-hm.</font>

248
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:22,221
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, no no no.
They're patty caking.</font>

249
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,848
<font color="#ffff00">Slapping hands with another dude.</font>

250
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,870
<font color="#ffff00">And zero hot girls.</font>

251
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,811
<font color="#ffff00">Ew.</font>

252
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:36,721
<font color="#ffff00">And the queen.
Not in a million years.</font>

253
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:38,352
<font color="#ffff00">I hate this class.</font>

254
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:41,569
<font color="#ffff00">Hollywood.
What's up, brother.</font>

255
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,900
<font color="#ffff00">- Hey.
- What're you doing? Practicing?</font>

256
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:47,725
<font color="#ffff00">- Mm-hm.
- Is it working.</font>

257
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:50,042
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.
I didn't think so.</font>

258
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,096
<font color="#ffff00">It makes no sense dude</font>

259
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:54,070
<font color="#ffff00">I mean.
This is torture.</font>

260
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:55,912
<font color="#ffff00">Why don't-
Why don't you call out sick.</font>

261
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:58,248
<font color="#ffff00">- You know. Put an end to this.
- I can't call out sick.</font>

262
00:12:58,273 --> 00:13:01,100
<font color="#ffff00">I call out sick 2, 3 times a week,
minimum. Just do it.</font>

263
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,686
<font color="#ffff00">I've a responsibility to these people.
I'm leading the play.</font>

264
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:06,462
<font color="#ffff00">To what people.
What are you talking about?</font>

265
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:10,001
<font color="#ffff00">A responsibility to these guys?
Come on.</font>

266
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,179
<font color="#ffff00">You're just...</font>

267
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:15,965
<font color="#ffff00">Let me see that.</font>

268
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,818

269
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:22,586

Reese, do you like Pfeifer?</font>

270
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:24,153
<font color="#ffff00">- No, Ryan. No.
- You do.</font>

271
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,145
<font color="#ffff00">- Don't you? You like Pfeifer.
- Ryan, serious. No, I don't</font>

272
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,065
<font color="#ffff00">That's why you're doing this.</font>

273
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,203
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh my god. Does she know?
- Ryan.</font>

274
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,089
<font color="#ffff00">- She doesn't know.
- I don't, Ryan.</font>

275
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:34,717
<font color="#ffff00">Reese.
Your boy has got this, dude.</font>

276
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:37,579
<font color="#ffff00">Just talk to Schwendiman.
I've got this one, man.
Eh ha ha.</font>

277
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:39,030
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, drama queen.</font>

278
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:40,652
<font color="#ffff00">Hey-hey-hey.
Pfeifer.</font>

279
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:41,882
<font color="#ffff00">- Hey, Ryan.
- Wait a second.</font>

280

Hold on.</font>

- What about Reese?</font>

282
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:49,252
<font color="#ffff00">He has a big ass
crush on you.</font>

283
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:51,588
<font color="#ffff00">Like, he wants to be on you.</font>

284
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:52,883
<font color="#ffff00">- Pfeifer please.
- yes.</font>

285
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:56,247
<font color="#ffff00">Talk to me about Reese.
What's going on there.</font>

286
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,674
<font color="#ffff00">Reese is going to do great.
I have complete faith in him.</font>

287
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:01,225
<font color="#ffff00">He knows his lines.
He's going to be fine.
- Okay.</font>

288
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,753
<font color="#ffff00">Are you kidding me? Everybody knows
he's going to choke like Charlie did.</font>

289
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,555
<font color="#ffff00">We don't say that name,
I've told you that.</font>

290
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,426
<font color="#ffff00">- It's bad luck.
- I'm sorry.</font>

291
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:11,099
<font color="#ffff00">I don't get you drama nerds
and your chagrin. It's like...</font>

292
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:12,783
<font color="#ffff00">Good luck is bad luck.</font>

00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:15,427
<font color="#ffff00">-Breaking a leg is suppose
to be a good thing.

What the hell is that?</font>

295
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:21,535
<font color="#ffff00">Oh my god.
Pfeifer, back to the point.</font>

296
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,609
<font color="#ffff00">After the show bombs, how is
it going to affect you and Reese.</font>

297
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:28,742
<font color="#ffff00">The show isn't going to bomb, Ryan.
Okay? We're going to finish the show.</font>

298
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,668
<font color="#ffff00">It's going to look great.
C'est fini. (It's finished.)</font>

You're from Nebraska.</font>

- What.</font>

301
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:38,171
<font color="#ffff00">- Price needs you.
- Who's Price?</font>

302
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:41,186
<font color="#ffff00">- The stage manager.
- Stage mana"der".</font>

Stage boy, yeah.</font>

304
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:48,974
<font color="#ffff00">Hey there, chief.
How're doing, bud?</font>

305
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:50,911
<font color="#ffff00">What can I help you with?</font>

306
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:54,460
<font color="#ffff00">No. 28 here is a little too heavy for me.
You know. You can do it.</font>

307
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:57,221
<font color="#ffff00">I probably can, yes.</font>

308
00:14:58,472 --> 00:15:00,204
<font color="#ffff00">You just can't...
Yeah, it's pretty stuck.</font>

309
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:03,075
<font color="#ffff00">- Is it this one?
- Price got some balls.</font>

310
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:05,251
<font color="#ffff00">- You just need it pull down?
- It's fine if you can't do it.</font>

311
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:07,098
<font color="#ffff00">- Are you sure it's this one?
- This one.</font>

312
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,694
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay.
- It's fine if you can't do it.</font>

313
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:11,676

need to get a pull.</font>

314
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:15,269
<font color="#ffff00">- Whoa.
- Oh.</font>

315

That's gonna leave a mark.</font>

Hey!</font>

318
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,437
<font color="#ffff00">Stage boy!
Hey!</font>

319
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:33,062
<font color="#ffff00">Come here, boy.</font>

320
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:34,250
<font color="#ffff00">- No no. Look.
- You're done, boy.</font>

321
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,162

We're even. We're even.
- It was a joke?</font>

326
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:44,868
<font color="#ffff00">Ryan.
Stop.</font>

330
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:11,408
<font color="#ffff00">No way.</font>

331
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,465
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.
Hey, Brooke.</font>

332
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,998
<font color="#ffff00">It's Kelly.</font>

333
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:16,849
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.
What is up with this door?</font>

334
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:20,106
<font color="#ffff00">It's broken.
Everybody knows that.</font>

Reese. Reese.</font>

00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:28,026
<font color="#ffff00">Dude. Dude.
Reese, my man.</font>

338
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:30,322
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa...</font>

339
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:32,592
<font color="#ffff00">- What?
- Do you still want to do this play?</font>

340

to do this play?</font>

342
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,389
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, listen.
I was talking to Pfeifer</font>

343
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,997
<font color="#ffff00">and that stupid stage boy,
I was chasing him.</font>

344
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:42,151
<font color="#ffff00">but I found this door.</font>

345
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:44,703
<font color="#ffff00">I found a door,
over here, that's unlocked.</font>

346
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:46,598
<font color="#ffff00">Never locks.
Always open.</font>

348
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:50,099
<font color="#ffff00">What'd she say?</font>

349
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:51,968
<font color="#ffff00">- Who?
- Pfeifer.</font>

350
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:54,973
<font color="#ffff00">Oh my god, Reese.
You like Pfeifer?</font>

351
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:55,904
<font color="#ffff00">Oh.</font>

352
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:59,021
<font color="#ffff00">Reese, this is your chance.
We break into the school tonight.</font>

353
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:01,960
<font color="#ffff00">We come in through that door.
We ruin the set. 10 minutes.</font>

354
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:04,659
<font color="#ffff00">- You don't have to do the play anymore.
- That's awesome.</font>

355
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:06,408
<font color="#ffff00">Cassidy.
Please.</font>

356
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,728
<font color="#ffff00">What do you think, Reese?</font>

357
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,853
<font color="#ffff00">You're insane, man.</font>

358
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:14,396
<font color="#ffff00">- Reese, it's a great plan.
- No.</font>

359
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,065
<font color="#ffff00">- Why not?
- No. Ryan, this is illegal.</font>

360
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,003
<font color="#ffff00">Put that camera down.
Why would you even want to film this?</font>

361
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:21,046
<font color="#ffff00">You want me to bail on the show.
If I bail on the show, they all hate me.</font>

362
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:22,466
<font color="#ffff00">Esp...</font>

363
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:24,387
<font color="#ffff00">Especially Pfeifer.</font>

364
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,814
<font color="#ffff00">And, if you don't bail on the show,
you let everyone down.</font>

365
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,929
<font color="#ffff00">And they all hate you,
especially Pfeifer.</font>

366
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:33,862
<font color="#ffff00">Dude, I'm done. I'm done
sugar coating this whole thing.</font>

367
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:38,177
<font color="#ffff00">You suck. You're a terrible actor and
you need to do something about it.</font>

368
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:40,656
<font color="#ffff00">Why not do something
that's not your fault.</font>

369
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:42,780
<font color="#ffff00">Tear this mother down.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">You, look. They're gonna
come in tomorrow and they're like;</font>

<font color="#ffff00">"Oh my god. The set's broken.
What're we going to do?"</font>

372
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:52,278
<font color="#ffff00">And who's there, for Pfeifer,
leaning on her time of need.</font>

373
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,656
<font color="#ffff00">Dude.
You are.</font>

374
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:57,610
<font color="#ffff00">- It's a win. I'm a freaking genius.
- You're not a genius.</font>

375
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:59,395
<font color="#ffff00">What time?</font>

376
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:02,468
<font color="#ffff00">- You're not coming, Cassidy.
- Yes, I'm coming.</font>

377
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:04,181
<font color="#ffff00">No, you're not.
You're a cheerleader.</font>

378
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:05,603
<font color="#ffff00">What the hell does that
have to do with anything?</font>

379
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:09,052
<font color="#ffff00">Let me finish. You're a cheerleader
that likes to do other girl dance stuff.</font>

380
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:13,449
<font color="#ffff00">Not cool awesome scary stuff
at the school at night.</font>

381
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,083
<font color="#ffff00">I'll pick you up at 9.</font>

382
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:19,855
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.
Dude. Are you in?</font>

383
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,473
<font color="#ffff00">- Do you have tools?
- Yes, Reese. Yeah.</font>

384
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:27,354
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah yeah yeah. I got tools.
- God, Reese. I can't believe you like Pfeifer.</font>

385
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:30,489
<font color="#ffff00">Shut up.
Why did you tell her?</font>

386
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,955
<font color="#ffff00">You know.</font>

387
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:37,877
<font color="#ffff00">I heard there is
a new inspection.</font>

388
