1
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,950
VAMPYR was produced in 1931/32
in German, French and English versions.

2
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,626
The original negative
for picture and sound was lost.

3
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,295
Partially complete prints
of the German and French versions

4
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,522
served as the basis
for this restoration.

5
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,030
The new German version of 1998
was a collaboration between

6
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,001
Cineteca del Comune di Bologna,
Deutsche Kinemathek and ZDF/Arte.

Screenplay By

Directed By

9
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:35,777
This is the tale of the strange
adventures of young Allan Gray,

10
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:41,586
who immersed himself in the study
of devil worship and vampires.

11
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:47,426
Preoccupied with superstitions
of centuries past, he became a dreamer

12
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:53,266
for whom the line between the real
and the supernatural became blurred.

13
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:59,105
His aimless wanderings
led him late one evening

14
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:04,113
to a secluded inn
by the river

15
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:08,014
in a village called
Courtempierre.

16
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,884
<i>Who's there? </i>

17
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,458
Go around.

18
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,933
Good night.

19
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,137
It was an eerie moonlit night.

20
00:06:55,348 --> 00:07:00,809
Light and shadow, voices and faces
seemed to take on hidden meaning.

21
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,080
Allan Gray felt a sinister
force descend upon him.

22
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,726
In vain he fought
the terror that seized him,

23
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,624
and fear of things he could not name
haunted his restless sleep.

24
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,885
Who are you?

25
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,253
Quiet!

26
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,272
She mustn't die!
You understand?

27
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:43,877
TO BE OPENED...

28
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:49,712
UPON MY DEATH

29
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,610
What was going on?

30
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,942
What terrifying secret
was unfolding?

31
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,279
Allan Gray felt certain
of one thing:

32
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,616
A soul in mortal distress
was crying out for help,

33
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,157
and a voice within
urged him to heed that call.

34
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,950
Silence!

35
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,767
Did you hear that?

36
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,097
Yes. The child.

37
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,142
The child?

38
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,709
Yes, the child!

39
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,815
There's no child here.

40
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,974
But the dogs!

41
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,842
There are no children
or dogs here!

42
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,940
No?

43
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,712
No.

44
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,582
Good night.

45
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,419
Good night.

46
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,571
He followed the fleeting shadows
and came to a large estate

47
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:47,734
where a forlorn manor rose up
among ancient trees.

48
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,005
Here, in seclusion,

49
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,343
with only his two daughters
and a few servants for company,

50
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,682
lived the man who had appeared
to Allan Gray earlier at the inn.

51
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:54,300
The wounds have almost healed.

52
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,620
The blood!

53
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,491
The blood!

54
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,542
Don't go to bed
until the doctor arrives.

55
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,559
Open up! Hurry!

56
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,668
For heaven's sake, hurry!

57
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,970
<i>I'm coming. </i>

58
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,978
What's wrong?

59
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,775
What is it?

60
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,113
Quick!
They're trying to kill him!

61
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,894
The other door.

62
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:06,061
Jeanne, light the lamps
in the library.

63
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:10,701
And you stay with Gisèle,
you hear?

64
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,991
Is he dead?

65
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,662
Yes.

66
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,531
Won't you please
stay here with us?

67
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,639
Where is he going?

68
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,807
To the police.

69
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,796
TO BE OPENED
UPON MY DEATH

70
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,997
THE STRANGE HISTOR Y
OF VAMPIRES

71
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:11,164
Accounts from many ages and lands
tell of terrible demons called vampires.

72
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:15,335
These are the bodies
and souls of the dead

73
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:19,847
whose terrible deeds in life
deny them repose in the grave.

74
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:23,646
Under the bright light
of the full moon,

75
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,814
they rise from their graves

76
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,154
to suck the blood of children
and young adults

77
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:35,321
and thus prolong
their shadowy existence.

78
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:39,230
The Prince of Darkness
is their ally

79
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:45,171
and lends them supernatural power
among the living and the dead.

80
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:29,111
At night these creatures
from the abyss

81
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,952
haunt the abodes of the living,

82
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:41,621
where they sow
death and decay.

83
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:48,295
A vampire's victim is doomed
to perish without hope.

84
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:55,810
A wound on the throat,
as from the bite of a cat or rat,

85
00:31:56,014 --> 00:32:00,474
is the mark of damnation.

86
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,620
Neither medical science...

87
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,421
Léone!

88
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,561
Where?

89
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,291
There, outside!

90
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,537
<i>Hurry! </i>

91
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,478
Léone!

92
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,513
Quick!

93
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,260
Like a plague,
the vampire's lust infects the victim,

94
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,763
who is torn
between a thirst for blood

95
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,597
and a desperate repulsion
toward this craving.

96
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,741
The innocent young person
itself becomes a vampire

97
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,877
and seeks to prey
on its nearest and dearest.

98
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,038
Entire families, even entire villages,
are thus brought under the curse.

99
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,034
If I could only die!

100
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,741
No, Léone.

101
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,606
I know.

102
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,674
I'm lost.

103
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,039
I'm damned.

104
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,322
I think she's dying.

105
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,936
Didn't you hear a scream?

106
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:35,364
Come!
The carriage is back!

107
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,146
She's asleep.

108
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,197
Good God!

109
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,796
What is that?

110
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,768
See that?

111
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,477
Blood.

112
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:13,767
The ghosts of executed criminals
are in their service,

113
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,772
but the living too may fall
under their dreadful sway.

114
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:25,279
An account from Hungary
tells of a village doctor

115
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:30,443
who, having sold his soul
to the Evil One,

116
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,590
became a vampire's henchman

117
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:40,628
and thus an accessory to a series
of horrid crimes in that region.

118
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,276
<i>Good evening, Doctor. </i>

119
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,648
<i>Good evening. </i>
<i>How is she doing? </i>

120
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,347
<i>- Not well at all. </i>
<i>- Oh? Why is that? </i>

121
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,528
We found her
out on the grounds.

122
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,791
Well, let's go see.

123
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,230
<i>She has another</i>
<i>of those marks on her neck. </i>

124
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,872
<i>We'll have a look. </i>

125
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,917
Good evening.

126
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,630
Good evening.
Come along.

127
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,037
You stay down here.

128
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,889
She's doing very poorly.

129
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,301
- Pulse?
- Weak.

130
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,228
Can't she be saved?

131
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,258
Perhaps.

132
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,998
But she needs blood.

133
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,890
It must be human blood.

134
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,790
Are you willing
to give her your own?

135
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,508
Come, young man.

136
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:30,351
I'll draw your blood.

137
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,366
Why does the doctor
always come at night?

138
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:22,041
Once the vampire has gained
complete control over its victim,

139
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:27,047
it seeks to drive
the victim to suicide,

140
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:32,052
thus delivering that soul
to the Evil One.

141
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:37,888
For he who takes his own life
is lost for all eternity.

142
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:43,727
To him the Golden Gates
of Heaven are closed.

143
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:48,268
For him all hope is lost.

144
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,446
<i>Sister. </i>

145
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,317
Come here a moment.

146
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,890
You may go to bed now.

147
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,368
Did you hear me?

148
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,358
Who can solve the riddle
of life and death

149
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:50,021
or fathom the dark secrets
hidden from the light of day?

150
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,863
For just as strange
as a vampire's existence

151
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,665
is the manner of its demise.

152
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,241
These dead who cannot find peace
must be murdered

153
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:03,607
to deliver a tormented humanity
from their grip.

154
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,840
Many monasteries and libraries
possess in their secret archives...

155
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,025
Doctor!

156
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,563
What's wrong?

157
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,860
I'm losing blood.

158
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,630
Nonsense!
Your blood is right here!

159
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:42,375
...accounts of how vampires have been
rendered harmless in many places.

160
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,953
In the village of Kisilova,

161
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:52,117
haunted a generation ago
by a vampire in the form of an old woman,

162
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,264
the following procedure
was used:

163
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:59,595
At dawn the grave was opened,

164
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:06,265
and the old woman
was found lying as if asleep.

165
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:11,277
An iron stake was driven
through her heart,

166
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:16,441
nailing her horrid soul
to the earth.

167
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:21,454
She then died a true death,

168
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:27,824
and the curse that had lain
upon herself and her victims was broken.

169
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,809
<i>Come... follow me. </i>

170
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:46,449
<i>We shall become</i>
<i>one soul, one blood. </i>

171
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,881
<i>Follow me. </i>

172
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:52,451
<i>Death is waiting... </i>

173
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:59,651
...deliverance by the grace
of our heavenly Lord.

174
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,263
Even in these parts,

175
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:06,926
tradition tells how certain areas
were haunted by vampires.

176
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,538
Just 25 years ago,
a murderous epidemic

177
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:14,370
claimed 11 victims
in the village of Courtempierre.

178
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,843
Doctors assigned the plague
a medical name,

179
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:21,711
but a persistent rumor
circulated among the people

180
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:25,877
that a vampire was
the cause of the scourge.

181
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,217
Many firmly believed
that vampire to be

182
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:34,193
none other than Marguerite Chopin,
who lay buried in the village cemetery.

183
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:38,835
All her life, Marguerite Chopin
had been a monster in human form.

184
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,028
She died
an unrepentant soul,

185
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:45,231
and the Church denied her
the Last Sacraments.

186
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,114
Come quickly!

187
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,690
Something terrible is happening!

188
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,885
Come quickly!

189
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,784
<i>Sister. </i>

190
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,260
I'm afraid of dying.

191
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,865
I am damned!

192
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:05,303
My God!

193
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,706
Sister.

194
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,676
She mustn't die.

195
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:47,907
She must live until sunrise,
you understand?

196
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,769
FROM DUST THOU ART

197
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:20,272
UNTO DUST THOU SHALT RETURN

198
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,214
Now go!

199
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,850
Quickly!

200
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,100
I feel strong.

201
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,365
My soul is free.

202
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:10,637
Ah, you're here.
Open this.

203
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,807
You hear me?

204
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:14,268
Listen to me!

205
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,151
Listen to me!

206
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,795
Please!

207
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,824
Curse you, you bastard!

208
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,799
Open up!

209
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:19,197
Let me out of here!

210
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:25,075
Open this gate!

211
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:01,779
<i>Over here. </i>

212
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:13,492
<i>This way. </i>
