00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,640
"The Three Mothers."

2
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,515
<i>I don 't know how much it will cost me</i>
<i>to break what we alchemists...</i>

3
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,393
<i>... have always called Silentium.</i>

4
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,838
<i>Our brothers ' experience warns us</i>
<i>to not trouble profane minds...</i>

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,319
<i>... with our knowledge.</i>

6
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,512
<i>I, Varelli, architect in London...</i>

7
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,398
<i>... have met the Three Mothers...</i>

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,711
<i>... and for them I created</i>
<i>and built three homes.</i>

9
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,079
<i>One in Rome, one in New York, and</i>
<i>the other one in Freiburg, Germany.</i>

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,630
<i>I discovered too late that</i>
<i>from these three places...</i>

11
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,037
<i>... they rule the world with pain,</i>
<i>tears and darkness.</i>

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,594
<i>Mater Suspiriorum, mother of sighs,</i>
<i>the oldest of the three, lives in Freiburg.</i>

13
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,515
<i>Mater Lacrimarum, mother of tears,</i>
<i>the prettiest, rules in Rome.</i>

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,434
<i>Mater Tenebrarum,</i>
<i>the youngest and the cruelest...</i>

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,676
<i>... reigns over New York.</i>

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,633
<i>And I built their monstrous dwellings...</i>

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,677
<i>... caskets for their secrets.</i>

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,196
<i>Mothers. Stepmothers that</i>
<i>do not give birth to life.</i>

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,478
<i>Sisters. Mistresses of</i>
<i>the horrors of humanity.</i>

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,990
<i>Men, mistaken, call them with</i>
<i>one terrible name.</i>

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,233
<i>But in the beginning, there were three</i>
<i>mothers, as there were three sisters...</i>

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,960
<i>... three Muses, three Graces,</i>
<i>three Fates, and three Furies.</i>

23
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,159
<i>The earth that the houses are built</i>
<i>upon becomes deadly and pestilent.</i>

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,992
<i>So much so that</i>
<i>the buildings surrounding them...</i>

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,832
<i>... and sometimes the entire</i>
<i>neighborhood...</i>

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,989
<i>... smell bad because of them.</i>

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,311
<i>This is the first key to unlock</i>
<i>their secret.</i>

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,869
<i>This is the first key.</i>

29
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,873
<i>The second key to discover</i>
<i>the three sisters '...</i>

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,156
<i>... venomous secret...</i>

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,393
<i>... is hidden in the basements</i>
<i>of their homes.</i>

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,439
<i>There, you will find an image</i>
<i>of the house's dweller.</i>

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,910
<i>There is the second key.</i>

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,278
<i>The third is under the sole</i>
<i>of your shoes.</i>

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,274
<i>There is the third key.</i>

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,990
<i>Dear Mark, my brother.</i>

37
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,516
<i>The second key is in the basement.</i>

38
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,834
Good evening.

39
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,713
I've come to talk to you about that book.

40
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,871
Which book?

41
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,113
The last one you sold me.
<i>The Three Mothers.</i>

42
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,869
Have you read it, by any chance?

43
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,628
A few passages, yes.

44
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,710
Listen, is it a made-up story,
or is there some truth to it?

45
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,394
It upset you, right?

46
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,755
That is nothing more
than a book written...

47
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,195
...by an ordinary alchemist.

48
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,273
You know, very many books have
been written about damned houses.

49
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,079
The Monsters' Villa in Bagheria,
near Palermo.

50
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,710
The Palace of the Peacock in Brussels.

51
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,110
The Salamander House in France.

52
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,068
Some people think they are purely
works of imagination.

53
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,471
Others believe in them blindly.

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,276
Usually, women are the worst readers
of these books.

55
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,238
Or the best, rather.

56
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,551
They take everything they read literally.

57
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,510
But no, you see, in one chapter the book
talks about a very particular bad smell.

58
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,477
And in this neighborhood, I smell...

59
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,154
...a strange, sweetish, nauseating smell,
you know?

60
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,717
They say it's because
of the cookie factory.

61
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,316
I've lived here a long time, and I've
always smelled it. Does it bother you?

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,548
It's just a matter of getting used to it.
Eventually, you won't notice it.

63
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,274
This isn't the only mystery.
There's another one.

64
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,112
- Lf you've read the book...
- There are many...

65
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,599
...mysteries in that book...

66
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,469
...but life's only big mystery
is that it is governed...

67
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,030
...only by dead people.

68
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,316
Good night.

69
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,717
<i>The second key...</i>

70
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,633
...<i>is in the basement.</i>

71
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,592
She went snooping around,
we have to hide everything.

72
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,230
We really have to hide everything.

73
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,592
This musical piece is the famous
"Va, pensiero."

74
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,471
Finale.

75
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,588
Part three.

76
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,757
From <i>Nabucco</i>, by Giuseppe Verdi.

77
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,110
<i>Dear Mark, my brother.</i>

78
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,919
<i>You know that here in New York,</i>
<i>for some time already...</i>

79
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,958
...<i>I've been living in an old building.</i>

80
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,035
Excuse me, I'd like
to go somewhere else.

81
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,638
49 Via dei Bagni.

82
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,396
What a strange smell.

83
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,152
Sickly sweet.

84
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,912

87
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,317
Nothing.

88
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,998
Are you looking for something?

89
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,912
No...

90
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,317
Yes, I'm looking for an old book.

91
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,596
I might be able to help you.

92
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,991
The title is <i>The Three Mothers.</i>
Yes, <i>The Three Mothers.</i>

93
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,391
Look, it's there. Right behind you.

94
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,713
Thank you.

We're closing.

108
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,591
Did you bring it for sure?

109
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,919
They're already there, don't you hear?
Come on.

110
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,279
- Nobody knows, it's not possible.
- Yes. What should I do?

111
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,149
Sir?

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,592
Excuse me.

The other door.

116
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,629
- The book.
- What?

117
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,513
It's not late, dear.

118
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,672
Yes, it is, we should
have gotten here sooner.

119
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,038
Which floor?

120
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,392
Which floor?

121
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,238
Fourth.

122
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,029
No.

123
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,595
Can I help you?

124
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,591
I'm afraid.

125
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,954
I'm afraid to be left alone.

126
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,554
All right.

127
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,950
I have nothing to do
for a couple of hours.

128
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,473
I can keep you company if you want.

129
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,749
What do you do, Sara?

130
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,909
Do you study or work?

131
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,149
I study music.

132
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,874
What do you do?

133
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,359
I'm a journalist...

134
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,748
...sports reports for television.

135
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,198
- Can I ask you a strange question?
- How strange?

136
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,716
Have you ever heard about
the Three Sisters?

137
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,350
- You mean those black singers?
- No.

138
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,114
I mean that ancient myth, the triad.

139
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,430
If you're talking about
ghosts or stuff like that...

140
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,874
...sorry, but I don't believe in it.

141
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,519
How can you be so sure?

142
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,511
I don't believe in it. That's all.

143
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,591
No philosophical discussions.

144
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,593
So what do you believe in?

145
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,593
In everything I see and touch.

146
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,789
You probably know this music.

147
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,599
It's Verdi's "Va, pensiero."

148
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,551
Mark, is that you?

149
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,278
I have that letter from your sister
that you forgot at the Academy.

150
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,317
Listen, have you read it?

151
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,959
You have to read it. It's important.

152
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,078
Come here right away, please.
I need to talk to you.

153
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,349
What's going on?

154
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,479
I don't know.
Maybe there's a voltage drop.

155
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,754
- Carlo?
- Yes?

156
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,797
Listen, where's the electricity meter?

157
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,717
It's in the closet at the end of the hall,
but please don't go in there!

158
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,155
Don't worry, I just want
to check the switches.

159
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,710
Yes, but keep talking to me.
Always let me know where you are.

160
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,552
All right.

161
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,192
Carlo?

162
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,429
Carlo, where are you?

163
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,989
In the closet. I found the switches.

164
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,711
Wait, I'm coming over there. I'm scared.

165
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,589
Carlo! Oh, my God, Carlo!

166
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,600
Carlo, what's going on?

167
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,671
I think I fixed it.

168
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,359
See?

169
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,792
Carlo?

170
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,593
Sara?

171
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,119
Sara?

172
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,311
Sara, it's Mark.

173
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,237
<i>"Dear Mark, my brother.</i>

174
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,714
<i>Kazanian. In my house lives... The third</i>
<i>key is under the sole of your shoes. "</i>

175
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,912
- Maybe it was a maniac.
- No...

176
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,719
...I think it was
the usual crazy slaughterer.

177
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,477
Nobody...

178
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,474
All right...

179
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,629
Do you know what happened?

180
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,236
L... I don't know anything,
she was already dead.

181
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,913
Nothing.

182
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,469
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

183
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,916
- Rose, can you hear me? It's Mark.
- <i>Oh, Mark, finally.</i>

184
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,275
You sound far away,
can you speak louder?

185
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,873
<i>Did you receive my letter?</i>

186
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,875
Yes, yes, I received it,
but I wasrt able to read it.

187
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,758
<i>Why not?</i>

188
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,831
I just couldn't.

189
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,595
Hello?

190
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,830
I can't hear anything.

191
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,709
<i>So come to New York right away,</i>
<i>Mark. Please, do it for me.</i>

192
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,156
I can't hear you.
I don't understand. What's going on?

193
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,117
<i>Promise me that</i>
<i>you'll come here right away.</i>

194
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,599
Yes, yes, of course.
I'll come there right away.

195
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,557
Hello?

196
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,473
Hello? Rose, can you hear me?

197
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,073
Mark?

198
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,792
Mark?

199
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,748
- You shouldn't think about it.
- What is it?

200
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,434
Although, sometimes, it's much better.

201
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,198
They shall come at sunrise. Yes.

202
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,352
This one goes to the usual person.

203
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,115
Excuse me?

204
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,789
Yes?

205
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,393
I'm Mark Elliot, Rose's brother.

206
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,359
Oh, yes.

207
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,558
Apartment 45, 4th floor. Here is a copy
of the key. If you'd like to go upstairs...

208
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,199
Thank you.

209
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,194
- So do you want to go upstairs or not?
- Oh, yes.

210
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,915
Fourth floor, on the left.

211
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,479
This is Miss Elliot's brother.

212
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,153
He just got here...

213
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,514
...all the way from Rome.

214
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,238
Oh, Italy.

215
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,518
Thank you.

216
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,194
He'd like to talk to you.

217
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,875
That's what he does when
he wants to communicate with someone.

218
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,312
This is professor George Arnold.
He's been sick for many years.

219
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,476
And what do you do?

220
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,518
Oh, l... I study musicology.

221
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,514
Wonderful. A toxicology professor.

222
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,071
- We know two other...
- Not toxicology, musicology. Nothing...

223
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,595
...to do with medicine.
- What is it, then?

224
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,518
The study of music.

225
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,956
Oh, yes. Your sister has
a very strange job too, right?

226
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,872
Strange? No, she writes poems.

227
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,158
Oh, yes, a very appropriate
pastime for a woman, don't you think?

228
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,311
Goodbye.

229
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,791
Rose?

230
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,112
Rose?

231
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,632
Rose?

232
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,075
Rose?

233
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,118
- Was that you?
- Yes.

234
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,159
I was calling Rose. I saw
the lights on, so I thought she was back.

235
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,151
We're friends. I live upstairs.

236
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,710
No, Rose is not here.
I'm Mark, her brother.

237
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,714
How did you do that?
The voice sounded strange, it echoed.

238
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,675
Rose and I discovered it a while ago.

239
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,877
It's our little secret. Look.

240
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,595
See this hole in the wall?

241
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,557
It's connected to your apartment.

242
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,915
It reaches every room
through some open pipes.

243
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,718
When you talk into it...

244
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,757
...your voice is amplified.

245
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,469
This is an old building
and it's full of strange secrets.

246
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,551
Listen, do you want to come in?

247
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,871
Okay, but only for a minute.

248
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,994
No, don't close it. Someone will
come to let me know I got a phone call.

249
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,072
My name is Elise Stallone Van Adler.

250
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,152
I've been living here
alone for over five years.

251
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,788
My husband is always away for work.

252
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,269
I can't go with him, because...

253
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,998
...I'm sick.

254
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,076
It's very strange.
Rose knew I'd be arriving.

255
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,358
I was sure she'd be here
waiting for me.

256
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,909
I don't understand where she could be.

257
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,152
Listen, what kind of people live here?

258
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,470
There aren't many tenants.

259
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,676
Part of the building is empty.

260
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,476
No, I mean...

261
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,518
...anybody special. I don't know...

262
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,194
I can't explain it, but
in one of her letters Rose mentioned...

263
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,717
All I know is that this building used
to belong to an eccentric, rich old man.

264
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,030
When he died, it was vacant for years...

265
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,077
...until a holding company took it over.

266
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,553
Who is Kazanian?

267
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,917
He's an antique book seller
who has a store nearby.

268
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,753
Rose bought some very
rare books from him.

269
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,399
And also...

270
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,868
Please excuse me.

271
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,110
You have a phone call,
Madame Countess.

272
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,077
All right, I'll be right there.

273
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,754
- Bye, see you tomorrow, Mark.
- Bye.

274
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,873
Did you hurt yourself,
Madame Countess?

275
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,873
No, no, it's paint, not blood.

276
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,238
Who's there?

277
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,673
Who's there?

278
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,714
You filthy animal.

279
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,874
Damn cats.

280
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,917
How much was the dose this time?

281
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,556
The first was 200 milligrams.

282
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,720
The second, 400.

283
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,360
This is the strongest dose.

284
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,629
Do you want me to run you a bath?

285
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,518
Thank you.

286
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,593
Blood.

287
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,710
Your bath is ready, ma'am.

288
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,440
Good night.
See you tomorrow morning.

289
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,069
Good night.

290
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,276
I hope you sleep well.

291
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,192
There is some blood in the hallway.

292
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,555
Did you notice that
the door handle is broken?

293
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,870
- Yes, I saw that.
- I want to tell you something.

294
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,514
I thought Rose was just raving.

295
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,150
Her nervousness, her fear of death...

296
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,669
...the myth of the Three Mothers.

297
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,308
- And what's that?
- It's her obsession.

298
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,993
They are three Latin names.

299
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,595
Mater Suspiriorum...

300
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,478
...the mother of sighs.

301
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,030
Mater Lacrimarum, the mother of tears.

302
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,431
And Mater Tenebrarum,
the mother of darkness.

303
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,194
Rose read about
this myth in an old book.

304
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,555
And she talks about it
like it's a true story.

305
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,754
She thinks someone
lives in this building.

306
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,512
But I don't know.
I can't explain it to you.

307
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,911
She should tell you.
It all sounds absurd to me...

308
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,594
...so impossible.
She's convinced that somehow...

309
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,194
...the building is connected
to those three mothers.

310
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,238
She talked about an architect,
Marelli or Varelli, I don't remember.

311
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,435
An Italian name.

312
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,712
That's how she expresses herself.
It's confusing...

313
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,318
Excited. And the feeling
of always being watched.

314
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,233
She's felt its presence.

315
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,710
I believe her doctor gave...

316
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,554
Did you hear this laugh?

317
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,718
- Which laugh?
- I thought I heard...

318
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,313
...someone laughing.

319
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,596
You were right, Elise.

320
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,040
This is really blood. Come take a look.

321
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,238
- Where does that door lead to?
- The service stairs. No one uses them.

322
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,835
Maybe Rose went out this way.

323
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,037
- I'll go take a look. You want to go?
- No, I'll wait for you here.

324
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,111
I'm scared.

325
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,272
All right.

326
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,559
Mark.

327
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,639
Mark.

328
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,188
Mark.

329
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,112
Where are you?

330
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,399
Mark?

331
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,791
Answer me.

332
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,314
Open the door, please!

333
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,592
My heart.

334
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:48,477
Please help me. Pain... My heart...

335
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,798
He says it's his heart.

336
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,110
A cardiotonic.
He'll feel better right away.

337
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,792
My... My God.

338
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,632
I'm in so much pain.

339
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,792
Come on, drink this.
You'll see, it will help.

340
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,754
Where did Rose go?

341
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,951
Where did she go?

342
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,190
Why isn't she coming back? Why?

343
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,671
I think we better take him
to his apartment.

344
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,195
Where did she go?

345
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,589
Elise?

346
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,716
Elise, it's Mark. Can you hear me?

347
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,118
Elise, it's Mark.

348
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,709
Elise.

349
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,190
Elise, it's Mark.

350
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,033
It's really disgusting.

351
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,918
There must be a dozen cats here.

352
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,230
They keep getting in my way.

353
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,313
The other night one of those damn cats
scratched me and broke a little statue.

354
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,075
This is the last time I tell you,
because next time...

355
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,719
...I'll go to the police...

356
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,871
...or to the Health Department,
if I have to.

357
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,268
I warned you.

358
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,317
You better make those...

359
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,674
...damn cats disappear.

360
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,832
Do whatever you want, Mr. Kazanian.

361
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,074
Good morning.

362
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,399
Do you feel better, Mr. Elliot?

363
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,596
Yes, but I don't remember
what happened to me last night.

364
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,478
You werert feeling well.
You know, your heart.

365
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,834
I've never had heart problems.

366
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,560
- We gave you some medicine.
- Who was that man?

367
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,233
That guy? His name is Kazanian.

368
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,392
- He's an antique dealer.
- Thanks, and thanks for last night.

369
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,152
You're welcome.

370
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,511
- Mr. Kazanian.
- Yes?

371
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,671
My name is Mark Elliot.
I'm Rose's brother.

372
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,478
- I know you know her.
- Oh, I remember her.

373
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,676
- Yes, she bought several books.
- Do you know her well?

374
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,513
- No, why?
- No one has seen her in two days.

375
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,910
- I thought that...
- I just sold her some books.

376
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,638
What kind of books?

377
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,519
Antique books, old editions.

378
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,719
If you can't find her, why don't
you try the usual routine?

379
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,997
- And what's that?
- Call the hospitals...

380
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,913
...or the police.
- I did, but they don't know anything.

381
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,911
Listen, do you understand this phrase?

382
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,150
"The key is under
the sole of your shoes."

383
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,231
What's that, a riddle?

384
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,358
I'm not too good with riddles.

385
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,116
How long have you been here?

386
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,078
I just got here yesterday.

387
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,838
You know what? There is going
to be a lunar eclipse tonight.

388
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,560
Oh, I didn't know.

389
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:06,396
It's been 46 years since the last
total eclipse we saw from here.

390
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,109
They just said so on television.

391
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,077
I urge you to watch it.

392
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,949
- It will be very interesting.
- All right, I'll watch it.

393
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,310
You'll thank me for it.

394
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,597
Goodbye, Mr. Elliot.

395
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,116
Goodbye.

396
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,396
Where are you?

397
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,836
There you are.

398
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,917
There you are.

399
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,556
Come on, boy, come out of there.

400
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,353
Come on, come out of there. Come on.

401
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,355
Come here, boy.

402
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,950
Good boy.

403
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,154
You wanted to hide, huh?

404
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,233
My crutch.

405
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,116
Help me!

406
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,718
My legs. Help me.

407
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,718
Help me!

408
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,192
Please! Please!

409
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,759
Oh, God! Mice, no.

410
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,830
I can't take it anymore!

411
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:23,955
Mice! Oh, my God, mice!

412
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,033
Help!

413
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,593
Help! Oh, my God!

414
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,836
Save me, Christ!
Someone get me out of here!

415
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,788
Get out of here! Go away!

416
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,070
Please, help!

417
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,197
Hurry! Hurry, run!
They're eating me alive!

418
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,877
I can't take it anymore! Hurry!

419
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:41,278
Mice! Run! Help!

420
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,599
Come take a look.

421
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,679
Oh, my God. That's a lot of stuff.

422
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:37,356
That horrible countess thought
she had hidden them well.

423
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,115
But you know what? It took
me less than 15 minutes to find them.

424
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,555
- You've been drinking today.
- No, that's not true.

425
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,349
- You have been drinking, I can smell it.
- I told you I haven't.

426
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,153
Well.

427
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,193
Now, go upstairs and
call her husband right away.

428
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,316
Do you know where to find him?

429
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,233
Tell him the countess left suddenly...

430
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,675
...taking all her valuables with her.

431
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,589
- And what if she comes back?
- She won't.

432
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,750
- Don't worry, she's never coming back.
- How can you be so sure?

433
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,194
What if she shows up?

434
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,756
I told you, the countess
is never coming back here.

435
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,230
Now, go call her husband.

436
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,919
Soon, it will be our turn to enjoy life...

437
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,548
...as much as the countess enjoyed it...

438
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,075
...along with
all those other rich bastards.

439
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,199
Who is it?

440
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,398
Who's there?

441
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,598
John?

442
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,753
John?

443
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,153
John?

444
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,835
How did that phrase go?

445
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:08,035
"Under the sole of your shoes."

446
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,438
"The key is under the sole
of your shoes."

447
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,158
Did you find the way?

448
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,194
- I suppose you know who I am.
- No, I don't know.

449
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,989
Many years ago, when I lived
in London, I was known as Varelli.

450
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,478
Now, I use another
name in order to be forgotten.

451
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:10,870
Are you surprised to hear my voice?

452
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,474
I can only talk with this.

453
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,480
I built the houses of
the Three Mothers.

454
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,790
Houses that are eyes
with which they see.

455
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,072
And then I buried myself in here.

456
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,994
This building has become my body,
its bricks are my cells.

457
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,549
Its passageways are my veins.

458
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,274
Its horror is my life now.

459
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,833
My sister. Where is my sister?

460
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,356
Come closer. She mustrt hear us.

461
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,034
She's the cruelest of all three.

462
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,555
The mother of darkness.

463
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,710
Come here.

464
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:52,388
You're not afraid of
an old man who can't move, are you?

465
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:56,639
I'll whisper it in your ear.
Come a little closer.

466
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,633
L... I am dying.

467
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,950
But nothing will ever be able to change.

468
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:16,750
They won't allow it.
They don't want anything to change.

469
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,353
I am not the master. I am only...

470
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:25,115
...a servant.
- Who lives in these damned houses?

471
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,397
Someone who waits.

472
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:32,229
- Who is it?
- She's watching you right now.

473
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:37,471
But remember one thing:

474
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:41,036
You are dust compared to her.

475
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,637
Burning.

476
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:50,712
Everything is burning.
It has already happened once before.

477
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,631
We have to get out of this place.

478
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,676
You will not leave.

479
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,357
The end of your journey is near.

480
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,516
Everything around you will become dark.

481
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:26,797
Someone will guide you
by the hand, and you'll be glad.

482
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,393
You must not be afraid. You will also
know moments of incredible light.

483
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:45,353
You think this is magic? No.

484
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,513
I am not a magician. Let's hurry now...

485
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:52,713
...because you still have to go through
several apparitions and tremble.

486
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,639
You were looking for me, right?
Just like your sister.

487
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,997
This is what you wanted, right?
I'm coming to get you now.

488
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:02,556
- Who are you?
- The Three Mothers.

489
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:04,870
What, you don't understand?

490
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,430
Mater Tenebrarum, Mater Lacrimarum...

491
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:11,594
...Mater Suspiriorum...

492
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,070
...but men call us by one name...

493
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,754
...a name which frightens everyone.

494
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:21,077
They call us Death.

495
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,719
Death!

496
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,236
Stand back, stand back.

497
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,594
Stand back.
