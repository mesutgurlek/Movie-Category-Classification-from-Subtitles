May I?

You were abducted from your home
the night of September 3, 1958.

You were left chained up in the basement

the same farmhouse you burned down.

723
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:33,042
You were only 11 years old,

01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:36,793
half-starved, sick with fever,
trapped in the darkness.

It was a waking nightmare.

Your only escape was into delusion.

727
01:18:44,478 --> 01:18:48,471
In order to survive the trauma,
your psyche fractured.

728
01:18:51,652 --> 01:18:54,689
You suffer from multiple
personality disorder.

729
01:18:57,616 --> 01:19:00,107
Each personality

730
01:19:00,494 --> 01:19:04,658
took a piece of this nightmare
and locked it away from you

731

But the new personalities
became so dominant,
