1
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,675
I'll tell you, but it's
just between you and me.

2
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,770
I'll tell you what's happening in
this society, what's beginning...

3
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,181
...just because you
don't know about it.

4
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,528
No, that's not it.

5
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,162
I'm just watching.

6
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,561
I mean, the me in the Wired is...

7
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,371
Right. She's becoming
less and less like me.

8
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,203
I don't really know.

9
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,777
Huh? Who?

10
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,927
Sis?

11
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,069
My sister's been acting
different lately.

12
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,740
I... I'm not sure.

13
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,683
Right.

14
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,053
Fine, suit yourself.

15
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,315
I know.

16
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:12,096
The real world and the Wired
are attached end to end.

17
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,997
I can exist anywhere.

18
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,039
No matter where my body is, I can
send my consciousness anywhere I want.

19
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,099
It's time for the EMA Motor
Consortium banquet.

20
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,535
Right.

21
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,520
Mail.

22
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,217
I'll be down in three minutes.

23
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,483
Very well.

24
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,252
What game do you want
to play this time?

25
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,892
Try some of this...

26
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,902
That's right, you morons...

27
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,042
I'm better than you bozos!

28
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,221
The real world isn't real at all.

29
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,089
Lain?

30
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,031
Are you okay?

31
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,861
Why do you ask?

32
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,668
Lately, you've been...
slipping again, Lain.

33
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:19,140
We... We wanted to make you happy,
so we've been taking you out with us.

34
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,689
That's what we were
trying to do. Honest.

35
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,451
But if you weren't
happy, I apologize.

36
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,722
No! That's not it...

37
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,858
Of course I was having fun...

38
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,768
I've had a great time.

39
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,321
Glad to hear it.

40
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,056
Arisu!

41
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:04,925
Yeah?

42
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:10,458
Um... Thanks.
Thanks for worrying about me.

43
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,196
That's what friends are for, right?

44
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,731
See you.

45
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:33,254
This afternoon, the firewall
of the Information Bureau's...

46
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,323
...information Control Center was
cracked and destroyed by some party,

47
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,764
and information in the Wired
Network is currently in disarray.

48
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,100
This news report is being
sent out at this moment,

49
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:51,772
but please be aware that it may arrive
tomorrow, or possibly yesterday.

50
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,837
Looks like it was the Knights.

51
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,611
"Knights"? Who's that?

52
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,619
"Knights." The Knights of
the Eastern Calculus,

53
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,180
said to have great
influence in the Wired.

54
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,522
Members comprising
the group: unknown.

55
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,420
They are not only involved in
mere information manipulation,

56
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,897
they also are involved in the
development and distribution...

57
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,367
...of illegal information devices.

58
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,627
I hear somebody's after Lain!

59
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,830
Lain? Who's that?

60
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,672
Lain. Search has no matches.

61
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,145
I haven't seen Lain around lately.

62
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,611
Who the hell is Lain?

63
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,804
A girl.

64
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:31,837
A girl?

65
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:32,972
She's powerful!

66
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,143
How?

67
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,414
Her metamorphosis.
Her will. Her power.

68
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,321
The light in her eyes.
Her existence.

69
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,194
Hey, can I ask you something?

70
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,127
What?

71
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,225
You wouldn't happen to be a
Knights member, would you?

72
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,474
Just a minute!

73
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,041
<i>Delivery, ma'am!</i>

74
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,510
Let me get <i>my</i> stamp.

75
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,823
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
keep you waiting so long.

76
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,021
That's okay, ma'am.

77
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,022
Okay, here's my stamp.

78
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,594
What is it?

79
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,964
That Navi.

80
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,228
That's a new model, right?
I wish I had one.

81
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,102
I bought it with money
from my home job.

82
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:34,141
Even working at a job like this, I'd
never be able to buy one of those.

83
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:34,973
Here you are.

84
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,636
Well, keep working for it.

85
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,613
Sure thing.

86
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,778
Yeah, you're right... If I don't
work hard, I'll never...

87
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,155
If you have trouble with anything,
let me know. I can teach you.

88
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,928
You'll teach me?

89
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,755
Sure. I'm pretty good.

90
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,825
So this is how you seduce
bored housewives, huh?

91
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,494
No, I just...

92
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,038
Well, maybe a little.

93
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,005
I'm home!

94
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,035
Well, thanks.

95
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:19,846
Morn, can I go over to
Kinya's to play later?

96
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,623
If you're going to play a game,
can't you just do it over the Net?

97
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,394
He's gonna teach me how to play it!

98
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,664
The Wired and the real world
are one and the same.

99
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,457
W-What?

100
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:04,190
Ms. Lain lwakura. Would you
please come with us?

101
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:10,507
We won't force you.
This is a request.

102
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:17,571
We have no intention to
harm you physically.

103
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,981
Who are you?

104
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,295
If you come with us, we'll tell you.

105
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:47,974
I... I don't want to be here.
You understand that, don't you?

106
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,380
Just look at all I can do! Look!

107
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,976
I'm breaking the barrier between
the real world and the Wired.

108
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,482
Come on, I think I'm
plenty qualified.

109
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,086
Let me into the Knights!

110
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,393
You're impressed, huh?

111
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,199
I tracked you down all by myself!

112
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,068
This is your dedicated
top-secret channel, right?

113
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,098
Come on, make me one of you!

114
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,752
W-Who are you?!

115
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,846
Could you come here for a minute?

116
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,379
I can't seem to get the main office's
firewall to recognize this machine.

117
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,651
I've done everything I can
on the app end of things.

118
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:50,524
I guess it's hopeless with
an old machine like this.

119
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,068
But I've always used this thing...

120
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,896
I just can't work up the interest
to switch over to a new Navi.

121
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,973
Not at my age.

122
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,751
If I were as young as you, though...

123
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,321
That jumper there.

124
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,125
Try removing this jumper
and that one over there.

125
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,225
Sorry, could you do it for me?

126
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,150
Authorized.

127
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,292
L-Lain? You're one of the Knights?!

128
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:03,938
You are, aren't you, Lain?
I had no idea!

129
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,905
Moron.

130
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,940
W-Wait! Please!

131
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,717
That game you've been playing with
those kids lately is the greatest!

132
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,486
But I have an even better idea.

133
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:23,923
So, please! Make me one of you!
Make me a Knight!

134
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,354
Please, make me one of you!

135
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:32,426
Some say that the Wired doesn't have
political borders like the real world.

136
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,669
But there are far too many...

137
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:41,001
...nonsense-spouting anarchists or idiots
who think that pranks are a revolution.

138
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,179
But the Knights don't seem
to be either of those.

139
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,347
Knights...

140
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,986
I'm don't know how much of
what you do is intentional.

141
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,327
Your presence in the
Wired is highly unnatural.

142
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:04,925
And the Knights seem to have
a special interest in you.

143
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:10,331
I... I don't...
I don't understand what you're...

144
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:15,436
The Knights... You've been in direct
contact with them at some point.

145
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,547
But I... I don't...

146
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:24,654
At any rate, it looks like they
want to use you for something.

147
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:30,291
We believe that is something that
must be prevented, no matter the cost.

148
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:35,425
W-What... are you?
Who are you?

149
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,471
Your secret's safe with me. You bet!

150
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,809
You believe in Deus, right?
I'll follow your lead.

151
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,953
But is it true? ls God
really in the Wired?

152
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,887
I'm not ready to believe that yet.

153
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,258
But if you let me join you,
I'll be able to learn more.

154
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,094
Then I'll believe!

155
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,566
Is that you?

156
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,796
You came!

157
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,138
You came for me!

158
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,039
My name...

159
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,876
It's meaningless to
know my real name.

160
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,152
I, and those gentlemen
there, have no name.

161
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,582
Tell me.

162
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:39,227
Lain lwakura, are you and the Lain
of the Wired one and the same?

163
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,425
Who are you?

164
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,331
I... I'm...

165
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,398
Are your parents your real parents?

166
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:50,932
Huh?

167
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,469
Is your sister your real sister?

168
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:58,073
W-What are you saying?
0-Of course they are...

169
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,081
When is your father's birthday?

170
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,681
Dad's... His...

171
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,618
What about your mother's birthday?
When did your parents get married?

172
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,457
Did they meet, or was it arranged?

173
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:16,228
T-That's... I...

174
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,268
Why don't you know? You never asked?

175
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,902
You've never celebrated a birthday in
your family? Not since you were little?

176
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,270
Well?

177
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:34,083
When were you born? Where?

178
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,383
I... What does it matter? It...

179
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,955
You don't know?
You don't know anything?

180
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,299
Are you okay?
You don't know anything.

181
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,604
Shut up, damn it...

182
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,901
Who cares about that crap?
Like any of it matters...

183
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,678
You're Lain of the Wired?

184
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,149
So what if I am?

185
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:17,259
If you're here without a device,
you know that the border between...

186
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,421
...the real world and the Wired is
starting to crumble, don't you?

187
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,825
So?

188
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,960
We believe that to be dangerous.

189
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,563
Sounds interesting.

190
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:35,767
Move it.

191
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,417
What's the big idea?

192
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,752
You are what's dangerous.

193
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,254
Karl!

194
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,998
It's as she said. Something
interesting is beginning.

195
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,073
We should just watch
from the sidelines.

196
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,247
Shou!

197
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,915
Yeah, Morn?

198
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,115
Let me play, too!

199
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,381
Are you done with work?

200
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,583
You bet!

201
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,553
I'm the greatest!

202
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,925
I'm gonna get ya, Shou!

203
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,161
See? Say your prayers!

204
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,795
Watch this!

205
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:38,056
I thought I was innocent,
but I'm being punished.

206
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,357
I didn't start this, but I
have to finish it somehow.

207
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:06,388
I can't say I didn't know about it,
but I don't remember taking part in it.

208
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:12,859
I get the feeling <i>my</i>
freedom cost me dearly,

209
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:20,138
but I don't remember
selling my soul cheaply.

210
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,509
Hey, hey!

211
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:27,973
Until I die and say goodbye...

212
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,514
Hey, hey!

213
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:37,926
... no one can catch me.

214
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:45,725
You probably don't know
the eternal outlaws...

215
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:51,133
...who wander the distant night.
