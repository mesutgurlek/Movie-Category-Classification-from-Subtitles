Please, baby.

166
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:26,281
You all need to
get that thing back
where you found it.

167
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:27,751
But we think
they're coming
after us.

It ain't
my goddamn problem.

It ain't
my goddamn problem!

Now, you listen to me.

171

The longer you keep
that thing, the more
dangerous things get.

I told you,
he ain't changed.

00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:39,189
Wyatt,
just hear us out.

174
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:41,358
I'm not getting mixed up
in your shit, Duke.

175
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:45,996
I left this shit
in the rear view
a long time ago.

176
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:48,497
It's been 15 years, guys.

177
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:50,207
So let this shit go.

Fuck this pussy!

179
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,479
We'll take it back to Otis's
and carve it like a turkey.

The hell we will.
My mom would shit.

181

Pissing on these things
ain't gonna bring back Timmy.

182
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,112
I ain't gonna hide
like a pantywaist

183
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:05,385
from the sons of bitches
that murdered my brother.

but don't do it in here.

I'm gonna do what I want,

Come on.

here, Duke.

on this one, Cody.

Trust you?

192

Last time we did that,
you made us look
like ape shit.

we gone retard,
you asshole!

194
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:38,680
My own fucking father
thought I killed my brother

195
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:41,124
and buried him
out in the woods.

196

better for you.
Better?

we were lying?

we made everything up?

She's fucking
cutting it.

Please, baby.
Concentrate on my voice.

He's talking to it.
You let her go!

The gun.

328
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:05,862
Put down the gun, Cody.

that looks infected.

Might need
a tetanus shot.

347

remember?

Hell if I know.

You shouldn't be out
pulling some
cockamamie stunt, Duke.

been out trying to catch
one of those things?

Probably seven by now.

That's some shit.

It was either that
or just go out drinking.

365

Well, there was
some drinking
out there, too.

366
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:23,691
Actually, after a while,
it was pretty much
all about the drinking.

367
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,700
Got easier when Otis

it'd be better.

controlling you.

hit him that hard.

No, he ain't dead.
Don't worry.

let him rot away

all right?

Now you stay away from him.
That shit's contagious.

It won't do nothing to me.
