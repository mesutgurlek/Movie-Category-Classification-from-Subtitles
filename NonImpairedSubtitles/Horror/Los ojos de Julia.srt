1
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:41,085
Listen to me.

2
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,917
OK, you win.

3
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:48,805
At least you could stop that song.
You know l hate it.

4
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,360
Why are you so quiet?

5
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,083
Say something!

6
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,161
You're there.

7
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:16,999
And you're looking at me.

8
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:20,239
Do you think you can fool me?

9
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:23,399
No, no, you can't fool me,

10
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,206
because l can feel your presence.

11
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:29,238
And your movements.

12
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,398
l can even smell you.

13
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:33,319
lf you think...

14
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:35,842
lf you think, son of a bitch,

15
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,521
that l'll hang myself
while you watch, you...

16
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:02,519
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

17
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:04,723
Julia, what's wrong?

18
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:07,799
Julia, can you hear me?
Bring some water.

19
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,639
Take it easy, Julia.

20
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:12,441
Julia, are you OK?

21
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:13,835
- What happened?
- She fell.

22
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:17,079
- Oall a doctor, quick!
- No, l'm OK.

23
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,283
l'm OK.

24
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,924
This is Sara. I can't take your caII
at the moment. PIease...

25
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,641
Do you think it's a good idea
to show up after six months?

26
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,116
l just need to know
that she is all right.

27
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:39,484
Sara?

28
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:43,399
Sara?

29
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:47,598
Maybe they have gone out.

30
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:48,995
No...

31
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,283
l know something's happened to her.

32
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:03,556
The power is out.

33
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:09,476
- The fuses seem to be OK.
- l'll look upstairs.

34
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:15,476
Sara?

35
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,439
Sara?

36
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:51,118
lsaac, she's nowhere to be found.
We'll ask the neighbours.

37
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,517
- Don't come down.
- Why?

38
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:57,999
What's wrong?

39
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,442
lsaac, tell me what's wrong.

40
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:06,405
- What's wrong?
- Julia...

41
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,797
- What's wrong?
- Oome with me.

42
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:22,238
lnspector...

43
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:24,762
l'm sorry about what happened.

44
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:26,601
No, thanks.

45
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:31,204
The forensics say Sara took her own life
last night, during the blackout.

46
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,358
But we need to find out why.

47
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,803
l have been informed that she suffered
a degenerative disease.

48
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:41,483
Yes, a progressive vision loss,
the same as my wife.

49
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:44,844
But Sara went blind a year ago.

50
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:47,077
And how did she cope with that?

51
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:51,123
My sister wasn't depressed,
if that's what you mean.

52
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,323
ln fact, she was...

53
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,047
She was going to have surgery, right?

54
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,166
She was waiting for a donor,
but she hoped to get her vision back.

55
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:09,401
Maybe she got tired of waiting.

56
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:41,476
All right.

57
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:45,916
Yes, thank you.

58
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:53,324
Dr Roman can't come to the funeral,
and he sends his condolences.

59
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:56,957
He also wants to check your eyes
before you go back home.

60
00:07:57,127 --> 00:08:00,039
lsaac, the power is back.

61
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:04,399
Darling, are you listening?

62
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,362
And the OD started playing.
Did you hear it?

63
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,365
- Yes.
- Don't you think it's strange

64
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:14,485
that Sara was listening
to music before...?

65
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:16,842
Besides, she hated that song.

66
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:19,441
- Julia...
- What if she wasn't alone?

67
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:22,246
- What if she was with somebody?
- Julia, please.

68
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:26,446
We may never find out her reasons.
We hadn't heard from her in months.

69
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,996
lt's strange.
l need to know what happened.

70
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:32,523
- lt's not good for you to get upset.
- l'm not worried about myself.

71
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:36,885
Well, l am.
Stress can turn you blind.

72
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,766
lt's only happened to me
twice in five years.

73
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,680
And you've lost 20% of your vision.

74
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,642
Oh, no... Again.

75
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:12,045
Did you find anything?

76
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:14,880
Nothing, not even a candle.

77
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:18,805
- lt's time to meet the neighbours.
- OK, hurry up.

78
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,285
lsaac?

79
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,719
Julia.

80
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:40,123
Excuse me.

81
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,324
Excuse me.

82
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:51,198
l'm sorry for your loss.
l'm Blasco, her next-door neighbour.

83
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,006
l didn't know your sister very well,

84
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:59,002
but Lia loved her very much
and she wanted me to bring you this.

85
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:00,796
Lia?

86
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:04,801
My daughter.
Sara used to lend her books.

87
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:09,882
The poor girl is so upset she didn't
want to come out of the car.

88
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:12,881
Anyway...

89
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:18,360
Sorry... Lia would like to know
if Sara left any note.

90
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:23,204
- We don't know.
- l understand.

91
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:26,803
Anyway, l won't bother you any longer.

92
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:34,439
Shall we continue?

93
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,802
Only a neighbour and his daughter?

94
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:41,520
l didn't know she was so lonely.

95
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,362
But l forgave her.

96
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,755
And l also forgave you.

97
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:08,116
Now l only need to forgive myself
for not being by her side.

98
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,880
But l did everything l could,
didn't l, lsaac?

99
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:38,277
The autopsy doesn't reveal
anything strange.

100
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:42,963
- Have you searched for fingerprints?
- We only found ours and hers.

101
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:44,879
OK, but...

102
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,924
That song...

103
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:49,362
And what about what happened
in the cemetery?

104
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:54,123
Julia, there's no evidence
of anyone being with your sister.

105
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:57,518
And nobody has seen or heard
anything suspicious.

106
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,636
You can speak with Soledad if you wish.

107
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,765
- With whom?
- An old lady who lives nearby.

108
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:09,920
Apparently, she helped your sister
when she went blind.

109
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:12,479
Don't be long.

110
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:19,796
Where does she live?

111
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,879
Follow the rope in the yard.

112
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:24,275
What rope?

113
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:38,356
l'm sure the old woman
doesn't know anything.

114
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,519
Nobody else knew apart from you.

115
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:46,317
But you have to speak with your wife.
She'll find out sooner or later.

116
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:49,846
l'll wait for the right moment.

117
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:19,883
Mrs Soledad?

118
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:27,765
Hello?

119
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:32,320
Who is it?

120
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,318
lt's Julia, Sara's sister.

121
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:36,079
l'll be right out.

122
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:45,479
Sorry about the mess.
The house must be quite disgusting.

123
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:49,885
Hello...

124
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:54,925
- Are you there?
- Yes. Sorry, l didn't know you were...

125
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:59,842
l am sorry too. l wanted to come
to your sister's funeral, but...

126
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,965
it took me an hour to find
a pair of matching shoes.

127
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:04,526
lt's OK.

128
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,440
Were you a good friend of Sara?

129
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:11,236
Well, when she started
losing her eyesight,

130
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:16,083
a year ago,
we used to have long conversations.

131
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:21,403
But lately she hardly spoke with me.

132
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,842
She had made new friends.

133
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:28,205
- What new friends?
- You know, younger people.

134
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:32,406
- From the Baumann Oentre.
- Baumann Oentre. What's that?

135
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,127
A centre for blind people,
not far from here.

136
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:41,237
One of those places where they make you
believe you can live a normal life.

137
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:45,880
lf you can't hear, you are deaf.
lf you lost an arm, you are a cripple.

138
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:48,720
And if you can't see, you are blind.

139
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,685
And nothing can ever be
how it used to be.

140
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,839
Mrs Soledad, where can l take a taxi?

141
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,565
Thank you.

142
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,556
Go straight ahead,
down the stairs and turn right.

143
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:27,875
Poor Sara.

144
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:31,244
- Why would she hang herself?
- Stop thinking about it.

145
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,080
- Shall we have a moment of silence?
- Don't be cruel.

146
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,807
None of us could stand her.

147
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:39,435
Don't you find it strange?

148
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:40,926
No.

149
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,043
We've all thought
of doing it at some time.

150
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:46,085
Dela...

151
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:49,523
Nora is right. l once thought
of slitting my wrists.

152
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,963
With candles and opera music.

153
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:55,595
Me too, l thought ofjumping
out of the window.

154
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:58,679
Well, we thought about it
but didn't do it.

155
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:01,725
There's a reason to live.

156
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,562
Maybe Sara didn't find any.

157
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:08,959
And a boyfriend doesn't seem like
a good reason?

158
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:11,239
Sara had a boyfriend?

159
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:13,318
She told me she met a boy.

160
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,398
- Who?
- No idea.

161
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,959
They had been going out together
for a couple of months.

162
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:22,244
They even went to Bellavista
together for a week.

163
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:27,246
- What's in Bellavista?
- Rooms for sex.

164
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,839
Quiet!

165
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,601
How weird! Shit!

166
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,359
What is it?

167
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:45,919
There's someone here.

168
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:49,557
- l would say it's Sara.
- That's not funny!

169
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:54,080
- l can smell her too.
- Something is moving.

170
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:58,445
- l've got her! Oall security!
- l'm Sara's sister.

171
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:00,165
Julia?

172
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,076
Yes.

173
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,126
- Why were you spying on us?
- l just didn't want to interrupt.

174
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,005
- And who is he?
- Who?

175
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,317
- The man who came with you.
- l came alone.

176
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,524
There's someone else here.

177
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:17,360
A man, and he's right behind you.

178
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:37,922
Wait!

179
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:04,879
Who are you?

180
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:07,516
Turn around.

181
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:10,324
Turn around.

182
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:11,960
l said turn around!

183
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:49,326
No, no!

184
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:10,719
lsaac?

185
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,245
lsaac?

186
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:36,599
Hotel Romeo, Bellavista.

187
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:40,644
What happened to you?

188
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:43,116
You are soaking wet.

189
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:45,960
lt started raining
when l left Soledad's house.

190
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,997
Have you been with her all this time?

191
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:53,397
She invited me for tea.
l couldn't say no.

192
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:58,561
Julia, l went to look for you.
You left her place an hour ago.

193
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,118
Where have you been?

194
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,364
Why are you so controlling?

195
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:06,121
l could also ask you
what you're looking for.

196
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:10,686
Fine.

197
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:13,439
Fine.

198
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:17,122
Now l'm certain there was
something strange in Sara's suicide.

199
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:21,758
- There's someone watching us.
- Julia, Julia, please.

200
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,121
Who?

201
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,077
Her boyfriend.

202
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,203
- Sara had a boyfriend?
- Yes.

203
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,356
Who told you?

204
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:33,802
A group of blind girls told me
at the Baumann Oentre

205
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,639
and someone was spying on us.

206
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:38,321
- How do you know?
- Because l ran after him.

207
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:41,399
- You ran after him?
- Yes, l did.

208
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,126
lsaac.

209
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:47,042
- lsaac! What are you doing?
- We're leaving this house.

210
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:50,599
Listen to me. lf l have to be
a controlling husband, l will be.

211
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,883
And if l have to drag you out of here,
l will too.

212
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:55,720
But l won't let you have a seizure.

213
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:58,640
You know l would never
forgive myself.

214
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,647
Your sister's death has hurt us enough.

215
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,085
You're right.

216
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:14,478
But l don't feel like
going back home.

217
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:18,686
Why don't we go somewhere,
you and me, alone?

218
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:30,921
Where would you like to go?

219
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:58,599
- Are you sure you want to stay there?
- The guide says it's the cosiest hotel.

220
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:09,277
Nice view, isn't it?

221
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,725
- Julia.
- Yes, yes. lt's beautiful.

222
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,240
Thank you.

223
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:17,675
Julia...

224
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,919
- l'll park the car.
- Yes, OK.

225
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:26,915
You don't remember my sister,
a blind woman?

226
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:29,601
Yes, a colleague talked to me about her.

227
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,280
This may sound weird,

228
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:34,484
but could you find out
the name of the man who was with her?

229
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:39,198
- There's no name on the receipt.
- Sorry, but l don't remember any man.

230
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:40,436
The thing is...

231
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:43,440
my sister is dead,
and l need to find this man.

232
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,440
Let me see... l don't understand.

233
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:49,041
Her booking is not registered.

234
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,607
lt's as if all the information
was deleted.

235
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:57,045
- Are you sure?
- Sorry. lt must be a computer problem.

236
00:24:57,847 --> 00:25:02,477
You could try El Arlequin. lt's the
restaurant we recommend to our guests.

237
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:04,080
Thank you.

238
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:05,236
Thank you.

239
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:13,441
Thank you.

240
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:16,917
l don't understand how they can
recommend this restaurant.

241
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:18,918
l like it.

242
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:23,761
lt's not your style at all.

243
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:30,603
And that waiter
won't stop staring at you.

244
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,405
Really?

245
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:40,887
- lt's your imagination.
- Maybe.

246
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:48,886
- My reading glasses...
- ln your coat? How weird.

247
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:53,357
l'll go and get them,
and l'll go to the toilet too.

248
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,886
lf he hits on you, just yell.

249
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,124
What a change!

250
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:15,077
l like it. lt highlights your eyes.
By the way, l knew they were green.

251
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:19,402
You're confusing me with my twin sister.
She was here last week.

252
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,444
With her boyfriend.

253
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:22,956
Her boyfriend?

254
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:25,402
She came with a man, didn't she?

255
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:28,357
Yes, l think so.

256
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:32,440
- Do you remember his name?
- No, no idea.

257
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:35,405
He was very quiet, very sad.

258
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:39,603
- Oould you describe him?
- Sure, he was...

259
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:43,164
He was very plain,
like any other man.

260
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:46,364
But was he tall, short,
blond hair, dark hair?

261
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:51,405
l can't remember right now.

262
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:54,286
How can you remember my sister
but nothing about the man?

263
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:58,440
She drew a bit of attention
with that blindfold.

264
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:01,596
Blindfold?

265
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:04,725
She was bandaged after the operation.

266
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:11,155
- Did she have an operation?
- Of course.

267
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,238
Hence the bet over her eye colour.

268
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:15,443
She said she'd come
once she'd recovered,

269
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:17,677
and if l guessed her eye colour,
l could...

270
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:20,441
- Pablo, can you come for a second?
- Yes, sure.

271
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:22,802
Excuse me.
My greetings to her.

272
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:31,922
l couldn't find them.

273
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:35,963
Let's see how l manage.

274
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:43,318
ls something wrong?

275
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:51,037
Sara was here last week.

276
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:57,887
Julia... what are we doing here?

277
00:27:58,047 --> 00:28:02,199
lsaac, the waiter told me
she had her eyes bandaged.

278
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:03,595
Do you realise?

279
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:08,756
lf she had the operation and had
a chance to regain her sight,

280
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:11,885
why would she commit suicide?

281
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:14,715
Tell me why.

282
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:24,484
Because the operation didn't work.

283
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:28,039
What?

284
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:30,639
lt didn't work.

285
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:35,284
Dr Roman told me yesterday.

286
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:44,085
l was waiting for the right moment
to tell you.

287
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:05,765
That man exists.

288
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:08,487
Julia, Julia.

289
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:11,445
- Anything else l should know?
- l was only trying to protect you.

290
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:14,326
- From what?
- From the truth.

291
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,000
What's the truth?

292
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:21,045
Sara committed suicide because
she couldn't stand being blind.

293
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,044
Julia.

294
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:33,322
Julia.

295
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,921
Did you know she came here
with her boyfriend?

296
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:40,645
That doesn't prove anything.

297
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:46,086
And why is he hiding?
Why didn't he show up at the funeral?

298
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:48,838
Maybe he wasn't with her by then.

299
00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:54,557
Maybe he left her when he found out
she'd never recover her sight.

300
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:59,243
That easy?

301
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:01,035
That easy, right?

302
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:03,516
- Well...
- l can't believe you're a psychologist.

303
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:05,678
Julia!

304
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:09,406
God!

305
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:15,046
What are you doing?

306
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:16,481
Julia, Julia.

307
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:18,319
Didn't you see the car?

308
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:26,720
You didn't see it, did you?

309
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:34,597
How many seizures have you had?

310
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:35,802
Two.

311
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,003
Shit!

312
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:40,958
Shit.

313
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,918
lf...

314
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:55,241
- lf l go blind... When l go blind...
- No, no. That won't happen.

315
00:30:56,727 --> 00:31:00,197
Not wanting it
doesn't mean it won't happen.

316
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,285
lsaac...

317
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,841
One time you told me that...

318
00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:19,602
...when you looked into my eyes,
you could see the entire universe.

319
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:25,556
- l still can.
- What if the universe shuts down?

320
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:32,836
Olose your eyes.

321
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,558
What?

322
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,683
Olose your eyes.

323
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:46,286
Oan you see me?

324
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:49,758
Of course l can't.

325
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:54,201
Then how do you know
l'm still here with you?

326
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,801
Because l can hear you.

327
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,327
What if l remain silent?

328
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:04,081
How do you know l'm still here?

329
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:20,283
l can touch you.

330
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,362
And you can smell me.

331
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:29,924
And kiss you.

332
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:55,921
Promise me that when the day comes,
we will go back to the desert.

333
00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:58,483
What?

334
00:32:58,647 --> 00:33:00,558
You know?

335
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:04,882
The last thing l'd like to see
is that sky, with you.

336
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:08,799
- Julia...
- Promise me.

337
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:11,399
Promise me.

338
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:14,683
l promise you.

339
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:18,315
But...

340
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:20,955
But you have to promise me...

341
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,325
...that you will stop chasing ghosts.

342
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,999
And that we will go and see Dr Roman.

343
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:31,639
Tomorrow.

344
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:35,125
OK.

345
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:55,480
l'll bring the luggage to the car.
l'll wait for you outside.

346
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:56,966
ln 15 minutes.

347
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,277
Ms Levin.

348
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,677
Ms Levin.

349
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:15,165
l'm really sorry for your loss.

350
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:18,764
My name is Orespulo.

351
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:22,283
l read about your sister
in the obituaries section of the newspaper.

352
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:23,926
Thank you.

353
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:26,239
l have something of hers.

354
00:34:28,087 --> 00:34:31,397
A few hours after your sister left,

355
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:36,846
l found a key in her room,
under the bed.

356
00:34:37,727 --> 00:34:40,639
l think l put it here somewhere.

357
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,039
Thank you.

358
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:04,645
Mr Orespulo.

359
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:06,718
l'm sorry.

360
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:10,563
Mr Orespulo...

361
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:13,036
My sister came here with a man,
didn't she?

362
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,516
The invisible man.

363
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,005
l beg your pardon?

364
00:35:21,927 --> 00:35:26,284
Nobody remembers the man
who came with your sister, right?

365
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,840
Well...

366
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:33,197
That doesn't mean he is invisible.

367
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:35,927
There are people with no light.

368
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:40,205
Do you know what it's like to walk in
somewhere and not be noticed?

369
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:46,282
Or to walk on the street
and have people stumble against you?

370
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:53,277
Or to ask something for the third time
and have no one answer your question?

371
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:55,836
That's the man you're looking for.

372
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:59,283
A pause, a vacuum.

373
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:02,079
An absence.

374
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,725
That's why nobody remembers him.

375
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,477
Nobody except you.

376
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:14,484
ln a way, l am also invisible.

377
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:19,636
lt's been many years since the last time
someone remembered me.

378
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:23,358
This man...

379
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:26,246
do you know where l can find him?

380
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:31,517
What are you afraid of?

381
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:37,203
He parked his van in a car park
two blocks down the street.

382
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:42,999
There's a OOTV camera
recording 24 hours a day.

383
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:46,201
Thank you.

384
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:48,039
Wait!

385
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,526
Be careful.

386
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:54,920
The man who was with your sister
had very angry eyes.

387
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,677
He knows how to be a shadow.

388
00:36:57,847 --> 00:37:02,079
lf someone feels invisible
and is angry at the world,

389
00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:04,124
he can be dangerous.

390
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:06,642
He has no light.
Nobody looks at him.

391
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:10,117
He could sneak up on you and...

392
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:36,722
- Where have you been?
- Did you see anyone?

393
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:40,436
- l've been waiting for 10 minutes.
- Wait a moment.

394
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:43,565
He's here.
And l know how to find him.

395
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:49,686
- No!
- What are you doing?

396
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:52,407
- Let me talk to the guard.
- Will you calm down?

397
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,922
- Oalm down!
- Wait here.

398
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:57,078
Don't be so rude!

399
00:37:57,247 --> 00:38:00,284
l remind you
that you made a promise last night.

400
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:01,960
- Enough.
- l can't take it any more!

401
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:04,357
- l said don't yell at me!
- l've had it!

402
00:38:04,527 --> 00:38:06,518
There's no mystery in Sara's death!

403
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:09,838
Do you want the footage?
You'll have it.

404
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:13,522
But this shit ends
right here, right now, all right?

405
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:37,120
You've reached...

406
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:02,916
Excuse me.

407
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:06,443
Has anyone been here
asking about security videos?

408
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:09,675
Look... l don't want any trouble, OK?

409
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,839
That guy came, gave me some money
and l promised to keep my mouth shut.

410
00:39:13,007 --> 00:39:15,965
He is my husband.
l've been waiting for a while.

411
00:39:16,127 --> 00:39:18,595
Do you know which way he went out?

412
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:23,683
He left as soon as my little friend
made the copies he wanted.

413
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:25,439
And...

414
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:27,484
Was there anyone else here?

415
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:29,524
- Are you sure?
- Nobody.

416
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:33,316
We can check the monitors
in case we see something.

417
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:35,804
What the hell?

418
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,516
l'll be right back.

419
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:50,004
Goddammit!

420
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:52,639
What's wrong?

421
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,005
Oalm down. lt's me.

422
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,158
Someone has switched off the power.

423
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,125
lt's impossible.

424
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,879
lt's impossible.

425
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:37,837
My husband has been kidnapped.
He's in danger.

426
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:41,556
OK, the only thing we know is that
someone stole some OOTV footage.

427
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:46,755
No, l've already told you.
lt was the man who was with my sister.

428
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:49,725
You have to find him
before it's too late.

429
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:54,756
How can we find someone
that nobody has seen, not even you?

430
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:01,036
Orespulo.

431
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:50,119
- He killed him because he was...
- No evidence of violence.

432
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:53,006
...the only who could recognise
the invisible man.

433
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,920
- He's erasing his tracks.
- What do you mean?

434
00:41:56,087 --> 00:41:58,317
My husband is in danger!

435
00:41:58,487 --> 00:42:00,796
- Oalm down, madam!
- lsaac!

436
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:03,199
Oall a doctor, quick.

437
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:06,086
We need a doctor down here.

438
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:10,996
lsaac.

439
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:28,923
The process is irreversible.

440
00:42:29,087 --> 00:42:30,759
How long do l have?

441
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:34,920
l don't know...
Perhaps a few hours, days.

442
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:37,920
Maybe a few weeks.
Definitely less than a month.

443
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:40,840
We have to find a donor
and operate as soon as possible.

444
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:42,725
Did you know Sara's boyfriend?

445
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:47,243
No, l didn't know him.

446
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:51,956
Julia, l know you're going through
a hard time,

447
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:54,960
but you have to think about yourself.

448
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:59,006
So, please,
try to avoid emotional stress.

449
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:02,443
And don't force your eyes. OK?

450
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,396
lvan. lvan.

451
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,285
A boyfriend?

452
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:35,644
Sara never told me
about any boyfriends.

453
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,275
She didn't trust men.

454
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:40,438
Unlike me.

455
00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:43,280
- Or you.
- lsaac hasn't left me, l'm sure.

456
00:43:44,127 --> 00:43:46,277
That's what all women think.

457
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:50,517
l also came up with a story
when my husband left me.

458
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:54,478
He couldn't stand my son Angel.

459
00:43:54,647 --> 00:43:57,923
And my son was more important
than anything else.

460
00:43:58,647 --> 00:44:03,277
Then my eyes started to degenerate
and l went blind.

461
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:06,759
Luckily, Angel looked after me
for 10 years,

462
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:10,636
until l woke up one morning...

463
00:44:10,807 --> 00:44:12,718
and he was gone.

464
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:14,878
My son was gone.

465
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:19,482
What kind of son abandons
a blind mother?

466
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:22,722
l had to come up with a story.

467
00:44:22,887 --> 00:44:25,447
And l still keep to it.

468
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:29,484
Such humiliation!
l'm sorry.

469
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:40,122
Hello?

470
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:43,484
The hotel is fully automated.
There are no staff.

471
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,241
Guests check in through a machine.

472
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:49,763
They called from the bank this morning
to inform me about a transaction

473
00:44:49,927 --> 00:44:51,997
with your husband's credit card.

474
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:56,763
l searched the room
and found this on the bedside table.

475
00:44:57,647 --> 00:45:00,957
Julia, there's things about your husband
you don't know.

476
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:06,200
- He kept Sara's surgery from you.
- To protect me. The doctor told me...

477
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:09,962
The doctor didn't talk to anybody
about the surgery.

478
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:13,919
How did your husband know?

479
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:19,923
lnspector, a patrol just drove by
Sara's house and saw light inside.

480
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:27,164
lsaac?

481
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:31,081
Wait here. Don't move.

482
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:03,520
lsaac?

483
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:24,600
Hello?

484
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:28,679
lsaac?

485
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:35,362
lsaac?

486
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:48,326
Julia!

487
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:52,240
Shit! l have to get out of here.

488
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:55,285
Where is it? Stay calm.

489
00:46:56,007 --> 00:46:59,204
Where is the door? Stay calm.

490
00:47:00,447 --> 00:47:02,961
Julia? Julia?

491
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:09,882
lnspector! There's somebody
down here. lnspector!

492
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:15,285
Julia, calm down. lt's me.

493
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:20,596
There's somebody here.

494
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:24,005
There's somebody here.

495
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,883
What's wrong?

496
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:37,446
What's wrong?

497
00:47:39,047 --> 00:47:42,039
Turn on the torch.
l hate darkness.

498
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:46,646
Please, say something.
Why aren't you saying anything?

499
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:03,645
Thank you.

500
00:48:06,727 --> 00:48:08,126
Hi.

501
00:48:12,007 --> 00:48:14,760
There's something
you should know, Julia.

502
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:18,046
Your husband left a letter.

503
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:22,884
We checked the handwriting
and there is no doubt it's his.

504
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:25,565
Listen...

505
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:30,276
Sara and lsaac
had been lovers for six months.

506
00:48:30,847 --> 00:48:33,600
He apologises in the letter.

507
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:39,800
That explains the numerous calls to her
we found on his mobile phone.

508
00:48:41,847 --> 00:48:44,725
Did you know
they were in touch lately?

509
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:56,399
Think, Julia.

510
00:48:56,567 --> 00:49:00,480
Did lsaac insist on getting the video?

511
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:04,959
Probably because he didn't want you
to see him on it.

512
00:49:06,127 --> 00:49:11,679
Then he went back to the motel and
decided he couldn't live without Sara.

513
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:17,757
l'm sorry, but everything makes sense.

514
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:34,001
We found a donor.
We can operate tomorrow.

515
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,397
You just have to sign here.

516
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:44,719
Thank you.

517
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:06,637
Oalm down, Julia!

518
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:10,961
Oalm down. Sleep a bit more.

519
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:17,237
OK, Julia... Everything went well.

520
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:20,636
But we have to be careful now.

521
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:24,880
You eyes must be protected
from the light for two weeks.

522
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:27,522
And don't manipulate
the bandages yourself.

523
00:50:27,687 --> 00:50:31,600
lf you remove them too soon,
there won't be a solution.

524
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:35,157
But don't worry,
you will be taken care of.

525
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,000
No.

526
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:40,000
l'd rather go home.
l hate hospitals.

527
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,806
l know,
but l'm afraid that's impossible.

528
00:50:42,967 --> 00:50:47,643
- You need supervision.
- l could... go to my sister's house.

529
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:50,367
l know my way around it very well.

530
00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:55,000
Julia, honestly,
l don't think it's a good idea.

531
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:58,842
Right, but if l can't see, l can't feel.

532
00:51:01,487 --> 00:51:05,685
All right, let's do this.
You can go to your sister's house.

533
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:09,840
But a care worker will visit you
every day, OK?

534
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:18,443
Julia, there's something else.

535
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:23,477
Your husband's body is still here.
l can take care of it if you want.

536
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,399
No.

537
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,925
l'd rather do it myself.

538
00:51:30,727 --> 00:51:34,083
Oould you keep the body
until l can see again?

539
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:36,966
l need to say goodbye to him.

540
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:49,596
Let's sit on the sofa. Slowly.

541
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:51,598
Keep walking...

542
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:54,640
- Here are your things.
- Thank you.

543
00:51:56,007 --> 00:51:59,158
- Oareful. Don't worry.
- No problem.

544
00:52:03,007 --> 00:52:05,840
Shall we wait here
until the care worker arrives?

545
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:08,680
- Oan you do me a favour?
- Sure. What is it?

546
00:52:08,847 --> 00:52:11,236
l'd like to know what this key opens.

547
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:24,886
Whatever it is this key opens,
it's not here.

548
00:52:25,047 --> 00:52:28,119
- Did you try every lock?
- l did.

549
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,562
Do you need anything else?

550
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:32,365
No, thank you.

551
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:35,041
- You can go.
- All right.

552
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,804
- Hello?
- Hi.

553
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:47,084
You must be Julia.
l'm lvan, the care worker.

554
00:53:47,247 --> 00:53:51,035
Sorry l'm late. The traffic was bad.
l phoned you, but it got cut off.

555
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:56,601
l would have preferred a woman.

556
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:01,481
lf you want to call Dr Roman...
What happened to your hand?

557
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:09,843
lt's just a scratch. You won't
feel anything tomorrow morning.

558
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:14,999
l will make you dinner
and clean up a bit. You stay here.

559
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:17,526
By the way...

560
00:54:18,927 --> 00:54:21,805
What should l do with the glasses?

561
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,480
Throw them out.

562
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:30,926
While you ate,
l familiarised myself with the house.

563
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:33,286
Julia.

564
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,006
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. l have to go.

565
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:40,885
What time is it?

566
00:54:41,047 --> 00:54:43,038
lt's nine o'clock.

567
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:45,516
On the first days,
we lose track of time.

568
00:54:46,727 --> 00:54:50,083
l'll give you a couple
of sleeping pills, just in case.

569
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:53,000
And also a pager.

570
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:56,796
lf you want to contact me,
press this button. Give me your hand.

571
00:54:57,207 --> 00:54:59,926
Look, here's the button.

572
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:09,322
Let's go.

573
00:55:09,487 --> 00:55:12,126
- What are you doing?
- l have to put you to bed.

574
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:16,396
- Sorry, but l can do it myself.
- Are you sure?

575
00:55:25,047 --> 00:55:26,719
Are you OK?

576
00:55:27,727 --> 00:55:30,036
OK, you win.

577
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:32,243
Put me to bed and then you can go.

578
00:55:57,367 --> 00:55:58,925
Who's there?

579
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:06,324
Oalm down.
Oalm down, darling.

580
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:08,880
lt's me.

581
00:56:09,047 --> 00:56:10,765
lsaac?

582
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:13,716
lsaac?

583
00:56:14,727 --> 00:56:16,877
How can this be?

584
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:24,601
Don't say anything.

585
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:27,565
Thank you.

586
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:33,955
- What are you doing?
- Taking this dirty bandage off.

587
00:56:34,567 --> 00:56:37,479
- So you can see me better.
- No!

588
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:41,159
That's it, that's it.

589
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:45,123
Leave me alone.
Get off me! Get off me!

590
00:56:45,847 --> 00:56:51,126
Don't resist, little sister.
We're two against one.

591
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:57,359
Don't move.

592
00:56:57,527 --> 00:56:59,438
No, stop!

593
00:57:01,647 --> 00:57:02,875
Get off me!

594
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:39,965
lvan. lvan.

595
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:42,243
JuIia, is everything OK?

596
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:45,922
- l think there's someone in the house.
- What?

597
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,237
ln the room next door.

598
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:52,435
- Don't move. I'II caII the poIice.
- No, lvan, lvan.

599
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:07,923
Are you stiII there?

600
00:58:10,007 --> 00:58:12,805
You have to get me out of here
right now.

601
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:16,164
- Where are you?
- ln the guest room.

602
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:18,966
That's good.
Find the door and get out of the room.

603
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:23,235
Find the door to your right.

604
00:58:25,247 --> 00:58:26,760
- He's there.
- CaIm down.

605
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:29,646
The handraiI is in front of you.
Look for it.

606
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:31,240
OK, yes.

607
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,602
HoId onto the handraiI.

608
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:36,645
Go down the six steps
to the first Ianding.

609
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:42,762
Then there's nine more.

610
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:46,606
JuIia...

611
00:58:47,687 --> 00:58:52,636
- l'm downstairs. What now?
- FoIIow the waII to the door.

612
00:58:59,647 --> 00:59:01,478
Who are you?
Who are you?

613
00:59:01,647 --> 00:59:03,365
- What's going on?
- l don't know.

614
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:06,087
Get out of the houseI QuickI

615
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:25,243
There is no indication
that someone entered the house.

616
00:59:25,407 --> 00:59:28,956
There was someone there.
And he was looking for something.

617
00:59:29,127 --> 00:59:32,437
Sorry, but there's nothing else
l can do.

618
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,317
- Do you want me to call the hospital?
- Why?

619
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:42,082
Maybe you shouldn't recover here,
considering what you've been through.

620
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:43,999
You don't believe me either.

621
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:49,400
l'm just saying that in your situation,
it's normal if your senses deceive you.

622
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:52,639
Don't open your eyes now.

623
00:59:54,447 --> 00:59:56,403
You can let go now.

624
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,679
What's the matter?

625
01:00:01,487 --> 01:00:03,398
My eyes could get damaged, right?

626
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:08,163
No, l only want to change the bandage,
and l took precautions.

627
01:00:08,327 --> 01:00:11,285
l've done this a hundred times.
Don't worry.

628
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,160
You know, when l was 20 years old,

629
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:21,285
l had a car accident
and l was blind for two months.

630
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:28,964
And like you now,
l imagined things and had nightmares.

631
01:00:29,127 --> 01:00:31,482
And l rejected the care worker's help.

632
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:36,601
l couldn't stand the idea
of going blind.

633
01:00:42,607 --> 01:00:44,962
ln the end, l recovered my sight.

634
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,241
But during those months...

635
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,598
...l understood what it was like
to live in the dark.

636
01:00:58,327 --> 01:01:00,761
That's why l became a care worker.

637
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:04,202
You made that up
to make me feel better.

638
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:07,757
No, no. Oall the hospital
if you don't believe me.

639
01:01:08,287 --> 01:01:13,680
Julia, l know you're scared,
but the only way to lose that fear

640
01:01:13,847 --> 01:01:15,644
is to fight it.

641
01:01:22,087 --> 01:01:23,918
What do you say?

642
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:28,118
Will you let me help you?

643
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:38,919
- What happened?
- You spilled it.

644
01:01:39,087 --> 01:01:42,636
Try to get to the door.
Follow the wall with your hand...

645
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:48,163
And after the glass cabinet...

646
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:14,243
Well, l have my ups and downs.

647
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:16,557
But l slept very well
the last few nights.

648
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:19,844
lvan has been
very patient with me all week.

649
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:21,963
Yes, he takes good care of me.

650
01:02:22,127 --> 01:02:25,119
l will. l will, yes.

651
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:27,278
Thanks a lot for calling. Bye.

652
01:02:29,007 --> 01:02:32,443
- Are you leaving?
- Yes. lt's a little late.

653
01:02:32,607 --> 01:02:34,563
Why don't stay a bit longer?

654
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:37,720
A little while.

655
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,082
- Are you still afraid?
- No.

656
01:02:40,247 --> 01:02:41,919
No, it's not that.

657
01:02:42,767 --> 01:02:44,439
Never mind.

658
01:02:46,607 --> 01:02:48,837
OK, should l make
a special dinner for two?

659
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:53,843
- Go and watch TV. l'll cook.
- That's a little difficult.

660
01:03:15,567 --> 01:03:17,523
Aren't you drinking too much?

661
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,163
l'm celebrating.

662
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:21,760
What?

663
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:25,442
That in four days,

664
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:28,724
l will have the bandages removed
and l will see again.

665
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,323
Everything will be all right, Julia.

666
01:03:33,607 --> 01:03:35,598
You know,

667
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:39,760
if the operation doesn't work,
l couldn't complain.

668
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:43,365
l have seen everything l wanted to see.

669
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:47,998
What's the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

670
01:03:49,327 --> 01:03:50,965
Funny!

671
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,482
How ironic that you ask me that.

672
01:03:53,647 --> 01:03:55,239
Why?

673
01:03:57,047 --> 01:04:01,484
Because l spent my whole life
looking for invisible planets.

674
01:04:01,647 --> 01:04:04,719
My eyes have seen amazing things.

675
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:11,198
But nothing can compare
to the sky in the Sahara.

676
01:04:13,847 --> 01:04:16,486
That's where l met lsaac.

677
01:04:16,647 --> 01:04:21,675
We were on the same excursion
and we spent the whole night...

678
01:04:22,727 --> 01:04:25,195
...staring at the sky.

679
01:04:26,127 --> 01:04:30,359
l asked him, ''ls that not the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen?''

680
01:04:31,087 --> 01:04:33,396
And he said, ''Yes.''

681
01:04:38,927 --> 01:04:41,122
When l turned my head,

682
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:45,678
l realised that he'd been watching me
for a while and l got nervous.

683
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:48,678
And l asked him...

684
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:54,079
...''Why aren't you watching
the universe?''

685
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:59,642
And he said,
''l don't have to look up to do it.''

686
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,124
''l can see the universe in your eyes.''

687
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:08,078
And what happened?

688
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:12,598
l came close.

689
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:15,365
l touched him.

690
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,484
And l realised that he was nervous too.

691
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:24,046
ln that moment it was as if
we became one person.

692
01:05:24,207 --> 01:05:26,960
And l wanted to know
if he felt the same.

693
01:05:27,287 --> 01:05:29,323
What did he say?

694
01:05:30,287 --> 01:05:31,879
Nothing.

695
01:05:33,487 --> 01:05:35,921
He replied with his gaze.

696
01:05:36,087 --> 01:05:37,645
Why?

697
01:05:37,807 --> 01:05:41,322
Why did he look at me that way? Why?

698
01:05:42,727 --> 01:05:46,561
- Do you prefer l hadn't done it?
- l don't know.

699
01:05:47,287 --> 01:05:52,486
When you had the affair with Sara,
l thought it was just an indiscretion,

700
01:05:52,647 --> 01:05:55,798
but l swear l don't know
what to think any more.

701
01:05:56,687 --> 01:05:58,757
l don't know what to think.

702
01:06:02,007 --> 01:06:04,601
Everything will be all right, Julia.

703
01:06:06,687 --> 01:06:08,439
You promise?

704
01:06:10,087 --> 01:06:11,998
l promise.

705
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:31,000
No, l can't.

706
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:33,158
l can't do it.

707
01:06:33,687 --> 01:06:35,678
lt's not right.

708
01:06:41,647 --> 01:06:43,558
- lvan.
- Don't say anything.

709
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:47,003
- l'm sorry.
- Don't be. Don't say anything.

710
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,442
l'll call the hospital
and ask to be replaced.

711
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:51,279
ls that what you want?

712
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:54,565
And you?

713
01:07:02,007 --> 01:07:05,044
OK, l'll come back tomorrow and...

714
01:07:05,887 --> 01:07:08,720
lf not, just contact me on my pager.

715
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:37,882
Help! Help!

716
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:41,566
Help!

717
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:47,200
Oalm down!
l'm Blasco, the neighbour! Lia's father!

718
01:08:47,367 --> 01:08:49,722
Oall the police, please!

719
01:08:50,767 --> 01:08:53,327
Oalm down!
You need a drink.

720
01:08:53,487 --> 01:08:57,002
No, no.
Oall the police, please.

721
01:08:57,167 --> 01:09:01,046
Why do you want to call the police?
To tell another one of your nightmares?

722
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:05,166
- The last time they didn't believe you.
- No. There was someone by my bed.

723
01:09:05,327 --> 01:09:07,079
l swear, this time it's true.

724
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:09,886
And what did he want?
To rape you?

725
01:09:11,327 --> 01:09:13,397
lt's my daughter.
Don't be afraid.

726
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,637
l told you not to sneak up on people!

727
01:09:15,807 --> 01:09:17,763
Go back to your bed!

728
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:20,522
And close the door!

729
01:09:20,687 --> 01:09:22,723
Mr Blasco...

730
01:09:23,807 --> 01:09:25,923
Oan you call now, please?

731
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:32,523
Of course, of course.
Don't worry.

732
01:09:34,647 --> 01:09:37,445
How strange.
There's no line.

733
01:09:39,887 --> 01:09:41,764
Oalm down.

734
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:43,963
l'll get the mobile phone.

735
01:10:18,767 --> 01:10:23,841
The mobile is out of battery.
lt will take a few minutes to charge.

736
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:29,840
Sit down, sit down.

737
01:10:30,247 --> 01:10:32,124
Sit down.

738
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:34,116
What do you say?

739
01:10:34,287 --> 01:10:39,884
Do you want something to drink
while we wait?

740
01:10:40,607 --> 01:10:43,804
- What do you say?
- Oould l have a glass of water?

741
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:48,722
- Water?
- Yes, my throat is a bit dry.

742
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:08,284
Julia, where are you going?

743
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,646
Hey!

744
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:12,880
Hey!

745
01:11:13,327 --> 01:11:16,603
Madam!
Where are you, madam?

746
01:11:16,847 --> 01:11:18,519
Madam!

747
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,241
Please, pick up.

748
01:11:23,007 --> 01:11:24,599
lvan.

749
01:11:24,887 --> 01:11:26,605
Pick up, please.

750
01:11:26,767 --> 01:11:27,756
JuIia, what's wrong?

751
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,480
- Julia!
- lvan!

752
01:11:42,647 --> 01:11:45,878
- Let's go to your house.
- Not my house.

753
01:11:46,047 --> 01:11:48,277
- Julia, calm down.
- No, my house is not safe.

754
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:51,007
Please. Take me to your place.

755
01:11:52,687 --> 01:11:54,279
OK.

756
01:11:54,447 --> 01:11:57,564
OK, thanks. Bye.

757
01:11:59,727 --> 01:12:01,479
What did they say?

758
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:05,525
lnspector Dimas
won't be on duty until seven.

759
01:12:06,647 --> 01:12:11,004
You should get some rest
and l'll go with you tomorrow morning.

760
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:14,955
Julia, l won't let anyone hurt you.

761
01:12:16,647 --> 01:12:18,000
You can sleep in my bed.

762
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,840
- And you?
- l have a mattress. l'll be right back.

763
01:12:21,007 --> 01:12:25,080
- No, no.
- l'll be right back. You're safe here.

764
01:12:25,247 --> 01:12:26,919
l'll be back in a minute.

765
01:12:42,127 --> 01:12:43,640
lvan?

766
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:24,485
- Who are you?
- l'm Lia.

767
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:26,160
- Who are you?
- Lia Blasco.

768
01:13:26,327 --> 01:13:28,124
Don't get close.
How did you find me?

769
01:13:28,287 --> 01:13:31,438
- l followed you. l was Sara's friend.
- l said don't come close.

770
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:35,236
Listen, my father
has nothing to do with all this.

771
01:13:35,407 --> 01:13:39,116
- Your father lied to me.
- My father is lonely, and you're hot.

772
01:13:39,287 --> 01:13:40,481
l don't believe you.

773
01:13:40,647 --> 01:13:44,083
l was the one who took the key
and have been spying on you.

774
01:13:44,247 --> 01:13:46,044
- You?
- Do you have nightmares?

775
01:13:46,207 --> 01:13:48,880
- What?
- Sara also had them.

776
01:13:49,047 --> 01:13:53,484
She dreamt of someone taking the bandage
off and piercing her eyes with needles.

777
01:13:53,647 --> 01:13:55,046
There's a monster on the street,

778
01:13:55,207 --> 01:13:57,675
but no one can see him
because he hides in the darkness.

779
01:13:57,847 --> 01:13:59,963
He made Sara go blind
and will do the same with you.

780
01:14:00,127 --> 01:14:01,606
- Stop!
- lt's him.

781
01:14:01,767 --> 01:14:05,282
l followed him and tried the key.
And today l saw the needles again.

782
01:14:05,447 --> 01:14:08,484
- lt's him, Julia. lt's the care worker.
- No.

783
01:14:09,927 --> 01:14:12,202
Listen to me!

784
01:14:13,567 --> 01:14:16,604
Do you really think lsaac
killed himself? He loved you.

785
01:14:16,767 --> 01:14:20,965
- He loved Sara more.
- They didn't want to worry you.

786
01:14:21,127 --> 01:14:23,641
That's why they kept you in the dark.
Sara told me.

787
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:26,196
lsaac wrote a suicide note.
Leave me alone.

788
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:30,155
- The monster forced him to write it.
- Monsters don't exist. Enough!

789
01:14:30,327 --> 01:14:32,045
This one does.

790
01:14:33,607 --> 01:14:35,677
He collects pictures.

791
01:14:36,087 --> 01:14:40,080
His wall is covered
with pictures of you and Sara.

792
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:44,237
- He removed your eyes.
- Lia, that's enough!

793
01:14:44,407 --> 01:14:45,726
Leave me alone!

794
01:14:47,967 --> 01:14:49,480
What are you doing?

795
01:14:52,207 --> 01:14:54,482
Use the key if you don't believe me.

796
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:58,522
The key. Where's the key?

797
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,757
- He took it.
- No, you took it.

798
01:15:00,927 --> 01:15:04,556
- Why me?
- l don't know. To protect your father.

799
01:15:04,727 --> 01:15:08,117
- lt's him. Don't tell him l'm here.
- Lia. Lia.

800
01:15:11,927 --> 01:15:13,076
lvan?

801
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:15,761
Julia, what are you doing?

802
01:15:15,927 --> 01:15:18,122
l'm really nervous.

803
01:15:19,127 --> 01:15:21,482
l'll make you a cup of tea.

804
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:23,365
lt will help you relax.

805
01:15:24,127 --> 01:15:26,561
- lvan...
- Yes?

806
01:15:27,567 --> 01:15:32,083
l can't find the key. lt's the only
evidence to incriminate Blasco.

807
01:15:32,727 --> 01:15:34,877
Did you take it?

808
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,840
- You must have dropped it.
- Please, give it to me.

809
01:15:50,007 --> 01:15:52,123
l'll keep it for you.
You are very nervous.

810
01:15:52,287 --> 01:15:55,723
l'll make you a cup of tea.
You sit down and relax.

811
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:06,806
He's lying. He had the key.

812
01:16:06,967 --> 01:16:09,356
- We have to get out of here.
- l don't want to.

813
01:16:09,527 --> 01:16:12,963
- You don't believe me now?
- lt's impossible. He is a care worker.

814
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,126
Shit! lt's locked.

815
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:21,199
- Julia!
- Yes?

816
01:16:22,287 --> 01:16:24,881
- Do you want sugar?
- Two teaspoons, thanks.

817
01:16:28,887 --> 01:16:30,878
He wants to drug you and make you blind.

818
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:32,116
What are you saying?

819
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:34,517
- Oan you take this off?
- No. Why?

820
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:39,044
Then we can't get out of the window.
l need to get the key.

821
01:16:39,207 --> 01:16:42,279
Get rid of him
and wait for me in the bathroom.

822
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:46,558
Here you go.

823
01:16:47,367 --> 01:16:50,882
l'll take you to bed
and wait until you fall asleep.

824
01:16:56,087 --> 01:16:58,203
l need to go to the bathroom.

825
01:16:59,727 --> 01:17:01,206
OK.

826
01:17:05,247 --> 01:17:06,475
Thank you.

827
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:45,842
- Julia, is everything all right?
- Yes. What was that noise?

828
01:17:46,007 --> 01:17:47,998
l don't know. l heard it too.

829
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:50,476
l thought something had happened to you.

830
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:54,481
- Hurry up, or your tea will get cold.
- l'll be right out.

831
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:02,118
Lia, please.

832
01:18:04,527 --> 01:18:06,882
Four days left. Only four days.

833
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:11,322
Four days, four days.

834
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,840
Julia, l have to go down again.
Are you OK?

835
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:30,441
Yes, l'll be right out.

836
01:19:47,727 --> 01:19:49,365
Lia.

837
01:19:50,767 --> 01:19:51,882
Lia.

838
01:20:22,847 --> 01:20:24,917
What are you doing here?

839
01:20:27,927 --> 01:20:29,963
Why are you crying?

840
01:20:32,487 --> 01:20:34,478
Please, answer me.

841
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:39,961
A girl called Lia came to see me.

842
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:42,277
Blasco's daughter.

843
01:20:42,447 --> 01:20:44,438
And she made me very nervous.

844
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:48,395
- Why did you take the bandage off?
- l couldn't see anything.

845
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:52,924
She told me horrible things about you
and l was afraid.

846
01:20:53,367 --> 01:20:55,119
About me?

847
01:20:56,007 --> 01:20:58,646
You would never hurt me, would you?

848
01:20:59,847 --> 01:21:01,280
No.

849
01:21:01,847 --> 01:21:03,678
l had to...

850
01:21:03,847 --> 01:21:06,919
l had to see your face to know it.

851
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:10,403
And what did you see?

852
01:21:15,847 --> 01:21:18,884
Nothing. l can't see anything.

853
01:21:42,727 --> 01:21:44,445
Are you sure you can't see anything?

854
01:21:53,607 --> 01:21:55,837
Sometimes the eyes
take time to adjust.

855
01:22:08,767 --> 01:22:11,235
The operation didn't work.

856
01:22:18,487 --> 01:22:20,796
l'm really sorry, Julia.

857
01:22:24,767 --> 01:22:28,282
Probably the girl lied to you
in order to protect her father.

858
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:34,076
Tomorrow... we'll speak with
the inspector and all this will be over.

859
01:22:34,247 --> 01:22:37,125
No. No.

860
01:22:37,887 --> 01:22:40,276
No, please.
Take me to the hospital now.

861
01:22:40,447 --> 01:22:43,883
- Now, please.
- We'll call Dr Roman.

862
01:22:44,407 --> 01:22:47,877
- Now.
- Julia, listen to me.

863
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,679
Dr Roman?

864
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:55,635
lt's lvan. Sorry to wake you
at this time of night.

865
01:22:55,807 --> 01:22:58,401
l have a problem with Julia Levin.

866
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:03,079
She took the bandage off by accident.

867
01:23:10,927 --> 01:23:15,921
l understand. l will tell her right now.
Thanks, and sorry to bother you.

868
01:23:17,287 --> 01:23:18,276
What did he say?

869
01:23:18,447 --> 01:23:21,245
He's at a conference.
We can't do anything until next week.

870
01:23:21,407 --> 01:23:25,446
- Then take me to a different hospital.
- No. Roman said you have to rest.

871
01:23:25,607 --> 01:23:30,806
- l need a second opinion.
- Julia, the damage is done.

872
01:23:30,967 --> 01:23:33,845
But if you don't do as l say,
it will be irreversible.

873
01:23:41,927 --> 01:23:43,201
OK.

874
01:24:14,607 --> 01:24:16,245
Why did you get up?

875
01:24:16,407 --> 01:24:21,083
- The kettle was whistling.
- l'll do it. You sit down.

876
01:24:21,847 --> 01:24:23,405
Be careful.

877
01:24:25,967 --> 01:24:27,525
Very good.

878
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:39,520
This is nearly ready.

879
01:24:55,327 --> 01:24:57,124
Here you are.

880
01:24:57,887 --> 01:24:59,400
Thank you.

881
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:16,880
What's the matter?

882
01:25:22,047 --> 01:25:23,799
Why are you doing all this, lvan?

883
01:25:30,527 --> 01:25:32,119
What do you mean?

884
01:25:32,287 --> 01:25:34,596
Why all this attention?

885
01:25:37,807 --> 01:25:39,604
What do you want from me?

886
01:25:41,447 --> 01:25:43,483
Well, Julia...

887
01:25:47,247 --> 01:25:49,078
When...

888
01:25:49,887 --> 01:25:51,320
When you kissed me...

889
01:25:54,207 --> 01:25:56,801
l didn't expect it.

890
01:25:56,967 --> 01:26:01,563
l didn't expect it, but don't think
l don't like you because...

891
01:26:01,727 --> 01:26:02,955
because that's not true.

892
01:26:05,807 --> 01:26:09,516
l only wanted to give you some time.
You've suffered a lot.

893
01:26:09,687 --> 01:26:13,396
And some wounds need to heal.

894
01:26:15,287 --> 01:26:17,676
What l'm trying to say is...

895
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:21,198
...l want to be with you.

896
01:26:26,607 --> 01:26:28,404
Drink your tea.

897
01:26:44,847 --> 01:26:46,599
Did you put sugar in it?

898
01:26:50,727 --> 01:26:52,683
l'll bring some.

899
01:27:19,327 --> 01:27:20,919
Two teaspoons, right?

900
01:27:22,087 --> 01:27:23,566
As usual.

901
01:27:30,647 --> 01:27:31,636
Done?

902
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:47,798
Oan you come with me, please?

903
01:27:51,087 --> 01:27:54,363
- Why?
- l need your help with the freezer.

904
01:27:55,287 --> 01:27:58,757
Oome. Let's go. Leave this here.

905
01:28:23,607 --> 01:28:25,325
Open the freezer.

906
01:28:25,487 --> 01:28:27,000
Why?

907
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:29,158
Just do it.

908
01:28:31,247 --> 01:28:33,761
Open the freezer, l said.

909
01:29:02,927 --> 01:29:04,519
Liar.

910
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,638
Are you afraid?

911
01:29:37,487 --> 01:29:41,605
You don't know what fear is!

912
01:29:43,807 --> 01:29:47,686
You have no idea what fear is!

913
01:29:47,847 --> 01:29:49,075
Real fear.

914
01:29:49,247 --> 01:29:51,442
Fear of being ignored and rejected.

915
01:29:51,607 --> 01:29:54,440
Look at me. Look at me!

916
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:57,963
You don't know what it's like to live
in the dark and hide in another world.

917
01:29:58,127 --> 01:30:03,918
A world full of silence,
getting used to measuring your steps.

918
01:30:04,647 --> 01:30:07,605
Always wearing
the appropriate clothes.

919
01:30:07,767 --> 01:30:10,839
Making your voice one voice and none.

920
01:30:11,007 --> 01:30:14,602
And your eyes, two eyes and none.

921
01:30:14,767 --> 01:30:18,646
lt takes so long that eventually
you become a shadow.

922
01:30:18,807 --> 01:30:22,959
But one day you find out that
blind girls realise that you're there,

923
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:27,006
that you're breathing,
that you are still alive.

924
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:32,480
That you can offer them your eyes
for theirs, your hands for theirs...

925
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,805
That's why our relationship
is so perfect.

926
01:30:36,687 --> 01:30:37,676
That's why...

927
01:30:38,847 --> 01:30:40,883
...we have to continue this way.

928
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:48,601
lf you are not lvan, who are you?

929
01:30:49,407 --> 01:30:51,318
Where are you taking me?

930
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:54,795
My eyes hurt.
Something is wrong.

931
01:30:55,407 --> 01:30:58,001
Take the bandage off, please.

932
01:30:58,767 --> 01:31:00,485
Please.

933
01:31:01,407 --> 01:31:03,204
Please, take it off.

934
01:31:03,367 --> 01:31:06,518
Please, my eyes hurt.
Take the bandage off.

935
01:31:06,687 --> 01:31:08,484
Shut up!

936
01:31:10,727 --> 01:31:12,479
l beg you.

937
01:31:26,767 --> 01:31:28,120
Let me see.

938
01:31:29,327 --> 01:31:31,363
Let me see.

939
01:31:34,767 --> 01:31:37,600
lt's started again, right?

940
01:31:43,647 --> 01:31:45,558
This time...

941
01:31:46,327 --> 01:31:48,636
...it will be more intense.

942
01:32:02,847 --> 01:32:05,759
Get out of the car.
You have to pack your bags.

943
01:32:07,807 --> 01:32:09,126
Open the door, Julia.

944
01:32:13,927 --> 01:32:17,715
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!

945
01:32:18,527 --> 01:32:20,722
Open the fucking door!

946
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:22,680
Julia!

947
01:32:22,847 --> 01:32:24,405
Julia!

948
01:32:24,567 --> 01:32:26,239
Julia!

949
01:32:30,007 --> 01:32:31,804
Julia!

950
01:33:46,447 --> 01:33:48,517
Who's there?

951
01:33:48,687 --> 01:33:50,882
ls the main door locked?

952
01:33:51,047 --> 01:33:53,959
- ls that you, Julia? You scared me.
- ls it locked?

953
01:33:54,127 --> 01:33:56,721
Yes, of course.
What's wrong?

954
01:33:56,887 --> 01:33:59,447
- There's a murderer in the area.
- A murderer?

955
01:33:59,607 --> 01:34:01,757
We have to call the police.
Where's the phone?

956
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:06,079
There, in the corner.
Under the painting.

957
01:34:06,247 --> 01:34:08,124
Don't move.

958
01:34:08,287 --> 01:34:10,039
Be quiet.

959
01:34:10,527 --> 01:34:12,245
- What's wrong?
- Don't move.

960
01:34:18,967 --> 01:34:21,765
- lt's him. He's here.
- Who?

961
01:34:22,447 --> 01:34:24,802
Don't come any closer,
you son of a bitch.

962
01:34:24,967 --> 01:34:28,562
- Who are you talking to?
- To a man who thinks he's invisible.

963
01:34:28,727 --> 01:34:31,719
He made Sara go blind
and he wants to do the same to me.

964
01:34:32,207 --> 01:34:35,324
- You're scaring me.
- Stay away.

965
01:34:35,487 --> 01:34:37,398
Soledad, call the police.

966
01:34:37,567 --> 01:34:40,320
- Oall the police, quick!
- Don't do it, Mum.

967
01:34:41,807 --> 01:34:43,445
Angel...

968
01:34:44,127 --> 01:34:45,879
ls that you, son?

969
01:34:48,927 --> 01:34:50,406
Yes.

970
01:34:50,567 --> 01:34:52,125
l'm back home.

971
01:34:52,807 --> 01:34:55,446
This woman says you're chasing her.

972
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,438
This woman is crazy.

973
01:34:59,607 --> 01:35:02,644
- Your son is a murderer.
- Shut up. Don't listen to her, Mum.

974
01:35:02,807 --> 01:35:04,525
- He killed my husband.
- She's lying.

975
01:35:04,687 --> 01:35:07,281
- He killed my husband and Sara too.
- Shut up.

976
01:35:07,447 --> 01:35:11,122
- lt must have been easy to hang her.
- l loved Sara.

977
01:35:11,887 --> 01:35:14,799
She killed herself because she wasn't
capable of living in darkness.

978
01:35:14,967 --> 01:35:16,685
Oapable?

979
01:35:16,847 --> 01:35:20,681
No one is capable of getting used to it.
You made her go blind.

980
01:35:20,847 --> 01:35:21,916
You killed her.

981
01:35:22,087 --> 01:35:26,285
- ls that true, son?
- Mum, mum. You know me.

982
01:35:26,447 --> 01:35:29,166
l said don't move.

983
01:35:29,327 --> 01:35:32,444
Make the call. Make it.

984
01:35:58,007 --> 01:36:00,316
l knew you'd come back.

985
01:36:01,767 --> 01:36:05,760
l knew you'd realise
that you can only be happy here.

986
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:09,319
l told you that without me,
you'd be nothing.

987
01:36:09,487 --> 01:36:11,682
Less than nothing.

988
01:36:11,847 --> 01:36:13,838
lnvisible.

989
01:36:21,127 --> 01:36:22,799
Since when can you see, Mum?

990
01:36:22,967 --> 01:36:27,836
But you're still my son, and l won't let
anybody take you away from me.

991
01:36:28,007 --> 01:36:30,805
Mum, l asked you a question.

992
01:36:32,087 --> 01:36:35,602
Since when can you see?

993
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:39,237
Angel, what are you doing, son?

994
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:43,122
What are you doing, son? No, no.

995
01:36:43,647 --> 01:36:45,842
No, no.

996
01:36:47,047 --> 01:36:48,275
Oalm down, Mum.

997
01:36:52,287 --> 01:36:54,243
- lt's me.
- Mum, calm down.

998
01:36:55,127 --> 01:37:01,123
Look, Mum, this liquid attacks the optic
nerve without causing any pain.

999
01:37:01,287 --> 01:37:05,997
Don't worry.
And these needles are very useful too.

1000
01:37:06,167 --> 01:37:10,080
- Don't do it, please.
- Mum, l have to do it.

1001
01:37:10,567 --> 01:37:12,956
- Oh, my boy!
- Don't worry.

1002
01:37:43,447 --> 01:37:44,800
What are we doing here?

1003
01:37:48,127 --> 01:37:50,322
l won't use it on you.

1004
01:37:55,127 --> 01:37:59,917
Your optic nerve must be very damaged
by now. lt won't take long.

1005
01:38:00,087 --> 01:38:05,445
- This can't end like this.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

1006
01:38:05,607 --> 01:38:11,443
Don't worry. When the darkness comes,
l'll be by your side.

1007
01:38:12,327 --> 01:38:14,522
l've packed your bags.

1008
01:38:14,687 --> 01:38:18,805
We will go far away
and nobody will find us.

1009
01:38:19,607 --> 01:38:21,120
We will start from scratch.

1010
01:38:21,287 --> 01:38:22,800
Don't touch me!

1011
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:25,444
Don't touch me, son of a bitch.

1012
01:38:26,727 --> 01:38:29,082
l will never love you. Never.

1013
01:38:29,247 --> 01:38:30,885
l would die first.

1014
01:38:31,967 --> 01:38:33,605
- Don't touch me!
- ls that what you want?

1015
01:38:33,767 --> 01:38:36,565
Don't touch me!

1016
01:38:37,607 --> 01:38:40,041
Let go of me!

1017
01:38:40,207 --> 01:38:43,358
- Let go of me!
- Oome on, do it!

1018
01:38:45,807 --> 01:38:47,525
Stay with me.

1019
01:39:17,767 --> 01:39:20,486
Do it. Do it.

1020
01:39:21,047 --> 01:39:23,720
Do it! Do it!

1021
01:39:23,887 --> 01:39:26,765
- Do it.
- l can't! l can't!

1022
01:39:31,807 --> 01:39:33,206
Of course you can't.

1023
01:39:33,367 --> 01:39:36,803
Although you don't know it...
you love me.

1024
01:39:37,407 --> 01:39:40,922
Because you know that without me,
you are nothing.

1025
01:39:41,087 --> 01:39:43,476
And l am only a shadow without you.

1026
01:40:55,767 --> 01:40:58,201
Julia, why did you lock the door?

1027
01:41:02,207 --> 01:41:04,084
- HeIIo?

1028

01:41:05,407 --> 01:41:08,956
Listen to me, because this is
the last time l'll call you.

1030
01:41:09,127 --> 01:41:12,642
- CaIm down.
- He's locked me in my house.

1031
01:41:12,807 --> 01:41:14,923
- CaIm down, JuIia.
- He's going to kill me.

1032
01:41:15,087 --> 01:41:19,285
lf you don't come, it will be too late.
You have to believe me. Please.

1033
01:41:19,447 --> 01:41:21,756
- JuIia, pIease, caIm down.

01:41:23,807 --> 01:41:25,240
lnspector?

1035
01:41:31,887 --> 01:41:33,161
Julia!

1036
01:43:33,167 --> 01:43:36,000
Julia, police!
Oover the stairs and the hallway.

1037
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:37,919

01:43:56,967 --> 01:43:59,401
Oan you see him?
Oan you see him, lnspector?

1042
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:03,082
Police! Put the knife down!
Put your hands above your head!

1043

Don't look at me.

How long do l have?

1050
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:30,677
You'll go blind before dawn.

1051
01:45:38,967 --> 01:45:41,356
l need you to do me a favour.

1052

Oan we have a moment?

1053
01:46:23,567 --> 01:46:25,046
What happened to his eyes?

1054
01:46:27,487 --> 01:46:29,443
He donated them.

1055
01:46:35,727 --> 01:46:37,160
And where are they?

1056
01:46:37,887 --> 01:46:40,117
Where he would have wanted.

1057
01:46:48,367 --> 01:46:50,801
