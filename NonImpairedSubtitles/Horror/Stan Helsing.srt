1
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:16,643
( eerie music playing )

2
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:46,267
( woman gasping )

3
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:51,440
( panting )

4
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,607
No! Ahh!

5
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,415
( screaming )

6
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:04,013
( screaming continues )

7
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:07,514
This place has got
great surround sound, man.

8
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,720
( phone rings )

9
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,560
Schlockbuster.
Happy Halloween.

10
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,862
Yeah yeah yeah,
we carry porn.

11
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,265
What do I recommend?

12
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,931
"Schindler's Fist,"

13
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:22,338
"How Stella Got
Her Tube Packed,"

14
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:24,706
"Six Degrees of Penetration."

15
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:27,712
That's a good one.
"Glad He Ate Her."

16
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:30,544
Yeah yeah. Okay.

17
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:32,675
- Man: Stan?
- You're welcome, Grandma.

18
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:34,345
Stan?

19
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,354
There's a cockroach in the ladies' room.
It's your turn to kill it.

20
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:39,448
Dude, come on,
you know my motto:

21
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:43,052
There's always someone
better for the job.

22
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,290
- Now!
- I'm off in 10 minutes.

23
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,060
Can't you have somebody
from the late shift do it?

24
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,192
No. I'm the manager and I say
you have to do it.

25
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:51,031
I got bongs older than you.

26
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,436
Well, I'm still the boss,
and I say you have to do it.

27
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,269
Don't make me write you up.

28
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,275
Here, you're gonna need it.

29
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,313
( sighs )

30
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,383
( grunts )

31
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,546
( grunts )

32
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:12,352
It's funny, I watched "The Notebook"
last night and I actually liked it.

33
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:14,689
You watched "The Notebook"
and you liked it?

34
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,491
Yeah. I'm actually thinking about
watching "Titanic" tonight too.

35
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:23,865
Woman: Stick it in me!

36
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:26,632
This "Blair Witch Project"
is some scary shit.

37
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:29,698
Oh, no, someone rearrangin'
rocks again.

38
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,176
See, this is why black people
don't go camping.

39
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,078
Why does that bitch gotta keep shining
that light up her dripping nose?

40
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,014
Man:
Run, bitch, run!

41
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,184
( object clatters )

42
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,838
Damn.

43
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,341
Thanks for scaring
the shit out of us.

44
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,673
We would have let you join in.

45
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:09,473
Oh.

46
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:15,678
I cockblocked myself.

47
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:18,781
( low growling )

48
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:22,487
Ahh, too many Peanut Chews!

49
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,519
( gurgling sounds )

50
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:37,605
( screeching )

51
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:40,373
Oh, cock...

52
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:43,643
roach.
Sorry, uh, dude,

53
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:45,843
I thought this was available,

54
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:47,875
but it's okay.
I don't actually need it,

55
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,979
'cause I just pissed myself.
You look tense.

56
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:51,683
Uh, you need a magazine?
Toilet paper?

57
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:53,190
Let me get you a magazine.

58
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:57,321
Ah, I see you're a fan of
the Kobe Bryant position.

59
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,798
Oh.

60
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,565
- ( screeches )
- What the... oh!

61
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,440
Hey, Sully, we're out of paper towels
in the ladies' room.

62
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,417
And these little puppies...
these lady diaper things

63
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:20,816
are super absorbent.

64
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,684
I'm gonna start doing
my dishes with those.

65
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,690
You gotta call somebody
about the cockroach in the bathroom.

66
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:28,659
Ask for a truck.
A very big truck.

67
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:32,596
Anyways, you're gonna need this.

68
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,565
- What's that?
- It's the videos

69
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,329
that you promised the owner
that you'd deliver to his mother.

70
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:39,531
Dude, no.

71
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:41,698
I got my friends right
outside waiting for me.

72
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,106
We're going to the coolest
Halloween party ever, okay?

73
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,270
- Can someone else do it?
- No, you promised.

74
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:49,542
And if you want to have a job here on
Monday, I would suggest that you do it.

75
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:50,639
No.

76
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:52,172
- What?
- No.

77
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:54,515
- I'm sorry?
- No!

78
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:58,455
( hip-hop song playing )

79
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,855
Stan, this is my date, Mia.

80
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,887
- Well hello, Mia.
- Hi.

81
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,661
- Why did you come as a cowboy?
- What?

82
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,861
I told you I was gonna
come as an Indian.

83
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,235
Now people are gonna think
that we're together.

84
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,763
Well, I think the correct term
is Native American.

85
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,672
And you look like Bret Michaels.

86
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,870
- Oh, yeah?
- Not a good look.

87
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,436
Hey! Whoa!

88
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,880
Stan:
God, I forgot, okay?

89
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,907
- Yeah, right.
- I did, I swear.

90
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,145
I didn't know you were
gonna wear that.

91
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,778
I think you guys look cute together.

92
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,048
- See?
- That's the problem.

93
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:32,556
Because we're not
together anymore.

94
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:36,355
- So, Mia?
- Hmm?

95
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,761
- What do you do?
- I used to be an exotic dancer,

96
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:40,424
but now I'm a massage therapist.

97
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:42,956
Oh, isn't that like
the same thing?

98
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,730
No. One you dance naked

99
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,931
and the other you
whack people off.

100
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,337
( coughs )

101
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:49,965
I just got a music gig.

102
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:53,171
A music gig?
Karaoke doesn't count as a music gig.

103
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,612
All right, Nadine, chill out.

104
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,444
I'll have us to the party
in, like, 10 minutes

105
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:58,779
and then you guys can separate.

106
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:01,183
Hey, can we make a quick stop
before we go to the party?

107
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,482
What stop?

108
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:05,115
I gotta drop off these videos
at my boss's mom's house.

109
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,091
Where's she live?

110
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,150
Linwood.

111
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,183
What?

112
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,959
- Isn't the party downtown?
- Stan: Quick detour.

113
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:15,228
In the complete opposite direction.

114
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,132
It's not even close to
being close by.

115
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,864
Come on, T!

116
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,804
Highway driving, man.
We'll get there in no time.

117
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,397
No way. No.

118
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:26,036
All right. But if I can't drop off
these videos, I'm gonna lose my job

119
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,945
and then I won't be able to pay
you guys the money I owe you...

120
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,916
both of you.
So, whatever.

121
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,815
If you don't want your money.

122
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:34,841
Okay.

123
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:37,446
( hip hop blaring )

124
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:52,961
His scent leads to this store.

125
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:57,032
But remember, I get the first taste
of his raw flesh.

126
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,440
( muttering )

127
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,372
- Why...
- It's not worth it.

128
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:02,880
Not worth it!

129
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,438
Come on.

130
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:13,481
( snorts ) Nice costume.
You're, like, the third one tonight.

131
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,152
( growling )

132
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:16,683
Can I help you?

133
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:20,425
I'm looking for a Mr. Helsing.

134
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:27,635
You should watch this one.

135
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,901
It's super tight.

136
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,841
( laughs )

137
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:34,539
( muttering )

138
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:42,042
( grunts )

139
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,385
( both laughing )

140
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,687
( baby cooing )

141
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:50,559
Um, can you hold her for a minute for me?
I just need to get my wallet out.

142
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:52,859
- ( baby coos, farts )
- Thank you.

143
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,833
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

144
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,858
Uh...

145
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:00,269
I'll have a box of
the Hot Tamales then.

146
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:03,763
( sighs )

147
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,073
- ( hip hop playing )
- Man, I knew it was too good to be true.

148
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,136
We're bumper to bumper over here.

149
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,910
It's probably a traffic jam.

150
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:18,145
Oh, snap, Teddy.

151
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,522
MILF alert, 3:00.

152
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,494
Ooh. Hello hello.
( makes cooing sounds )

153
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,625
Ahh. ( laughs )

154
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:29,065
- You're so gross.
- What?

155
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,593
What?
"Oh oh, Teddy.

156
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:35,128
Teddy, there's a MILF alert,
3:00."

157
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:36,572
You think I don't know
what that means?

158
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:38,735
What's a milk alert?

159
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:41,837
I can't believe I ever even
went out with you.

160
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,372
- The best six weeks of your life.
- It was two weeks.

161
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,977
Yeah, but I was doing you in
my mind for the other four.

162
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,145
Aww.

163
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:51,280
That's so sweet.

164
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:52,950
No. No.

165
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,465
( chuckling )

166
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:15,874
( wood tapping )

167
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,348
( makes monkey sounds )

168
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:19,577
Ahh!

169
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,483
- Did you guys see that?
- What, another MILF?

170
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,818
No!
In the MILF's van.

171
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:26,517
That doll mimed a blowjob

172
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:29,493
and started smacking his ass.

173
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,826
- That's so weird.
- Nadine: No no no no.

174
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:33,455
That's not weird at all.

175
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,398
It's... you know, it's a MILF

176
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,892
driving a car with a doll
that's miming a blowjob

177
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:41,565
and spanking his ass.
Yeah yeah.

178
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:43,130
Sounds perfectly normal.

179
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,541
My brother said I used to give
his GI Joe doll a boner.

180
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:46,669
- Oh!
- Okay,

181
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:48,645
you probably want to keep that
to yourself.

182
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,705
You know what?
Forget I even said it.

183
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,979
Oh, no.
We won't be forgetting that one.

184
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,646
Nope, it went right...
right up here.

185
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,382
Well, there's plenty of
room for that there.

186
00:10:57,422 --> 00:11:01,188
In Stan's defense, there is a phenomenon
called an urban mirage.

187
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:03,490
Forget it, dude.
You do not have to defend me.

188
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,656
I'm just saying, people get stressed out
in urban settings. It happens.

189
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,393
I saw what I saw.

190
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:12,169
- Shit.
- What?

191
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,332
- Did another doll just moon you?
- No, we missed our exit.

192
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:19,173
- Why aren't you paying attention?
- Dude, that doll freaked me out!

193
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,576
It's all right. Just take the next exit.

194
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:22,136
I know how to get there
taking the back roads.

195
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,875
Ooh, I've heard that before.

196
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:31,419
All right, which way?

197
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:33,185
Uh, straight.

198
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,529
It would help if there were
some fucking street signs.

199
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:40,793
All: Whoa!

200
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:46,797
Did you see that?

201
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:50,137
Yeah, I saw it.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

202
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,370
Me too.
And I'm a vegetarian.

203
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,210
Uh, he's slowing down.
I think he's trying to box us in.

204
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,806
Teddy, she's right.
Go around him.

205
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,510
All right, hang on.

206
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,349
- Teddy, you gotta speed up.
- I'm flooring it!

207
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:16,594
- Whoa!
- What the hell is driving that truck?

208
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,466
Looks like a purse
I bought in Tijuana.

209
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,562
Oh, great, now he's speeding up.

210
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:23,937
- Almost.
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

211
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,239
- Teddy, drop back!
- I can't. It's too late. I gotta pass!

212
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,143
There's another semi coming!

213
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,239
( all screaming )

214
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:39,245
( muttering )

215
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:43,750
- Are we dead?
- No. But we should be.

216
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:47,231
Teddy, that was awesome, man.
You should be a stunt-car driver.

217
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:51,292
I wanted to be a stuntman, but a little thing
called law school got in the way.

218
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:53,236
What do we do now?

219
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:54,636
We do nothing.

220
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,141
My motto is don't get involved.

221
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:59,769
I thought you said you knew how
to get us back on the highway.

222
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:01,904
Why don't we just knock on the door
of one of these houses out here?

223
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,710
( buzzer sound )
Wrong answer.

224
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:05,613
Ever seen a little movie
called "The Hills Have Eyes"?

225
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,279
This whole place is crawling
with flesh-eating inbreds.

226
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,313
Okay, sister?
I say we just chill...

227
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:14,587
and enjoy the drive.

228
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:19,386
What are you doing?

229
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,991
Medicating myself, man.

230
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:25,867
That was a really stressful
situation back there.

231
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,531
I need to settle the nerves.

232
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,332
Okay.

233
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,400
( distorted speech )

234
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,776
( groovy music playing )

235
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,007
( Nadine moaning )

236
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:41,947
( exhales )

237
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,477
( Stan sniffing )

238
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,921
Teddy:
Man, what are you doing?

239
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,891
( exhaling loudly )

240
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,989
Huh?
( laughs )

241
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,967
( Stan speaks gibberish )

242
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,095
Okay.

243
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:01,537
Just make sure nobody
burns the upholstery.

244
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:05,669
Mia:
Isn't it smoky in here?

245
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,440
Nadine:
I feel, like, really baked.

246
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,845
Teddy:
Mm-hmm.

247
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,610
What the hell was in that shit?

248
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,914
( voice distorted )
Special recipe.

249
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:18,048
It's a really cool Thai stick and
I dip it in liquid X,

250
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,387
and then I grind it
into the weed,

251
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:23,417
and then I roll it into the joint.

252
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:26,259
Man, you're like
the Rachael Ray of weed.

253
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:29,198
Rachael Ray!

254
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:32,226
- I feel numb all over.
- Yeah.

255
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,397
What are you doing?

256
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm just working on some
acupressure points.

257
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,844
All:
Whoa!

258
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,176
Sorry.

259
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:47,745
This van just went from an automatic
to a stick shift. Teddy got a boner.

260
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,686
( laughing )

261
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:52,383
- Do you have any more?
- You should try.

262
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,355
( gasps )

263
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:58,862
- Whoa!
- ( brakes squeal )

264
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,889
What the hell was that?

265
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,265
It looked like a baby bear.

266
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,964
- Where are you going?
- To see if it's all right.

267
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,405
Are you insane?

268
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,931
If that's a baby bear,

269
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:13,136
then there's a mama bear out there
wanting to kick some ass.

270
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,772
Look, I am a medical professional.

271
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,112
I took an oath.

272
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,515
Massage ain't medicine!

273
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,621
We can't let her go out there alone.

274
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,487
Okay, fine,
I'll go out there.

275
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,294
Wait.

276
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,130
Teddy, you probably
should go out there.

277
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,795
No, I'm not going.
We both go.

278
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,327
They're gonna call us pussies
if we don't go.

279
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,862
Wait a minute. Okay.

280
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:53,074
Oh, boy.
It... it's a dog.

281
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,177
I think it's a Rottweiler.

282
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,120
He's hurt bad.
I don't think he's gonna make it.

283
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,146
( motor humming, car backfiring )

284
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,824
Teddy:
Hey hey, here's comes a pickup truck.

285
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,885
Oh, that's good.

286
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:07,125
We can maybe flag him down and
then he can take the dog to a vet.

287
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,224
All: Yo! Hey!

288
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:13,567
Stan:
Hey, how you doing?

289
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,999
Uh, listen, we hit this dog...

290
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:21,239
Well, we... we didn't hit the dog!
What?

291
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,214
There's a dog there.
We are citizens.

292
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,980
So we see it and stop.
Now we're talking to you.

293
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,714
Hey, citizen,

294
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:31,051
can you help us out?

295
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:38,156
Sammy Boy?

296
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:43,093
That's my Sammy Boy!

297
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:44,431
Oh, shit.

298
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,801
Oh, my baby boy.

299
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:49,238
Daddy's here now!

300
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,707
( sobbing )

301
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:54,178
I'm sorry, Daddy,
but I think he's gone.

302
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:57,670
He may be gone to
a she-devil like you...

303
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:59,478
Help me up.

304
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:01,246
...but I'm gonna take him home!

305
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,221
I'm gonna fix him!

306
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,760
( man wailing )

307
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:12,957
- Let's go.
- Why'd you call him "Daddy"?

308
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:15,192
We're gonna get you for this.

309
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:19,067
I'm gonna take Sammy home
and make him better,

310
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,469
and then we're gonna
hunt you down

311
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,599
and make you feel what it's like

312
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:27,543
to have your bones broke and
your insides ripped out!

313
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,446
Now would be a good time
to get out of here! Ahh!

314
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:31,948
Ahh!

315
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:37,186
What just happened back there?

316
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,589
- We just killed his dog.
- And now he's gonna kill us.

317
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,786
Don't talk about it.
My motto is...

318
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,193
"Don't talk about it."
And it's served me well.

319
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,131
Well, no wonder you can't get any.
So far your mottos are,

320
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,329
"Don't get involved,"
"Don't talk about it."

321
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:54,065
Oh, I get any.
I get plenty of any.

322
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,834
Trust me.

323
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,865
Oh, look at this guy up here,

324
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:01,072
hitchin' in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah, sure, buddy.

325
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:04,172
Sure, we'll pick you up,
Mr. Mass Murderer.

326
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:10,743
Uh, um...
you're kidding, right?

327
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,915
You... Teddy, you...

328
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:16,358
No, Teddy's just fucking with him.
He's gonna wait till he gets really close

329
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:18,555
and then Teddy's gonna floor it
and take off!

330
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,757
- Nope, I'm giving him a ride.
- No way!

331
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,358
Do you know what it's like
to be black and need a ride?

332
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,959
Okay, nobody stops for you.

333
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,972
I once stood outside downtown
for 40 minutes

334
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,633
and nobody would pick me up.

335
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:31,335
Were you wearing
that costume?

336
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,003
Well, this guy's not black.

337
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:34,807
You don't have to be black
to be oppressed.

338
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:37,906
Yeah, so we gotta get hacked up to pieces
'cause you want to level the playing field?

339
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,849
Ahh.

340
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,514
Yeah, hop in, man.

341
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,188
Whoo, thanks. Ahh.

342
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,285
( exhales )

343
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:52,193
I was freezing.

344
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,460
This is all I had on
when I got out.

345
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,490
- Got out?
- Yeah.

346
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:58,502
I was at Chino State.

347
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:01,096
Oh, um, the university?

348
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:03,266
No, the prison.

349
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,538
It was a bum rap.
That's why I took off.

350
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:08,568
Pretty much had to
after the riot.

351
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,081
That riot that
you were referring to,

352
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:12,548
what was that about?

353
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:16,417
Oh, a stabbing. He was from
the Black Guerilla family.

354
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:18,979
He touched my spoon at lunch.

355
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:20,718
Well, I pretty much
had to shank him.

356
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:22,089
- ( laughing )
- Teddy: Yeah.

357
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,117
Yeah, you gotta shank him.

358
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:26,221
Can't just touch a spoon.

359
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:29,165
No, that's...
yeah, he touched your spoon, man.

360
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,533
Is this going just like you
planned there, Teddy?

361
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,733
I have a question for Mr. Hacker.

362
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:38,071
Why, sure... sure thing, baby girl.

363
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:41,101
How was it that you got invited
to prison in the first place?

364
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,545
It's this particular instance
that you're referring to...

365
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:46,049
well, that was because of
a tease and squeeze.

366
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,075
What's a tease and squeeze?

367
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,111
Sorry, I'm using
prison slang here!

368
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:52,884
( Nadine laughing )

369
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:56,257
No, I was convicted of
the torture and murder

370
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,728
- of two nursing students.
- Oh my God!

371
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,754
- All: Ooh!
- ( tires squealing )

372
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:02,891
- ( laughing )
- Sorry.

373
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:06,426
- Whoo-hoo!
- It's just... my mom's a nurse.

374
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,497
Not around here, though.
Not around Linwood at all.

375
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,974
Yeah, anyways, it was bullshit.

376
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,671
I suffocated her with a pillow.

377
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,144
Oh. Okay.

378
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,808
Yeah, anyways, her roommate
witnessed it and I had taken some acid,

379
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,977
so I wigged out, you know?

380
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,316
And the next thing I knew,

381
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:24,878
the room was full
of body parts!

382
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:26,617
( laughing )

383
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:28,249
Anyway, who's got some weed?

384
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:32,126
I got the nose of a bloodhound!
( laughs )

385
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,957
You sure do, yeah.
You sure do.

386
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:39,561
Uh, I got a bag of
some great stuff, actually,

387
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:42,971
right there underneath your seat.
You just gotta reach over the back.

388
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:44,497
You sure? I think it's down...

389
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,601
No, it ain't.
It's in the back.

390
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:48,578
- Yeah, just reach all the way over.
- I can't find it.

391
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:49,739
- Yeah.
- No, reach and see.

392
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,944
Reach over there.
Yeah, reach all the way over.

393
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,781
Stretch it out.

394
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,286
It's not back here!

395
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,585
- Oh!
- ( girls screaming )

396
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,189
Ahhh!

397
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,823
- Ahhh!
- Stop it! Stop!

398
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:14,568
Oh my God.

399
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,073
- I just killed a man!
- You didn't kill him.

400
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:20,202
Okay, I maimed him.
He's flopping down on the street.

401
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:23,304
Now might be a good time to invoke
your motto, "Don't talk about it."

402
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:25,781
Mia: Guys, are we going to go
to this party?

403
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,980
Because so far I'm having
a really lousy Halloween.

404
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,488
We'll stop for gas
and get directions.

405
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:33,513
We could get some chips.

406
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:38,856
( dog barking )

407
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:41,057
( bell dinging )

408
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:48,566
What can I do you for, Superman?

409
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:51,234
( laughs )
Uh, fill her up, please.

410
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,004
Check the oil?

411
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:56,844
Sure. Thank you.

412
00:21:56,881 --> 00:22:00,180
Man, that hippie chick
is cool as hell...

413
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,210
full service? That's cool.
Places don't do that anymore.

414
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:06,314
Yeah, but don't forget,
full service costs extra.

415
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:14,128
Well, I don't know about your oil,

416
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,896
but you've got quite a bit of
blood and fur on the front of your car.

417
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:22,604
Oh, yeah, that...

418
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,005
well, it's...

419
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,702
Stan:
Halloween! Ha ha!

420
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,370
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

421
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:29,641
Ha ha, I'm a cowboy!

422
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,513
But, yeah, we go all out.
Not only do we dress up,

423
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,279
we dress up our van too.

424
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:37,583
Ah, Halloween, right.

425
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,146
Halloween.

426
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,183
We don't participate in those
pagan rituals around here.

427
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:45,752
Well, I'm a Baptist, so...

428
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:48,230
we just kinda sort of play along.

429
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,131
Play along? Mmm.

430
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,829
Do you have a restroom?

431
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,769
Right there.

432
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,965
But you need the key.

433
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,733
Thank you.

434
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:03,372
We've got snacks and drinks
inside if you want 'em.

435
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:05,814
I could go for a little snack.

436
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,875
- Yeah.
- A little snack.

437
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,217
( soft music playing )

438
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:12,051
( doorbell dings )

439
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,551
- You!
- Who?

440
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:17,788
- You!
- Me?

441
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,989
- Van Helsing!
- No, man, Stan.

442
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,898
My name is Stan Helsing.
How did you know my last name?

443
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,902
Not Stan, Van!

444
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,733
( turns off radio )

445
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:29,797
You are Van Helsing,

446
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,671
the great monster hunter.

447
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,540
- ( growling )
- ( woman screaming )

448
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:40,213
Yo, Chief, I think you're
mistaking me for somebody else.

449
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:43,812
My name is Stan.
That... that doesn't even...

450
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:46,914
Teddy: I don't know, man.
I mean, it kinda looks just like you, Stan,

451
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,721
with better hair.

452
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:53,457
That's some weird shit.

453
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:57,263
You guys, Mia's taking a really
long time in the bathroom.

454
00:23:57,301 --> 00:24:00,600
Cold drinks in the fridge against the wall.
Help yourself.

455
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:01,832
I'll be right back.

456
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:04,602
Gotta go upstairs and
refill the coffee-maker.

457
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,680
My name's Stan.

458
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:13,480
Ah, doughnut.

459
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:16,577
There's a whole pot of coffee right here.
Want some coffee?

460
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:22,158
Okay, you guys, be totally honest.
Does my vagina make me look fat?

461
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:24,423
- Oh my God!
- Ooh! Whoa!

462
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,487
Come on!

463
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,159
- What I'd do is I'd go on in there!
- You're ridiculous!

464
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:32,328
I'm going in!

465
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,430
- Goin' on up in here!
- Let me in!

466
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,872
( music ends )

467
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:39,102
- No.
- Okay.

468
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,601
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

469
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,104
l... I can't even see your vagina.

470
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:47,276
- Oh.
- I wish I could.

471
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:48,945
I wish I could.

472
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:50,954
He's so sweet.

473
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,961
Oh.

474
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,636
( puts down key )

475
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,972
( unzipping )

476
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:14,705
( Stan urinating )

477
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:22,017
Oh my God, I totally thought
we were busted there

478
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,180
when she mentioned the blood
on the car.

479
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:26,348
Yeah, luckily Stan
saved the day.

480
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,654
The boy is always thinking.

481
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,684
What'd you get?

482
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:33,356
Girl, I didn't know you
liked Old Spanglish.

483
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:34,887
- Mm-hmm.
- ( sighs )

484
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:38,565
( chanting )

485
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:42,197
( Native American music playing )

486
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:45,072
( several people chanting )

487
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,318
Ahhh!

488
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:00,382
What? What's wrong?

489
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:02,517
Somebody was watching me take
a piss through a hole in the wall.

490
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,755
You know, tugging his totem pole.
You, man!

491
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:07,059
You were watching me
go to the bathroom!

492
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,429
I was not!

493
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,934
Okay, you know what?
You pervs do what you gotta do.

494
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:13,300
- We're gonna go.
- Yeah.

495
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:15,100
- Ahh!
- Oh!

496
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:17,073
You owe me 40 bucks for the gas.

497
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,406
- Teddy, pay her.
- Oh.

498
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,237
This is my emergency stash.

499
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,044
You know, you guys are lucky
we don't call the cops on you

500
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,812
and Chief Spanks-a-Lot.

501
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,821
You and your whores
get off of our property.

502
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,789
Hey, we're not whores!

503
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,791
- ( fires )
- All: Oooh!

504
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:40,555
Oh, man!

505
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:43,966
All:
Teddy!

506
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:46,401
I got... I gotta...

507
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:50,396
- Teddy!
- ( muttering )

508
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,473
Stan: Go! Let's get out of here!
Drive!

509
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:58,778
( gun fires )

510
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:07,215
We just gotta deliver
these damn videos.

511
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,886
We can then go to the party.

512
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:14,325
I can't believe that guy was watching
you pee while he masturbated.

513
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,923
You know, Mia,
he probably watched you too.

514
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:17,797
Mmm, yeah, he did.

515
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:20,065
Do you know that for sure?

516
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:22,163
- Oh, yeah, I saw him.
- Stan: What?

517
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:23,867
Why didn't you tell us?

518
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,967
Because I put on
a little show for him

519
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,308
and I thought he was,
you know, finished.

520
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:31,109
You put on a little show for him?

521
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,116
Well, yeah,
I felt sorry for him.

522
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,847
Anyway, that's the real reason
I changed.

523
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:39,014
Take this right! Take this right!

524
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,149
( tires squeal )

525
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,023
- Oh.
- Oh my God.

526
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,755
Okay, we're on Mockingbird Lane.

527
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:47,025
This takes us right to the main
gate of where we're going.

528
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:47,928
It's about a quarter mile ahead.

529
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:00,667
- 'Evening.
- 'Evening.

530
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:05,872
Are you going to a party?

531
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,111
Um, we're making a delivery.

532
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:10,620
Deliveries go to the east gate.

533
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:12,178
This is the west gate.

534
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,054
Well, how do you get to
the east gate?

535
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:17,549
The east gate doesn't open
for deliveries till 7:00 AM.

536
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:21,497
- You look very familiar.
- ( phone ringing )

537
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:26,602
- West gate.
- ( woman screaming )

538
00:28:26,637 --> 00:28:29,265
Well, why don't you hit it
with a little WD-40?

539
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:31,365
When my chainsaw sticks,

540
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,103
that always does the trick.

541
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:35,577
- ( woman screaming )
- You're welcome.

542
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:42,207
Yeah, see, we're not really making
an official delivery.

543
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,448
We're kind of just dropping
something off to a friend.

544
00:28:44,488 --> 00:28:46,115
Oh, why didn't you say so?

545
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:49,648
Ha. Welcome to
Stormy Night Estates.

546
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:52,457
- You know how it got its name?
- No.

547
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:54,930
It used to be the backlot
for Stormy Night Pictures.

548
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:58,298
They made all of
the popular horror movies

549
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:01,065
right up until the fire.

550
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,802
- ( glass shattering )
- ( woman screaming )

551
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:07,436
( phone rings )

552
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:10,770
- West gate.
- ( sped-up tape playing )

553
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:12,679
A hockey mask?

554
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:14,149
That's a new one.

555
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,914
Yeah, but he shouldn't be
looking in your window.

556
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:18,819
I'll... I'll keep an eye out.

557
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:23,857
- The fire started at midnight.
- If... if we could...

558
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:27,330
Then developers bought this land
and built this.

559
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:30,492
But they still say you shouldn't
be out here after midnight.

560
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:33,162
We're kind of in a hurry.
Can we just go on our way?

561
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:35,569
- ( phone ringing )
- Oh, be my guest.

562
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:37,005
West gate.

563
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,531
( mumbled man's voice )

564
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,340
You're afraid to go to sleep?

565
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:44,142
What kind of nightmares?

566
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:45,978
All right, so what are
we looking for?

567
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:49,543
Um... 1428 Elm Street.

568
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,521
The last house on the left.

569
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:54,854
( car stalling )

570
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,452
What's... what's wrong?

571
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:00,690
The gauge says we're empty.

572
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:07,359
Man, that crazy hippie lady
didn't put any gas in the car.

573
00:30:07,404 --> 00:30:09,634
As a matter of fact, I bet she
siphoned some of it out.

574
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:12,506
Well, let's get out. I mean, it's a gated
community. It can't be that far.

575
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:14,636
( Teddy sighs )

576
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:24,446
Why don't we just, you know,
ask the security guard?

577
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:29,791
That's weird. He's gone.

578
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:33,228
Well, come on. We've got a party
to go to. Let's drop off these videos.

579
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:35,663
( distant wolf howling )

580
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,992
Yeah.

581
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,732
Okay.

582
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:44,570
- ( chainsaw buzzing )
- ( woman screaming )

583
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:48,044
Well, I guess that guy found oil
for his chainsaw.

584
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:51,138
Oh, my gosh.
Check out the dates they all died.

585
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,447
What a coincidence.

586
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,050
( croaking )
Nevermore!

587
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:03,582
That sounds familiar.

588
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:07,688
- You're an idiot.
- Hey, that sounds familiar too.

589
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:10,359
Faster! Spit on it! Spit on it!

590
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,733
( groans )
How much do I owe you?

591
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,862
Now leave.

592
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:16,964
Oh my God. Three in a row.
Something is going on!

593
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,032
( pop music playing )

594
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:21,738
( all chuckling )

595
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,212
When did Rocket Suckers
get balls?

596
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:33,086
Hey, check out the guy
running the truck.

597
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:44,257
Oh, look, there's a sign
for a bar.

598
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:46,861
Oh, great, 'cause after
seeing that, I'm starving!

599
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:50,931
Come on, man, I was talking
about the ice cream, not...

600
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:53,636
pictures. Forget it.
I'm not even gonna...

601
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:57,204
I'm not gay, so I don't know what
you guys are staring at me for.

602
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:00,705
( honky-tonk music playing )

603
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:04,450
 I'm crazy... 

604
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:05,978
( door opens )

605
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:09,117
 Crazy for feeling... 

606
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,389
- That's that guy.
- ( girls gasp )

607
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:12,861
That's the guy.

608
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:16,229
You'd think they'd never seen
a brother in a superhero costume before.

609
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:17,756
Mm-hmm.

610
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:21,202
All: How you doin'
Okay. How's your dog?

611
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:24,173
- 'Evening, everybody.
- How are you folks?

612
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,335
How you doin'
Good evening.

613
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:32,440
Stan:
All right. Yes, those are her breasts.

614
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,884
That is a black man
in a Superman outfit.

615
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,352
Teddy: All right, bro.

616
00:32:37,387 --> 00:32:39,287
- Let's just have a seat here.
- Stan: Okay.

617
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:41,951
- Teddy: Oh, here's a table.
- Stan: Let's just sit down right here.

618
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,956
Yeah yeah, all right.
That's good.

619
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:50,826
Man's voice:
Careful of the pie.

620
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,893
Teddy: Damn!

621
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:55,131
Uh, now what can I do for you?

622
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:57,367
Menus?

623
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:00,035
No menus.
We make everything here.

624
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:03,308
Great. Well, I'll have three
cheeseburgers for here, one to go,

625
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:06,009
extra mayo, french fries
and a triple chocolate shake.

626
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:09,314
Would you like that in an IV?
It's quicker.

627
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:12,652
- No.
- No.

628
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:15,783
Can I get some sliced mango,
a pinch of salt, squeeze of lemon,

629
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:17,885
Diet Coke in a can with
a bendy straw?

630
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:19,020
You got it, cowgirl.

631
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:23,726
And I'm going to have
a chicken pot pie and an iced tea, please.

632
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:26,964
You know, this is the first time I've seen
a push-up bra on an Indian.

633
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:31,703
Actually, you know, the correct term
is Native American. So...

634
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:35,178
Pocahontas, around here
the native term is "hooker."

635
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:38,773
Hmm? Oh, uh, I'll have a salad and...

636
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,215
Never mind.

637
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,708
She just called me a hooker!

638
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:46,484
I'm gonna talk to the manager. I don't think
they like how she's talking to us.

639
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:49,458
One order from the freaks
at table 9!

640
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:52,189
Might want to rethink about
talking to the manager.

641
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:55,721
You know what? Let's just eat and deliver
those videos and get out of town.

642
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:58,564
Well, we can't since
we don't have any gas.

643
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,729
- Remember?
- That's right.

644
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:02,705
All right. Well, I'll call AAA.

645
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:05,003
And then if they're not here by
the time we're done,

646
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,442
I guess I'll just call a taxi.
Is that all right?

647
00:34:07,477 --> 00:34:09,035
Nadine: Okay.

648
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:12,208
( phone beeps )

649
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:14,149
I'm not getting a signal up in here.

650
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:16,812
That's 'cause cell phones don't work
in Stormy Night Estates.

651
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,356
Why not?

652
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,120
Because they don't want anybody
calling out to the outside world.

653
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,390
Elwood, I told you never
to bother the customers.

654
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,521
I'm sorry.

655
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:30,624
Okay, drinks for everybody. Uh...
who gets what?

656
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:31,998
Where's the men's room?

657
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:34,162
At the back wall, turn right.

658
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:41,835
( unzips )

659
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:45,975
( sighs )

660
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:49,975
( person farting )

661
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,456
( person defecating loudly )

662
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:57,222
Hey, buddy, how about
a courtesy flush, huh?

663
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,695
( person farts, toilet flushes )

664
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,721
Thank you.

665
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:06,225
Low voice: Hey, pal, you think you could
pass me a roll of toilet paper, please?

666
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,299
Here you go.

667
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:13,570
Thank you very much.

668
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,941
( blade swiping )

669
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:19,745
( man grunting in pain )

670
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:23,311
It's a boy!

671
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:25,583
And whatever you do,

672
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:27,351
don't be in town after midnight,

673
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,951
- because ever since...
- You guys!

674
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:33,087
This is crazy. So I'm in the stall
doing my business,

675
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,530
and the guy next to me in the stall
asks for some toilet paper

676
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:37,396
and I said sure. So when he
reaches his hand under...

677
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:39,868
- Excuse me. You guys are up.
- Up where? Where?

678
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:42,895
- What are you talking about?
- To sing. Your group.

679
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,703
What are you talking about?
We're not singing.

680
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:46,038
- No.
- We're not singing.

681
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:49,204
- Then what'd you sign up for?
- We didn't sign up.

682
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:51,146
Your friend Superman here
signed you up

683
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:52,944
when you were in
the men's room.

684
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:56,043
Teddy? Teddy?

685
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,522
Are you kidding me?
Why did you sign us up?

686
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:03,083
Well, I figured it, you know,
it would help us fit in.

687
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:05,185
Who cares about fitting in?

688
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:07,753
Teddy, you're the only brother here
wearing a Superman outfit.

689
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,766
Fit in? Fit in?

690
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,792
We're not gonna sing.
Take us off the list.

691
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:14,360
Okay.
Just take us off the list.

692
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:16,304
All right, all right.

693
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,207
Uh, the freaks at table 9

694
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:23,542
say they're too good to sing karaoke
at our shitty little bar and grill.

695
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,980
- No no...
- ( all booing )

696
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:29,112
Easy easy.

697
00:36:29,152 --> 00:36:31,052
I didn't say "shitty."
Everybody, calm down.

698
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,885
( whip lashes )

699
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:35,687
( "Ring of Fire" playing )

700
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,157
 Love 

701
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,463
 Is a burning thing 

702
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,369
 And makes a fiery ring 

703
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:57,443
 Bound by wild desire 

704
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:02,950
 I fell into a ring of fire 

705
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:08,280
 I fell into a burning ring of fire 

706
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:10,452
 I went down down down 

707
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,292
 And the flames went higher 

708
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,060
-  And it burns burns burns 
-  Burns burns burns 

709
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:18,226
 The ring of fire 

710
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:21,863
 The ring with fire... 

711
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,236
( record screeches to a halt )

712
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:33,746
What?

713
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:39,886
I just thought you guys might
like a little Johnny Cash.

714
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:41,413
Elwood:
We like Johnny Cash.

715
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,916
It's just we're still a little
sensitive about fires,

716
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:48,260
ever since the one that destroyed
and cursed our town.

717
00:37:48,298 --> 00:37:53,133
That's right. That's right.
The security guard told us.

718
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:55,466
( laughs )

719
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:57,200
( all chuckle )

720
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,767
Your whole town burned up.
Uh, sorry?

721
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,974
Um, well...

722
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:07,450
Howdy. I'm Stan Helsing.
This is...

723
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,884
Hey, did you say Van Helsing?

724
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,855
No, I didn't say Van Helsing.
I said Stan Helsing.

725
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:15,221
Stan Helsing,
not Van Helsing.

726
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:17,385
Why does everybody want me
to be Van Helsing?

727
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:21,193
Ever since the fire, this town has
been tormented by monsters.

728
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:24,359
Legend has it that one day

729
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:27,598
a Van Helsing will come

730
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:30,936
and save us from this curse.

731
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:32,601
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

732
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:36,100
but I'm Stan Helsing,
not Van Helsing.

733
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:38,774
I'm not here to save anybody.

734
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,510
Sorry.

735
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:46,083
Well, I'm glad I didn't suggest
we sing Clay Aiken.

736
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:50,184
Stan, I don't understand why you're
ducking this whole Van Helsing thing.

737
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,058
I'm not ducking anything!

738
00:38:52,095 --> 00:38:56,361
I'm Stan. Stan, man.
I'm not a monster killer.

739
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:58,560
I don't want to let these
townspeople down.

740
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,435
( bell tolling, wolf howling )

741
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:05,300
( clanging )

742
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,647
Don't worry, it's just a clock.

743
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:17,517
( electricity buzzing,
woman screaming )

744
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:19,954
That can't be good.

745
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,322
I forgot my cell phone.

746
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:30,991
- What?
- The door is locked.

747
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:33,901
( creaking )

748
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:35,632
Well, go get your phone, Teddy.

749
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:37,264
( high-pitched )
I ain't going on my own...

750
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:40,538
( continues, gibberish )

751
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:42,545
It is dark in there.

752
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,570
Ooh, I have a flashlight.

753
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:04,533
( all screaming )

754
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,869
Ahh!

755
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:14,001
You guys, I can't run anymore.

756
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,069
( sighs )

757
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:19,707
I ain't running no more.

758
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:21,740
What the hell are you doing?
What is that?

759
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:23,980
It's my to-go burger.

760
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,352
( static )

761
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:52,980
Prepare yourself
to die, mortal!

762
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:56,008
- ( all screaming )
- Run to the west gate!

763
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:08,523
This whole town is full
of skeletons.

764
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:11,466
( all screaming )

765
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,165
Man, this whole town is dead.

766
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,608
Oh my God.

767
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,512
Maybe this is like "The Sixth Sense"
and we're the ones who are really dead.

768
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:27,448
You know what, Mia? I've been
holding something back all night,

769
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:29,008
so I'm just gonna
go ahead and say it now:

770
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:31,850
That doesn't make any sense,
you stupid bitch.

771
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:33,981
Yeah, I feel better now.

772
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,152
- Try the guardhouse phone.
- Good idea.

773
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,124
- Big surprise... it's dead.
- ( phone rings )

774
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,067
- Hello?
- We know who you are.

775
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:49,469
- Who is this?
- How'd you like my ass?

776
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:51,303
- Dad?
- I may be a little doll,

777
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:54,538
but I'm gonna chop you
and your friends into pieces.

778
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:57,307
You know who that was?
That was that doll

779
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,645
that we were driving next to
that showed me his ass.

780
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,617
Oh my God.

781
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:03,642
Stan, I know it's been
a stressful night,

782
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,451
but there was no doll.

783
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:08,753
And there definitely was no doll

784
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,953
- showing you his ass!
- I'm out of here.

785
00:42:15,098 --> 00:42:17,089
Come on.

786
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:20,560
God.

787
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:24,233
- ( all gasping )
- ( electricity buzzing )

788
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:25,605
Stan!

789
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,943
Stan? Stan?

790
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:34,415
- Are you okay?
- ( gasps )

791
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,284
Oh. Ah.

792
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,553
- Nadine?
- Yes.

793
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:44,719
Why did we break up?

794
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:47,229
Don't you remember?

795
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:50,897
I think so.

796
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:56,933
Yeah, so I told the guy,
I was like, " Listen,

797
00:42:56,973 --> 00:42:59,305
I'm the only guy here
at the karaoke bar

798
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:01,139
that sings 'T emple of the Dog." '

799
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:03,111
I had to lay down the law,
you know?

800
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:07,480
I just think that grunge didn't have
enough time to, like, fully mature.

801
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:09,644
You know?
Like it's still evolving.

802
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:12,348
And that's what I'm trying to do,
just bring my music back to that...

803
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,323
- ( fly buzzing )
...you know, so...

804
00:43:14,357 --> 00:43:15,551
( fly stops buzzing )

805
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:17,526
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.

806
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,653
Ever since I was a kid,
I was, you know,

807
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:21,357
able to snatch bugs and stuff.

808
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,195
Wow.

809
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,030
Woman over intercom:
Number 74, your order's ready!

810
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:26,899
That's us. I'll go get it,

811
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:28,665
since you paid and all.

812
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:35,072
 It's not the way that 

813
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:37,477
 You carry on in bed 

814
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,482
 It's not your last laugh 

815
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,245
 It's not your game 

816
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:43,184
 It's not the way that 

817
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,483
 You wear your saddle straps 

818
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,819
 It's in your name 

819
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:49,324
 And it's in your gaze 

820
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,988
-  Oooh... 
- ( baby crying )

821
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:04,366
( choking )

822
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,544
Pot pie.

823
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:12,480
Uh, I wish that was
a real pot pie.

824
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:14,005
That would be fun.

825
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,577
 So hungry,
I'm gonna eat you. 

826
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:22,521
What?

827
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,720
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

828
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:27,787
Who are you doing?

829
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,129
- Stan?
- ( gasps )

830
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,600
Stan?
Stan, are you okay?

831
00:44:32,635 --> 00:44:35,365
- Nadine?
- Yeah.

832
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,331
Are you wearing any underwear?

833
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:41,866
- Yep, he's fine.
- ( Stan grunts )

834
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:46,573
Teddy: Man, how was
the flashback?

835
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:48,550
It was terrible.

836
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,712
But the food was delicious.

837
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:52,448
All right, well, let's go find
the east gate.

838
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,581
Good idea.

839
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:56,057
I taste metal.

840
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:59,926
- East gate. East gate.
- Oh. Okay.

841
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,954
( wolf howling )

842
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:05,058
Look, this place can't be that big.
We'll find somebody to help us out,

843
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:08,730
drop these videos off and get out
of this godforsaken place.

844
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:09,965
Hey, look, a truck.

845
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:13,737
- Nadine: Hey, it's stopping.
- What is he doing?

846
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:18,445
( body thumping )

847
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:20,540
- We should ask him for some help.
- Nope.

848
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:23,609
We should. Who else is there?
Hey, buddy!

849
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:25,314
- Hey!
- Excuse me, sir?

850
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,220
- Nadine: Over here!
- Stan: You,

851
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,248
with the yarmulke!

852
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:31,055
Oh, he's leaving.

853
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:33,528
- Wait a minute.
- Mia: What was he doing?

854
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,190
He threw something down
that metal tube.

855
00:45:35,231 --> 00:45:36,994
Teddy: Yeah, but that
something was moving.

856
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:38,796
Yeah, and that something
was bloody.

857
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:49,772
Hello?

858
00:45:49,812 --> 00:45:53,077
- Hey, Mia, hand me your flashlight.
- Oh, sure.

859
00:45:53,116 --> 00:45:55,084
( flashlight crashes )

860
00:45:55,118 --> 00:45:58,576
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

861
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:02,216
Hello, sir?
Yoo-hoo!

862
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:04,317
Sir, I know you're tied up right now,

863
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,158
but could you please
throw me my flashlight?

864
00:46:07,196 --> 00:46:08,663
Hello?

865
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:09,722
( grunts )

866
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,529
Nadine: Oh, no no!

867
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,502
- ( screaming )
- Oh! Oh!

868
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:16,630
- Do you have her?
- Yeah, I got her!

869
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:20,038
Damn.

870
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:22,806
I think now would be
a great time

871
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:25,643
for a reverse POV.

872
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:32,077
Oh, shit.

873
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:34,180
- ( mouse squealing )
- ( Mia giggling )

874
00:46:34,223 --> 00:46:36,748
Stop it.

875
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,728
Stan. Oh.

876
00:46:39,762 --> 00:46:41,662
A little higher.

877
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,325
Oh, right there.

878
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,469
Oh, no.

879
00:46:48,504 --> 00:46:50,734
( footsteps )

880
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:51,797
Come back.

881
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:53,741
Stan, can you pull her up?

882
00:46:53,776 --> 00:46:55,141
I'll try.

883
00:46:55,178 --> 00:46:57,305
( clothing ripping )

884
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,247
( sniffs )

885
00:46:59,282 --> 00:47:00,977
I should have grabbed
your hands.

886
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:04,248
You know, I'm gonna just keep
these for later... no, evidence.

887
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:05,914
That's evidence.

888
00:47:05,955 --> 00:47:09,322
Help me, I'm not wearing
any underwear!

889
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,796
Hey.

890
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,628
A perfectly good pencil.

891
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,734
Can you pull me up?

892
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,297
- ( both grunting )
- No.

893
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,534
Well, try lowering me down
a little farther.

894
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:26,735
Nadine: Okay, we'll try.

895
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:28,971
You know, I think you're gonna have to
get in the tube and grab his ankles

896
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,411
and then I'll hold onto yours.

897
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:34,143
- Are you gonna look up my skirt?
- No. Probably.

898
00:47:34,183 --> 00:47:36,310
Okay.

899
00:47:36,352 --> 00:47:38,445
Uh, ahhh!

900
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,956
I feel like a lost little doggie.

901
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:46,989
Ooh!
Ooh-oooh!

902
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,658
Oh, wait, wait a minute.
Ah, okay.

903
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:51,997
There it is. It came out.
Okay.

904
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,128
Nadine:
A little deeper.

905
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,935
A few more inches.

906
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:58,907
Yeah, that's what you
bitches always say...

907
00:47:58,941 --> 00:48:01,808
to somebody else!
Not Teddy.

908
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:03,641
Teddy... Teddy gets it done.

909
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,080
Ain't nobody out here.
Ahh!

910
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:09,912
( all grunting )

911
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:12,716
Where... where am I?

912
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:15,383
Where am I? Where...

913
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,394
- Where is this place?
- Uh, I don't know,

914
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,328
but your hands are
on my breasts.

915
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:21,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

916
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,931
- ( gasps )
- Ahh! A rat. I'll kill it!

917
00:48:32,975 --> 00:48:36,103
No, he's my friend.

918
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:43,413
Oh! Oh no, I think he's hurt.

919
00:48:48,224 --> 00:48:49,987
( Stan moaning )

920
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,830
Is that someone's ass?

921
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:05,700
Oh my God.

922
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,370
- Help me.
- Stan: Dude, you look like shit.

923
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:11,141
You're like a really messed-up
Paul Giamatti.

924
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,875
Who did this to you?

925
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:14,940
It's... it's horrible.

926
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:17,145
Vicious.

927
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:20,485
It's... it's...

928
00:49:21,524 --> 00:49:24,857
It's what?
For the love of God, tell us!

929
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:27,488
It's behind you.

930
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,665
( all screaming )

931
00:49:36,272 --> 00:49:38,297
( tombstone squeaking )

932
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:40,468
( Stan grunting )

933
00:49:51,854 --> 00:49:53,685
Ahh!

934
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:55,281
Okay.

935
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:57,485
One, two, here you go.

936
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,495
( grunts )

937
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,791
Take my hand.

938
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,162
( gasps )
Hey, a church.

939
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:05,667
Maybe there's like a priest
inside who can help us.

940
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:07,498
Let's go.

941
00:50:10,573 --> 00:50:12,871
( organ playing )

942
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,572
It worked.
He didn't follow us in.

943
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:22,075
This place is so beautiful.

944
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:29,914
Makes me wish I'd worn
my nun costume.

945
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:32,928
( "Take Me Out To the Ballgame"
playing )

946
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,891
Disturbing.

947
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,836
Jeez!

948
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:44,567
Jesus Christ.

949
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,508
You can't sneak up on me
like that, Father.

950
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:50,876
I'm not a priest.
I'm an altar boy.

951
00:50:50,913 --> 00:50:54,041
- ( organ plays scary tune )
- Almost a priest.

952
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,550
Okay.

953
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,748
Hey, you think you can maybe, like,
hide us, you know?

954
00:50:58,788 --> 00:51:00,221
Keep us safe?

955
00:51:00,256 --> 00:51:03,020
Ooh, I can hide them.

956
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,926
I mean, I can hide you...

957
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,795
but you will never be safe.

958
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:12,928
I think he likes you.

959
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:16,234
You are Van Helsing,
the monster killer.

960
00:51:16,272 --> 00:51:17,899
Oh, man, not you too.

961
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,170
Look, dude, it's... it's Stan.

962
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:23,542
It's Stan Helsing.
I'm no monster killer.

963
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:25,046
I work at a video store.

964
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:26,776
- No.
- Hey hey hey hey hey.

965
00:51:26,816 --> 00:51:29,512
I thought you said
you weren't a priest.

966
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:32,077
Almost a priest.

967
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:35,090
He is Stan Van Helsing,

968
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:38,958
descendant of
Dr. Abraham Van Helsing,

969
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,896
and salvation of all
who are trapped

970
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,899
in Stormy Night Estates.

971
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:46,561
Why do you reject the role
you were born to?

972
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:49,002
Go ahead, Stan.
Tell him some of your mottos.

973
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:50,972
Okay. Look, dude,

974
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:54,067
I just like to go with the flow.

975
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,578
What's the problem with that?
I'm no monster killer.

976
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:58,443
I'm certainly no leader.

977
00:51:58,481 --> 00:52:02,815
- I'm just here to drop off these videos.
- Shh shh shh shh!

978
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:04,615
It has been said

979
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,122
that some are born to greatness,

980
00:52:07,156 --> 00:52:09,784
some achieve greatness,

981
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:12,623
and some have greatness
thrust upon them.

982
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,790
Sweet greatness.

983
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:18,523
You sure you're not a priest?

984
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:20,899
This close... almost a priest.

985
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,838
Okay.
What's the plan?

986
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:26,239
Follow me.

987
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:29,642
Please come this way.

988
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,240
Hang your torches on the wall.

989
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:40,316
I will give you some items
that will aid you in your quest.

990
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:42,950
- Sweet.
- Yeah. Yeah, you will.

991
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:45,483
( sighs )

992
00:52:45,528 --> 00:52:50,363
 Holy chest of mystery... 

993
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:54,631
Wow.

994
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:01,136
Oh, that chest.

995
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,042
This chest.

996
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:15,084
For you, this sweet jacket.

997
00:53:15,124 --> 00:53:17,092
Yeah.

998
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:21,290
Ooh, that is really gonna bring out
the color of your eyes.

999
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,730
Oh, yeah.

1000
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:27,129
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

1001
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:29,569
Ahh! Not to be
referred to now,

1002
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:31,470
but upon meeting the enemy.

1003
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:34,772
Oh, right. 'Cause I'm sure the monsters
will wait on killing us

1004
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:36,903
while I read my monster handbook.

1005
00:53:36,946 --> 00:53:39,107
( all laughing )

1006
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:43,513
Filled with holy water...

1007
00:53:43,552 --> 00:53:45,019
- Yeah, that's mine.
- No, it's not.

1008
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:47,249
...to buy you the time.

1009
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:50,417
Wow, I wonder if Jesus used that.

1010
00:53:50,459 --> 00:53:52,427
Say, man, what about
the rest of us?

1011
00:53:52,461 --> 00:53:55,055
( sighs )

1012
00:53:55,097 --> 00:53:59,158
You will know once you use this

1013
00:53:59,201 --> 00:54:00,998
why it alters your look.

1014
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:04,564
I didn't know my look
needed altering.

1015
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:06,404
Well, you could
pluck your eyebrows.

1016
00:54:06,442 --> 00:54:08,967
And for you...

1017
00:54:10,112 --> 00:54:13,673
no explanation necessary.

1018
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:16,344
The Strip-a-lot 3000s.

1019
00:54:16,385 --> 00:54:18,046
I wanted these for Christmas.

1020
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:21,284
And for you, super one...

1021
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:25,054
- Oh!
...for when you get hungry,

1022
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:29,724
one final shameless
product placement,

1023
00:54:29,765 --> 00:54:32,461
a Fatburger for my fat
little superhero.

1024
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:34,435
Here you go, big guy.

1025
00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:40,069
Hope this doesn't turn into that dude
with the needles in his head.

1026
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:42,737
Maybe we should just camp out
here until morning, then call a taxi.

1027
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:45,975
No! How dare you reject
the opportunity

1028
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,983
that has been given you?
Be gone!

1029
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,286
God help you.

1030
00:54:54,323 --> 00:54:56,484
- ( door slams )
- Nadine: Thanks, Stan.

1031
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:58,356
- What?
- Not many people can say

1032
00:54:58,394 --> 00:55:00,487
they've actually been
thrown out of a church.

1033
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,793
Oh, boy.

1034
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,803
I still can't get over that.

1035
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,634
( music and girls moaning )

1036
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:11,833
Stan:
What's this?

1037
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:16,208
( hip hop playing )

1038
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:25,979
( all hissing )

1039
00:55:26,021 --> 00:55:27,488
Oh. What? Whoa!

1040
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:29,491
( hissing )

1041
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:32,323
All:
Oh! Ahh!

1042
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,731
- What in the...
- Teddy, you know what I'm thinking?

1043
00:55:37,766 --> 00:55:40,132
- Fantasy sequence?
- Yeah!

1044
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:41,193
Yeah!

1045
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,467
( hip hop playing )

1046
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:47,804
Both:
Mmm! Mm-hmm!

1047
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:51,569
Here you go.

1048
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,210
Whoo-hoo!

1049
00:55:58,854 --> 00:56:00,116
Here you go... bang.

1050
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,729
Whoa whoa! Pah!

1051
00:56:07,763 --> 00:56:10,357
( both laughing )

1052
00:56:14,803 --> 00:56:18,637
-  Titties titties 
-  Ass ass titties... 

1053
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:22,504
So what's you guys's names?

1054
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,639
Names? What are names?
Don't tell us your name.

1055
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:28,445
Tell us... tell us your
stripper names.

1056
00:56:28,484 --> 00:56:31,146
We are the brides of Dracula.

1057
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:34,054
Well, I hope he's out of
town on business. Ha ha!

1058
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:36,148
Damn!

1059
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,057
How much for a lap dance?

1060
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:44,191
Right here in your hole.
Look at those toes.

1061
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,700
What is your name?

1062
00:56:45,734 --> 00:56:47,634
Stan.

1063
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:51,137
( sing-song )
Sta... Stan...

1064
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:53,232
Helsing.

1065
00:56:53,275 --> 00:56:54,799
( gasps )

1066
00:56:54,843 --> 00:56:58,074
 Stan Helsing. 

1067
00:56:58,113 --> 00:57:01,344
Stan Helsing?
Don't you mean Van Helsing?

1068
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:03,442
No no no,
it's Stan Helsing.

1069
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:04,679
( record screeches to halt )

1070
00:57:06,355 --> 00:57:08,289
Hey, all right.
That's for you.

1071
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:10,121
- We're outta here.
- What do you mean you're out of here?

1072
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:12,024
- Teddy: What's wrong?
- Wait, what?

1073
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,688
Baby...

1074
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:16,163
Come on!

1075
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:18,428
Hey. Wait... wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1076
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:20,765
l... I wanted to show you something.

1077
00:57:20,803 --> 00:57:23,499
Say, this is a fantasy.
You don't walk out on a fantasy like that.

1078
00:57:25,374 --> 00:57:30,277
Man, the next time three fine womans
with their breasteses exposed

1079
00:57:30,312 --> 00:57:33,372
ask you if your name
is Van Helsing, the answer is yes!

1080
00:57:33,415 --> 00:57:36,248
( women clearing throats )

1081
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,222
Oh, hey.
We were, uh...

1082
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,554
doing a little, uh...

1083
00:57:42,591 --> 00:57:45,958
- uh, recon.
- That's all. What's that up there?

1084
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:49,362
- Uh, about a 2"x30"?
- That's a 2"x30".

1085
00:57:49,965 --> 00:57:51,523
I have to admit,
as a fellow professional,

1086
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,431
those dancers were pretty good.

1087
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:55,937
Yeah, I think that one girl
was ambidextrous.

1088
00:57:55,971 --> 00:57:59,372
Wow, I'd give my right arm
to be ambidextrous.

1089
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:01,876
You know, all this monster killing
is bullshit.

1090
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:05,243
Our first plan should be to escape.
We need to find the east gate.

1091
00:58:05,347 --> 00:58:06,814
- I'm with you.
- Me too.

1092
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:08,612
Me too.
It's anonymous!

1093
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,449
Hey, there's a guy.
Maybe he can help us. Hey, sir?

1094
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:13,216
Do you know how to get to the east...

1095
00:58:13,255 --> 00:58:15,246
( all scream )

1096
00:58:16,258 --> 00:58:17,919
( powers on )

1097
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:38,847
Both:
Oh God! Ahhh!

1098
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:42,483
 I can picture you naked... 

1099
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:44,509
( song continues )

1100
00:58:44,553 --> 00:58:48,512
You shall not pass!

1101
00:58:48,557 --> 00:58:50,855
 I can picture you naked... 

1102
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:54,692
( yipping )

1103
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,823
 I can picture you naked... 

1104
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:02,230
How come we're not losing him?

1105
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,172
Hey, look, a police station!

1106
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,272
Police! What... what?

1107
00:59:14,316 --> 00:59:16,614
Man, this is just an old movie set.

1108
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:18,882
You know, besides the fact
that we've been in constant danger

1109
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:21,583
from the moment we got here,
this town is really cute.

1110
00:59:21,623 --> 00:59:22,954
( echoing voices )
Shh shh shh shh.

1111
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:26,324
- Wait, guys, shh! Listen.
- ( echoing )

1112
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:29,627
- Shh shh shh shh.
- You guys hear that?

1113
00:59:30,632 --> 00:59:32,725
( growls )

1114
00:59:32,768 --> 00:59:35,259
- That's him, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.

1115
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,670
- Ahh!
- ( all screaming )

1116
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:43,073
Maybe we should run inside
one of these houses.

1117
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,603
Great idea. Then what?
Should we hide up in the attic?

1118
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:48,480
Maybe we should try hiding in this house.
I'm tired of running.

1119
00:59:48,517 --> 00:59:50,883
( thunder rumbles )

1120
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:54,422
Let's do it.

1121
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:58,188
- ( door creaking )
- ( thunder rumbling )

1122
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:07,964
Well, in case he saw us
come in here.

1123
01:00:08,003 --> 01:00:09,903
( all screaming )

1124
01:00:09,938 --> 01:00:12,463
He saw us. He saw us!

1125
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,305
He saw us!

1126
01:00:14,343 --> 01:00:15,901
Run!

1127
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,710
Holy moly!

1128
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,240
Maybe try this one.

1129
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:26,414
Looks like a bathroom.

1130
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:28,889
( making flatulence sounds )

1131
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:30,824
Is it a bathroom?

1132
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,885
Look, there's a pay phone.

1133
01:00:36,131 --> 01:00:38,326
It takes tokens.
Come on, come on.

1134
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:39,732
( phone dinging )

1135
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:41,633
Operator. Op...

1136
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,365
( sexy music playing )

1137
01:00:45,974 --> 01:00:47,464
Hi there, baby.

1138
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:51,605
Anything you need to
get off your mind?

1139
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,979
I think that one has
a double meaning, Stan.

1140
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:56,780
Woman:
We'll do whatever you want.

1141
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,585
We don't want to jerk you around.

1142
01:01:00,622 --> 01:01:02,590
Yeah, that one has
a double meaning too.

1143
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:06,720
( all moaning )

1144
01:01:08,597 --> 01:01:11,862
- That's pretty specific.
- Oh!

1145
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,834
I think I just got off.

1146
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:15,496
Oh.

1147
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:19,871
That's okay.
That could happen to anyone,

1148
01:01:19,908 --> 01:01:22,138
even Stan.

1149
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:24,771
- ( unzips )
- Oh, little Stan!

1150
01:01:24,813 --> 01:01:27,543
- ( women moaning )
- Yeah.

1151
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:28,845
Stan!

1152
01:01:28,884 --> 01:01:32,183
- Woman #1: More cream, Stan.
- Woman #2: Yeah.

1153
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,212
Sorry.
Can I call you back?

1154
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:36,053
Mm-hmm.

1155
01:01:36,091 --> 01:01:37,854
( music ends )

1156
01:01:37,893 --> 01:01:40,225
- We should try upstairs.
- ( unzipping )

1157
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,562
Do you take debit cards?

1158
01:01:46,301 --> 01:01:49,134
This is good. Come on.
Move the bed!

1159
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:51,969
- Block the door.
- ( all groaning )

1160
01:01:57,746 --> 01:02:00,544
( sighs )

1161
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:01,947
Oh!

1162
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,844
Wow, I can...

1163
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,517
barely keep my eyes...

1164
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:13,016
( snoring )

1165
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,537
( bicycle bell dings )

1166
01:02:33,882 --> 01:02:35,907
Um...

1167
01:02:39,788 --> 01:02:41,653
Oh, Jeez!

1168
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:48,627
Guys...

1169
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:51,189
we did it. We did it!

1170
01:02:51,233 --> 01:02:53,895
- ( laughing )
- Yeah, we did it!

1171
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,767
- We did it!
- Let's go!

1172
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:57,271
Teddy, I don't know about you,

1173
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,001
but I haven't slept
that well in years.

1174
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,065
Yeah, whatever!

1175
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:03,043
I know I ruined our night,
and I'm sorry,

1176
01:03:03,078 --> 01:03:05,706
but since it's daylight,
I'd really like to drop off these videos.

1177
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:07,874
Can we get some breakfast?
I'm starving.

1178
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,318
- That's so weird.
- Not so weird!

1179
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:16,347
( screaming )

1180
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:17,881
Ahhh!

1181
01:03:17,926 --> 01:03:20,827
- ( all screaming )
- Ha ha ha ha!

1182
01:03:23,932 --> 01:03:27,868
Ahh!
Can you say "bitch slap"?

1183
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:30,433
( all gasping )

1184
01:03:30,472 --> 01:03:32,463
- Man, I had this nightmare.
- Me too.

1185
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:34,498
The guy had, like, a Swiss Army knife
on his hand.

1186
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:37,512
- And he smacked us.
- Across the face.

1187
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:39,776
When did you change into
a nurse's outfit?

1188
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:41,646
Oh, in my dream.

1189
01:03:41,683 --> 01:03:44,311
Well, we can't fall asleep again
because that's when he'll kill us.

1190
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:46,844
There's a TV.
Let's put that on.

1191
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,991
We'll keep you posted
on this election.

1192
01:03:52,027 --> 01:03:55,656
And in local news, tonight police
are looking for this man.

1193
01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:57,722
His name is Finbar Ohara,

1194
01:03:57,766 --> 01:04:00,428
an escaped murderer also
known as The Butcher.

1195
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,027
Hey, that's the guy we picked up.

1196
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,470
A busload of Linwood
special-education students

1197
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:08,067
found him lying on New Road after he had
been thrown from a moving vehicle.

1198
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,340
He wasn't thrown.
He let go.

1199
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:13,678
Once inside the bus,
he turned on his good Samaritans,

1200
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:17,116
killed the driver and all
but one of the special-ed students.

1201
01:04:17,152 --> 01:04:19,347
The lone surviving
special-education student

1202
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:22,414
described the killer
as screaming and bossy.

1203
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:24,186
I didn't think he was bossy.

1204
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:27,684
In other news, a Margate couple
was arrested this evening

1205
01:04:27,729 --> 01:04:30,630
for selling pornography that
was shot surreptitiously

1206
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:33,032
while people used the bathroom at
the couple's gas station.

1207
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:37,732
Chanel 5 News was there exclusively
when the bust went down.

1208
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:42,403
Some of the footage was shot
as recently as this evening.

1209
01:04:42,444 --> 01:04:44,378
Maybe we'll get residuals.

1210
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:47,849
And finally tonight,
the death of a local hero.

1211
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:51,284
Sammy Boy was the victim
of a hit-and-run accident.

1212
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:53,514
Viewers might remember
Sammy Boy

1213
01:04:53,555 --> 01:04:55,523
from a story we did
a couple of months ago

1214
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:57,718
when Sammy Boy rescued
several children

1215
01:04:57,759 --> 01:04:59,750
from a fire at
the Bentner Orphanage.

1216
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:02,958
Sammy Boy's owner was too distraught
to speak to us on camera,

1217
01:05:02,998 --> 01:05:05,933
but he said he vowed to
get those who killed Sammy Boy

1218
01:05:05,967 --> 01:05:08,435
and "butcher them like pigs."

1219
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,994
- Turn it off.
- That's all for tonight.

1220
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:11,699
I'm Zorianna Kit.

1221
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:21,941
Well, there he is,
waiting for us.

1222
01:05:21,983 --> 01:05:25,077
Well, I'm tired of
waiting to be slaughtered.

1223
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,145
I'm gonna do something about it.

1224
01:05:29,224 --> 01:05:30,885
( all scream )

1225
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,292
- ( unsheaths sword )
- Stan, wait.

1226
01:05:42,337 --> 01:05:43,998
Ahh!

1227
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:47,133
No one messes with
me and my friends!

1228
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,771
- ( girl screams )
- Hey!

1229
01:05:51,813 --> 01:05:54,805
- He's beating up Timmy, our goalie.
- Ah, stop!

1230
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,545
Let's get him!

1231
01:05:57,652 --> 01:05:59,176
( Timmy moaning )

1232
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,621
- Get back here!
- Come on!

1233
01:06:01,656 --> 01:06:05,057
( all shouting )

1234
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:07,618
Ow! Ow!

1235
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,231
Teddy:
That's great, Stan.

1236
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:17,136
We went from one crazy hockey
player trying to kill us to a whole team.

1237
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:19,402
Well, that's 'cause I don't
like getting involved.

1238
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:23,070
We need to get out of here, okay?
We're trapped in here like sitting ducks.

1239
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:36,751
( pop music blaring )

1240
01:06:38,827 --> 01:06:42,024
- Oh!
- Ahhh!

1241
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:43,587
( grunting )

1242
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:48,165
And cut.

1243
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:50,296
His cock is green.

1244
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:53,102
( music continues )

1245
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:55,132
His fangs are starting
to leave marks.

1246
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,701
What's that smell?

1247
01:06:56,745 --> 01:06:58,406
Man: It's a combination of
tanning oil and poop.

1248
01:06:58,446 --> 01:07:00,937
Oh, what the hell is this?

1249
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:04,042
We're making a gay porno.
That's what we do here

1250
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:06,747
at Cornhole Pictures.

1251
01:07:06,788 --> 01:07:07,948
Cornhole Pictures?

1252
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:10,423
Hey, how did these
looky-loos get on my set?

1253
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,858
- Get these freaks out of here.
- Hey, man, we're going.

1254
01:07:12,894 --> 01:07:15,658
We're just trying to, like,
get through this house

1255
01:07:15,697 --> 01:07:18,689
and then we're trying to drop off
these videos. Then we'll go on our way.

1256
01:07:23,538 --> 01:07:25,699
"Grazing Ryan's Privates"?

1257
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,369
What?

1258
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:29,775
That's a classic.

1259
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:35,443
Oh, he got lube on the bag.
( sniffs )

1260
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:37,383
He got lube on...

1261
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:39,979
- Why do you have that?
- I'm just dropping them off, man.

1262
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:41,852
Get 'em out of here.

1263
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:44,654
Who would have thought that
Stormy Night Pictures

1264
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,524
is now the home to porn?

1265
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:49,553
- ( dog cooing )
- Oh, you guys.

1266
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,793
- Aw.
- All: Aww!

1267
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:53,994
- How cute.
- Oh, little cutie!

1268
01:07:54,035 --> 01:07:57,368
- Aw!
- Oh, you baby!

1269
01:07:57,405 --> 01:08:00,806
He kind of looks like that dog
we hit on the road.

1270
01:08:00,842 --> 01:08:03,242
Man:
You mean Sammy Boy?

1271
01:08:03,278 --> 01:08:05,473
That's Sammy Boy's son.

1272
01:08:05,513 --> 01:08:08,505
- This is Sammy Boy!
- ( barking )

1273
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:10,313
- Whoa!
- Ah!

1274
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:13,947
Hi, Sammy Boy.
Looking good.

1275
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,184
- ( barking )
- Nice job.

1276
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:17,589
You barely notice.

1277
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:20,823
He hasn't been the same
since you hit him with your car.

1278
01:08:20,862 --> 01:08:24,298
He can't eat.
Now he's starving.

1279
01:08:24,332 --> 01:08:26,527
Have you tried the Ensure?

1280
01:08:26,568 --> 01:08:29,696
They're these little milkshakes.
We gave them to my grandfather one time

1281
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,330
when he couldn't poop.
It was awful...

1282
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,863
Sammy needs meat!

1283
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,069
There was a Sizzler
that we just passed

1284
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:37,340
- on the way over here.
- Raw meat.

1285
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:40,439
- You don't have to cook it.
- ( growling )

1286
01:08:40,482 --> 01:08:43,679
- Anybody else got any big bright ideas?
- Mia: No.

1287
01:08:43,718 --> 01:08:45,549
But I have this.

1288
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:46,884
Teddy:
What you got there?

1289
01:08:48,356 --> 01:08:51,814
( blowing dog whistle )

1290
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,226
That's fantastic, Mia.
Keep doing that.

1291
01:08:54,262 --> 01:08:55,786
You're controlling him!

1292
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:58,856
You haven't seen the last of us!

1293
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,197
( whistle stops )

1294
01:09:00,235 --> 01:09:03,796
You guys, I'm like those guys
in Vegas with the tigers...

1295
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:05,305
Sigmund & Freud.

1296
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,467
You know, we have so many
people after us,

1297
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:09,773
if we don't get to a landline soon
and call for a ride,

1298
01:09:09,811 --> 01:09:11,472
we're not gonna make it
through this night alive.

1299
01:09:11,513 --> 01:09:13,413
Too bad there's just
that cab phone.

1300
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:14,710
What cab phone?

1301
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:17,013
The one in the town
square that we passed.

1302
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,519
Ahhh!

1303
01:09:18,553 --> 01:09:21,420
( wind whistling )

1304
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:23,651
Do you guys hear that?

1305
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,286
All right. All right, thanks.

1306
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,989
( sniffs )

1307
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:32,629
So I called the dispatcher.

1308
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:34,965
Cab'll be here in 20 minutes.

1309
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:36,937
And did you tell him
to call the police?

1310
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:39,668
On who?
Us for killing that hero dog?

1311
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,107
Yeah, he's got a point.

1312
01:09:41,142 --> 01:09:43,110
- So are we still going to this party?
- Party?

1313
01:09:43,144 --> 01:09:45,271
I just want to go home.

1314
01:09:45,313 --> 01:09:47,008
We're not home yet.

1315
01:09:47,048 --> 01:09:50,040
( all grunting )

1316
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:53,184
Barker:
Programs!

1317
01:09:53,221 --> 01:09:55,155
Get your programs right here!

1318
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,317
Get them while they're hot...
red hot!

1319
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,760
Here you go, kind sir.
$1 please. Thank you kindly.

1320
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:04,088
- Well, that can't be good.
- We are so screwed.

1321
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,802
I can't believe I'm gonna die
dressed as a nurse.

1322
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,930
You're not gonna die
dressed as a nurse.

1323
01:10:10,972 --> 01:10:12,530
So I have time to change?

1324
01:10:12,574 --> 01:10:15,372
That's great, because I have this
really cute little Girl Scout uniform...

1325
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:18,208
- We're going to plan B.
- All: What's plan B?

1326
01:10:18,246 --> 01:10:20,214
- Run!
- Ahhh!

1327
01:10:20,248 --> 01:10:23,615
- ( techno music playing )
- ( all screaming )

1328
01:10:42,103 --> 01:10:44,003
Damn, those guys are fast.

1329
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:45,939
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared, little lady.

1330
01:10:47,809 --> 01:10:51,802
- What's that on my hip?
- Nothing but a little goodbye hug.

1331
01:10:51,846 --> 01:10:54,747
Stan, I hate to admit it,
but I'm really scared too.

1332
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:58,310
Well, I'm not scared.
I just don't know what to do.

1333
01:10:58,353 --> 01:11:00,014
Is this how it all ends?

1334
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,489
( gunshot )

1335
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:05,459
No, it's not how it all ends!

1336
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:08,587
We're gonna settle this the way
we settle everything around here

1337
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,825
ever since the fire
destroyed our town.

1338
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:12,093
How's that?

1339
01:11:12,133 --> 01:11:15,796
- Utilizing the ancient art of...
- Karaoke!

1340
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:17,930
( gongs )

1341
01:11:19,207 --> 01:11:22,574
All right, freaks.
Tonight you will be given a chance

1342
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:26,341
to beat these monsters in an event
that plays to your strengths...

1343
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:28,508
- singing karaoke.
- Bam!

1344
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,747
Now in case you don't know it,
here's what's at stake:

1345
01:11:31,786 --> 01:11:34,016
If Stan and the gang wins,

1346
01:11:34,055 --> 01:11:37,855
they get to go home alive
and the monsters must leave our town

1347
01:11:37,892 --> 01:11:39,450
and never come back!

1348
01:11:39,494 --> 01:11:42,486
( townspeople cheering )

1349
01:11:43,531 --> 01:11:46,557
Now if the monsters win,

1350
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:49,900
they get to mutilate and kill
Stan and Nadine

1351
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,462
and Teddy and Mia.

1352
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:54,532
- No, that's "boo."
- You said "Stan"?

1353
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,942
First up, the monsters.

1354
01:11:56,978 --> 01:12:01,108
( "YMCA" playing )

1355
01:12:08,256 --> 01:12:11,657
 Hey, Stan, there's no need
to feel down 

1356
01:12:11,693 --> 01:12:13,854
 We said, " Hey, Stan 

1357
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:15,590
 Pick yourself off the ground" 

1358
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,461
 We said, " Hey, Stan 

1359
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,364
 'Cause you're in a new town 

1360
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,800
 There's no need to be 

1361
01:12:21,836 --> 01:12:23,633
 Unhappy 

1362
01:12:23,671 --> 01:12:26,868
 Hey, Stan,
there's this thing you should know" 

1363
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:30,674
 We said, " Hey, Stan,
when we're done with this show 

1364
01:12:30,712 --> 01:12:34,148
 You can stay here
and I'm sure you will find 

1365
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:39,017
 That we're here to rape
and kill you" 

1366
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:44,820
 We're here to kill S-T-A-N 

1367
01:12:44,859 --> 01:12:48,625
 It's fun to kill S-T-A-N 

1368
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:51,632
 Our intentions are real 

1369
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:53,600
 And you can't make a deal 

1370
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:56,934
 This will be your last meal 

1371
01:12:56,971 --> 01:12:58,996
 Hey, Stan 

1372
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,871
 Are you listening to me? 

1373
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,604
 We said, " Hey, Stan 

1374
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:04,703
 Who did you think you'd be?" 

1375
01:13:04,746 --> 01:13:08,443
 We said, " Hey, Stan,
we can crush all your dreams 

1376
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:13,113
 Don't think you can escape us." 

1377
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,759
Kay: Well, I hate to say it,
but great job, monsters.

1378
01:13:20,795 --> 01:13:24,322
Not bad for a bunch
of murderous heathens.

1379
01:13:24,365 --> 01:13:27,892
But Stan and the gang are
gonna give it a shot.

1380
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:31,269
( all cheering )

1381
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:38,174
( "I Don't Want To Go Home"
playing )

1382
01:13:51,259 --> 01:13:54,751
 Well, I know that it's getting late 

1383
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:58,129
 But I just wanna go home 

1384
01:13:59,534 --> 01:14:02,901
 I'm in no hurry, baby,
time can wait 

1385
01:14:02,937 --> 01:14:06,031
 'Cause I just
wanna go home 

1386
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,776
 Listen to the man sing his song 

1387
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:14,009
 I just wanna go home 

1388
01:14:15,283 --> 01:14:18,616
 I don't mind if it takes
all night long 

1389
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:22,111
 'Cause I just wanna go home 

1390
01:14:22,156 --> 01:14:26,991
 Listen, baby, I know
we had to try 

1391
01:14:27,028 --> 01:14:30,862
 To reach up and
touch the sky, baby 

1392
01:14:30,898 --> 01:14:34,334
 Whatever happened to
you and I? 

1393
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,998
 But I just wanna go home 

1394
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:41,941
 Lord, look at how
the people stare 

1395
01:14:41,976 --> 01:14:44,968
 Said I just wanna go home 

1396
01:14:46,447 --> 01:14:49,780
 In their minds
I know they've all been there 

1397
01:14:49,817 --> 01:14:53,218
 I just wanna go home 

1398
01:14:54,322 --> 01:14:57,723
 I know the words to
this song are real 

1399
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:00,785
 But, oh, I just wanna go home 

1400
01:15:01,963 --> 01:15:05,421
 I know he's talking about
the way I feel 

1401
01:15:05,466 --> 01:15:08,333
 And I just wanna go home 

1402
01:15:08,369 --> 01:15:10,098
 Listen, baby 

1403
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:13,869
 I know we had to try 

1404
01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:17,708
 To reach up and touch
the sky, baby 

1405
01:15:17,745 --> 01:15:21,203
 Whatever happened to you and I? 

1406
01:15:21,249 --> 01:15:25,015
 But I just wanna go home. 

1407
01:15:27,555 --> 01:15:31,548
( all cheering )

1408
01:15:37,832 --> 01:15:42,030
Tough. It's tough... tough call.

1409
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,595
Now you know how it works...

1410
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:46,607
the town decides.

1411
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:49,838
How many of you think that
Stan and his friends

1412
01:15:49,877 --> 01:15:51,276
were the best?

1413
01:15:51,312 --> 01:15:54,406
( all cheering )

1414
01:15:57,285 --> 01:16:00,015
Yay!

1415
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:03,888
Now how many of you felt that
the monsters were the best?

1416
01:16:03,925 --> 01:16:05,688
( monsters cheering )

1417
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,161
( monster sighs )

1418
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,528
- ( shudders )
- Aw, well,

1419
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:11,998
I'm sorry, monsters.

1420
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:15,935
They're admittedly a little biased,
you understand.

1421
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,732
( growling )

1422
01:16:19,807 --> 01:16:23,573
Wait wait wait.
You heard Kay. We won fair and square.

1423
01:16:23,611 --> 01:16:26,478
( monsters laughing )

1424
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,080
There is no fair and square.

1425
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:39,025
Uh, Stan?

1426
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,585
Do something, Stan.
Do something.

1427
01:16:41,629 --> 01:16:43,859
I'm gonna bring out the hardware.

1428
01:16:43,898 --> 01:16:47,197
( toy gun squeaking )

1429
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:52,738
- Do you need a hand?
- No, I got it.

1430
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:56,301
Ooh, I got it.

1431
01:16:56,344 --> 01:16:59,677
Ahhh!

1432
01:17:06,187 --> 01:17:09,054
( all sighing )

1433
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:11,251
Well, that was
completely ineffective.

1434
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:13,487
Hmm.

1435
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:16,224
l... I feel like I should tell you, um...

1436
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:19,358
I forgot to mention that
I got a little thirsty earlier,

1437
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,267
so I refilled your weapon

1438
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,033
with the water hose
from outside.

1439
01:17:27,008 --> 01:17:30,535
- You drank the holy water?
- It was delicious!

1440
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:33,843
Could have used this information
a minute ago.

1441
01:17:38,085 --> 01:17:40,417
Ahh.

1442
01:17:42,123 --> 01:17:43,886
- ( laughs )
- ( wood clanking )

1443
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:46,120
The scroll!

1444
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:54,231
Great, it's a joke.

1445
01:17:54,268 --> 01:17:56,361
I thought it'd be more of a clue.

1446
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:59,237
I think you're both right...
it's a joke and a clue

1447
01:17:59,273 --> 01:18:01,867
on how to deal with
these monsters.

1448
01:18:01,909 --> 01:18:03,877
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it either.

1449
01:18:03,911 --> 01:18:06,209
No, guys, I think I can read this.

1450
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:09,410
Yeah, I think it says that
the monsters have weaknesses.

1451
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,611
( monsters laughing )

1452
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:17,614
Okay okay, Stan Helsing!

1453
01:18:17,658 --> 01:18:19,455
You've had your fun.

1454
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:23,089
Now get ready to
taste your own blood!

1455
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:25,291
- Ahh!
- Ooh!

1456
01:18:27,735 --> 01:18:29,066
( all gasp )

1457
01:18:30,805 --> 01:18:33,467
Man:
There! Check it out!

1458
01:18:34,775 --> 01:18:36,402
That really hurt.

1459
01:18:36,444 --> 01:18:38,378
( all chattering )

1460
01:18:38,412 --> 01:18:42,280
You wanted me to get involved?
Well, I'm getting involved.

1461
01:18:47,755 --> 01:18:50,747
Wait, no, please.
Please please.

1462
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:52,520
- ( whip lashes )
- ( Freddy crying )

1463
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,994
I don't see how this is
gonna help, but all right.

1464
01:18:56,764 --> 01:18:59,198
Oh, not me? Okay.

1465
01:19:00,601 --> 01:19:01,863
Ow!

1466
01:19:08,175 --> 01:19:10,541
- ( crying )
- My God.

1467
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:14,878
( all laughing )

1468
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:25,459
I have no weaknesses, mortal.

1469
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:45,671
( grunting continues )

1470
01:19:47,748 --> 01:19:51,149
( all cheering )

1471
01:19:57,124 --> 01:19:59,456
We're not gonna go that easy.

1472
01:19:59,493 --> 01:20:01,984
Oh, actually, you two
have the same weakness.

1473
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,261
Teddy... condiments, please.

1474
01:20:07,301 --> 01:20:09,496
Coming right up, Stan my man!

1475
01:20:09,537 --> 01:20:12,404
( laughing ) Whoo!

1476
01:20:14,175 --> 01:20:16,075
( growling )

1477
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:19,841
Sounds like Sammy Boy finally
got his raw meat.

1478
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,906
- ( rimshot plays )
- ( all laughing )

1479
01:20:26,053 --> 01:20:28,783
Got his raw meat!

1480
01:20:28,823 --> 01:20:29,847
( laughs )

1481
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:32,757
Let's set this on shred!

1482
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:34,784
Yeah!

1483
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:37,923
- ( clicking )
- ( monster grunting )

1484
01:20:37,965 --> 01:20:39,489
( clears throat )

1485
01:20:39,533 --> 01:20:42,297
Hello? Hi.

1486
01:20:42,336 --> 01:20:45,772
Ha. Looks like no one's
getting blown tonight.

1487
01:20:45,806 --> 01:20:47,774
- ( all laughing )
- Ahhh!

1488
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,876
And what's my weakness?

1489
01:20:51,912 --> 01:20:55,439
- Dude, you're a doll.
- ( whistle blows )

1490
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:58,748
Announcer over radio:
Go for the goal!

1491
01:20:58,786 --> 01:21:02,222
Blue 69,
hut hut hut!

1492
01:21:03,724 --> 01:21:06,124
Announcer:
Here's the kick!

1493
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,856
In the air.
It's good!

1494
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:11,990
You did it!
You got rid of the monsters!

1495
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:27,047
Your cab is waiting
for you outside.

1496
01:21:27,081 --> 01:21:28,708
Here.

1497
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,684
You've earned it,

1498
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:33,914
Stan Van Helsing.

1499
01:21:47,868 --> 01:21:50,268
( kissing )

1500
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:55,170
Freak.

1501
01:21:55,209 --> 01:21:58,076
( all cheering )

1502
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:02,974
Come back! Come back!

1503
01:22:03,017 --> 01:22:04,951
We need you.

1504
01:22:04,985 --> 01:22:07,283
( crowd cheering )

1505
01:22:29,043 --> 01:22:32,410
Thanks for visiting
Stormy Night Estates!

1506
01:22:32,446 --> 01:22:34,607
- ( phone ringing )
- West gate.

1507
01:22:34,648 --> 01:22:37,412
- ( mumbled speech )
- An ice-cream truck? That's a new one.

1508
01:22:37,451 --> 01:22:39,919
No, I can't say I've ever seen

1509
01:22:39,954 --> 01:22:42,787
a Rocket Sucker with balls.

1510
01:22:44,725 --> 01:22:48,183
Oh, hey look, it's the mask
that altar boy gave you.

1511
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,527
Oh. Mask.

1512
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:55,262
So does it alter how I look?

1513
01:22:55,302 --> 01:22:58,794
I think he meant it would alter
how you look at things.

1514
01:22:58,839 --> 01:23:00,329
Oh.

1515
01:23:02,309 --> 01:23:05,972
( hawk screeching )

1516
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:11,718
Stop the cab, please!

1517
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,838
Yeah!

1518
01:23:44,718 --> 01:23:47,312
You know what I'm thinking?

1519
01:23:47,354 --> 01:23:49,982
- Lap dance?
- Well, I was gonna say a kiss,

1520
01:23:50,024 --> 01:23:52,254
but we can skip right to
the lap dance if you want to.

1521
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:53,692
( hip-hop music playing )

1522
01:23:53,727 --> 01:23:56,093
Oh my oh...

1523
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:59,031
Oh, I'd better make sure you're okay.

1524
01:23:59,066 --> 01:24:02,092
Oh, no, you're so sick.

1525
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:04,331
Oh, you're so sick.

1526
01:24:04,371 --> 01:24:05,998
Whoo!

1527
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,905
Welcome to my world, bitch.

1528
01:24:12,379 --> 01:24:16,213
( hip-hop song playing )

1529
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:18,912
 Take it one time 

1530
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:20,887
 Yeah yeah, uh-huh 

1531
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:24,220
 Do we gotta say it again?
Ain't nothing goin' to change 

1532
01:24:24,258 --> 01:24:26,488
 What we got is lockdown 

1533
01:24:26,527 --> 01:24:28,392
 We run the game
and that's right 

1534
01:24:28,429 --> 01:24:30,522
 People wanna get on down
and get down 

1535
01:24:30,564 --> 01:24:32,725
 People wanna
let loose and let loose 

1536
01:24:32,766 --> 01:24:35,326
 'Cause you know
that the beat is sick 

1537
01:24:35,369 --> 01:24:37,166
 Make you wanna
get down with it 

1538
01:24:37,204 --> 01:24:38,569
 Yeah, yo 

1539
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:41,268
 I eliminated the middle man,
the child genius 

1540
01:24:41,308 --> 01:24:43,674
 Growing up with a fan
like nothing in the middle, man 

1541
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,872
 I gotta do this for
my daughter and my little man... 

1542
01:24:45,913 --> 01:24:47,881
Oh, yeah, squeeze your face.

1543
01:24:47,915 --> 01:24:49,746
Who's a bad boy?
Who's a bad...

1544
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:52,115
Yeah! Yeah, you're my bad boy!

1545
01:24:52,152 --> 01:24:53,176
You're my bad boy!

1546
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:54,744
 Everybody can do it,
you know Scribble can 

1547
01:24:54,788 --> 01:24:56,949
 Went from the top to the bottom
to the top again 

1548
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:58,185
 And ain't no stopping him 

1549
01:24:58,225 --> 01:25:00,125
 'Cause he the one to check
my studio tan, man 

1550
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,593
 I ain't seen the sun
in five weeks... 

1551
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,927
Hey, Mom.
That's right.

1552
01:25:03,964 --> 01:25:06,194
I'm in a stripper costume.

1553
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:09,669
I'm giving a lap dance. I've done
dirty dirty things in this movie.

1554
01:25:09,703 --> 01:25:11,193
You're gonna be so proud of me.

1555
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:12,296
 Where that music coming from? 

1556
01:25:12,339 --> 01:25:14,102
 From my heart, just a start,
there's a reason... 

1557
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:16,769
Wait, are there any
black people in this movie?

1558
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:19,711
Wait, we're in it.
( laughs )

1559
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:21,112
I'm in it!

1560
01:25:21,148 --> 01:25:24,606
 Tick tickety, don't quit,
but do we gotta say it again? 

1561
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:26,176
 Ain't nothing going to change 

1562
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:28,711
 What we got is lockdown 

1563
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:31,384
-  We run the game... 
- Take this right, take this right!

1564
01:25:31,425 --> 01:25:33,791
 People want to get on down
and get down... 

1565
01:25:33,827 --> 01:25:35,488
This is Mockingbird Lane.

1566
01:25:35,529 --> 01:25:37,861
- ( giggling )
- It takes...

1567
01:25:37,898 --> 01:25:40,389
- One more time.
- Do it again, do it again.

1568
01:25:40,434 --> 01:25:43,528
Do it again.
Here we go. Shut up.

1569
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:46,300
Shut up. Here we go.

1570
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:50,037
Take this right, take this right!
Oh.

1571
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:52,910
Ahh.

1572
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:55,006
One more.

1573
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,347
It's so stupid!

1574
01:25:57,384 --> 01:26:01,252
Stan Helsing?
I thought you said Van Helsing.

1575
01:26:01,288 --> 01:26:04,689
Next thing I know you're
gonna tell me that's not Superman.

1576
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:07,558
( laughing )

1577
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:12,156
 Get you high but too much
and you might choke on the words 

1578
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:14,224
 Please stop frontin' like
you're taking the crown 

1579
01:26:14,268 --> 01:26:16,736
 You're really waitin' around
till I'm hingin' the town 

1580
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:18,761
 Oh! Tick tock, you don't stop 

1581
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:21,070
 To the... tick tock, you don't stop 

1582
01:26:21,108 --> 01:26:23,269
 To the...
tick tock, you don't stop 

1583
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,141
 To the... tick tickety,
you don't quit 

1584
01:26:25,179 --> 01:26:26,806
 But do we gotta say it again? 

1585
01:26:26,847 --> 01:26:28,508
 Ain't nothin' going to change 

1586
01:26:28,549 --> 01:26:30,779
 What we got is lockdown 

1587
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:32,979
 We run the game
and that's right 

1588
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,284
 People wanna get on down
and get down 

1589
01:26:35,322 --> 01:26:37,290
 People wanna
let loose and let loose 

1590
01:26:37,324 --> 01:26:39,952
 But you know
that the beat is sick 

1591
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:41,689
 You make me want to
get down with it 

1592
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,993
 That's right,
straight running the game full stop 

1593
01:26:44,031 --> 01:26:45,828
 Third verse, catch it
fresh with the free flow 

1594
01:26:45,866 --> 01:26:47,993
 Hands up in the air,
put 'em up for my people 

1595
01:26:48,035 --> 01:26:50,094
 If you're still wondering about
the numbers that we sow 

1596
01:26:50,137 --> 01:26:52,503
 Just bought a house, motherfucker,
it's free ho 

1597
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:54,769
 Not Lisa Loeb
but got the #1 single 

1598
01:26:54,808 --> 01:26:56,867
 Come a long way from
them radio jingles 

1599
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:59,003
 Had to hustle and flow,
keep that on the d-low 

1600
01:26:59,046 --> 01:27:01,139
 Stay humble, showing off's
not in my "stilo" 

1601
01:27:01,181 --> 01:27:03,445
 We just sitting together now,
sittin' in the king's throne 

1602
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:05,782
 Even got coated platinum
buttons on my ringtone 

1603
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:08,014
 Producing and continuin' to jam,
bringing my team home 

1604
01:27:08,055 --> 01:27:10,216
 Peter Jackson can now
witness King Kong 

1605
01:27:10,257 --> 01:27:12,452
 Looking forward for daylight,
Chinese playing ping-pong 

1606
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,961
 Laughing at the competition,
whacking at wind songs 

1607
01:27:14,995 --> 01:27:17,020
 Keep it poppin', I ain't stoppin',
won't be long 

1608
01:27:17,064 --> 01:27:19,225
 Ride it to the top
like I ain't even been gone 

1609
01:27:19,266 --> 01:27:21,097
 Tick tock, you don't stop 

1610
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:23,296
 To the... tick tock, you don't stop 

1611
01:27:23,337 --> 01:27:25,567
 To the...
tick tock, you don't stop 

1612
01:27:25,606 --> 01:27:27,699
 To the... tick tickety,
you don't quit 

1613
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:29,106
 But do we gotta say it again? 

1614
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:30,735
 Ain't nothin' going to change 

1615
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:33,110
 What we got is lockdown 

1616
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:35,138
 We run the game
and that's right 

1617
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:37,446
 People wanna get on down
and get down 

1618
01:27:37,484 --> 01:27:39,577
 People wanna
let loose and let loose 

1619
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:42,111
 But you know
that the beat is sick 

1620
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:43,817
 You make me want to
get down with it

 The way she move her neck

 Ordinary girl

01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:15,477
 Watch her back it up

 You're from Costa Rica
and you smell exotic 

1662
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:52,514
 Like a gin and tonic
