1
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,429
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,810
(crows cawing)

3
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,438
(woodpecker pecking)

4
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,982
So tell me again
why we're awake.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,944
Come on. Where are you
gonna see this in the city?

6
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,113
Uh, nowhere. That's why
I choose to Iive in the city

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,823
and not in the middle
of the woods.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,409
- I need a coffee.
- I think there's a Starbucks up here,

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,495
- so we're going to be good.
- Starbucks? Are you serious?

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,210
- You got to admit this is amazing.
- No. I have to admit that we're Iost

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,295
- and we shouldn't be awake.
- Okay. We are not lost.

12
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,927
Do you hear that?

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,598
- Nope. Nothing.
- Yeah, exactly.

14
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,642
Where are all the birds?
It's really quiet.

15
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,313
I don't know, babe.
Maybe they're still sleeping.

16
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,899
Like we should be.
Come on, Iet's take a nap.

17
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,193
- No. We're not taking a nap. Come on.
- Just a teeny tiny one.

18
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,362
Just a Iittle further, okay?

19
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,203
- I need a minute. Nature calls.
- AII right. Just hurry up, babe.

20
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,582
- We got to keep moving.
- You have someplace to be?

21
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,687
(flies buzzing)

22
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,988
Oh, my God.

23
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,912
- Hey, Dale--
- Erica, stop! Don't come down here.

24
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,705
- What? Why?
- Just stop!

25
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,749
Erica: Dale, you're scaring me.
What's going on?

26
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,586
Dale, what the hell is all this?

27
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,589
Dale: Yeah, there's been
some sort of accident.

28
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,674
No, I don't know.

29
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,593
We're about a mile
off the Camp Nash Line.

30
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,680
- (Iow squeal)
- Dale?

31
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,434
(Iow growl)

32
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,230
Erica, quickly and quietly
back up. Come on.

33
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,398
Dale, what is it?

34
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,317
- (growling)
- Run! Go! Go!

35
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,528
Dale, what is it?!
Dale, what is it?!

36
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,946
- (grunting)
- Erica: What is it?!

37
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,572
- Jesus, Dale!
- Go!

38
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,492
- (grunting)
- Dale!

39
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,206
Erica, get up! Come on!
Come on, wake up!

40
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,251
Come on, get up! Come on!

41
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,752
Shh. Okay. Okay.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,338

00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,195
The car's packed
and we're ready to go.

85
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,407
- Hi, Mrs. Vineyard.
- Hey.

86
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,992
- Sadie, Iet's--
- Okay.

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,620
You can tell my dad
I'll be right down.

88
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,125
- You're such a bitch.
- I am a princess compared to her.

(gasps)

91
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,422
- Sorry.
- Car's packed.

92
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,049
She isn't.

93
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,510
Why are you making her go
when she doesn't wanna come?

94
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,053
She's being a teenager.

95
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,848
But do you think making her
go on this trip is going to fix things?

96
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,142
We need this.

97
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,022
I need this.

98
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,984
Okay.

99
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,246
What?

100
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,790
- Hi, Dad.
- You ready?

101
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,753
- Two minutes?
- Go easy on her this weekend.

102
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,881
She's trying. Please?

103
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,218
- For me?
- Okay.

104
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,766
Your dad is pretty hot
for an old dude.

105
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:56,934
Shut up.

106
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,019
- I'd do him.
- Gross!

107
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,105
Did Daddy help you put up
the posters for Oscar?

108
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,857
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

109
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,943
What happens if he comes back
when we're gone?

110
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,363
I don't think Mr. Peterson will mind
taking him in for a couple days.

111
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,449
- What if he's hungry?
- You know, baby,

112
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,119
dogs survived
for thousands of years

113
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,830
in the wild
before they became pets.

114
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,082
I think he'll be fine.

115
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,214
Danny?
Where is he going?

116
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,383
I don't know.

117
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,933
Hey.
You don't Iook so good.

118
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,935
You had a cold Iast week

119
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,979
and Sadie had a cold
the week before.

120
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,815
Will you knock off
the nurse act? I'm fine.

121
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,526
- Okay.
- Save it for the hospital.

122
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,659
What do you think
really happened to Oscar?

123
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,620
I don't know.

124
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,678
- Hey, buddy boy.
- Come on.

125
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,222
Sadie: Oh, my God.
Can you believe her attitude?

126
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,142
It's fine. It will be fine.
Don't worry.

127
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,519
- I'm going to miss you so much.
- I'm going to miss you, too.

128
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,688
- Okay, have fun.
- I'll call you as soon as I get back.

129
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,190
Okay.

130
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,196
See you, Mr. Vineyard.
(giggles)

131
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,398
- (Danny Iaughing)
- Leave me alone.

132
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,191
Leave me alone, you Iittle--

133
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,243
"Welcome to New Jersey."

134
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,161
That's very good.

135
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,499
Little man, what does that say?

136
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,669
"Guide to the...

137
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,797
Pine Barrens."

138
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,008
That's very good.

139
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,982
So who's Iooking forward
to going fishing?

140
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,485
Seriously, Dad?
Who goes camping?

141
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,739
I do.
And now we all do.

142
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,492
- (phone camera clicks)
- Richard: When I was young

143
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,619
and we came over from England,
Grandpa used to take us

144
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,581
to the Pine Barrens every summer
for our summer holidays.

145
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,375
It's a form of abuse that I haven't
brought you here already.

146
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,587
Why couldn't he have just made it
an annual trip back to London?

147
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:15,090
(cell phone beeps)

148
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,800
Please tell me there are no bears.

149
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,845
Nope. Deer.
Lots of deer, Iots of birds,

150
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,805
but no bears.

151
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,474
Great.

152
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,479
(crows cawing, birds chirping)

153
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,232
Sadie:
"The Jersey Devil.

154
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,735
For hundreds of years,
the Lenni-Lenape tribes

155
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,988
inhabited what is today
the Wharton State Forest.

156
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,492
The tribes fought bitterly
and united only in their fear

157
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,204
of 'Sic ay Mahtantu'--

158

00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,002
It's make-believe.
You know, it's made up.

160
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,422
It's Iike the Loch Ness Monster
or Bigfoot.

161
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,009
- It's just pretend.
- (cell phone beeps)

162
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,470
You don't have to worry about it.

163
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,599
AII right, all right.

164
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,894
(heavy metal music playing)

165
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,940
From now on,
we have no iPods,

166
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,401
no PSPs, and no phones.

167
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,403
- AII right, Sadie?
- What?

168
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,073
- You can't be serious.
- It's just four days.

169
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,200
If I can go without
talking to the bank,

170
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,743
then you can go without
talking to your friends.

171
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,371
- Daddy, watch out!
- (screams)

172
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,045
Sadie:
What the hell was that?

173
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,923
- Dad?
- Stay in the car.

174
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,967
Stay in the car.

175
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,639
(crow cawing)

176
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,365
(branch snaps)

177
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,456
(rustling)

178
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,087
- Oh, my God.
- Get back in the car.

179
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,090
- Holy shit.
- Get back in the car.

180
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,217
Okay. Jesus.

181
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:31,602
- (car door closes)
- (low growling)

182
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,521
What just happened?

183
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,648
Dad, what the hell was that?

184
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,527
A bloody animal just collapsed
in front of the car

185
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,696
and we're not going
to talk about it?

186
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:50,287
- It's probably hunters, darling.
- Sadie: What? Is that Iegal?

187
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,040
- Richard: At the right time of year.
- Is it the right time of the year?

188
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,127
No.

189
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,818
Ranger:
Hey there.

190
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,987
- Can I help you?
- Taking the family camping.

191
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,822
- Oh, yeah? What's the name?
- Vineyard.

192
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,534
Here we go. All right,
you're in zone three, campsite F.

193
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,661
Just sign here for me.
I'd appreciate it.

194
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,829
Yeah.

195
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,584
Excellent. Just up ahead,
through the trees there.

196
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,628
- (music playing)
- (voices overlapping)

197
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,134
This is fantastic.

198
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,596
AII right.
Watch your head.

199
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,724
(grunts)

200
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,769
Take that for me.
(groans)

201
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,231
AII right. This one
is a Iittle bit Iighter.

202
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,276
Mr. Vineyard. I forgot
to give you this permit.

203
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,611
Could you put that on
your dashboard, please?

204
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,363
- Yes, of course.
- Well, hey there, buddy boy.

205
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,324
So you been
to the Barrens before?

206
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,410
I came here with my dad
quite a Iot when I was Iittle,

207
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,996
but it's the first time
I've brought my wife and kids.

208
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,790
That's great. Then I'm going to
spare you the routine then, okay?

209
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,086
Just stay in your designated spot here
and you know the drill.

210
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,757
- We saw a dead deer.
- Really?

211
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,053
Hey, can you take this to Mom
for me, champ?

212
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,096
- Good boy.
- Dead deer, huh?

213
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,515
- Dying deer.
- Where?

214
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,810
It was down on the Leeds Hallow Road
about eight miles back.

215
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,271
It stumbled out in front of us
and then just--

216
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,774
it just dropped down
in front of the car.

217
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,693
Entrails ripped out,
his antlers were gone.

218
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,530
I'll bet all the money in my wallet
those antlers

219
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,575
- are attached to Wyatt Barren's fence.
- Who's that?

220
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,620
Wyatt Barrens.
He's the piney wacko.

221
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,664
He Iives not too far from here.

222
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,625
He put up this barbed-wire fence
a couple years ago.

223
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,586
Deer have been known
to get themselves caught up in it.

224
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,588
The more determined ones,

225
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,508
well, they'll do whatever they can
to free themselves.

226
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,885
I'm going to go check
for that deer, okay?

227
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,721
- You and your family have a great time.
- Thank you.

228
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,765
- Zach.
- Hi.

229
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,267
- Oh, really?
- I'm Ryan.

230
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,603
- Hey.
- These are my buddies.

231
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,148
- You here with your family?
- Yeah.

232
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,859
Oh, by the way, you're going to want
to lock up your food at night.

233
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,320
Tie it up to a tree branch,
not in your tent.

234
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,698
Is that really necessary?

235
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,117
Well, we had an incident
a couple weeks back.

236
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,995
- What kind of incident?
- It was a bear attack.

237
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,665
A couple campers stumbled
across a bear feeding

238
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,668
and the bear got defensive.
You know how it goes.

239
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,631
I thought bears were not indigenous
to the Pine Barrens.

240
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,426
There's only a handful of them
and usually they do keep to themselves,

241
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,679
but, Iisten, just stick to the trails
and you'll be fine.

242
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,682
- You have a great time.
- Thanks.

243
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,101
- It's so freaking Iame.
- It's pretty Iame, eh?

244
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,270
Yeah, totally.

245
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,868
(Iaughing)

246
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,619
Richard:
Who's your new friend, Sade?

247
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,164
- Just some guy.
- Yeah?

248
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,207
How old is "just some guy"?

249
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,877
- Ow. Can you help me?
- Oh, are you okay?

250
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,379
- It still hurts.
- Still?

251
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,548
(heavy metal music playing)

252
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,889
Seriously?

253
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,235
- Say cheese, buddy.
- (laughing)

254
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,531
(cell phones ringing)

255
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,791
It's hot.

256
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,084
Yeah. It is hot.

257
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:52,005
The sun's setting,
so it will cool down in a few minutes.

258
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,219
Take a Iook at what I'm doing,
Danny boy.

259
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,640
You're going to have to know
how to set up your own tent someday.

260
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,310
Hey, will you do me a favor?

261
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,480
In the top of my backpack is my knife.
Can you get it for me?

262
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,078
Be careful.

263
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,504
Whew.

264
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,894
(growling)

265
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,529
Danny!

266
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,576
- Richard!
- (groans)

267
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,661
- Here, Richard.
- (screams)

268
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:10,292
Blood-- blood must have gone
to my head.

269
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,628
Here. Okay.

270
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,339
- Let's get up.
- No.

271
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,609
Hi.

272
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,113
So... you coming?

273
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,366
- Coming where?
- To the campfire.

274
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:47,329
Where you can have s'mores
and hot dogs,

275
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,206
and there will be ghost stories.

276
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,668
Camping, what do you think?

277
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,962
I wanted to set my own fire.

278
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,882
Well, we can do that Iater.

279
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,719
- AII right.
- Okay. I'll meet you out there.

280
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,819
Man: Oh, you missed it. 10 minutes
before your guys showed up to camp,

281
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,738
a family of deer
walked right through the site.

282
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,907
Richard: When we were coming here,
a deer walked in front of the car

283
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,867
and somebody
had removed its antlers.

284
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,745
The ranger said that they had
probably been torn off on a fence.

285
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,914
It wasn't a fence.

286
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,751
- I'm sorry?
- The deer and his antlers.

287
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,921
- It wasn't a fence that tore them off.
- Okay. What was it then?

288
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,923
It was the Leeds Devil.

289
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,134
- Oh-ho, Jersey Devil.
- Ooh.

290
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,179
Both:
Ghost story time.

291
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,058
Baby, you realize
this is just a story, all right?

292
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,768
Well, you know,
I'm going to go take a dump,

293
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,269
so I'll see you guys in a bit.

294
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,271
Nice. Lovely.

295
00:21:56,691 --> 00:22:00,026
AII right, so the Jersey Devil.
Give us the story.

296
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,362
Well, it Iives in the woods.
These woods.

297
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,366
- What is it?
- Do you believe in witches?

298
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,619
- Witches?
- Not Iike the kind with black cats

299
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,247
and flying broomsticks.
A different kind.

300
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,125
A real witch.

301
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,547
Mother Leeds was the town whore.

302
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,009
She was never married.
She was always pregnant.

303
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,803
The story goes
that she had 12 kids

304
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,680
and she raised them
in these woods in a Iittle, tiny cabin

305
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,849
not too far from here.

306
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,060
As you can imagine,
with 12 kids, they just ran wild.

307
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,438
There was no man in her Iife
to help raise them.

308
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,815
So it kind of fell to the town
to take care of them, you know?

309
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,651
Feed them, protect them,
clothe them, educate them.

310
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,321
Eventually, the elders
grew tired of all of this.

311
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,659
They decided that the town shouldn't be
responsible for her offspring.

312
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:53,788
So they told her--
if she bore another child,

313
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,416
then she will be banished
from the Barrens forever.

314
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,169
Oh, no. Not banished.

315
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,672
Mother Leeds was furious

316
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,507
and she was scared.
I mean, banishment from the woods

317
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,384
meant certain death
for her and her family.

318
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,847
She was poor. She relied on the town
to take care of her kids

319
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,058
and give them the things
that she was unable to give them.

320
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,978
So she agreed
and Iife continued on.

321
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,855
The Iegend goes that one day,

322
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,900
Mother Leeds grew violently ill.

323
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,486
She stopped going to town,
she withdrew from people,

324
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,613
she became a total recluse.

325
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,699
These rumors started popping up
that she was practicing witchcraft

326
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,535
and making deals
and conjuring the devil himself.

327
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,080
Other rumors feared her dead.

328
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,291
The Iast rumor, it proved to be true.

329
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,586
Mother Leeds was pregnant.

330
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,047
Pregnant with her 13th child.

331
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,840
(giggles)

332
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,468
Woman:
She was hiding the baby.

333
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,220
She couldn't tell the elders.

334
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,263
With 12 kids,
keeping a secret, well--

335
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,224
- Did they find out?
- Oh, yeah.

336
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,559
They went to her cabin
to find out for themselves.

337
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,521
She was very much pregnant.
She pleaded and begged.

338
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,231
She told them that she
hadn't been with a man for years,

339
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,817
but they didn't believe her.
They agreed to Iet her stay in the cabin

340
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,443
until she gave birth.

341
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,613
As soon as the child was born,
she and her family had to move on.

342
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,200
She cursed the elders,
the town, the Barrens,

343
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,202
even the unborn baby.

344
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,162
She told them
that it wasn't hers.

345
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,956
- That it was the devil's baby.
- You all right?

346
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,458
Let him take it.

347
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,837
And take him the devil did.

348
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,005
On the night
that she went into Iabor,

349
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,468
after hours of agony,
she finally gave birth.

350
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,848
But what came out of Mother Leeds
was not human.

351
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,433
It had cloven hooves,
a serpentine tail,

352
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,562
a head of a horse,
and a kangaroo body.

353
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,772
(screaming)

354
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,401
The 13th child of Mother Leeds
was nothing short of the devil himself.

355
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,362
The midwife screamed,
she dropped the child

356
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,072
and it immediately
sprouted these wings

357
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,158
and started flying
all around the room.

358
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,661
It killed two of its siblings
before finally turning on Mother Leeds.

359
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,122
It attacked her.
It tore right into her.

360
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,294
- AII right. I think that's enough.
- No, no.

361
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,796
- What happened?
- It's okay. I'm big enough to hear.

362
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,382
- You sure?
- Yeah, Dad. He's big enough to hear.

363
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,679
What happens next, it varies
depending on who's telling the story.

364
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,349
I heard that the thing climbed up
the chimney and escaped into the forest.

365
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,477
Sadie: The book said that people
have actually seen it.

366
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,272
That's true. There's been countless
sightings over the years.

367
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,733
This is almost 400 years ago.

368
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,985
Yeah, and sometimes
if you're quiet enough,

369
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,862
you can actually hear it.

370
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,615
- (scoffs)
- Ryan: No, I'm serious.

371
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,825
- (giggling)
- Shh. Listen.

372
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,537
No, seriously, guys. Listen.

373
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,006
- (yells)
- (screaming)

374
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,802
Yes! Yes!

375
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,305
Woman:
Oh, my gosh!

376
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,185
You got punked!

377
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,396
What a bunch of bitches, huh?

378
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,814
Bitches!

379
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,692
- That was seriously messed up!
- Dude, relax. It was a joke.

380
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,444
Dad, calm down.
He was just joking.

381
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,196
(snaps)
Do I Iook amused, Sadie?

382
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,864
- Do I?
- Cynthia: Richard.

383
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,283
Look at your brother.
Look at him. Look at him.

384
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,662
- He's six years old.
- Man: Chill, bro.

385
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,163
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Richard, let's--

386
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,040
- Don't you touch me, man.
- Richard, stop.

387
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,875
- Get your hands off me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

388
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,378
Man:
Chill, chill.

389
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,181
Sorry.

390
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,810
I didn't mean-- okay.

391
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,230
What's up with your pops?

392
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,152
- You totally overreacted.
- I'm sorry.

393
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,570
I don't know what I was thinking.

394
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,740
Danny, are you all right?
You all right, honey?

395
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,326
Fine. I'm going to
take him to bed.

396
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,495
Take it easy, champ.

397
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,222
(pants)

398
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,993
(faint voices muttering)

399
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,000
(wings fluttering)

400
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,258
(Iow growling)

401
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,103
(Ioud growling)

402
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,572
(beast shrieking)

403
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,831
- What happened?
- Richard, are you okay?

404
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,792
No, no, no. I don't mean--

405
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,960
(cell phone buzzing)

406
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,882
- Were you on the phone?
- No.

407
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,219
Let me see it.

408
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:45,139
- Let me see your phone.
- No.

409
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,268
- Stop it.
- Give it here.

410
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,354
- Give it.
- Richard, stop it.

411
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,983
Brian?

412
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,985
Are you fucking kidding me?
Seriously?

413
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,154
(grunts, groans)

414
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,740
You need to calm down.

415
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,910
I have never cheated on you.

416
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,871
The paranoia has to stop now.

417
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,082
You told me
you'd stopped talking to him.

418
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,042
I did stop talking to him

419
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,253
and then he called me
out of the blue.

420
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,256
What else are you
Iying about, Cynth?

421
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,884
Huh? Am I going to have to
run around questioning you?

422
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,512
You are so jealous, Richard.
He said that he needed to talk.

423
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,848
- Oh, just talk?
- That's all we did. We talked.

424
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,767
- How naive are you?
- Ever since we got married,

425
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,229
I have cut ties
with every single guy friend.

426
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,649
(screeching, rumbling)

427
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,569
Richard?

428
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,990
I chose you.

429
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,250
I Iove you, Richard.

430
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,802
(moans)
Ow.

431
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,013
I'm sorry.

432
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,266
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

433
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,521
- I'll go and get your phone.
- No. I don't want my--

434
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,648
I don't care.
I just want to go to bed.

435
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,695
I'm going to--

436
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,823
I need to clear my head.

437
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,288
(birds hooting)

438
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,642
(rustling)

439
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,205
(gasps)

440
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,260
(faint voices muttering)

441
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,284
(birds chirping,
woodpecker pecking)

442
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,906
(winces)

443
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,826
Ryan: So your mom seems pretty cool,
but your dad doesn't.

444
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,579
Cynthia is not my mother.

445
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,247
Oh, yeah?
What's your story?

446
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,250
Not a very interesting one.

447
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,379
My mom died when I was seven.

448
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,341
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

449
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,388
So what do you think
happened to Zach?

450
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,599
- (crows squawking)
- He went out in the woods Iast night

451
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,101
to take a piss
and he never came back.

452
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,480
That's crazy.

453
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,289
Hey.

454
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,128
We were starting to wonder
when you were gonna wake up.

455
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,965
- What time is it?
- It's after 11 :00.

456
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,635
- What?
- Yes.

457
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,804
Come here.

458
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,433
- How are you feeling?
- I'm better, thanks.

459
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,102
You are?

460
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,562
Because you really Iook Iike shit.

461
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,357
- Right back at ya.
- Thanks, babe.

462
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,359
You're so nice.

463
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,824
So...

464
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,329
- did you find it?
- What?

465
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,500
- My phone.
- No, I didn't.

466
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,253
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

467
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:13,300
- Where's Sadie?
- She went on a hike with that guy.

468
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,554
- With that douchebag?
- God, Richard.

469
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,432
- It's a hike.
- What's this?

470
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,477
He's been here since this morning
and he's been questioning everybody.

471
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,442
This is not camping.

472
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,236
We need to go further
into the forest.

473
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,655
I don't know whether
that's such a good idea, babe.

474
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,868
When she gets back,
we'll Ieave immediately.

475
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,847
Hey, Dad.

476
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,099
I'm going to need you
to pack your things up.

477
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,144
- Are we Ieaving?
- Just moving sites.

478
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,314
We're here for a reason.

479
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,237
Taking off so soon?

480
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,906
Moving sites.

481
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,074
Oh, where to?

482
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,785
Just gonna go
a couple of miles up the trail

483
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,787
to the Oswego Pointe.

484
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,790
Officer:
Can't say I blame you.

485
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,750
Not how I remember it.

486
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,252
Well, things have a way
of changing.

487
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,011
Scattering my dad's ashes.

488
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,097
Sorry for your Ioss.

489
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,767
You got a minute?

490
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,602
Seen you just woke up.

491
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,604
Richard:
Yeah, I had a bit of a headache,

492
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,731
but feeling better now.

493
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,150
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, we're fine, hon.

494
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,778
We're just-- we're just chatting.

495
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:59,240
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

496
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,408
I'm Cynthia Vineyard.
Nice to meet you.

497
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,703
Pleasure. So when you
were up last night,

498
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,998
- did you notice anything strange?
- No. Why?

499
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,544
It's probably nothing.

500
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,712
One of their friends
disappeared Iast night.

501
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,339
Went into the woods
and didn't come back.

502
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,133
- Cynthia: You're kidding.
- If you ask me,

503
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,969
guy drank too much,
passed out somewhere,

504
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,971
and he's going to wake up
with one hell of a hangover.

505
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,181
- But I got to check, you know.
- Mm-hmm.

506
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,141
No, we didn't see
anything strange.

507
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,977
A camper thought he saw you

508
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,938
out walking around
in the middle of the night.

509
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,566
Thought maybe you'd seen
or heard something.

510
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,192
Nope.

511
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,987
No, you weren't walking around

512
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,281
or, no, you didn't see
or hear anything?

513
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,408
Neither.

514
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,911
Huh.
Well, it's probably nothing,

515
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,997
but given what happened
last week,

516
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,583
- we got to be a tad more cautious.
- What happened last week?

517
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,878
Well, a couple of hikers
ran smack into a bear's den.

518
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,838
Cynthia:
You're kidding.

519
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:59,633
I had no idea
that there were bears up here.

520
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:03,429
Well, a handful at most.
Black bears. Mostly stay to themselves.

521
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:06,098
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, jeez.

522
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,852
I almost forgot. This wouldn't happen
to be yours, would it?

523
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,147
Eh, yes.

524
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,773
Yes.

525
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,359
Pretty safe to assume
that phone has made its Iast call.

526
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,028
Mm-hmm.

527
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,196
- You be safe out there, Cynthia.
- Thank you.

528
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,325
- And...
- Richard.

529
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,291
Bye.

530
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,340
Where are you from, Richard?
If you don't mind me asking.

531
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,300
- Philly.
- Philly?

532
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,720
- No, by way of England.
- Oh.

533
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,725
Well, hope you beat the rain.

534
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,771
Thank you.

535
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,192
Richard, why did you
just lie to him?

536
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,245
Richard: Oswego should be
just over to the west here.

537
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,583
It's where my dad and I
used to camp.

538
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,461
It's where he'd want to be.
Definitely.

539
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,965
(Danny whimpers)

540
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,890
Wait.

541
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,314
I'm sorry about your phone, Cynth.

542
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,775
I really didn't think
I'd thrown it that hard.

543
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,112
I don't understand what was wrong
with where we were.

544
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,155
Everything, Sade.
Everything was wrong with it.

545
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,953
- This is way better.
- Dad, I have to go to the bathroom.

546
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,789
Really?

547
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,959
- Number one or two?
- One.

548
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,713
AII right.
Look, you can go around here.

549
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,633
- Want me to come with?
- No.

550
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,969
AII right. Come on.

551
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,352
(grunts)

552
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:26,989
Here.

553
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,824
- Drink some water.
- I'm fine.

554
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,501
(urinating)

555
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,551
(flies buzzing)

556
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:57,227
We need to hike about another mile
and get to a clearing.

557
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,814
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

558
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,986
Need to scatter my dad's ashes.
I owe it to him.

559
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,787
(crow cawing)

560
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,213
Come on.

561
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,719
Move.

562
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,181
Stop it.

563
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,234
- Nearly there, guys.
- Sadie: Okay.

564
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,823
Sadie:
Careful. Over.

565
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,578
Did you see that?

566
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,125
What? A deer?

567
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,293
I don't think so.

568
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,716
- Careful here.
- Okay.

569
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,264
Sadie: Got it.

570
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,433
Watch out, buddy.

571
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,002
- Take my hand. You okay?
- Danny: Yeah.

572
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,984
Daddy, my feet hurt.

573
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,445
Cynthia: Do you even know
where you're going?

574
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,492
Daddy?

575
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,503
We're just going to have to carry you
the whole way then, aren't we?

576
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,175
(grunts)

577
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,556
(groaning)

578
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,405
- Dad, stop.
- (music playing faintly)

579
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,495
Listen.

580
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,122
(coughing)

581
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,376
- Cynthia: Danny?
- Something's over there.

582
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,544
Hello?

583
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,048
It's someone's campsite.

584
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,468
Hello?

585
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,804
(music continues)

586
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,059
Hey, kiddo.

587
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,188
Are you okay?

588
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,401
(music continues)

589
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,134
(static crackles)

590
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,395
(gasps, screams)

591
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,942
Richard!

592
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,737
Danny, turn around.

593
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,784
Richard:
Danny, take this.

594
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,995
Help set up the tent
with your sister, okay?

595
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,289
- Cynthia: Richard, we can't stay here.
- (flies buzzing)

596
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,209
You see those clouds, Cynth?

597
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,295
We don't want to be in the middle
of the woods when they open up.

598
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:37,215
Anyway, we're two or three miles
from the main site.

599
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,262
(grunts)

600
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:48,101
It's okay, kiddo.
We're going to be home very soon. Okay?

601
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,396
Sadie, go over there
with your brother. Okay?

602
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,325
Oscar?

603
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,701
(whimpers)

604
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,455
Richard?

605
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,708
(snarling)

606
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,682
Richard?

607
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,366
Richard, what are you doing?

608
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,620
I'm going to cut him Ioose.

609
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,735
(retching)

610
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,284
- Danny: I want to go home.
- I know.

611
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:30,036
Sadie: Tell me about it.
Cynthia, we're not actually

612
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,997
staying here, are we?

613
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,375
Cynthia: Do you think
this is my idea of fun?

614
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,295
This trip is important
to your dad.

615
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,047
Seriously, I mean,
what the fuck is this shit?

616
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,925
- Cynthia: Come on, Sadie.
- No. This is fucked.

617
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,012
Dead deer, dead dogs,

618
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,931
and all this "Blair Witch"
crazy shit hanging from trees.

619
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,559
Your dad is going to scatter
Gramp's ashes

620
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,436
in the river
where they used to fish.

621
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:57,272
Why don't we just throw Gramps in
this water and get the hell out of here?

622
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,065
It's not Iike
he'll know the difference.

623
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,321
Oh, my God.

624
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,324
Cynthia?

625
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,581
(flies buzzing)

626
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,005
Cynthia:
Danny, stay there.

627
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,246
(splashes)

628
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,875
Hello?

629
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,794
(rustling)

630
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,390
(Ieaves rustling)

631
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,770
(panting)

632
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,942
Hello?

633
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,777
Answer me.

634
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,574
Say something.

635
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:35,704
(branches creaking)

636
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,422
(rattling)

637
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,427
- Hey.
- Jesus.

638
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,013
Gee, sorry, man.
I didn't mean to scare you.

639
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,606
What are you doing out here?

640
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,941
Camping. You?

641
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,154
Was it you?
Following us?

642
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,823
Following you? No.

643
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,950
(branches creaking)

644
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,040
You okay, Mr. Vineyard?

645
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,296
Mr. Vineyard?

646
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,134
I think you should go back
to the main campsite.

647
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,303
I'm kind of meeting Sadie.

648
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,182
- You're what?
- She just texted me.

649
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,142
We're going for a walk.

650
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,144
Look, if you're mad about this whole
stupid story thing--

651
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,730
Do you believe
in the Jersey Devil?

652
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,650
What? You mean,
Iike the real thing?

653
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,028
The version I heard
is a Iittle bit different from yours.

654
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,700
The 13th child of Mother Leeds
was born normal.

655
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,829
Not deformed,

656
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,499
but she did do a deal
with the devil.

657
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,544
He would spare her sinner's soul

658
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,214
in exchange for the 13th child.

659
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,719
So when the baby was born,

660
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,391
she walked down to the river
by the side of her cabin...

661
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:26,022
and she offered up her son
to the devil...

662
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,278
...by drowning it.

663
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,200
(voices whispering)

664
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:42,372
Richard: One of the town elders
saw Mother Leeds

665
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,084
down by the bank,
drowning her Iittle baby.

666
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,962
So he rushed over...

667
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,716
but he was too Iate.

668
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,719
The baby was dead.

669
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,555
So he pulled Mother Leeds
away from the bank.

670
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,725
When he turned round,

671
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:06,062
the infant's body was gone.

672
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,692
Taken by the devil himself.

673
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,072
I thought I saw the Jersey Devil
when I was a Iittle boy.

674
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,076
- (branches creaking)
- (low growl)

675
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,246
(rain pattering)

676
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,708
Do you hear that?

677
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:29,043
Hear what?

678
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,759
(thunder rumbling)

679
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,895
I went fishing with Spider.

680
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,855
- Ah, that's Spider.
- Richard: Sadie, come here.

681
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,398
Richard:
Give me that. Give me the bag.

682
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,942
Sadie:
Dad! No! Give it back!

683
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,944
Dad! Give it to me!

684
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,238
What are you doing?

685
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,740
- Richard?
- Sadie: Dad, give me--

686
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,825
- Richard: Get off me!
- Sadie: What are you doing?

687
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,244
- What are you doing?
- Cynthia: Richard, stop!

688
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:06,998
- Dad!
- I said no phones!

689
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,833
- Give me--
- Get off me!

690
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,545
- Dad?
- (thunder rumbling)

691
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,092
Sadie, are you okay?

692
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,808
- You sound Iike a crazy person.
- She called that boy Ryan

693
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,519
- and she told him to come and meet us.
- So what?

694
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,146
That's what 17-year-olds do.

695
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,441
Not Iisten to their parents,
they text boys.

696
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,610
What the hell, Richard?

697
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,862
You wanted to come here,
so we came here.

698
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,656
You wanted to Ieave
the other campsite,

699
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,449
so we Ieft,
and now we're here.

700
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:45,411
You know what? This is not
bringing us any closer together.

701
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,832
You have a fever.
You Iook Iike shit.

702
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,460
We're lost in the middle
of this fucking forest. It's raining.

703
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:57,257
For some reason the other campers tied
their dog to a tree and they vanished.

704
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,093
Put yourself in our position.

705
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,178
This is insane.

706
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,097
There's something wrong
with my arm.

707
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,225
What? Let me see it.

708
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,189
(gasps)

709
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,154
I'm seeing things.

710
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,574
Things that I know aren't there.

711
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,537
Okay, fuck it.

712
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,747
As soon as this rain stops,

713
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,584
we're leaving here
and we're going to go to a hospital.

714
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,504
I Iove you and I know

715
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:39,924
that you are trying
to fix this family...

716
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,054
but this is not the way.

717
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,892
Okay?

718
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,658
Here.

719
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:08,161
Call your boy back.

720
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,665
Thanks.

721
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,919
Thank you.

722
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,258
Dad's acting fucking crazy.

723
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,678
Is he mad?

724
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:29,015
No. Not at you.

725
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:34,062
We're going to get the hell out of here
as soon as it stops raining.

726
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,607
Recording: You've reached Ryan.
Leave a message.

727
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,236
- He's not answering.
- (thunder rumbling)

728
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,493
He will. Trust me.

729
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:02,131
(thunder rumbling)

730
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,197
Hi.

731
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,911
You still have a fever.

732
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,500
I think that we should
get out of here tonight.

733
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,213
I'm sorry
if I'm scaring everyone.

734
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,718
I don't feel safe or comfortable
hiking out of here tonight.

735
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:52,098
The ground is mush,
it's going to be pitch black soon.

736
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,684
You can call the sheriff.

737
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,523
What is that?

738
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,151
I found it
in the other occupants' tent.

739
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,738
You went through their stuff?

740
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:11,200
I buried their dog.
I'm sure they won't mind.

741
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:21,169
- What Ianguage is this?
- I killed Oscar.

742
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,047
What?

743
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,552
About a month ago,
he started...

744
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,639
acting different.

745
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,976
- And strange.
- (barks)

746
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,314
Well, he was old.

747
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,401
I mean, what else could I do?

748
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,945
I mean, what if he attacked
Sadie or Danny?

749
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,530
(snarling, snapping)

750
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,409
I had to put him down.

751
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:57,288
He bit me.
I Ioved that fucking dog.

752
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,674
I think I'm going to go
and rest for a bit.

753
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,011
(grunts)

754
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,181
(thunder rumbling)

755
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,228
(bird hooting,
crickets chirping)

756
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,454
- Hey.
- Hey.

757
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,207
What are you guys doing?

758
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,253
We're rather unsuccessfully
trying to make s'mores, right?

759
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,965
- Well, at Ieast it stopped raining.
- Yeah.

760
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,884
Does that mean
we finally get to go home?

761
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,637
Cynthia:
When your daddy feels better,

762
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,222
we'll go home, okay?

763
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,476
Okay, well, I'm not getting
any service here,

764
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,855
so I'm going to walk around
and try to call Ryan.

765
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,190
Okay. If you're not back by the time
your father gets up,

766
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:09,193
there's going to be
a new ghost story

767
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:12,572
- to tell around the campfire, Sadie.
- Yup.

768
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,740
- I won't go far.
- Thank you.

769
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,159
Promise.

770
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:28,838
(phone ringing)

771
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,722
(distant ringing)

772
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,016
Recording: You've reached Ryan.
Leave a message.

773
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,185
Ryan?

774
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,235
- (phone ringing)
- Ryan?

775
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:54,071
- Ryan?
- (distant phone ringing)

776
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,330
(branches crunching)

777
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:14,926
(ringing continues)

778
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,346
(ringing)

779
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,771
(dull thump)

780
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:28,481
(screaming)

781
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,698
Go inside the tent.
Get your father.

782
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,408
- What is it?
- Something's out there.

783
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,576
- What?
- I don't know, I just--

784
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,913
I was trying to call Ryan and I kept
hearing his phone ringing in the woods.

785
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,041
- Okay. Give me your phone.
- What are you doing?

786
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,168
I'm calling for help.

787
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,173
Shit. Okay.
Go inside that tent.

788
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:57,385
Cynthia:
Danny?

789
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,055
Danny?

790
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,977
Danny?
Hey, sweetie.

791
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,940
I want you to go out there

792
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,900
in the tent
with your sister, okay?

793
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,777
Go.

794
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,446
(gasps)

795
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,286
I can't get to sleep.

796
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,830
I keep trying to,
but I can't sleep.

797
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,625
When Oscar bit you...

798
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:34,130
did he have pus in his eyes...

799
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,009
and foam in his mouth?

800
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,555
Oscar's dead.

801
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,822
Okay.

802
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,494
(thunder rumbling)

803
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,842
- We've got to scatter Dad's ashes.
- Okay.

804
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,644
I want you to take this.

805
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:34,106
- What is it?
- It's a sleeping pill.

806
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,443
- Okay?
- What's wrong with me?

807
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,862
You just need to sleep.

808
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,531
Then we're going to
get out of here tomorrow.

809
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:47,495
Everything is going to be okay.
Okay?

810
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,207
Okay.
Put that in your mouth.

811
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:54,835
Here--
(gasps)

812
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,131
Okay.

813
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:02,927
The kids are scared.

814
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:05,679
I've got a headache.
I'll be better tomorrow.

815
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,066
(roars)

816
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,615
(thunder rumbles)

817
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,414
(whimpers)
I want to go home.

818
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,708
- Hi, guys.
- What's going on with Dad?

819
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:39,296
- Daddy is scaring me.
- Well, he's sick,

820
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,465
but guess what?

821
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,259
When we get
out of here tomorrow,

822
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:44,593
we're going to have him
all fixed up, okay?

823
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,721
- I want to go home.
- I know, kiddo.

824
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,936
What do you guys think
if I were to sleep in here tonight

825
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,938
and we have a giant sleepover?

826
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:59,608
What do you think?
Come here.

827
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,946
- It's okay, baby. It's okay.
- (sobbing)

828
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:09,869
(crow cawing)

829
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,794
(shuddering)

830
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,963
(Ieaves crunching)

831
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,680
(squealing)

832
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,768
(wings flapping)

833
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,988
(voices muttering)

834
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,841
(crow cawing)

835
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,184
(branches creaking)

836
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,236
(snarls, roars)

837
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:28,239
(distant screaming)

838
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,407
Cynthia:
Richard?

839
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,134
Richard?

840
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,389
- It was here. It was just here.
- What was here?

841
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,976
- The Devil.
- Can you walk?

842
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,021
- You're hallucinating.
- It is real.

843
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,566
- It is not real.
- It was real.

844
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,735
I'm getting the kids
and we are Ieaving in two minutes.

845
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,909
- Your dad is sick.
- Sadie: Uh, no shit.

846
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,830
- We need to get him to a hospital.
- Wait, what?

847
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,917
- What's wrong with him?
- You take that.

848
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:25,588
- He was bitten.
- By what? What are you talking about?

849
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,925
- Cynthia?
- Oscar bit your dad.

850
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,595
It happened
a couple of weeks ago

851
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,265
and now there is a wound
on his arm that is infected.

852
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:40,311
- Oscar bit Dad?
- Hold on. Where's Oscar now?

853
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,732
(gasps)

854
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,151
Rabies?

855
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,701
Sadie: Hello?

856
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,876
Hello?

857
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,129
Is anybody out there?

858
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,298
(cell phone beeping)

859
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:18,307
Mommy said Oscar bit you.
Why?

860
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:23,937
He was confused.

861
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,899
He didn't recognize me.

862
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:31,820
Oh. Is that why he Ieft?
Because he was sorry?

863
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,161
He didn't have to Ieave.
I would still love him.

864
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,832
(phone ringing)

865
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,129
Hang on. Hello? Hello?
Hello? Can you hear me?

866
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,631
Operator:
9-1-1, please state your emergency.

867
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:53,008
Yes, my family and I are Iost.

868
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,719
My husband's sick
and we need help, please.

869
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,347
Operator: Okay. Please slow down, ma'am.
Where are you?

870
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,433
We're in the Pine Barrens.

871
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,852
Operator: The Barrens is a Iarge area.
Could you be more specific?

872
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,481
- We're in the Wa--
- Wharton State Forest.

873
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,191
Wharton State Park.
The Wharton State Forest.

874
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,985
Operator:
I need to know the trail.

875
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,029
- No, we're not on a trail.
- (screaming)

876
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,447
- Danny?
- Dad?

877
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,074
- Operator: Ma'am?
- Cynthia: Danny?!

878
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:18,909
Both:
Danny?!

879
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:23,288
Danny?!

880
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,499
- Danny?!
- Danny?!

881
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:27,668
Danny?!

882
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,264
(cell phone ringing)

883
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,688
Ma'am, the 9-1-1 operator
traced your call to my county.

884
01:07:47,856 --> 01:07:50,065
- He's dead.
- Sheriff: Who's dead?

885
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,901
- Who is this?
- There's a dead body.

886
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,696
My husband is sick.
I can't find my son.

887
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,573
Ma'am, I need you
to tell me your name.

888
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:02,703
- Cynthia Vineyard. Please.
- Cynthia Vineyard?

889
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:05,497
- Sorry. Get up. Get up.
- Ma'am, this is Sheriff Winters.

890
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,166
I met you and your husband
at the campgrounds.

891
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,584
I think I know
where you were headed.

892
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,419
Conserve your phone's battery
and just sit tight.

893
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,337
We're going to find you, ma'am.

894
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,883
Cynthia:
Danny? Danny?

895
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:21,430
(women panting)

896
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,559
Cynthia!

897
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,311
Get up.

898
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:30,105
Get up, please.

899
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:35,778
- What do you think it was?
- I don't know.

900
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,784
(sobbing)
What could have done this?

901
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,243
I don't know.

902
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:45,287
Dad? Do you think
it was Dad?

903
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,206
Stop that.

904
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,999
Sadie:
It was his knife.

905
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:53,045
- Cynthia, it was his knife.
- Stop it.

906
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,131
(sobbing)

907
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,260
Danny?!

908
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,888
Danny!

909
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,099
- (screaming, water splashing)
- Danny!

910
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,977
Danny! Dad!

911
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,980
Danny? Danny?

912
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:17,736
Danny?

913
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:25,577
Oh, my God. Danny!

914
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,206
(screaming)
Oh, my God! Danny!

915
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,625
- Oh, my God! Danny!
- Danny! Danny!

916
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,293
Danny! Danny!

917
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,676
- Help me. Danny!
- Cynthia!

918
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:44,847
Cynthia:
Help me. Go.

919
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,812
Danny.

920
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,440
Danny.
Oh, my God. Danny.

921
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,526
Oh, my God.

922
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,697
- My God! Wake up!
- One two three four, five six seven.

923
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:04,157
One two three four five...
(panting)

924
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:14,960
Is he dead?

925
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,505
(yelling)
Somebody please help us!

926
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:21,425
Somebody please!

927
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,596
...six seven eight...

928
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:30,475
(coughing)

929
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,238
Cynthia:
It's okay. It's okay.

930
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,617
Okay.

931
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,203
Oh, my gosh.

932
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:57,586
- What have you done to my son?
- (screaming)

933
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:01,298
What have you done!
What did you do to my son?!

934
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,261
(groans)

935
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,932
Wake up!
I said wake up!

936
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,435
Wake up! Wake up!

937
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,271
I said wake up!
Wake up!

938
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:21,151
No!

939
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,197
Cynthia!

940
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,035
(moaning)

941
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:47,094
(siren wailing)

942
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,774
Yeah. Richard and Cynthia Vineyard.
They registered two days ago

943
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,026
and they've been missing
since yesterday morning.

944
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,752
I don't have a good feeling
about this.

945
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,338
I've already got two men
in the woods looking.

946
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:24,840
This is the Vineyards' SUV.

947
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:27,426
- Any luck reaching that cell phone?
- No. It's going straight to voicemail.

948
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,593
The husband mentioned Oswego.

949
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,972
There's a clearing about two miles past
these campgrounds near the Oswego River.

950
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,558
- Let's go!
- I'll be two minutes behind you.

951
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,532
(Cynthia moaning)

952
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,959
We can go.
You know, me and Danny.

953
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,337
- We can go get help.
- Yeah.

954
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,007
We can just...

955
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:10,594
walk in a straight Iine.
I mean we're bound to find somebody.

956
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:13,597
Cynthia: Okay.

957
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:17,225
You don't Iet anything happen to Danny.
You don't Iet go of his hand.

958
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,270
You don't stop moving
until you find someone.

959
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:23,440
If you're not at that campsite

960
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:26,151
before sunset,
you come right back here, okay?

961
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,153
Okay.

962
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,156
It's three or four miles away.
Danny, come here.

963
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,874
Promise me that you're
going to protect your sister.

964
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,751
- Okay?
- (whimpers)

965
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,135
Dan--

966
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:59,768
- Will you come and untie me, please?
- Danny.

967
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,942
Sadie?
Sadie, come over.

968
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,277
Help Daddy now.
Come on.

969
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,155
Come and help Daddy.

970
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,407
You just need to untie me.

971
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,243
No. I can't.

972
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,620
You run.

973
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,457
Danny boy.

974
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,835
Danny boy. Danny.

975
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,462
- Danny.
- No.

976
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,549
Hey, come and help Daddy.

977
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,552
Come over here
and help Daddy.

978
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:36,471
- Danny.
- Run! Go! Go!

979
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,307
- Come on!
- Danny, come back here!

980
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,643
It's not safe out there!

981
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,857
Richard:
Danny!

982
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:49,484
(dispatch chatter)

983
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,361
Cynthia?

984
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:58,243
(panting)

985
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:00,537
Hello?

986
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:03,832
Can anyone hear me?

987
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,169
Sadie, come back!
It's not safe out there!

988
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,886
(groans)

989
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,349
(whines)

990
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,775
I didn't mean--
I didn't mean to hurt you.

991
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:37,324
Danny said that something
pushed him into the water.

992
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:41,828
- What pushed him?
- I don't remember.

993
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:44,372
Who pushed him?

994
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,501
(sobbing)
I would--

995
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,087
I would never.

996
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:54,758
- I wouldn't--
- Ryan is dead.

997
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:58,470
- Who?
- Sadie's friend.

998
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:04,392
- The boy in the fucking woods.
- You need to untie me.

999
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,187
He's following us.
He's following us.

1000
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:10,398
He's here. I've seen it.

1001
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:14,236
- I need your help.
- You have rabies.

1002
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:22,244
- What?
- You're having hallucinations.

1003
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:25,247
You're hearing things--
hydrophobia.

1004
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:28,583
You have extreme paranoia
and dementia.

1005
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,547
There's no monster
out there, Richard.

1006
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,344
The monster is you.

1007
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,894
- Fucking untie me now!
- Did you do it?!

1008
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:53,316
- Did you do it?! Answer me!
- No! I did not!

1009
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:55,610
No!

1010
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,949
- Untie me?
- No.

1011
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,626
The Devil. It's out here.

1012
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,131
I've seen it.

1013
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:18,800
It's gonna get us.

1014
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:23,888
I need you to untie me
so we can get out of here.

1015
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:32,355
I am not going crazy!

1016
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:58,256
- Officer: Over there.
- (police dispatch chatter)

1017
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,427
Another bear attack?

1018
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,557
(flies buzzing)

1019
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,353
Not Iikely.

1020
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,775
Sadie: Did Dad tell you
to go in the water?

1021
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,568
Danny, did he push you
in the water?

1022
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,489
Danny, I need you
to answer me.

1023
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:26,701
He said something
was following us.

1024
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:29,579
He was trying to find
a hiding place.

1025
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,460
Dad did something bad,
didn't he?

1026
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,672
Come here.

1027
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,008
(Danny sobbing)

1028
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,180
We just need to keep moving, okay?

1029
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:49,516
We need to keep going.
It's going to be okay.

1030
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:52,060
We need to keep going, okay?

1031
01:18:52,228 --> 01:19:04,739
(grunting)

1032
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,628
(screams)

1033
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:38,690
- Yeah, we got a body.
- Sheriff.

1034
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:41,025
You need to see this.

1035
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,990
There it is. There it is.

1036
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,033
There it is.
It's right there.

1037
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:55,874
(Ieaves rustling)

1038
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,586
(Iow growl)

1039
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:02,297
It's there. It's there.
Look through the trees.

1040
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:05,049
Cynth, Cynth.
Look through the trees.

1041
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,010
Look through the trees!

1042
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,433
It's not the first time
I've seen it.

1043
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,895
It's been after me
since I was a child.

1044
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,402
(Ioud growl)

1045
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:41,336
Cynth.

1046
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:43,338
You've got to trust me.

1047
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:47,175
I know--
I know I seem insane.

1048
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:52,013
I just want to protect you.

1049
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:54,390
Sadie:
Help!

1050
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:58,353
Somebody, please!

1051
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,773
Ouch! Shit.

1052
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,609
- (groaning)
- Sadie!

1053
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,111
I'm okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1054
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,447
Ah, shit...

1055
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,178
Danny, come here.

1056
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,348
Danny.

1057
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:39,644
- (Iow growl)

1058
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,064
Oh, my God.

1059
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,276
Sadie:
Oh, my God.

1060
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:55,159
Danny, don't move.

1061
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,250
- Don't move.
- (growls, Ioud gunshot)

1062
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,966
- Man: It's okay.
- (Ioud ringing)

1063
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:13,094
Where are your parents?
Come on.

1064
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,097
Come on. Hurry up.

1065
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,932
Come on.

1066
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,414
I want every campsite
in a 20-mile radius shut down.

1067
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:49,547
(grunting)

1068
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:11,486

(Ieaves rustling)

1070
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,671
Richard?

1071
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:34,801
Richard? Richard...

1072
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:48,022
(branches creaking)

1073
01:23:48,190 --> 01:24:03,955
(screaming)

1074
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,374
Cynthia.

(coughing)

1078
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,497
- Sadie: Dad.
- Sadie. Sadie.

1079
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,584
- Dad! Dad!
- I Iove you, baby.

1080
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,920
Where's Cynthia?
Where is she?!

1081
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,922
I'm not sure.

1082
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,468
- I'm so glad I found you.
- Where is she?

1083
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,554
It's not safe.

1084
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,101
(grunts)

1085
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,644
(gasps, trigger clicks)

1086
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:12,064
- Miss, step away from your dad, please.
- Sadie.

1087
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:25,119
- What did you do?

Mommy!

What did you do?

1094
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:53,022
