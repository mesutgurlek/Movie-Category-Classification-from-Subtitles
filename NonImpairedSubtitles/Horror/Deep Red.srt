1
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,724
Okay, okay, stop.

2
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,717
Great!

3
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,165
Really...

4
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,333
...really, that's good. Very good.

5
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,903
Maybe a little too good.

6
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,896
Too clean. Yes, too precise. Too...

7
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:58,111
...formal.
It should be more... trashy.

8
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,913
See what I mean?

9
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,583
Remember that this sort of Jazz
came out of the...

10
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,553
...the brothels... and the freedom
inspired from...

11
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,422
<i>Parapsychology Conference</i>

12
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:13,415
...and this phenomenon,
as the latest studies confirm...

13
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,629
...is not restricted to superior species...

14
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,766
...but it includes vertebrates and
invertebrates as well...

15
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,135
Butterflies...

16
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,903
...termites, zebras...

17
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,606
...all these animals, and many more...

18
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:30,599
...use telepathy to transmit orders
and relay information.

19
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,505
This is a proven fact
that can be easily demonstrated.

20
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,943
For instance: If we put a butterfly
in a cage, within a few hours...

21
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:45,280
...it will be able to gather around it
many other butterflies...

22
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:51,286
...which will quickly swarm in,
in answer to its call...

23
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,757
...even covering a distance of
several miles.

24
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,171
This is telepathy.

25
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,164
A faculty which comes naturally to the
newborn in the early stages of life...

26
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,602
...but which they generally lose
as they acquire the means of...

27
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,748
...verbal communication.

28
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,618
On the other hand,
certain rare individuals...

29
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,588
...for reasons as yet unknown to us,
do not lose this faculty.

30
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,891
One such exception is Mrs. Helga Ulman...

31
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,528
...who's here in Italy for
a round of conferences.

32
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,565
Helga has extraordinary
telepathic powers...

33
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,435
...and her natural bent for the
paranormal has just amazed us.

34
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,672
I will let her tell you herself.
Helga Ulman.

35
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,475
I would like to point out immediately...

36
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,468
...that my faculties have nothing
whatsoever to do with magic...

37
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,772
...the esoteric, or fortune-telling.

38
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,610
I pick up facts the very moment they
occur or have occurred...

39
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,325
...but nothing of what is to come.

40
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,229
I can feel thoughts,
the very instant they are formed.

41
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,798
Some I can even sense
a long time afterwards...

42
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,234
...because they are so strong.

43
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,871
They linger about the room...

44
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,864
...like cobwebs.

45
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,772
You, sir...

46
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,843
Yes you, in the third row,
with your right hand in your pocket.

47
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,760
You're clutching a bunch of keys.

48
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,753
Four keys... one of them very long.

49
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,003
It's true, look, they're right here!

50
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,996
Your name is Pietro... Pietro...

51
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,267
...forgive my pronunciation... Valgoi?

52
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,080
Yes, Valgoi, that's right.

53
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,950
Mr. Valgoi, excuse me,
may I ask you something?

54
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,086
Do you know Ms. Ulman by any chance?

55
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,354
No.

56
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,289
Pardon my persistence...

57
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,293
...is it possible you could have met
her before and told her your name?

58
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:04,286
No, how could I? I live in Bologna and
I only arrived in Rome three hours ago!

59
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,668
It's absolutely impossible.

60
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,971
Good, thank you, sir.

61
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,873
No... no!

62
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,866
Out! Out! No!
<i>Via! Via! No!</i>

63
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,586
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,579
Forgive me.

65
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,960
There is something...

66
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,029
...someone...

67
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,022
No, I don't know what it is...
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

68
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,669
Helga?

69
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,662
It was... I can't explain.

70
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:52,367
Something strange and sharp,
like a knife...

71
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,649
...entering my flesh.

72
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,642
Please forgive me,
but it's alright now, thank you.

73
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,162
I feel it again.

74
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:13,155
It's here. I can feel death.

75
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,995
I feel... a presence.

76
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,802
I have entered into contact
with a perverse mind!

77
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,885
Its thoughts are of death.

78
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,878
Go away!

79
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,594
You...

80
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,197
...have killed...

81
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:48,190
...and you will kill again!

82
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,628
That nursery rhyme...

83
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,733
...and that house down there...

84
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,081
...and the...

85
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,584
...death.

86
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,986
And that blood!

87
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,422
I'm scared, I'm scared!

88
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,092
Ms. Ulman! Helga, it's alright!
Calm down, that's enough!

89
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:17,063
Yes, let's hide everything,
everything in the house...

90
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,699
...as if nothing happened.
Back the way it was.

91
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,802
No one must know,
no one must find out, no one!

92
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,795
Just forget... forget everything...

93
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,600
...forever... forever.

94
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,514
Are you okay?

95
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:12,507
Anything I can do for you?
Get some help?

96
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:23,485
It was all so clear, believe me,
so frightfully clear.

97
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:28,790
Like a thorn piercing my brain.

98
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,270
I heard his twisted thoughts...

99
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,263
...cruel and yet childish
at the same time...

100
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,143
How odd.

101
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,312
Before, in front of the audience...

102
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,305
...I couldn't express all the
sensations that crowded my mind.

103
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,919
...but tonight at home
I'll write them all down.

104
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,156
I'll let you have it tomorrow.

105
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,725
You may use it as you see fit.

106
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,260
I'm saying this because...

107
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,563
...you see... now...

108
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,556
...I also know who that person is.

109
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,815
- What is it? What's the matter?
- No, it's nothing.

110
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,808
Those evil thoughts must be here
stagnating in this room.

111
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:25,558
Just a moment ago it came back to me.

112
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,551
I must admit I'm frightened...
I'm really frightened.

113
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,998
I don't feel like it...
<i>Non me la sento</i>...

114
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,968
...and I really need some rest...
...<i>ed ho bisogno di riposare</i>...

115
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:19,961
...I feel very tired.
...<i>mi sento molto stanca</i>.

116
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,212
So...
<i>Allora</i>...

117
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,205
Shouldn't we talk about that right away?
<i>Non pensi che dovremmo parlarne subito?</i>

118
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:36,010
Yes, I'd like this article to be published...
Sì, vorrei pubblicare questo articolo...

119
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:40,115
...while I'm still in Italy.
...<i>mentre sono in Italia</i>.

120
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,297
Yes...
<i>Sì</i>...

121
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:49,290
I am alone.
<i>Sono sola</i>.

122
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,947
Yes, I am a bit jumpy...
Sì, sono un po' nervosa...

123
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,086
...but don't worry.
...<i>ma non preoccuparti</i>.

124
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:23,424
We'll talk again tomorrow?
<i>Ne parliamo ancora domani?</i>

125
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:14,602
Hinno, Marc!

126
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,050
Hinno? What does that mean?

127
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,519
What are you talking about?

128
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,056
A client just said it to me, in the bar.

129
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:28,049
He said it's a Tahitian word.

130
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,654
Or was it Madagascar?

131
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:39,460
I'm so damn drunk,
I can't even remember!

132
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,399
Anyway, it means...

133
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,536
..."alla salute!", "cheers",
"à votre santé", "skol!"

134
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,688
Listen, Carlo, when I was in America...

135
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,957
...I met a lot of people like you.

136
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,950
Heavy drinkers...
they don't last long, you know?

137
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,931
Who says I want to last?

138
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,924
You're speaking like a true masochist.
You obviously have the vocation.

139
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,707
Definitely not a masochist,
on the contrary.

140
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,700
You know...

141
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:25,184
...as long as I'm drunk...

142
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,387
...I'm as happy as a lark!

143
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:32,380
And I play better too!

144
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,718
I mean, the piano is like
the body of a beautiful woman...

145
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:41,622
...and I tickle her.

146
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,431
Cut it out!

147
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,336
Speaking of pianos,
my half hour of fresh air is up.

148
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,318
I'll go back in to bang out
a few more notes.

149
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:03,155
Otherwise, I won't get paid tonight.

150
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,148
On your feet then, up!

151
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,497
You know what, Marc?

152
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,490
The difference between you and me
is purely political.

153
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,495
You see, we both play rather well.

154
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:28,313
But I am the proletarian of the pianoforte...

155
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:32,184
...while you are the bourgeois!

156
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:36,177
You play for the sake of art
and you enjoy it.

157
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,259
I play for a living.

158
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,594
It's not the same thing.

159
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:46,587
My, my, my! One of your
philosophies I wasn't aware of yet!

160
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,226
Actually, I just thought of it! You know,
I'm really sharp when I'm drunk!

161
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,470
What was that?

162
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,408
A scream, I'd say.

163
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,746
Who knows, maybe rape.

164
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,552
I drink to you, deflowered virgin!

165
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,579
Bye, Marc.

166
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:37,572
- Bye.
- Bye.

167
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,436
Five fatal blows, twelve wounds.

168
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,429
Probably from a hatchet
or a butcher's cleaver.

169
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,244
The victim seems to be about
35-40 years old.

170
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:16,237
She has abrasions and cuts
all over her body.

171
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,321
So, you are a foreigner, then?

172
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,523
Yes, I was born in London but I lived...

173
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,516
...several years in America,
before coming here.

174
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,364
And what are you doing in Italy?

175
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,357
I am a pianist. Jazz.
I teach here at the Conservatory.

176
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:41,195
- I teach Jazz.
- And you play the piano, right?

177
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,701
So, in that case,
you don't have any job, right?

178
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,838
- I told you that I am a pianist.
- Hmm, sure, sure...

179
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,587
Yes, in short, that's your only job.

180
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,258
Why? You think playing an instrument
isn't a job? What is it then, a joke?

181
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,251
No, what are you saying?
No, I would never say that.

182
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,855
In fact, in my family I have
a cousin who plays the...

183
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,205
What?

184
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:17,198
The violin!

185
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,739
Strange paintings, huh?

186
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,388
Yes.

187
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,890
Let me ask you something.
Did you move anything...

188
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,826
...change something around
or take anything from here?

189
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,361
Are you crazy?

190
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,354
We're very careful not to move a thing.
Why? Is there something wrong?

191
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:46,827
No, no, I mean...
It's just an impression, maybe.

192
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,276
Sorry, you were asking?

193
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:55,269
Ah yes, the victim!
Please.

194
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,717
You knew her, didn't you?

195
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,710
Yes, I already told you, I live upstairs.
Her name was Helga Ulman.

196
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,559
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

197
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,552
A raincoat... Tell me about the raincoat
the murderer was wearing.

198
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,926
Wait a minute. I didn't say the
murderer was wearing it.

199
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,831
All I said was that I noticed
a man with a dark raincoat...

200
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,902
...walking away from the building.

201
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,517
Good evening! Hi everybody!

202
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,854
Get lost!
You can't come in here!

203
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,591
Why not? A crime like this, the first
thing you do is call the press!

204
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,961
Get your hands off me!
I told you, you can't come in here!

205
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,430
We're conducting a very
complex investigation here!

206
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,399
Look who's here!

207
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,301
Gianna Brezzi!

208
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,104
Yes, Inspector!

209
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:56,097
- Who told you about the crime?
- I have my sources.

210
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,112
As it happens, the victim
was rather famous even in Italy.

211
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:04,105
In fact, she gave an important
lecture this very afternoon.

212
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,586
What did this famous lady do?

213
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:11,579
She was... a sort of magician.

214
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,861
She could read people's minds.

215
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,096
Well! I'll be...

216
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,598
I thought she was...

217
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,566
You! Yes, I am sure!

218
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,559
You're the one who saw the whole thing.
The eye witness extraordinaire!

219
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:31,543
Fabbroni, get Mingozzi for me.
I have something to tell him.

220
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:35,536
- Then call the Station.
- Yes, Inspector.

221
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,883
Why must I go to the Police Station?

222
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,919
I told you everything I know!
I don't understand what else...

223
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,912
It's for your statement. It has to be
officially typed, you know, bureaucracy!

224
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:50,684
And also all your information:
Place and date of birth, passport, etc.

225
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:04,098
My head is splitting!

226
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,938
And you, what the hell are you
doing here at this hour?

227
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,487
I'm on my way home...
after four hours at the Police Station.

228
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,723
Oh yeah, right.

229
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:22,716
I forgot about the murder.

230
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,797
How did it go?

231
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,734
What kind of question is that?
How do you suppose it went?

232
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,003
Come on, I'll walk you home.

233
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,996
No, thank you. I can make it by myself.

234
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,936
I can make it, I said!

235
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,811
Oh, my poor head, my head...

236
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,416
Tell me, how much did you drink?

237
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,632
Who knows? Who can remember
anything about this night?

238
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:04,625
But I'm sure it must have been a lot.

239
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,806
Why not come to my place for coffee?

240
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:11,799
No thanks, thanks anyway.
I'd rather sleep in my own bed.

241
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:18,439
Bye.

242
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,553
Carlo? Carlo?

243
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:25,546
Did you see that man
leaving the building?

244
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,858
A man?

245
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,851
Yeah, a man in a dark raincoat?
Right after the murder.

246
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,765
I think he's the killer.

247
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,867
Wait, wait...

248
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,860
Yes, I saw him for a second
from the back.

249
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,643
Listen, Carlo. Something strange
happened to me, very strange...

250
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,912
...and I don't know if it's true or not but...

251
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:50,715
...when I went into that woman's
apartment, the first time...

252
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,817
...I thought I saw a painting.

253
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:56,021
But then a few minutes later it was gone.

254
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,189
What happened to me?

255
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,960
To you, nothing. But maybe
the painting was made to disappear...

256
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,930
...because it represented
something important.

257
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,923
- What did you say?
- It represented something important!

258
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,570
No, no, I don't think so.

259
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,563
If I remember well, it was... it was...
some sort of composition of faces...

260
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,578
...something very unusual.

261
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,571
Look, maybe you've seen something
so important that you can't realize it.

262
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,621
But I... I'm just trying to understand,
because...

263
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,614
You know, sometimes, what you
actually see and what you imagine...

264
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:41,555
...get mixed up in your memory
like a cocktail...

265
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,272
...from which you can no longer
distinguish one flavor from another.

266
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,240
But I'm telling you the truth!

267
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,233
No, Marc. You think you're telling
the truth, but in fact...

268
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,872
...you're only telling
your version of the truth.

269
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,911
It happens to me all the time.

270
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,569
That one there with the raincoat.
That's Giordani.

271
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,562
He's a professor in Psychiatry, and an
enthusiast of parapsychology.

272
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,577
A great friend of Helga's,
he practically kept her.

273
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,570
The man with the glasses
is Mario Bardi.

274
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,051
He's also a clairvoyant...

275
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:37,044
...and was a great friend of poor Helga.

276
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,812
Let's go.

277
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,338
By the way... I wanted to thank you!

278
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,640
<i>"I've seen the murderer."</i>

279
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,743
It's nice to be brought to
the attention of murderers!

280
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,812
Oh, come on!

281
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:37,805
Look, you may not believe me, but I
don't have a steady boyfriend right now.

282
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,653
- Me neither.
- Ah, I should hope not!

283
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,455
I meant a girlfriend!

284
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,191
Ah, that's why you're always so jumpy!

285
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,094
Me jumpy? Oh please!
I am not jumpy at all!

286
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,830
Yeah right! And stop fidgeting!
You're always scratching...

287
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,100
...your hands are shaking.
Tell me, what's going on?

288
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,069
How many times must I tell you
that I'm an artist?

289
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:02,062
In case you've forgotten, we artists are
very sensitive people, is that clear?

290
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,144
We don't have elephant hide
like you journalists!

291
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:10,137
Elephant hide? I'm told I have
very delicate skin.

292
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:15,375
You can touch it, come on, try!

293
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:19,824
- Yes, not bad.
- It's fantastic!

294
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,694
I know a way to stop your jumpiness...

295
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:26,231
What? Here at the cemetery?
Are you crazy?

296
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,400
Anyway, I've other things
on my mind, understand?

297
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,237
- Sure, you are scared witless!
- I am not scared!

298
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,140
Right, you're almost
pooping your pants!

299
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,108
And it's all my fault!

300
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,101
And I would like to see him, you know?
I'm curious to see him face to face.

301
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,716
Forget it. You'd be better off
returning to England.

302
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,851
To tell you the truth I decided to stay.

303
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,420
- You've just decided that?
- Yes, maybe.

304
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,413
Anyway, I need to concentrate.
I must try to remember.

305
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,327
I am sure I saw something very
important that night...

306
00:29:56,327 --> 00:30:00,320
...but I can't remember what exactly,
damn it!

307
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,803
Are you driving?

308
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,405
No, Marc, wait!
I have to get in this side.

309
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:11,398
The other door is jammed.
Oh, sorry!

310
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,745
Long live Italy!

311
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,320
That seat broke the other day.
Is it very uncomfortable?

312
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,468
Why don't you help with this
murder story?

313
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,371
If you could give me hand on this scoop...

314
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:44,364
...maybe I can get away from reporting
on the environment.

315
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,579
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

316
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,249
- You've locked the door!
- Why, shouldn't I have?

317
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,385
The lock jams, and now we'll need
a mechanic to open it!

318
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,087
That's all we need!

319
00:30:56,087 --> 00:31:00,080
Damn! The car's not exactly new,
you know?

320
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,461
- Gianna, just drive fast, will you?
- Why?

321
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:07,454
I suffer a little from claustrophobia.

322
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:12,159
Alright.

323
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:44,024
Tell me, Enrico, why do Australian
boomerang sellers go bankrupt?

324
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,204
No, I don't know that one.

325
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:50,197
They go bankrupt because the
goods are always returned!

326
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,978
Funny, don't you think?

327
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,971
- Carlo's not in yet?
- No, he never shows up before ten.

328
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,185
Could you please tell him I was
looking for him?

329
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,222
- I need to speak to him urgently?
- Of course.

330
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:08,215
Everything in the house.
Let's hide it all.

331
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:14,254
No, no one will ever find out.

332
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,404
We must forget.

333
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,573
We must forget everything.

334
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:26,377
Forever...

335
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:30,370
Forever... That's all.

336
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,217
She was pointing over there.

337
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,421
To the middle of the 6th or the 7th row.

338
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:40,058
And you can't remember anything?
Not even a face?

339
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,659
No, absolutely impossible.

340
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:45,652
All the lights were on us
and the stalls were in darkness.

341
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:50,090
I must say, in thinking it over,
I seem to recall...

342
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:54,895
...while Helga was speaking,
I noticed some kind of movement...

343
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,032
...in the 6th or 7th...
or maybe the 8th row.

344
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,613
- I can't say exactly.
- What kind of movement?

345
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,384
Sorry, what did you say?
Could you repeat that please?

346
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,620
I said... what kind of movement?

347
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,556
It's hard to say.

348
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,292
As if someone had stood up
and left the row...

349
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:18,285
...but of course it was just an impression,
more than anything else.

350
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:22,556
With the lights on,
we couldn't see anything...

351
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:28,306
You see, you're not jumpy anymore.

352
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:32,299
You can even button your shirt
without shaking at all.

353
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,380
Look, will you cut it out
about being jumpy?

354
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,373
It's a question of character, it's in my
nature. It's my artistic temperament.

355
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,589
Why did you become a pianist?

356
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:48,582
Well, my psychiatrist would say
it's because I hated my father.

357
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:55,489
So in pressing the keys,
I was like smashing his teeth.

358
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,572
Actually it's because I love music.

359
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:05,343
What about you?
Why are you a journalist?

360
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,645
Because I like working.

361
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:11,149
And I think a woman has to be
independent to be equal to a man...

362
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,751
Oh, God, let's not start on sex equality!

363
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,220
It's all rubbish, not true at all.

364
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,213
Men and women are different.
Women are delicate...

365
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,161
...fragile.

366
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:27,154
What? Delicate?

367
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:32,259
Fragile?

368
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,675
- Why are you clearing the table?
- Come over here.

369
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,523
- What's that?
- Arm wrestling.

370
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,025
Come on!

371
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,693
Then we'll see who's delicate!

372
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,262
Don't be ridiculous!
I've better things to do.

373
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:02,255
Afraid?

374
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:11,075
That was total cheating,
you can't start before I'm ready!

375
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,712
It doesn't count.
You must play by the rules.

376
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,780
And you too!

377
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,250
We do it properly or not at all.
Still want to go ahead?

378
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,186
Will you play by the rules
without cheating? Properly?

379
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,855
Alright.

380
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,848
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

381
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,231
Let's go.

382
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:36,434
Both elbows must stay on the table
and no sudden movements.

383
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:40,427
- I know the rules!
- We'll start when I say, okay?

384
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,708
Ready?

385
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:47,701
Steady... steady... wait...

386
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,518
One...

387
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,087
Two...

388
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,089
Three...

389
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:02,082
Go!

390
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:18,643
That doesn't count either!
You lifted your elbow off the table!

391
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,412
It's an old trick, a dirty old trick!

392
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:25,349
- You're a cheat! It's so ridiculous!
- You're right.

393
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,385
And you go around challenging people!

394
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:31,378
You're big... and macho...
I surrender!

395
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,458
So, where are we going now?

396
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,494
Where are we going?

397
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,596
I'm not going anywhere with you.

398
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,832
If anyone is going anywhere,
I am going by myself.

399
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,902
Oh sure, but where?

400
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,638
I'm going to see a friend,
if you must know.

401
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:50,274
I have things to do.
I can't sit here all day...

402
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,510
...arm wrestling just to keep you amused!

403
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,503
I'm on to something important,
but I'm not saying what, is that clear?

404
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:01,274
Listen, don't be angry now.
Why can't I go with you?

405
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:07,247
- But we started this job together, right?
- No.

406
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,219
Statistics prove you can't work
seriously with liberated women.

407
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,569
So, whether you like it or not,
I'm going on my own.

408
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,562
Listen, have it your own way, stupid!

409
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,633
I'll carry out my own investigation,
and we'll see who comes out on top!

410
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,681
What's that?
Another test of arm wrestling?

411
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:33,484
Yeah, in a way.

412
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,852
So be it.

413
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,589
Wait! You didn't tell me
when I'll see you again.

414
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,558
Never.

415
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:44,551
Oh, really?

416
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,699
How about later tonight?

417
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:52,692
- When will you be back?
- I don't know.

418
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,921
I'll try to call you.

419
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,914
Okay. But I'll tell you again that I don't...

420
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,828
If you don't want to, just say so.

421
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:21,821
I was just trying to say that I don't
know what time I'll be back.

422
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:29,407
Alright.

423
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:33,400
Bye.

424
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:38,249
Tell me the truth.

425
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,319
Do you find me so unattractive?

426
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,955
- No.
- So, what's wrong, then?

427
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:48,948
- My smell? What?
- Nothing at all, why?

428
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,321
Oh nothing. I was just wondering!

429
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,367
Yes?

430
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,603
Excuse me, I'm Marc Daly,
I'm a friend of Carlo's.

431
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,672
Oh do come in, Marc dear.

432
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,909
I know you by name.
Carlo mentions you very often.

433
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,545
You're an engineer, right?

434
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,381
No, I'm a pianist.
I teach at the Conservatory.

435
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,751
A pianist? Please, come in.

436
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,555
What can I offer you?
Coffee or a drink?

437
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:21,548
No, thank you, nothing.
I actually came to see Carlo.

438
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,995
He wasn't at the Blue Bar, so I thought...

439
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:28,999
A drink, wasn't it?
Is this alright?

440
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,436
It's Coca Cola!
I'll just make some coffee and...

441
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:36,429
No, no, please. Don't go to any trouble.
I just came to see Carlo.

442
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:41,501
I'll call him, then.

443
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,849
I'm so absent-minded.

444
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:48,586
I'm sorry, Carlo is not here,
he's gone out.

445
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:52,022
Come here Marc, come and talk to me.

446
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,793
Come over here with me.

447
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,786
Tell me something about yourself.
How long have you been an engineer?

448
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,823
- No. Madam, I am pianist.
- And I'm an actress.

449
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:08,506
Or rather I was an actress.
That's me in all those photos.

450
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,475
What do you think?
Was I good or what?

451
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,110
Yes, I'm sure.

452
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,347
I just wish I'd had the opportunity to...

453
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,815
Never mind.

454
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,808
When I married Carlo's father...
Carlo wasn't born then, of course...

455
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,457
...he made me give up my career.

456
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,427
Now, it's all gone.

457
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,130
It's not important now.
I console myself by playing the piano.

458
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,123
- Do you play the piano?
- The piano...? I'm a pianist.

459
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:41,705
Oh, what a magnificent combination!
A piano playing engineer!

460
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,974
Could we play a duet?

461
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,411
No, unfortunately I just don't have the time.

462
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:51,404
I really need to see Carlo urgently.
Do you know where he is?

463
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,485
He went to see a friend.

464
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:58,478
Someone called Massimo Ricci...
28 Via Crescenzio.

465
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,121
Sorry, my mistake.

466
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,548
I'm... I'm looking for a friend, Carlo.

467
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:27,218
His mother gave me this address.
Is he here?

468
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:31,211
Yes, yes, do come in.

469
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:35,482
Thank you.

470
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,692
You don't know how ill he's been.
I wish I knew what's come over him.

471
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:50,730
He's still very sick.

472
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,715
He's been like this for over an hour.

473
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,484
He started to drink as he usually does.

474
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,987
Maybe more than usual.

475
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,980
Then he started talking nonsense.

476
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,895
Look who's here.

477
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,888
You caught me red handed, huh?

478
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:18,235
Good old Carlo...

479
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:22,228
He's not only a drunk
but a faggot as well.

480
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,543
Surprise!

481
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,778
I don't give a damn about
your preferences!

482
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,771
But I already told you that you won't
last for long if you drink that much!

483
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:36,576
And I told you... who wants to last?

484
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:41,915
The liver is gone,
and so are the intestines.

485
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,861
Come on, try to get up.

486
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,597
Put your head under a cold tap,
it'll do you good.

487
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:50,590
Then I'll take you out
to get some fresh air.

488
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,145
I love that guy. But he's such a downer.

489
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,981
He drank a lot today.

490
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,974
Then he started talking a lot of nonsense.
I think he's really cracking up.

491
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:12,289
He said he wanted to go away.
And then he wanted to make love.

492
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,825
And then he wanted to sleep.

493
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,994
He kept getting worse.

494
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,987
And then he started to scream.
I was about to call a doctor.

495
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,973
Would you like some coffee?

496
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:32,109
No, it's very late already.

497
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:36,102
I need to go, or I'll be thrown out
of the Blue Bar for good.

498
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:45,322
You're coming with me?

499
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:49,315
Yes.

500
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:59,303
Bye.

501
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,272
Sorry...

502
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:06,265
...for what happened before.
- Don't be silly. Call me.

503
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:20,179
Good bye.

504
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,630
Why did you come looking for me?

505
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,232
I wanted to ask you something.

506
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:32,169
Remember the other night,
the night of the murder?

507
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:36,173
Well, I said... I thought I saw
a painting in that house.

508
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,009
But a few moments later
it was gone, remember?

509
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,344
Vaguely.

510
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:44,337
Do you have a light?

511
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,643
You said that maybe the painting
represented something important.

512
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:55,848
You said a lot of things
about memory and truth...

513
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,996
A lot of things I didn't really
understand at the time.

514
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,065
Yeah.

515
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,700
I remember something but...

516
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,693
I can't remember what I wanted to say.
I was probably talking nonsense.

517
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,375
I was dead drunk.

518
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,368
Look... listen Marc...

519
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:20,139
...why don't you just pack up
and clear out?

520
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:26,946
What are you doing messing around
with this business anyway?

521
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,384
Why are you annoying a madman?
A maniac?

522
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:36,856
Anyone who would commit such a
monstrous crime, is certainly a maniac.

523
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,873
If you must know,
I'm attracted to madmen.

524
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:46,477
I can't help it. I have a morbid
fascination for them.

525
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:50,214
But wait, wait... listen.

526
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:54,207
That painting was definitely there,
I didn't imagine that.

527
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,212
And I feel it's something important.

528
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,259
So now...

529
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,252
...it's become kind of a challenge...
with my memory.

530
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,999
- A challenge...
- Right, a challenge.

531
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:12,169
I challenge myself too, all the time.

532
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:16,162
And I always lose...
But this is different for you.

533
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:22,001
If you lose, apart from the challenge...

534
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,106
...you'll end up getting murdered yourself!

535
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:35,214
No further news on the murder of
German mind-reader, Helga Ulman.

536
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:38,729
Police are concentrating
their investigation...

537
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:42,722
...on a person seen leaving the
scene of the crime that very night.

538
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,728
According to an unofficial
newspaper report...

539
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:53,065
...the eye witness can identify
the mysterious night visitor.

540
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,840
Carlo should be very careful.

541
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,833
If they find out he's a good pianist,
they'll get rid of him for sure!

542
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,865
Whoever you are, please help me!

543
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,735
Marc? It's me, Gianna!
What are you talking about?

544
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:22,272
You won't get away...

545
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:26,265
I'll kill you sooner or later...

546
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,448
Hello?

547
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:35,441
- What is it? Hello? Hello?
- Listen, Gianna, Gianna!

548
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:39,612
There's somebody in the house.
He talked to me, he wants to kill me!

549
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,727
- Want me to call the police?
- Wait, wait a second.

550
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,720
Hello?

551
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:59,632
<i>Little songs for children</i>

552
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:17,716
Well, that's it, alright. That's the
same song I heard last night.

553
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,831
And if I remember correctly...

554
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:25,824
...you said that Helga talked about
a nursery rhyme in the theater.

555
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,938
That's right!

556
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:31,931
And this song may very well be
the reoccurring theme of the crimes.

557
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,869
You see, we are starting to form what
I presume to be the correct profile.

558
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,650
The murderer is a schizophrenic paranoid.

559
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,920
Anyone who kills with such a frenzy...

560
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,390
...surely does it in a state of
temporary insanity!

561
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,383
And well, in every day life this person
could appear quite normal.

562
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,863
Like you or me.

563
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:57,856
And when he kills he must recreate
these specific conditions...

564
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,805
...which will trigger the release
of all his madness.

565
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,242
A particular time of day, a particular
day of the week, even clothing...

566
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:09,235
Something that recreates the
same images that, in the past...

567
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:14,607
...were the occasional frame
of his provoking trauma.

568
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,312
I'd like to add something much less
scientific to this business...

569
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,326
...about the children's song.

570
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:27,319
If you recall, as well as a child singing,
Helga also mentioned a house.

571
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,300
And well...

572
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,293
I remember having read a book,
quite some time ago, a strange book.

573
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:40,566
I think the title was "Ghosts of Today
and Legends of the Modern Age".

574
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:46,372
The author spoke about a haunted
house, from which the neighbors...

575
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:51,977
...could sometimes hear singing
like this little song.

576
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:56,715
The book suggested an act of bloodshed
was once committed in that house.

577
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,796
Do you have that book?

578
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,789
Oh no, but you could easily find it in the
library of folklore and popular traditions.

579
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,795
<i>"Ghosts of Today and</i>
<i>Legends of the Modern Age"</i>

580
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,618
<i>The House of the Screaming Child</i>

581
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:24,287
<i>In a house near Rome,</i>
<i>a strange thing happened</i>.

582
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,456
<i>One night, a hunter woke up</i>
<i>before dawn</i>...

583
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:29,726
...<i>and heard a child singing in a</i>
<i>high shrill voice, ; soon after</i>...

584
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:33,719
...<i>the voice stopped, and he heard</i>
<i>shrieking screams and weeping</i>.

585
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,388
No, nothing.

586
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:35,381
No news other than what Bardi gave me.
No names, no addresses.

587
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:39,662
So, what are you going to do, now?

588
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,831
I'd like to contact the author.

589
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:45,824
Would you write down her name?
Her name is Amanda Righetti.

590
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:50,629
Got it.

591
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:59,749
What the hell! What are you doing?

592
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,419
Why did you put the phone right here?!

593
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,954
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, listen...

594
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:08,958
Will you try to find out her address
for me? It's important.

595
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,594
She should know where this house is.

596
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:15,365
She probably knows other things
that can be useful to us.

597
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:19,358
Listen, I'll call you back.
I can't hear a thing in this bar.

598
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,172
What did you say?

599
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:25,442
The address! Oh, this is impossible!

600
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,435
Can't you wait until I'm done?
It's a sauna in here!

601
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,984
- When you come, remember the birds.
- Oh, don't worry, Ms. Amanda.

602
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,977
I don't understand why you keep these
strange Indian blackbirds.

603
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:18,016
I feel less lonely. They whistle, they
imitate things, the television, our voices...

604
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,654
Oh, it's like having a madman
around the house!

605
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,468
I'd be scared.

606
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:29,461
- See you tomorrow.
- See you, Elvira.
