1
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,397
- Let me put your jacket on, Sam.
- No, no.

2
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,752
- Come on, sweetie. Come on.
- I don't want to.

3
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,473
- You taking off, Karen?
- Trying to.

4
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,715
- Need a hand?
- Would you mind?

5
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,320
Are you giving your mommy
a hard time?

6
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,476
- No.
- You'll let Carter do it?

7
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,115
There you go.
Amy, did you say hi to Sam?

8
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,957
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Amy.

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,639
- Darn.
- Something wrong?

10
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,390
No, no. Jenny was supposed
to pick us up half an hour ago.

11
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,238
She probably got delayed
at the hospital.

12
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,556
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- That would be great!

13
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,753
He is such an amazing kid.
You've done a great job with him.

14
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,392
Please.

15
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,477
Do you realise how important
these early years are?

16
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,034
Are you kidding?
I've read all the books

17
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,437
and I get all the expert advice
I can handle from my mother-in-law.

18
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,836
I know what you mean.
I've seen her in action. Oh, boy.

19
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,394
Don't you have
any know-it-all relatives?

20
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,273
My father wrote the book
on child development.

21
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,595
Fortunately, it's in Norwegian.

22
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,029
What does he say on the subject?
In English.

23
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,674
- What does he not have to say?
- That bad?

24
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,110
Actually, he's one of
the most visionary men in his field.

25
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,391
He heads a child-development clinic
outside of Oslo.

26
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,476
We're taking Amy there next week.

27
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,513
Jenny never said anything about
Amy going to a clinic in Norway.

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,314
It would be a great
opportunity for you and Sam.

29
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,593
- I think Sam's a little young.
- I don't know. A big boy like Sam?

30
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,315
What's so visionary
about your dad's clinic, anyway?

31
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,717
First of all, it's in a beautiful,
natural country setting.

32
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,116
Amy will be supervised
by a team of child psychologists

33
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,355
who record her progress hourly.

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,039
But you can't study child development

35
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,833
and think anyone
is gonna take it seriously

36
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,314
if you only have one subject.

37
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,669
It's just another case history.

38
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,554
So, what we're setting up is
a control group of gifted children.

39
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,832
We'll need at least five, none
of them older than three years old.

40
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,111
- That's why I want Sam...
- To be your guinea pig?

41
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,755
- Carter, you got to be kidding.
- No.

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,110
Nobody will send their kid
to some snake pit in Norway

43
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,119
- for some developmental study.
- It's not a snake pit.

44
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,391
Do you think I'd let Amy go
unless it was completely safe?

45
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,432
No! But I can't believe
Jenny agrees with it.

46
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,789
- Just forget it.
- Don't get mad.

47
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,159
(Sneezes)

48
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,794
- Bless you.
- I'm not mad. (Sneezes)

49
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,155
We're friends, remember?

50
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,193
And as a friend, I'm telling you
the whole idea is crazy.

51
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,075
Why would any sane parent
allow their kid to be part of that?

52
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,636
Do you realise no one knows anything
about personality development?

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,319
Everything has been pure conjecture.

54
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,388
All we psychiatrists do is chase cows
after the barn door has been opened.

55
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,158
(Sneezes)

56
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,715
For the first time,
we'll be able to observe what happens

57
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,673
and precisely monitor
the psychological consequences.

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,551
Not with my kid, you don't.

59
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,192
- (Sneezes)
- Oh!

60
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,037
- Sorry.
- It's in my eyes!

61
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,275
I got the wheel.

62
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,111
I'm so sorry.

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,312
- Karen... are you all right?
- I've got something in my eye.

64
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,828
- It hurts.
- Let me have a look.

65
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,510
Look up. Now look down.
It's just the tiniest bit of dirt.

66
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,394
- It hurts!
- Just keep your eyes closed.

67
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,352
I'll get a... a tissue.

68
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,312
- Are the kids OK?
- Don't move! They're fine.

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,716
They're fine! So sorry. I'm so sorry.

70
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,033
What's that smell?

71
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,071
(Muffled yelling)

72
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,556
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

73
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,670
- (Horn honking)
- (Groans)

74
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,916
(Sinister laughter)

75
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,038
- Kiss her.
- What?

76
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,469
In five seconds those guys
will be in your face

77
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,830
and what do you look like, killer?
Go on, kiss her!

78
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,679
(Man) Ooh! Well done.

79
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,154
(Sighs)

80
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,918
- When did you get out?
- Move over.

81
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,878
Isn't this pleasant?
We just gonna sit here all day?

82
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,913
- What are you doing here?
- I'm saving your ass, that's what.

83
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,114
I was supposed to be an observer.
What I'm observing is very odd.

84
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,392
Twins chatting in the front,
the driver slumped over the wheel.

85
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,034
- What is wrong with this?
- I don't need you!

86
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,913
"I don't need you!" (Chuckles)

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,878
Let's get out of here, Carter,
before we're seen...

88
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,151
because, believe me,
we'll be remembered.

89
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,200
Drop me at the corner.
I could use a drink.

90
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,879
- Don't follow me.
- "Don't follow me."

91
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,672
- Stop that!
- "Stop that."

92
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,518
All right, all right.

93
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,989
- Jesus.
- Oh, Carter...

94
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,031
you're a thankless dope.

95
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,511
I was only trying to help,
which, of course, I did.

96
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,552
This thing you're doing
means everything to the old man

97
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,670
and you can't fuck it up.

98
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,393
- I'm not fucking anything up.
- Oh, really?

99
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,671
What were you planning on doing
with the little missus?

100
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,915
I'm gonna...

101
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,758
take her back to the park
and leave her there.

102
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,951
Very good. I see you've got this
all thought out(!)

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,549
"Take her back to the park
and leave her there." Then what?

104
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,068
When the chloroform wears off,
she'll be fine.

105
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,079
- And the cops will come for you.
- I won't hurt her!

106
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,918
You won't hurt her, she'll hurt you!

107
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,631
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

108
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,070
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
- What?

109
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,794
First, stop at your place.
I need to get out of these clothes.

110
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,152
- And then you need to get lost.
- And then what?

111
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,235
The cat's in the bag...

112
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,669
and the bag is in the river.

113
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,036
(Yawns) I've been up all night
with Mrs Bellor.

114
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,514
The radiation seems to be working.

115
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,552
I'm gonna lie down
before I take her for her checkup.

116
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,795
Isn't she beautiful?

117
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,468
Oh, Dr Nix. Oh, how horny we are.

118
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,518
Ow! You're hurting me.

119
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,314
That's all right. I'll get her.

120
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,388
You just wait here.

121
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,237
OK.

122
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,709
(Police siren in distance)

123
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,872
'Mommy! Mommy! '

124
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,919
Mommy!

125
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,080
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!

126
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,111
(Crying continues)

127
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,111
(Carter) Shut up!

128
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,071
Stop that.

129
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,831
(Man, Norwegian accent)
I was afraid of this.

130
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,032
I wanted him to do this himself.
I didn't want you to help him.

131
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,675
Gee, Daddy,
I was only trying to help out.

132
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,598
If I hadn't been there,
we'd all be fucked.

133
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,757
(Sighs) Carter's an amateur.
He panicked.

134
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,870
Oh, stop it!

135
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,911
I know you, Cain.

136
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,714
Carter weakened and you stepped in.

137
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,873
We all know your tough-guy act.

138
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,519
But we don't need
a loose cannon here.

139
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,391
Carter can finish this himself.

140
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,149
Let me tell you something, Doctor.
I know Carter wants to help

141
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,318
but we're talking about stealing kids
and experimenting on them.

142
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,669
You may need this "loose cannon".

143
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,840
You should never have gotten out.
You're nothing but a cheap hoodlum.

144
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,791
I am what you made me, Dad.

145
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,832
- Shut up and finish your drink.
- I already have.

146
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,508
Then let me get you another.

147
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,869
You know...

148
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,912
you could get us all
put away for good.

149
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,754
There's no jail that can hold me.

150
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,439
I'm the escape artist, remember?

151
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,995
I learned it breaking out of
all those cages you locked me in.

152
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,395
They were not cages!

153
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,716
They were a specially designed
infant environment.

154
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,469
- They were cages!
- Hush. You'll wake the child.

155
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,756
But hey,
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

156
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,839
After all, where would I be
without you, Baumse?

157
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,831
You wouldn't exist.

158
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,314
That's right
but I do exist, don't I?

159
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,069
I'm that fucked-up experiment
of yours that won't go away.

160
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,717
Hickory dickory dock. Cain
has picked his lock. I'm out of here.

161
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,832
The cat's in the bag
and the bag is going in the river.

162
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,871
So don't fuck with me, Dad!

163
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,356
You may lose more than
your licence this time.

164
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,111
Have you talked to the others?

165
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,314
- About what?
- About what we are doing.

166
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,557
(Laughs) Are you kidding?
If Margo finds out...

167
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,154
- What did you put in this?
- Just something to relax you.

168
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,555
You fucking...

169
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,914
I want you to sleep now, Cain.

170
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,116
You've done a good job
but we don't need you any more.

171
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,273
I want you to relax and sleep.

172
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,594
Carter can handle everything now.

173
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,314
(Clocks ticking and chiming)

174
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,158
(# Grieg: Morning from Peer Gynt)

175
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,228
Daddy, I want to pick the flowers.

176
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,670
We don't pick 'em, sweetie.
We just look at them.

177
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,711
I'm going to take her outside.

178
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,990
- I'll take her.
- No, you finish up.

179
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,589
We'll be fine. We're going to
go look at the flowers.

180
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,674
- Would you like that gift-wrapped?
- Yes. Thank you.

181
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,029
I'll be right back.

182
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,791
(Tapping)

183
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,550
That's what I would buy
for the man in my life.

184
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,233
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

185
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,152
(Sighs)

186
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,191
After the funeral...

187
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,510
I was a block of ice.

188
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,236
I couldn't bear to feel,
so I felt nothing.

189
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,959
I'm sorry I made such a mess of it.

190
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,628
I'm staying at the Garden Court.
If you wanted to just talk...

191
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,478
I'll be there tonight. We could...

192
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,359
I saw you come in with Carter
and your little girl.

193
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,551
I guess I just didn't thaw out
fast enough.

194
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,194
- Here's a flower for you, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

195
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,959
- Are you finished?
- Yeah.

196
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,673
- I mean, no.
- Are you all right? You look upset.

197
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,712
No, I'm fine.
I'm just not finished.

198
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,115
Take Amy to the park
and I'll catch up.

199
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,879
No, it's going to rain.
We're going to go home.

200
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,911
But don't be too long.

201
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,997
Amy needs to spend more time
with her mommy.

202
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,838
- More quality time.
- I'll be home soon.

203
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,474
We'll have plenty of time
for quality time.

204
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,159
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Mommy.

205
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,436
- Miss?
- Yes?

206
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,357
I'd like this one also, please.

207
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,878
(Woman on phone)
'Mr Dante isn't answering.'

208
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,119
Tell him that Jenny O'Keefe called
and that I have his keys.

209
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,951
And I can meet him at O'Keefe Park...
Camino Park at one.

210
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,434
If he can meet me by the playground.

211
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,114
(Banging, woman chattering outside)

212
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,869
(Crash, woman shouting)

213
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,911
(Laughter)

214
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,635
(Children chattering)

215
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,631
(Woman) Maxine, be careful.

216
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,875
You went too high.

217
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,475
- Jenny.
- Hi.

218
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,991
- Hi. Where's Amy?
- Home, with Carter.

219
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,759
I missed them.
What a great guy you've got.

220
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,316
Taking a day off to spend with Maxine
hasn't occurred to my husband.

221
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,632
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

222
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,796
- No.
- What's the matter?

223
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,196
- Sarah, I saw Jack today.
- Jesus.

224
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,196
Uh...

225
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,518
I think he still loves me.

226
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,348
Oh, come on.
Isn't it a little late for that?

227
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,960
He was so flustered
he forgot his keys,

228
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,117
so I'm meeting him here
to return them.

229
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,153
I hate to bring this up but
you are married to the perfect man.

230
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,316
The perfect man?

231
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,194
Yesterday, out of the blue,
he started to make love to me

232
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,312
and then stopped
when Amy started to cry.

233
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,989
- He was worried about Amy...
- He didn't even go to her room.

234
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,918
He got into his car
and then drove off.

235
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,679
That doesn't make any sense.

236
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,915
Carter isn't making any sense

237
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,158
and he's becoming
awfully compulsive with Amy.

238
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,352
He doesn't just take care of her.
He studies her.

239
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,593
I have this horrible feeling it has
something to do with his father.

240
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,316
You're not just finding excuses
to start up with Jack again?

241
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,591
I don't know.

242
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,356
- Boy, he looks great.
- Yeah.

243
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,477
Definitely don't do what I wanna do.

244
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,353
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

245
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,597
Thank you.

246
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,552
Nothing's as stupid
as making a dramatic exit

247
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,068
and having to go back
for your car keys.

248
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,590
Fortunately, it was a rental.
They sent over another set.

249
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,473
You're very good at dramatic exits.

250
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,549
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
- It's OK. I got over it.

251
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,876
- And I learned something.
- What?

252
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,388
To be the dispassionate doctor.

253
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,435
Let's walk.

254
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,997

Oh...

259
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,515
Three o'clock?

260
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,791
(Sighs)

261
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,868
(Amy crying)

262
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,473
'It's OK, sweetie.
It's all right, baby.'

263
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,230
(Thinks) 'Why couldn't we just have
an intercom instead of this thing? '

264
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,670
(Singing quietly in Norwegian)

265

- Coming through.

- We have cardiac arrest.

- 'What happened to you? '

I can't explain now.
What did Carter say?

312
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,634
'Since you didn't come home
he figured you had an accident.

313
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,877
'He called all the hospitals
and the police.

314
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,195
'What are you going to tell him? '

315
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,396
(Screaming)

316
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,354
Honey. Honey, it's OK.
I'm right here.

317
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,799
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

318
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,035
I had the worst dream.

319
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,198
I'll say. You were moaning
and waving your hands around.

320
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,997
I dreamt I was in
the weirdest car accident.

321
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,031
Well, you're OK now.

322
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,594
Why don't I get you a glass of water?

323
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,393
OK. Thanks, sweetie.

324
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,393
I get so worried about you, honey.

325
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,114
I think you've been
working too hard.

326
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,197
You shouldn't have to carry
the whole load.

327
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,919
It's beginning to take a toll on you.

328
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,396
I don't know.

329
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,194
Maybe we should be rethinking
this parenting arrangement.

330
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,993
I just don't think
it's been fair to you.

331
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,876
One of these days I'm going to have
to get back to my own practice.

332
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,316
Maybe we could get a sitter in,
during the day.

333
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,392
I should go back to work.
What do you think?

334
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,231
I think...

335
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,349
(Muffled screaming)

336
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,275
- Dr Nix.
- Oh, hi, Nan.

337
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,993
- Can you do me a big favour?
- Of course.

338
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,794
My boyfriend forgot me.
Can you drop me at Mrs Roberts'?

339
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,956
- Sure, I...
- (Baby crying)

340
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,232
I just have
to pick something up first.

341
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,555
Can you keep an eye on Amy for me?

342
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,195
- Yeah. No problem.
- I'll be right back.

343
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,311
(Gasping and moaning)

344
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,158
(Cain, laughing) Jesus!

345
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,270
Be a Peeping Tom on your own time.
We're going to lose that kid.

346
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,915
- That's my wife.
- No shit(?)

347
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,313
(Moaning)

348
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,229
I married her too soon.
She never got over him.

349
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,589
No question of that. (Laughs)

350
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,398
Look, Carter,
why don't you just go home?

351
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,399
- I'll handle the baby-sitter.
- (Sarah panting)

352
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,431
I guess you're right.

353
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,476
I don't feel very well.

354
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,035
I'd better just go home and sleep.

355
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,392
That's right. You go sleep.
I'll take care of everything.

356
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,352
I'll just be you for a while, huh?

357
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,994
Until this whole mess is cleaned up.

358
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,991
Poor schmuck.

359
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,232
Ooh...

360
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,676
(Laughs)

361
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,389
Oooh... yes!

362
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,432
Where did you get
that neat trench coat?

363
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,319
I copped it.

364
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,559
You know, Dr Nix, I should
be going out with older guys.

365
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,431
I'll tell you something.

366
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,359
For a man your age, you're...
you're still pretty cute.

367
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,799
It's not the mileage, honey.
It's the make.

368
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,315
Keep an eye on the monster.
I gotta go pee.

369
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,351
I'll be right back.

370
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,871
(Chuckles)

371
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,990
(Door creaking)

372
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,839
I know what you're going to do.

373
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,589
It's a bad thing
and I'm going to tell.

374
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,275
Get out of here!

375
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,117
Shit.

376
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,237
(Moaning)

377
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,429
(Gasps)

378
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,958
(Jack) What's the matter? Jenny?

379
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,191
(Starts engine)

380
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,991
(Birds singing)

381
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,079
(Bird shrieks)

382
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,749
Help! Somebody help!

383
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,190
(Screaming) Carter!

384
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,993
Carter! Carter!

385
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,875
(Alarm beeping)

386
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,911
(Groans)

387
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,511
(Beeping stops)

388
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,949
(Gentle music playing)

389
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,354
(Sighs) Jenny.

390
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,231
Oh, Jenny.

391
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,510
(Music continues)

392
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,272
We were all going
to the beach today to have a...

393
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,880
a Valentine's Day picnic.

394
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,356
Jenny took Amy to the park
while I packed up the Jeep.

395
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,233
I guess that was at about eight.

396
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,919
They were supposed to be back at ten.

397
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,556
My wife is never late.
I was immediately concerned.

398
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:19,118
So I went to the park to search
for them at about ten thirty

399
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,390
but they weren't there.

400
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,228
So I called up you fellas
and came right over here.

401
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,077
Dr Nix, I'm sorry to say

402
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,317
we've had a few other
disappearances from this park.

403
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,353
From your description, your wife
and daughter were likely candidates.

404
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,676
You mean...
they might have been kidnapped?

405
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,429
We don't know. All we know now
is that they've disappeared.

406
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,598
You told us you went there regularly
with your little girl.

407
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,757
- That's right.
- Ever notice anybody strange,

408
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,349
another man or a woman
that seemed to be hanging around?

409
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,470
No.

410
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,594
Wait a minute.
There was somebody, a man.

411
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,475
I remember because... I noticed he
didn't seem to have a child with him.

412
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,956
Why would you come to a playground
without a child?

413
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,992
Why don't you sit down
with our sketch artist?

414
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,429
It would be helpful to get a picture.

415
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,596
Of course.

416
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,393
Peters, it's Cally.
I want you to do a sketch.

417
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,512
Yeah, right away. I'll send him over?

418
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,872
See that guy?
That's Jay Peters, our sketch man.

419
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,151
Why don't you go see what you guys
can come up with?

420
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,839
- All right.
- Come on.

421
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,549
And, er, thanks for all your help.

422
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,510
Dr Nix, Jay Peters.

423
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,915
How you doing? Have a seat.

424
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,599
- Just do the best you can.
- You got it.

425
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,631
(Phone)

426
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,190
Poor guy.

427
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,160
- This is getting out of hand, Sean.
- Yup.

428
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,430
It seems like a serial to me.

429
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,040
A detective's dream -
the motiveless murder.

430
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,150
What have we got now?

431
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,998
Two moms, a baby-sitter
and their kids are gone.

432
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,235
From the same playground.

433
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,475
And there's Dr Nix.

434
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,391
What do you mean?

435
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,000
It's the kind of name
that sticks in your head.

436
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,157
- From where?
- From ancient history.

437
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,236
Oh, your specialty.

438
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,636
- Let's go home, Mack.
- Sean, come on...

439
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,148
- Go home.
- I wouldn't waste your time.

440
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,113
When you retire, you don't
come to the office any more.

441
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,835
Sit in your chair, watch
the shopping channel, wash your car.

442
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,555
Take your grandkids to the zoo.
Maybe go see a ball game.

443
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,674
What you don't do is hang around here
looking over our shoulders.

444
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,871
- I'm just trying to help you.
- You're in the way.

445
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,630
Yeah? Well, maybe you can tell me
who this Dr Nix is.

446
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,069
That guy there working with Peters.

447
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,475
Yeah. Any dope can see that.

448
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,637
But I worked another Nix case
20 years ago.

449
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,150
20 years ago.
What are you talking about?

450
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,192
I'm talking about that guy's old man.

451
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,272
- Are you sure?
- Same name, same face.

452
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,788
So, what did your Dr Nix do?

453
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,150
We got an anonymous tip
he was buying babies.

454
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,350
I remember we caught him with five.

455
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,551
Five?
Was he starting a basketball team?

456
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,398
- Who knows?
- So what happened to him?

457
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,510
He jumped bail and left the country.

458
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,518
He was Swedish or something,
we couldn't extradite him.

459
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,755
- Great. Thanks for sharing.
- Wait.

460
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,237
At his trial, an associate testified
against him, a Dr Lynn Waldheim.

461
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,352
Still works around here.
I called Waldheim's office.

462
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,517
They tell me the doctor
checked into the hospital.

463
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,438
- What's the matter with him?
- Her. Cancer.

464
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,075
I told her the father of
one of the missing kids was a Dr Nix.

465
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,111
She says she'll be right over.

466
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,591
So this is retirement?

467
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,871
I think I'll just have
a heart attack right here.

468
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,353
(Laughs)

469
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,789
I could never retire, so I don't.

470
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,308
- You don't mind, do you, guys?
- Mack...

471
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,749
consider yourself
back on my task force.

472
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,791
Thanks, Terri.

473
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,273
Hey...

474
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,959
Hey, Sean. Thanks.

475
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,035
(Mack) I know what you're thinking.
(Sean) Like father, like son.

476
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:34,029
Too easy. Just because his father's
a nut doesn't mean Carter is.

477
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,071
I'm going with what we got.

478
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,715
Two mothers, a baby-sitter
and their kids disappear.

479
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,276
When Peters has finished that
sketch I want it shown to everybody.

480
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,709
- (Phone)
- Yeah?

481
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,991
When?

482
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,474
We'll be right down.

483
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,795
Car popped up out of Half Moon Marsh.

484
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,833
Had a woman's body in it.
They just brought it in downstairs.

485
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,838
- Oh, God.
- Do we bring him?

486
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,075
Let's see how bad she is.

487
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,715
- How's it going?
- Very well.

488
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,320
It's amazing. It looks just like him.

489
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,476
He was wearing a trench coat.

490
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,557
- My God.
- Ma'am?

491
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,672
(Terri) Tell me when you're finished.
Let's go.

492
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,635
- Detective Terri, Dr Waldheim.
- Thanks for coming over.

493
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,990
It's uncanny.
He looks exactly like his father.

494
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,759
- That's Carter Nix.
- It couldn't be anyone else.

495
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,837
And his wife and child
have disappeared?

496
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,838
- It gets worse.
- We got a dead woman downstairs

497
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,075
that could be his wife.

498
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,992
So much tragedy in one family.

499
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,918
- Could you walk with us?
- Certainly.

500
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,951
This way.

501
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,150
- Are you feeling up to this?
- I hate this wig.

502
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,998
I told them to get me a grey one.
My hair is grey.

503
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,917
They couldn't find one.

504
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,394
- I look like a transvestite.
- It looks fine.

505
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,193
You're very kind
but you don't lie very well.

506
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,993
- So, you were trained by Dr Nix?
- I took my residency with him.

507
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,395
- Why him?
- Because he was the best.

508
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,716
I was interested in his work
on multiple personalities.

509
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,150
We wrote a book together
based on one of his patients.

510
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,668
In the book, we called him Cain.

511
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,918
- Three Faces Of Cain or something?
- He had many more faces than that.

512
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,679
Down here.
So, what was the book called?

513
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,632
Raising Cain:
The Creation And Evolution

514
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,750
Of The Multiple Personality.

515
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,237
It was a bestseller.
They even made a TV movie out of it.

516
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,078
I heard he made quite a lot of money.

517
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,351
I wouldn't have it.
I had my name removed from the book.

518
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,995
- Why?
- I didn't want that kind of money.

519
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,031
What kind of money was that?

520
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,038
Money profited
off the misfortune of another.

521
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,071
You still wrote the book.

522
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,908
I didn't know all the circumstances
surrounding the case.

523
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,191
- What were they? This way.
- Yes. Let me explain.

524
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,756
All multiple personality patients,
regardless of their background,

525
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,519
seem to share
certain childhood traumas.

526
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,394
Then the original personality
splinters into others.

527
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,477
For instance,
if a boy is molested by his mother

528
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,830
or abused by his father,
the original...

529
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,478
Ah.

530
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,751
The original personality
forgets it ever happened.

531
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,190
How could his loving parent
do such a terrible thing?

532
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,232
And he creates
an alternate personality.

533
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,033
This becomes the person
it happened to.

534
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,675
He is the one who suffers the pain
for all the rest.

535
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,998
Hm, you do something bad,
the other personality takes the rap.

536
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,837
Very convenient.

537
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,395
It is not a psychological state
one wishes to acquire.

538
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,512
With each trauma
there may be another personality.

539
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,996
Soon scores of them
are running around inside your head,

540
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,795
squabbling amongst themselves as to
which one controls the consciousness.

541
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,197
Only one personality can control
the consciousness at one time.

542
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,677
- So they're talking to each other.
- Sounds like one messed-up guy.

543
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,032
Yes, but by carefully
observing and documenting

544
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,436
the formation and development
of Cain's multiples,

545
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,918
Dr Nix was creating a whole new
theory of personality evolvement.

546
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,349
Yeah. There was only one problem.

547
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,198
- (Lift bell)
- Only one? What was it?

548
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,471
- The raw data.
- (Sean) Elevator.

549
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,438
The raw data
was extraordinarily detailed.

550
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,119
It was as if he'd gotten
into a time machine

551
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:42,109
and seen each of Cain's personality
splitting traumas as it occurred.

552
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,799
I was never allowed to meet Cain.

553
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,719
His true identity
was known only to Dr Nix.

554
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,796
All the information I had

555
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,230
I transcribed from tapes recorded
during their sessions.

556
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,875
So, how do you think
he got the information?

557
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,876
I never knew for sure

558
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,277
but years later, when he got arrested
for trying to buy babies,

559
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,392
I suspected
there could only be one answer.

560
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,431
Yeah?

561
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,759
He had created Cain's multiple
personalities in order to study them.

562
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:20,078
He had taken some innocent child
and split its personality.

563
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,271
He needed a control group
to test his theories,

564
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,949
- that's why he was buying babies.
- (Lift bell)

565
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,679
Uh-huh.

566
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,756
To the right.

567
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,792
And you testified against him
at his trial?

568
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,354
A man like that should be in jail!

569
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,279
- What happened to Cain?
- Only Dr Nix knew that.

570
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,311
What's the story, Al?

571
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,511
Looks like she was put
in the car alive and then drowned.

572
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,393
Look at her nails.
See how they're cut and torn?

573
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,432
Looks like she was trying
to claw her way out.

574
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,472
You should see the expression
on her face.

575
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,469
(Man) Lieutenant, we got lucky.

576
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,911
A lady's picked out the guy
on the bench there. He's real close.

577
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,831
All right.

578
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,833
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me?

579
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,110
Lieutenant Terri, Bay View police.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

580
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,997
It's just a short ride.
You'll help us out a lot.

581
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,270
Short ride?
I could help you out here.

582
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,074
- Do you have a car here in the lot?
- This is my car right here.

583
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,111
- This is your car?
- It's a rental car.

584
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,355
Give the keys to Detective Carleton.

585
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,075
- You ride with us.
- I don't understand...

586
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,999
You can have the keys.
I just rented it yesterday.

587
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,190
I'm visiting.

588
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,753
Here. These are...

589
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,872
- What is this?
- I must have rubbed...

590
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,718
- Huh? This looks like blood.
- I've never seen that.

591
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,276
- Would you open this?
- Sure. It's probably the round key.

592
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,995
I don't know what you expect to find,
I'm not hiding anything.

593
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,508
Weapons or something.

594
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,755
Oh, my God.

01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,511
But I don't know where she is!
What are you saying?

622
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,393
Tell her before
you get your throat cut.

623
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,954
- But I don't know.
- "I don't know."

624
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,991
- I don't!
- Who are you talking to?

625
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,555
- I do. I took her to dear old Dad.
- Where is he?

626
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,556
Who are you talking to?

627
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,791
Where have you taken her?

628
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,593
Taken her? Taken her where?

629
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,952
She's... she's...
She's... with my father.

630
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,198
Your father? What are you saying?
Your father is dead!

631
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,277
No, no. He's not dead. He's here.

632
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,914
Amy's with him. She's fine.

633
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,350
- Tell her, Cain. She's fine.
- (Doorbell)

634
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,198
- Why won't you tell her?
- (Terri) Bay View Police!

635
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,629
Carter, get up. Carter, get up.

636
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,240
- Tell her, Cain!
- (Banging) Doctor?!

637
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,670
- Amy's fine. Why won't you tell her?
- Dr O'Keefe?

638
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,518
- You've got to tell her.
- Get up.

639
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,755
According to Norwegian authorities,

640
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,759
Dr Nix took a swan dive
into a fjord 18 years ago.

641
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,634
There was a suicide note
but they never recovered the body.

642
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,672
Great.
Carter says they're with his father.

643
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,032
His father's been dead for 18 years.
This gets better all the time.

644
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,993
Let's hope Waldheim
can get something out of this psycho.

645
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,669
When I got myself out of the car,

646
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,309
I could only think of one thing.

647
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,513
If he was crazy enough to kill me
what was he going to do to Amy?

648
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,036
So then I went home...

649
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,560
but she wasn't there.

650
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,875
That's when I called you.

651
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,835
And then Carter came home.

652
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,553
I just wanted him
to tell me where Amy was.

653
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,794
Oh...

654
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:20,118
Well, let's hope he's not too nuts.

655
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,390
What do you mean?

656
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,034
Too nuts to go to jail.

657
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,640
You mean he might not go to jail?

658
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,275
First we've got to find out
if he's competent to stand trial.

659
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,552
Any smart lawyer will plead him
not guilty by reason of insanity.

660
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,398
And depending on what
Waldheim finds out,

661
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,036
Carter could wind up a celebrity
mental case in a cushy institution.

662
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:47,153
- He might be out someday?
- All he's got to do is get better.

663
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,437
Fascinating.

664
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,916
It's quite something,
after writing about him for years,

665
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,111
- to finally meet him.
- Carter is Cain.

666
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,391
And Josh and Margo
and God knows who else.

667
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,309
Now it is clear to me
how Dr Nix got all his precise data.

668
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,430
He traumatised his own son.

669
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,678
Then, over the years,
he observed the effects.

670
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,517
- Does Carter know what he did?
- Carter didn't do anything.

671
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,676
Cain did all the killing.

672
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,757
- Who is Cain?
- One of Carter's multiples,

673
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,998
one of the ones Dr Nix created
when he abused him as a child.

674
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,237
When something bad
is about to happen to Carter

675
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,714
or when something bad has to be done,

676
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,558
Carter blacks out
and Cain takes over.

677
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,393
After the unpleasantness,
Cain exits and Carter wakes up.

678
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,877
He has lost some time. He doesn't
remember how he got where he is

679
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,480
or what happened while he was asleep.

680
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,308
He may be confused
but his conscience is clean.

681
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,356
So how do we find the children?

682
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,631
Carter doesn't know where they are

683
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,752
but one of the other multiples may.

684
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,473
And how do we talk to them?

685
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:17,355
Hypnotism is the fastest though
not always the most prudent method.

686
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,789
We've got to find these babies now.

687
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,714
Then I will need
an absolutely quiet space

688
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,910
where I can be alone with Carter.

689
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,554
Whatever you need, and do it fast.

690
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,592
I don't wanna be walking behind
any little coffins.

691
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,597
It's all right.

692
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,631
We'll find them.

693
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,237
(Cain laughs)

694
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,397
She doesn't care who she fucks
or where she does it.

695
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,591
But don't worry, buddy.

696
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:57,031
I'm not gonna let that loving wife
of yours sell you down the river.

697
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:01,790
I'll put that two-timing bitch
in a box she'll never swim out of.

698
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,473
Hey...

699
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:10,196
You remember that lady cop
that brought Waldheim her coffee?

700
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,871
Take a look down at your feet.

701
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:19,311
Don't be so obvious! Jesus.

702
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,791
(Sighs)

703
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,628
Keep your head up. Now reach down.

704
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,589
Down...

705
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,471
Down...

706
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,034
and pick it up.

707
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,911
Good boy.

708
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,390
Carter, you're awake now.

709
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,797
I am a doctor and I am here
to help you. Do you understand?

710
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,471
Carter?

711
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,396
(Boy's voice) Are you talking to me?

712
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,237
Yes, I'm talking to you.

713
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,034
Carter, pay attention.
You have to answer my questions

714
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,356
so I will be able to understand
what is going on.

715
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,709
Is that perfectly clear?

716
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,155
- No.
- Why?

717
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,990
Because I'm not Carter.

718
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,634
- You're not Carter?
- No.

719
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:32,629
Wait a minute. If you're not Carter,
then who are you?

720
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,511
I'm Josh.

721
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,312
Josh.

722
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,388
- And where is Carter?
- Carter's inside.

723
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,193
Inside where?

724
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,629
Can you wake him up
so I can talk to him?

725
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,513
- No.
- Why?

726
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,551
Baumse would hurt me.

727
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:56,194
- Who is Baumse?
- Baumse is my dad.

728
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,232
But your father isn't here any more.
He's dead.

729
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,593
No, no! He's here. I gotta go.

730
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,235
Your father isn't here now
so you don't have to be afraid.

731
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,271
He'll hurt me.

732
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,710
No, he can't hurt you now,
I won't let him.

733
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,670
- You won't?
- No.

734
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:21,759
- You promise?
- Yes, I promise.

735
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,713
OK.

736
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,154
- How old are you?
- Seven and a half.

737
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:32,159
Why are you the one
who came to talk to me?

738
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,395
I don't know.

739
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,149
- Why are you here?
- I don't know!

740
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,191
Try to think.

741
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,835
What is the last thing
that you remember, hm?

742
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,031
- I was in a playground.
- A playground.

743
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,071
And what happened?

744
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,037
Get out of here!

745
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,400
I saw Cain.

746
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,034
He was going to do something bad,

747
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,389
something I'd be blamed for.

748
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,432
I told him it was bad!
Then I told Margo.

749
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,836
She got real mad!
She told me to go to sleep!

750
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,269
Then I woke up here.

751
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,634
My... My arm hurts.

752
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,998
- That's why I'm here.
- Could you explain that?

753
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,157
- That's what Margo says.
- Margo.

754
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,633
That's what she says.

755
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,229
Hickory dickory dock.
Cain has picked his lock.

756
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,113
He did a bad deed
and Josh comes to bleed.

757
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,718
Hickory dickory dock.

758
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,119
Josh...

759
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:49,109
Everything is all right.
Everything is all right.

760
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,029
Do you know where the babies are?

761
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:03,154
- What babies?
- Someone hid the babies.

762
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,351
- No, no, no...
- Nobody is going to get punished.

763
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,595
I just want to know where they are.

764
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:14,237
He did it again!
It was Baumse! He did it again!

765
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,192
Oh, no.

766
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,435
- What's the matter?
- Shh!

767
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,594
- She heard me.
- Who heard you?

768
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,631
Margo.

769
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,672
She's right behind you. Don't look!

770
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,031
I shouldn't be talking to you.

771
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,389
How do you know she heard you?

772
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,715
She's staring right at me,

773
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,320
like I did something bad.

774
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:44,797
- Who is Margo?
- She protects the children.

775
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,230
She won't let Baumse hurt them
like he hurt me.

776
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:52,034
When he took the children before
she called up the police.

777
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,355
- She called the police?
- Yes.

778
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,119
But you said that he did it again.

779
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,639
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

780
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,478
She won't just call the police
this time.

781
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,875
- What is she going to do?
- I don't know.

782
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,549
I gotta get out of here.
Where is she?

783
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,032
Carter? Carter? Josh?

784
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,230
Josh, I want to talk to you.

785
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,999
When I snap my fingers,
you are going to wake up.

786
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,990
Josh?

787
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,592
Is this Margo?

788
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,554
Do you know where the children are?

789
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,271
Where?

790
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,116
Dr Waldheim?

791
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,677
Dr Waldheim?!

792
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,151
Dr Waldheim!

793
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,589
Did he tell you where Amy is?

794
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,111
(Lift bell)

795
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,474
Where's Amy, Dr Waldheim?

796
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,715
(Groaning)

797
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,678
My God, my God.

798
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,676
Help! Help!

799
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,832
(Honking horn)

800
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,795
(Man) What's the matter with you?
You almost took those people out!

801
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,149
Are you blitzed again?

802
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,312
(Man) I'll take it out of your pay!

803
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:16,070
(2nd man) Guys, guys. Cool it.

804
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:19,396
Manuel, you almost took
the taxicab with you.

805
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,955
Move the truck.
Put it over there out of the way.

806
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,991
(Shouting in Spanish)

807
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,436
(Ringing tone)

808
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,958
(Phone)

809
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,514
Carter escaped. Let's go. Yeah?

810
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,755
- It's Jenny O'Keefe.
- Where are you?

811
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,475
I'm at the Riviera Motel,
I followed Waldheim here.

812
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,512
That's not Waldheim. Just stay put.

813
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,155
- Stay put, we'll be right over!
- I gotta go.

814
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,678
Jesus! Stop! You're gonna kill
somebody with that sundial!

815
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,836
Calm down.

816
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,632
OK, stop. OK, now back it up.

817
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,477
(Shouting)

818
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,511
(Lift bell)

819
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,191
(Lift bell)

820
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,518
- Mommy!
- Oh, my God.

821
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,757
- Mommy!
- So, this is my daughter-in-law.

822
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,636
God! What kind of a mother are you?
Put that knife down and come out.

823
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:26,196
- Give me my child!
- I want my mommy!

824
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,758
I have a gun.
It's pointed at your heart.

825
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,758
If you have anything to say,
say it gently,

826
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,439
I don't want you upsetting the child.

827
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,155
You're her mother.
You're scared and angry.

828
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,475
And if looks could kill, my dear,

829
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,909
I would be dead.

830
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,989
I want my mommy!

831
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,839
It's OK, honey. I'm here now
and we're going to go home.

832
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,837
Now, drop the knife
and come out of there.

833
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,153
- Why are you doing this?
- I can't explain.

834
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,795
- Carter is waiting downstairs.
- Carter is in there.

835
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,832
(Amy) I want my mommy!

836
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,871
You're a poor liar, my dear.

837
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,438
Carter always does as he's told.
He's a good boy.

838
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,438
Once we're safely away,
he'll be yours again.

839
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,994
You might have to share him
with the law.

840
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,157
Someone will have to pay
for these terrible crimes.

841
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:38,192
- (Jenny) You did this.
- I did nothing.

842
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,231
I don't even exist.

843
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,589
(Thunder rumbles)

844
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,315
Now say goodbye to Amy
and don't upset her.

845
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,556
- Can I kiss her?
- No. Don't force me to kill you.

846
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,751
It would be very harmful
to the child.

847
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,793
Damn you! Look what you've done!

848
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,671
(Thunder crashes)

849
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:05,918
(Men shouting in Spanish)

850
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,791
Mommy!

851
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,434
- Back up!
- Mommy!

852
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,711
Back up!

853
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,591
Now!

854
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,791
Back up!

855
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,637
Do it!

856
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,788
She's not there. Let's go
around front. Stay in the car!

857
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:27,599
(Jenny) We thought Carter
was imagining his dead father.

858
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:31,349
Dr Nix faked his suicide
so that he could kidnap the children

859
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,119
without the police tracking him down.

860
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,993
What about tracking down his son?

861
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,874
Once Carter helped him get the kids
he was disposable.

862
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,708
Dr Nix planned to disappear
and leave Carter for the police.

863
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,955
Did they find him yet?

864
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,959
Mm-mm.

865
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,036
Do you think he'll come back?

866
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,595
I don't know.
I hope so. He needs help.

867
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:59,428
- He needs to be locked up.
- He needs to be in a hospital.

868
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,119
Are you running for sainthood?

869
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,994
- He tried to kill you.
- I know.

870
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,191
(Sarah) In case he shows up,
I'd be packing a.45.

871
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:12,073
Jack's staying with me now, so...

872
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,669
Better than a.45. How's it going?

873
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,076
Good. He's been very supportive.

874
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,111
And Amy likes him.

875
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:24,516
Did you see the new bunny
he brought her? Amy!

876
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,878
Amy?! I'll be right back.

877
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,911
Amy!

878
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,431
Amy?

879
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,151
Amy?!

880
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,591
Amy?

881
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,717
Where's Daddy?

882
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,593
Daddy's not here, sweetie,
he's gone away.

883
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,950
- Daddy's here.
- No, he's not.

884
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,877
Come on, we've got to get back.
Come to Mommy.
