Yes. I included the four percent increase

247
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:24,581
I read. Right now I'm reading Hemingway,
The Sun Also Rises.

00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:30,417
And you really should eat.
It's gonna get cold.

this guy loves this girl so much

that he's willing to forgive
everything that she does.

251
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,434
Even her infidelities.

252
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,165

and come looking for me, Tom.

255

he'll come looking for me.

-Two years?

-Do you live together?
-That's none of your fucking business.

260

Yeah, we live together, okay?

262

-Yes.
-What does your fiancé do?

266
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,842
He's a journalist.

267
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:07,646
I knew he had to be smart.
What kind of journalist?

268
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,119
-Sports.
-What paper?

269
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,322
-Post.
-I read The Post.

270
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,620
-What's his name?
-Mark Clayton.

271
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,754
Clayton. I don't remember that name.

272

-I have one over here.
-It's The Post online.

273
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,807
It's amazing

274
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:41,112
that you're able to keep a relationship
with the amount of hours you work.

275
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:45,554
He must get really lonely
when you have to work late, right?

276
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,758
Do you love him?

277

Does he love you?

278
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:02,731
I'm only asking because I'm worried about
how quickly he's going to get here.

279
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,707
I'm sure he's already on his way.

280
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:15,352
Right. He's probably
on the Harlem River Drive as we speak.

281
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,650
-What kind of car does he drive?
-I don't know.

282
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,883
You don't know what kind of car
your fiancé drives?

283
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:24,395
-Toyota, I think.
-Toyota. That is a fast car.

284
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,530
He can be here a lot sooner
than I was thinking.

285
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,124
He could be coming down
this ramp right now.

286
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:44,079
You haven't been very talkative
since we met.

287
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:50,779
But now you're telling me all about

288
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,517
your boyfriend. Oh, sorry, your fiancé.

289
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:02,290
So either we've become best friends
over dinner or you're lying to me.

290
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,199
I'm guessing

291
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,794
you're lying to me.

292
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,741
You don't really have a boyfriend, do you?

293
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,305
But you want one.

294
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,783
You want somebody who cares about you...

295
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,118
-Worries about you...
-Please, don't.

296
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,526
You've got a great family.

297
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,522

298

Jimmy and Rose. They love you.

299
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,167
They're probably getting worried about you.

300
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,402
Maybe we should give them a call. Yeah?

301
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,309
Tell them you're okay.

302
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,179
What do you think?

303
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,598
What should we say?

304
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,208
I know.
We should say you made other plans.

305
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,405
No. You probably already said that one.

306
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,875
You know what?
You should think of something.

307
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,741
You're a good liar.

308
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,853
Go ahead.

309
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,151
Go!

310
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,019
No.

311
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,470
Hello? Hello?

312
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,241
Hey, Rosie.
Can you get your mommy on the phone?

313
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,973
Who's calling, please?

314
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,381
-It's Auntie Angie.
-Mommy, it's Aunt Angie.

315
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,549
LORRAINE: Give me a second, okay?
Hey, where are you?

316
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,220
-Angela?
-I'm not feeling well.

317
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,122
What do you mean?
We're all waiting for you.

318
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,889
She says she's not feeling well.

319
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:20,028
MAN: That's what she said the last time.
LORRAINE: Can I talk to my sister, please?

320
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,468
Where are you, Angie?

321
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,507
MOTHER: She's got a real job. It's not like...

322
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,535
LORRAINE: Angela?

323
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,645
I went home.

324
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,840
MOTHER: What's wrong? Where is she?

325
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,907
LORRAINE: I don't understand.
Last time I talked to you,

326
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,783
you were on your way.
What about the costume?

327
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,880
MAN: Let's just eat.
You should know your sister by now.

328
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,452
LORRAINE: It would be nice if you'd try

329
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,391
and put your family
ahead of your work sometimes.

330
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,325
MOTHER: That's enough. Give me the phone.

331
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,458
Angie, what's wrong?

332
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,061
Hello? I can't hear her.

333
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,028
Sweetie? Can you hear me?

334
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:59,266
-Hi, Mom. I'm here.
-Honey, what happened? Where are you?

335
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,810
I don't know.

336
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,075
I think it's the flu.

337
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:09,210
You really sound terrible.
Are you sure you're okay?

338
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,587
Yeah. I just need some rest.

339
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,983
Okay.

340
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,997
Rest up and hopefully you'll
feel better for lunch tomorrow.

341
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,998
And don't worry about the costume, okay?

342
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,662
-Merry Christmas, angel. I love you.
-I love you too, Mom.

343
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,954
That was the best Christmas present
anyone's ever given me.

344
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,484
Thank you.

345
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,291
And now I have a present for you.

346
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:14,913
Go ahead.

347
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,479
Open it.

348
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,189
Aren't you even curious?

349
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,958
Open it.

350
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,700
Yes.

351
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,270
Bet you're curious now.

352
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,712
(LAUGHING)

353
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,944
Okay. Enough torture.

354
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,019
Watch. It's all cued up.

355
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,791
-Why are you showing this to me?
-Wait.

356
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,088
You fucked up now, asshole.

357
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,498
Sorry you had to see that.

358
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,500
You want to go for a stroll?

359
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:56,611
These guys always do whatever they want.

360
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,455
Here we go.

361
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,363
(ANGELA SCREAMING)

362
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,331
Rocky, sit down!

363
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,209
(GROANING)

364
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,445
Why did you do that?

365
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,955
Rocky, shut the fuck up!

366
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,150
-Let me help you up.
-Don't.

367
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,958
-Don't touch me!
-I'm not gonna hurt you. All right?

368
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,055
You're hurting my arm.

369
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,657
That's because you won't
relax your arms. Okay?

370
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,670
-Come on.
-Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

371
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,142
Yeah, I believe you.
I just need to show you something.

372
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,053
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

373
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,426
Here we go.

374
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,046
Uh-oh.

375
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,484
I think I drank too much wine.

376
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,982
I really shouldn't be driving.

377
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,958
I'm just kidding.

378
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:51,332
You know, I've seen you drive
out of here so many times.

379
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,095
Strange being in the car with you.

380
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,564
It's great, actually.

381
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:01,035
-I thought you said we were taking a drive.
-We are.

382
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,105
Then why are we going down, Tom?

383
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,047
It's freezing out there.

384
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:11,280
Besides, this is gonna be much better.

385
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,597
Why are we down here, Thomas?

386
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,228
Tom?

387
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,685
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

388
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,515
Oh, my God, Tom.

389
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,423
What is this?

390
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,091
This is my present to you.

391
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,308
I want you to take this and show him.

392
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,138
Show him what?

393
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,444
Show him you're not a slut.

394
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:19,779
Take this and teach him he can't be
touching every woman he wants.

395
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,086
Are you talking about
what happened in the elevator?

396
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:29,030
Oh, Tom, no. You don't understand.
That was a mistake.

397
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,027
A stupid mistake.

398
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,570
-What? He tried to rape you.
-No.

399
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,741
He got a little out of hand at a party, Tom.
He hardly tried to rape me.

400
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:41,574
Look, he was drunk. He apologized.

401
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,773
Oh, he apologized.

402
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,951
You think you're the first woman
he tried to do this to?

403
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,543
I've seen him try to touch
every woman in the building.

404
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:54,022
-He's a pervert. A degenerate.
-No.

405
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,393
He's a good man, Tom.

406
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:02,595
Look at him. He has a family.
He has a wife. Tom, please don't.

407
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,863
Tom, Tom...
Stop calling out my name, all right?

408
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,494
I know what you're trying to do.

409
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,096
You're trying to humanize yourself,
like you're some poor victim.

410
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,974
I told you, I'm not gonna hurt you!
All right?

411
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,376
Stop calling out my name!
Enough's enough!

412
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,382
Tom, Tom, Tom!
How many times can you say it?

413
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,210
Okay.

414
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,629
I know you're a person, okay?

415
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,763
I'm a person, too.

416
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,635
I know you have feelings.
I have feelings, too.

417
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,272
I care about your feelings.

418
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:49,135
He's the one you should be scared of.
He's the one who has no feelings.

419
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,715
So if you want to help him,

420
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,345
take this and teach him a lesson.

421
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,153
I told you, he apologized.

422
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,731
What? He can just apologize
and then he can do it again?

423
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,665
And then he's just gonna
apologize again and then...

424
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,067
You've got to stop letting these assholes
have their way with you!

425
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:19,007
Tom, please believe me.
It was just a misunderstanding, Tom.

426
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:23,570
Tom, Tom!
Just stop calling out my name! I told you!

427
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,507
-Didn't I?
-Yes! Yes.

428
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,646
-I'm sorry, but you're scaring me.
-Jesus! When are you gonna understand?

429
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,051
I'm here to help you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

430
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,039
Okay.

431
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,142
I'll do it.

432
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,318
You untie me and I'll do it.

433
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,462
No. Oh, no. Whoa.

434
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,156
You're a good person.

435
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,463
You're a good person, too.

436
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,299
I should have never asked
you to do this. I'm sorry.

437
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:25,331
No. It's okay because I want to.

438
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:30,142
You just have to untie me
and I'll do it for you.

439
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,882
No, no. It's my job to protect you.

440
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,828
No, Tom, listen to me. It's not.
Please don't do anything.

441
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,956
Don't try to run away, okay?

442
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,431
Can I trust you?

443
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,498
-Can I trust you?
-Yes.

444
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,335
You can trust me.

445
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:06,043
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry.

446
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,445
So...

447
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,987
You like to touch girls, do you?

448
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,559
No? Look at her.

449
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,056
I said look at her.

450
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,027
Does she look happy to you? Huh?

451
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,432
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

452
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,698
Yeah.

453
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,969
You messed with the wrong girl.

454
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,975
What makes you think
you deserve her? Huh?

455
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,344
What gives you the right?

456
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,884
You're something else, you know that?

457
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:48,550
You pretentious Ivy League piece of shit.

458
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,218
You don't own the world and everyone in it.

459
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,790
What is a guy like you thinking
when he puts his hands all over a girl

460
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:59,927
who obviously is not interested?
Who is obviously not a slut?

461
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,232
Because that's what
you think they are, right?

462
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:08,005
Yeah? I can't hear you. What did you say?

463
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,876
What? Can you speak up?

464
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:14,679
Because you can't talk your way
out of this one, can you?

465
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,478
-Why am I even wasting my time with you?
-ANGELA: No!

466
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:24,355
-What? Angela, he deserves it!
-Don't do anything, Thomas, please!

00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,979
Well, he won't be bothering you again.

475
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,020
Where are we going?

476
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,885
We can't just leave him here.
You have to get him.

477
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,154
What? Why are you defending him?

478
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,699
I'm not. I'm not.

479
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,362
Do you like this?
Do you like to get touched?

480
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,462
You like it when he touches you
in the parking garage?

481
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,133
-Do you want to get laid here?
-You know that's not true.

482
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,645
So what is it? A career thing?

483
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,413
Did you fuck him to get a promotion?

484
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,543
We can't leave him here.

485
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,082
You're right. I'm sorry.

486
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,753
We shouldn't leave him here.

487
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,330
Wait! Thomas, stop!

-We're gonna just take him for a little drive.

490
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:22,007
What are you doing?
Tom, stop the car! Please!

Please stop! Please!

No! No!

Oh, my God!

No, please! Oh, my God! Don't do this.

Calm down, miss.
Is there someone with you right now?

No, he's outside in the parking lot.
He already killed someone else.

Did you see him do it?

Yes! His name is Thomas and he's
the parking attendant in my building.

Ma'am, you have got to relax
and take a deep breath.

Can you please try to understand
and call the cops?

Please just call 911!

00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:15,160
No. I'm sure he's just trying to help you.

Listen you fuck-face, I called the cops
and I'm gonna stay down here

563
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,556
as long as it takes until they get here,
so I suggest that you get the fuck out!

564
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,153
I just wanna talk to you.

565
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,490
That's why I pretended to be
someone else, okay? So don't be upset.

566
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,292
Will you come out? I was just kidding.

Just go to hell!

568
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,772
Don't you understand? I did it for you.
That guy showed you no respect.

Why won't you talk to me, Angela?

570

Just give me a chance.

571
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:07,022
If you just give us a chance,
it can work out.

572
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,824
You'll grow to like me.

573
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:12,458
That's usually what happens
when two people

574
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,896
are forced to be together
in a stressful situation.

575
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:20,561
They have to depend on one another.
And eventually they support each other.

576
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:24,571
They like each other.
Sometimes they even fall in love.

a little bit more respect for yourself.

That way he can go back to his kids
and family, and you can go to your sister's.
