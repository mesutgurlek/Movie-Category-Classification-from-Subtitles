168
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,990
I'll leave too,
so you can ask her out.

169
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,557
Lovely.

170
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:13,194
But there's still the one next door.

171
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:15,929
Let's check something else out.

172
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,709
- Hey, you guys!
- What?

173
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:27,207
Get a load of this.

174
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:29,307
Huh?

175
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:32,482
Forget it.
I don't want to see, OK?

176
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:34,582
You have to.

177
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:40,748
- What the hell is that?
- It's a mutation.

178
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:44,696
LIZ: It's a fake.

179
00:19:44,796 --> 00:19:46,260
It's like magicians do.

180
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,825
It's probably made of rubber.

181
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:55,403
"Born to Mr. And Mrs. Latiner,
Cedar Falls, lowa."

182
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:58,138
Richie, you're so full of shit.

183
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:04,116
I'm getting some air.

184
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:06,216
Wait up.

185
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:08,252
RICHIE: Hey, wait. Don't go.

186
00:20:08,352 --> 00:20:10,089
It's moving.

187
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:11,623
It's waving to ya.

188
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:14,018
[Squeaks] Goodbye! Goodbye!

189
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,004
BUZZ: So long, fella.

190
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:27,168
BUZZ: Damn!

191
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,703
- RICHIE: What?
- Bastard bit me!

192
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,907
Come on. What?

193
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,775
It bit me. Look at that.

194
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:39,949
Asshole!

195
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,152
Hey, watch who you're calling asshole.

196
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,252
Asshole.

197
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:49,092
Liz'll clean you up.

198
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:59,127
[Hysterical cackling]

199
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:07,941
Come on in and see Daisy May,
our two-headed cow.

200
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,078
See a sheep with six legs.

201
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:12,748
Yes, six.
Count 'em yourself, six legs.

202
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:16,986
And these are creatures of God,
ladies and gentlemen, not man.

203
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:20,219
All authentic and all alive.

204
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,261
Inside, behind that lovely tent,

205
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:26,231
you'll see the most
beautiful girls you ever saw.

206
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:30,101
Six of the loveliest in the
world, like my sister Mona here.

207
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,132
Give 'em a little show, girl.

208
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:34,106
Open it up... No, that's all.

209
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:35,540
Just a tease.

210
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,142
Who will dare to face
the challenge of the Fun House?

211
00:21:41,242 --> 00:21:43,745
Who is brave enough?

212
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,482
How about you, sir?

213
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:48,684
Who is man enough...

214
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:52,952
to enter that world of darkness?

215
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:57,087
Terrifying terror ride.

216
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:02,665
You will scream with terror.

217
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:06,970
You will beg for release.

218
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,338
But there will be no escape.

219
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,770
For there is no release...

220
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,413
from the Fun House.

221
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:18,548
So, what about it?

222
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:20,113
- Huh?
- [Mocking] Huh?

223
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,621
What do you wanna do?
It's your choice.

224
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:23,920
What? What?

225
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,755
How about the magician?
Wanna come?

226
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:27,855
Yeah. Good idea.

227
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:31,061
Hell, I love magicians.

228
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:34,411
I met an uncle once who was a magician.

229
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:36,234
I mean it.

230
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:38,334
Oh, he was bad.

231
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:41,204
One, please.

232
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:53,418
Have you seen two guys
and two girls on a double date?

233
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:56,578
Hey, kid,
I ain't the fortune teller.

234
00:22:57,923 --> 00:23:01,692
Now, I need a volunteer from the audience.

235
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:05,028
A young lady,
preferably attractive.

236
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:07,763
Come on, now. Don't be bashful.

237
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:14,006
You.

238
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:16,106
You. Come on.

239
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:16,975
No, I couldn't.

240
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,977
Of course you could. Come on.

241
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:23,344
Come on. Let's give
our little lady a big hand.

242
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:29,619
You're not afraid, are you?

243
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,590
Yes!

244
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,187
Smart girl.

245
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,594
Please step into the coffin.

246
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,895
Go ahead. Right inside.

247
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:40,764
I promise you'll feel no pain.

248
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:43,159
HECKLER: Get a regular job.

249
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:47,437
Comfy?

250
00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:48,907
No.

251
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,007
Good.

252
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:53,136
Now a little history.

253
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:56,107
[Sharply] A little history.

254
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:02,550
In the fifth century,
Vlad V of Wallachia,

255
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:07,841
known as Vlad the lmpaler to his friends.

256
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,859
Tortured 23,000 prisoners
in a device not unlike this.

257
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:19,566
Tiring of his name,
he decided to change it.

258
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:24,706
He selected his father's name, Dracul,

259
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:26,806
meaning devil.

260
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,981
He added the letter A and became...

261
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,383
Dracula.

262
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:39,686
Literally, 'son of the devil'.

263
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:42,925
And so legends are born.

264
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:44,995
With that history in mind,

265
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:47,730
I present, without further ado,

266
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,867
The lmpaler.

267
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:52,466
Notice, if you will,

268
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:57,471
that a hole has been cut
in the front of this box,

269
00:24:57,571 --> 00:25:01,745
right over the human heart within.

270
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:06,114
I insert the stake gently.

271
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:08,218
Do you feel that?

272
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:10,987
- Yes.
- Good.

273
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:14,226
And now, without further ado, I present

274
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:16,326
The lmpaler.

275
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:20,733
[Screaming]

276
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:25,763
Oh, my God! Is there a doctor
in the house? Lights! Lights!

277
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:31,473
Ladies and gentlemen,

278

- See ya, Richie.
- Hey! Come on, man!

287

[Muttering outside]...

serious business for Madam Zena.

are wonderful for tonight.

[Others snicker]

302
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:13,566
It means you were born...

303
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,301
with a knowledge of the occult.

304
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,750
Are you sensitive?

305
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,088
Do you have premonitions
that often come true?

306
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,789
- No.
- [Others snicker]

307

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

That is good.

313
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:58,949
That means a long life-line...

- [Others laugh]
- Shh!

Wait.

317
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,955
Quite a break in the faith line.

318
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,626
Hmm. It makes sense.

319

enter and change your life.

01:18:09,298 --> 01:18:10,761
I said drop it!

832
01:18:10,861 --> 01:18:14,202
Why are you doing this?

833
01:18:14,302 --> 01:18:17,037
I'm just protecting my family.

834
01:18:17,137 --> 01:18:18,807
Your family?

835
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:20,274
It's not even human.

836
01:18:20,374 --> 01:18:24,284
The Lord works
in mysterious ways, little lady.

837
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:27,355
Oh, hell,
he ain't such a bad fella.

838
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:32,519
Gets himself in all sorts
of trouble though, don't he?

839
01:18:32,619 --> 01:18:34,821
Anyway,

840
01:18:34,921 --> 01:18:37,759
blood is thicker than water.

841
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:41,004
And he'll be a comfort in my old age.

842
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:47,532
Now, how many people know you're here?

843
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:50,003
Lots.

844
01:18:50,305 --> 01:18:52,305
AMY: They all know.

845
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:54,775
Well, no matter.

846
01:18:54,872 --> 01:18:57,509
We'll be pulling
outta here tomorrow morning.

847
01:18:57,609 --> 01:18:59,514
There's plenty of other carnivals around.

848
01:18:59,614 --> 01:19:02,416
What did you do with the other girl?

849
01:19:02,516 --> 01:19:07,254
Oh, I expect by now he's
just finishing up with her.

850
01:19:07,354 --> 01:19:10,669
We'll just wait here till he gets back.

851
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:12,692
[Doors clunk]

852
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,731
Oh, my, my!

853
01:19:19,831 --> 01:19:22,566
That is a gruesome sight.

854
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,385
Oh, you're real tough,
ain't you, son?

855
01:20:16,992 --> 01:20:18,359
Get up!

856
01:20:18,459 --> 01:20:20,459
Come on! Get up.

857
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:25,130
[Amy screams]

858
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:27,230
Come on!

[Wails in agony]

860
01:20:53,595 --> 01:20:55,595
BUZZ: You all right?

861
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:57,796
AMY: Oh, my God!

862
01:20:57,896 --> 01:21:00,300
He's gotta have keys on him.

863
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:11,545
No! Buzz!

864
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:17,749
[Gunshots]

865
01:21:34,937 --> 01:21:37,667
Get out of here! Run! Run!

866
